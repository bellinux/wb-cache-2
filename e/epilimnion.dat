The building materials used to build huts on the phumdi blocks sunlight from reaching the lower depths of the lake water, which has resulted in formation of vertical profiles of the lake water body and decomposition. Further, pesticides and insecticides are used for catching fish or as insect repellent. Degradation {{is in the form}} of benthal, which, as it decays, releases toxic gases such as methane, hydrogen sulfide, and reduces dissolved oxygen (DO). This causes the lake water to degenerate into a eutrophic condition, creating a dead water zone called the hypolimnion. Above the hypolimnion is a thin layer, known as <b>epilimnion,</b> where fish survive to some degree. The benthal is becoming increasingly thick, causing not only pollution of the lake water, but an increase in the shallow part of the lake.|$|E

Because the density of water varies with temperature, with a maximum at +4 DC, thermal stratification is an important physical characteristic of lakes that controls the fauna and flora, sedimentation, chemistry, and other aspects of individual lakes. First, the colder, heavier water typically forms a layer near the bottom, which called the hypolimnion. Second, normally overlying it is a transition zone known as the metalimnion. Finally, overlying the metalimnion is a surface layer of a warmer, lighter water is called the <b>epilimnion.</b> However, this typical stratification sequence can vary widely depending either on the specific lake, the time of season, or combination of both.|$|E

5000|$|The thermal {{stratification}} of lakes {{refers to a}} change in the temperature at different depths in the lake, and is due to the change in water's density with temperature. [...] Cold water is denser than warm water and the <b>epilimnion</b> generally consists of water that is not as dense as the water in the hypolimnion. [...] However, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater is 4 °C. In temperate regions where lake water warms up and cools through the seasons, a cyclical pattern of overturn occurs that is repeated from year to year as the cold dense water {{at the top of the}} lake sinks. For example, in dimictic lakes the lake water turns over during the spring and the fall. This process occurs more slowly in deeper water and as a result, a thermal bar may form. [...] If the stratification of water lasts for extended periods, the lake is meromictic. Conversely, for most of the time, the relatively shallower meres are unstratified; that is, the mere is considered all <b>epilimnion.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many soda lakes are {{strongly}} stratified, with well-oxygenated upper layer (<b>epilimnion)</b> and an anoxic lower layer (hypolimnion), without oxygen and often {{high concentrations of}} sulfide. Stratification can be permanent, or with seasonal mixing. The depth of the oxic/anoxic interface separating the two layers varies from a few centimeters to near the bottom sediments, depending on local conditions. In either case, it represents an important barrier, both physically and between strongly contrasting biochemical conditions.|$|E
50|$|In lakes grab {{samples are}} {{relatively}} simple to take using depth samplers {{which can be}} lowered to a pre-determined depth and then closed trapping a fixed volume {{of water from the}} required depth. In all but the shallowest lakes, there are major changes in the chemical composition of lake water at different depths, especially during the summer months when many lakes stratify into a warm, well oxygenated upper layer (<b>epilimnion)</b> and a cool de-oxygenated lower layer (hypolimnion).|$|E

50|$|Thermoclines {{can also}} be {{observed}} in lakes. In colder climates, {{this leads to a}} phenomenon called stratification. During the summer, warm water, which is less dense, will sit on top of colder, denser, deeper water with a thermocline separating them. The warm layer is called the <b>epilimnion</b> and the cold layer is called the hypolimnion. Because the warm water is exposed to the sun during the day, a stable system exists and very little mixing of warm water and cold water occurs, particularly in calm weather.|$|E

50|$|The {{northwest}} {{to southeast}} orientation of Uvas Reservoir {{is in line}} with prevailing winds which drive the warm surface layer (<b>epilimnion)</b> down into the cool bottom layer (hypolimnion), so that by late summer the bottom water is warm and anoxic. The result is that no wild or planted trout survive the summer in the reservoir. Wild populations of native stream resident coastal rainbow trout persist Uvas Dam. Genetic studies of these fish in upper Uvas Creek above Uvas Road show that they are of native, and not hatchery stock.|$|E
50|$|Warm {{monomictic}} lakes are lakes {{that never}} freeze, and are thermally stratified {{throughout much of}} the year. The density difference between the warm surface waters (the <b>epilimnion)</b> and the colder bottom waters (the hypolimnion) prevents these lakes from mixing in summer. During winter, the surface waters cool to a temperature equal to the bottom waters. Lacking significant thermal stratification, these lakes mix thoroughly each winter from top to bottom. These lakes are widely distributed from temperate to tropical climatic regions. One example is South Australia's Blue Lake, where the change in circulation is signaled by a striking change in colour.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} shore is densely {{built up}} with the main resort towns of Krumpendorf, Pörtschach, and Velden. The Süd Autobahn motorway and a railway mainline occupy the narrow space between the steep hills and the shore. The southern shore is quieter and less developed. The water surface (<b>epilimnion)</b> can reach up to 25 °C in summer. In winter, the region is often covered by snow and approximately every 10 years the lake freezes over, attracting numerous ice skaters. Lake Wörth's fauna is dominated by fish typically found in alpine lakes. The most common species are the pike (Esox lucius) and the common whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus).|$|E
5000|$|Dimictic lakes mix {{from the}} surface to bottom twice each year. Dimictic lakes are holomictic, a {{category}} which includes all lakes which mix one or more times per year. During winter, they are covered by ice. During summer, they are thermally stratified, with temperature-derived density differences separating the warm surface waters (the <b>epilimnion),</b> from the colder bottom waters (the hypolimnion). Mixing (overturning) typically occurs during the spring and autumn, when the lake is [...] "isothermal" [...] (i.e. at the same temperature from the top to the bottom). At this time, the water throughout the lake is about 4 °C, and, {{in the absence of}} any temperature or density differences, the lake readily mixes from top to bottom. These lakes are common in regions with temperate climates.|$|E
5000|$|Even quite shallow lake {{water can}} develop a {{thermocline}} {{in the short term}} but where there is a moderately windy climate, the circulation caused by wind drift is sufficient to break this up. (The surface is blown down-wind in a seiche and a return current passes either near the bottom or just above the thermocline if that is present at a sufficient depth.) This means that the bed of the shallow mere is aerated and bottom-feeding fish and wildfowl can survive, providing a livelihood for people around. Expressed more technically, the mere consists entirely of the <b>epilimnion.</b> This is quite unlike Windermere where in summer, there is a sharp thermocline at a depth of 9 to 15 metres, well above the maximum depth of 60 metres or so.

50|$|Lake Nar is {{particularly}} {{known for its}} scientific importance. It {{is home to a}} newly-described species of microscopic diatom algae called Clipeoparvus anatolicus. Nar lake waters undergo a remarkable change between different seasons. In winter, the lake water is cold from top to bottom. As the temperature increases in the spring, the lake water divides into an upper half which is warm (<b>epilimnion),</b> while the lower half (hypolimnion) stays cold and lacking in oxygen. An abundance of planktonic algae (or plankton bloom) in early summer changes the water chemistry and leads to the precipitation of calcium carbonate. As a result, the mud {{at the bottom of the}} lake is made of alternating black and white layers (or varves) representing different seasons of the year. Like tree rings, they create a natural geological clock. The best known other example of a varve-forming lake in Turkey is Lake Van.|$|E

5000|$|Lake Whatcom is a {{monomictic}} lake. The {{water body}} is stratified {{for part of}} the year (late spring through mid-fall) and mixed during the rest. This phenomenon is important to the hydrology of the lake. The top layer of water (<b>epilimnion)</b> is warmed by the sun and sits atop the metalimnion (also a thermocline). In this middle layer water temperatures take a pronounced decline and eventually a distinct third layer forms (hypolimnion), much colder and isolated {{from the rest of the}} water body. Minimal oxygen from the air diffuses down to the hypolimnion, causing very low dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This combined with sediment oxidation, cause for near or complete anoxic conditions in the deeper levels of the lake. This stratification is more pronounced in Basin 3 where water is deepest. This layering of the lake, as well as the distinct physical barriers (sills) between basins cause for slow movement of water through the lake. (Ecology TMDL, 2008) ...|$|E
5000|$|Similar {{to light}} zonation, thermal {{stratification}} or thermal zonation {{is a way}} of grouping parts of the water body within an aquatic system based on how each layer has different temperature variations. The less turbid the water, the more light is able to penetrate, and thus heating a thicker depth of water. Heating declines exponentially with depth in the water column, so the water will be warmest near the surface but progressively cooler as moving downwards. There are three main sections which define thermal stratification in a lake. The first is the <b>epilimnion</b> which is closest to the surface and experiences primarily wind circulation although the water is generally uniformally warm because of the close proximity to the surface. The layer below is often called the thermocline and is an area within the water column which tends to experience a rapid decrease in temperature. Finally, the layer which is the bottom-most within the body of water is the hypolimnion which has uniformally cold water because of its depth which restricts sunlight from reaching it. [...] In temperate lakes, fall-season cooling of surface water to 4 °C (the highest density of water) results in turnover of the water column.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Washington Department of Fish And Wildlife, Lake Washington is {{believed}} to hold the largest urban sport salmon fishery in the United States. Research {{has shown that the}} temperature of Lake Washington's upper layers or <b>epilimnion,</b> have risen more than [...] in the past 40 years. Overall the water temperature has increased a full degree Fahrenheit. The effects on local salmon runs are increasing as well. As the water warms, the lake's resident population of zooplankton such as Daphnia, important food for juvenile salmon, are declining. Increased temperatures are delaying fall turnover and maintaining stratification nearly 4 weeks longer than in previous years. Earlier stratification means earlier algal blooms, necessary food for zooplankton such as Daphnia. Normally, the spring burst in the Daphnia population coincides with local algal blooms, providing them with the food they need to survive. However, earlier blooms now mean that other zooplankton are eating the algae before the main Daphnia bloom, severely curtailing Daphnia numbers which have dropped by more than 50% over the last 26 years. In addition, salmon in stratified lakes are more likely to seek shelter in lower cooler layers of water leaving them more vulnerable to predation. It is estimated that rising temperatures played a major part in the disappearance of roughly half the sockeye salmon returning to the Cedar River watershed through the Ballard Locks and Lake 4Washington in 2004.|$|E
40|$|In many lakes, {{zooplankton}} show {{a distinct}} diel vertical migration (DVM) behavior, especially {{during periods of}} stratification. Excretion products of these zooplankton could potentially cause an upward nutrient transport and consequent nutrient enrichment for phytoplankton in the <b>epilimnion.</b> We quantified the upward transport of phosphorus by the cladoceran Daphnia DVM experimentally by adding a radioactive tracer (33 P) to the hypolimnion of large indoor mesocosms and measuring tracer accumulation in the <b>epilimnion</b> over time. During the daytime, when all Daphnia {{were found in the}} hypolimnion, no phosphorus transport from the hypolimnion into the <b>epilimnion</b> took place. As soon as the Daphnia started their upward migration, around dusk, we observed a continuous increase in phosphorus concentration in the <b>epilimnion.</b> The amount of phosphorus transported was in a biologically meaningful range. Our results strongly suggest that Daphnia vertical migration presents a continuous nutrient supply for the <b>epilimnion...</b>|$|E
30|$|In the <b>epilimnion,</b> the {{accuracy}} of the model prediction was dependent on the difference between prevailing temperature and boundary conditions. Temperature in the <b>epilimnion</b> was slightly underestimated on 1 August when observed temperature was higher than in boundary conditions and overestimated on 22 August when observed temperature was lower than in boundary conditions. However, because the aim of the model was especially to study the effects of aeration in the hypolimnion, and mass flow between the hypolimnion and <b>epilimnion</b> is weak, the effect of the boundary conditions did not affect the feasibility of the model.|$|E
40|$|During {{the first}} few weeks of a {{recurring}} seasonal period of diel vertical migration in Lake Maarsseveen (The Netherlands), part of the hybrid Daphnia galeata x hyalina population migrated, while another part remained in the <b>epilimnion.</b> In the <b>epilimnion,</b> 0 + perch prey upon daphnids during daytime. Gradually, the number of adult Daphnia in the <b>epilimnion</b> decrease until the <b>epilimnion</b> is nearly devoid of daphnids. The population as a whole may decrease, as in 1991, or may increase as in 1992. Genotype composition, as determined by allozyme analysis, changed substantially within a fortnight in 1992, and one genotype became dominant. Our data are in agreement with the hypothesis that predation on different genotypes (clones) occurs during the beginning of a seasonal period of diel vertical migration, though our data do not allow to exclude alternative explanations.

40|$|Two {{vertical}} curtains, having depths {{to cover}} the <b>epilimnion</b> thickness, were installed across the Terauchi Dam Reservoir in the western island of Japan to curtail the nutrient supply from nutrient-rich inflows to the downstream <b>epilimnion</b> of the reservoir. The withdrawal level was also regulated to keep the downstream <b>epilimnion</b> away from the nutrient supply. This method markedly reduced algal blooming in the reservoir downstream of the curtains during spring and summer. The physical and biological processes in the reservoir ecosystem were analysed using the 2 -D reservoir model DYRESM and chemical and biological submodels, to predict the water quality and algal species composition in the reservoir. The horizontal variability was maintained in the model by dividing the horizontal layer into parcels. Temperature, chlorophyll-a, soluble phosphorus, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, internal nitrogen, internal phosphorus were considered as state variables in the model. The simulated results revealed the mechanism of how algal blooming is reduced, during early spring high algal concentrations consume large amounts of nutrients, which reduces the nutrient supply to the downstream zone of the reservoir, whereas during late spring and summer, nutrient dispersion from the upstream <b>epilimnion</b> to the downstream <b>epilimnion</b> is curtailed by the curtains, markedly reducing algal blooming in the downstream zone...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the development of SLIM (Second-generation Louvain-la-Neuve Ice-ocean Model), we have built a finite element reduced-gravity model of Lake Tanganyika. This lake is well stratified, so we may define two main layers (the <b>epilimnion</b> at the top and the hypolimnion at the bottom) separated by a thin thermocline. This thermocline undergoes oscil- lations due to wind stress. The wind stress may be decomposed between a seasonal component and an intraseasonal variability, respectively responsible for the free and forced oscillations of the thermocline. The first part of this work was to evaluate the relative importance of these two types of oscillations (Gourgue et al, 2006 a). In the second part of this work, we present a method, based on the concept of age and residence time, to study the renewal of <b>epilimnion</b> water (Gourgue et al, 2006 b). We split the water in the <b>epilimnion</b> into different water types. The initial water is the water initially present in the <b>epilimnion.</b> The renewing water is defined as the water entering it.
