50|$|The Association of Professional Industrial Hygienists, Inc. (APIH) was {{established}} in 1994 to offer credentialing to industrial hygienists who meet the education and experience requirements found in Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 62, Chapter 40. APIH adopted the Tennessee Code as its basis for credentialing {{because it was the}} first legal definition in the United States of an <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienist</b> in terms of education and experience. The APIH Registration Committee investigates and verifies, through electronic means or correspondence, both educational and experience accomplishments claimed by each applicant for registration. The Committee determines the appropriate level of registration, Registered <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist</b> or Registered Professional <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist,</b> and then authorizes the registration certificate to be issued.|$|E

Both of these terms have been codified into law in many states in the United States to identify minimum qualifications of individuals having oversight over certain activities that may affect employee and general public health.|$|E

The AIHA joined with the American Conference of Governmental <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist</b> (ACGIH) in 1961 to sponsor an annual industrial hygiene conference. Despite concerns of the recent split with the AAIPS, the first conference was a success as all exhibit spaces were sold out, scientific exhibits were so numerous that they had to be placed in the halls and 688 industrial hygienists attended the meeting held in Detroit, Michigan.|$|E

50|$|The American Conference of Government <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienists</b> (ACGIH) is a member-based {{organization}} of <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienists</b> and {{individuals in the}} occupational and environmental health and safety industry. They recommend an airborne exposure limit of 0.05ppm for heavy work, 0.08ppm for moderate work, and 0.1ppm for light work. If work is done for {{less than two hours}} the ACGIH recommends an exposure airborne limit of 0.20pmm averaged over an 8-hour work shift. It {{is important to note that}} engineering controls are the most effective way of reducing airborne exposure of ozone (unless the exposure is the result of chemical use, in which exposure can possibly be reduced by substituting a less hazardous chemical). These controls include proper ventilation systems, proper respirators and protective clothing.|$|R
50|$|The American Conference of Governmental <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienists</b> (ACGIH) is {{a private}} {{organization}} {{best known for its}} publication of threshold limit values (TLVs) for occupational exposure and monographs on workplace chemical hazards.

50|$|The {{history of}} the American Industrial Hygiene Association began in the 1930s with {{interested}} people already meeting together {{under the auspices of}} other organizations to include the American Public Health Association, the American Chemical Society, the National Safety Council, and the American Society of Heating and Ventilating Engineers. In 1938 {{the board of directors of}} the American Association of Industrial Physicians and Surgeons (AAIPS) organized a permanent American Conference on Occupational Diseases in response to a massive outbreak of lead poisonings in the automotive industry. Dr. Carey P. McCord as chairman of the Conference proposed the creation of an independent association of <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienist</b> who were not physicians and would operate under the name of the American Industrial Hygiene Conference.The 24th annual meeting of the AAIPS was held in June 1939 in Cleveland, Ohio during which an organizational meeting for the establishment of an industrial hygiene association was held on June 6, 1939. Initially the association was to be named the Society of Industrial Hygienists however was not supported and the consensus agreed on the name of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA).Three officers for the new association were elected with William Yant, president; Warren Cook, president-elect; and Gordon A. Harrold, secretary-treasurer. The AIHA had 160 members at its start and paid annual dues of $3.00. Harrold reported from the first board of directors meeting on October 18, 1939 that the four major goals of the Association were:1. The advancement and application of industrial hygiene and sanitation through the interchange and dissemination of technical knowledge on these subjects.2. The furthering of study and control of industrial health hazards through determination and elimination of excessive exposures.3. The correlation of such activities as conducted by diverse individuals and agencies throughout industry, educational and governmental groups.4. The uniting of persons with these interests.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{experience}} of one <b>industrial</b> <b>hygienist</b> on ex-works environmental problems is described and also how the relationships {{have been established}} with neighbours and local authorities. The differences between in-works and ex-works criteria are highlighted {{and the effects of}} recent trends in legislation arc mentioned. Some examples of problems, investiga-tions, co-operation with local authorities and writing of specifications are included and suggestions are made on how industry and the local authorities may benefit from the indus-trial hygienists ' involvement in neighbourhood problems. THE NATURE {{of the relationship between the}} <b>Industrial</b> <b>Hygienist</b> and the Local Authorities has been very dependent on the industry in which the hygienist worked and its technical organisation, and on the type of local authority. ROBENS (1972) referred to two major criticisms of Local Authorities. The first was that 'the general quality of Local Authority inspection is very uneven', one of the main reasons for this being the size of the authority. This factor should be lessened by the recent Local Government reorganisation. The second major criticism was that 'in interpreting the requirements of statutory provisions, different Local Authorities adopt differen...|$|E
