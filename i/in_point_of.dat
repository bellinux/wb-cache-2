The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, know that he did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{objects are}} conceptually {{imported}} {{into the situation}} as convenient intermediaries not by definition in terms of experience, but simply as irreducible posits comparable, epistemologically, to the gods of Homer... For my part I do, qua lay physicist, believe in physical objects and not in Homer's gods; and I consider it a scientific error to believe otherwise. But <b>in</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> epistemological footing, the physical objects and the gods differ only in degree and not in kind.

25|$|When a thread—or in some cases, {{an entire}} forum—becomes unstable, {{the result is}} usually {{uncontrolled}} spam {{in the form of}} one-line complaints, image macros, or abuse of the report system.

To flame someone means to go off-topic and attack the person rather than their opinion.
