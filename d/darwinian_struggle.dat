2500|$|In {{the same}} way, Mussolini argued that Italy {{was right to}} follow an imperialist policy in Africa because he saw all black people as [...] "inferior" [...] to whites. Mussolini claimed {{that the world was}} divided into a {{hierarchy}} of races (stirpe, though this was justified more on cultural than on biological grounds), and that history {{was nothing more than a}} <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> for power and territory between various [...] "racial masses". Mussolini saw high birthrates in Africa and Asia as a threat to the [...] "white race" [...] and he often asked the rhetorical question [...] "Are the blacks and yellows at the door?" [...] to be followed up with [...] "Yes, they are!". Mussolini believed that the United States was doomed as the American blacks had a higher birthrate than whites, making it inevitable that the blacks would take over the United States to drag it down to their level. The very fact that Italy was suffering from overpopulation was seen as proving the cultural and spiritual vitality of the Italians, who were thus justified in seeking to colonize lands that Mussolini argued – on a historical basis – belonged to Italy anyway, which was the heir to the Roman Empire. In Mussolini's thinking, demography was destiny; nations with rising populations were nations destined to conquer; and nations with falling populations were decaying powers that deserved to die. Hence, the importance of natalism to Mussolini, since only by increasing the birth rate could Italy ensure that its future as a great power that would win its spazio vitale would be assured. By Mussolini's reckoning, the Italian population had to reach 60 million to enable Italy to fight a major war—hence his relentless demands for Italian women to have more children in order to reach that number.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1930s, Mussolini's {{obsession}} with demography {{led him to}} conclude that Britain and France were finished as powers, {{and that it was}} Germany and Italy who were destined to rule Europe {{if for no other reason}} than their demographic strength. Mussolini stated his belief that declining birth rates in France were [...] "absolutely horrifying" [...] and that the British Empire was doomed because one-quarter of the British population was over 50. As such, Mussolini believed that an alliance with Germany was preferable to an alignment with Britain and France as it was better to be allied with the strong instead of the weak. Mussolini saw international relations as a Social <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> between [...] "virile" [...] nations with high birth rates that were destined to destroy [...] "effete" [...] nations with low birth rates. Mussolini believed that France was a [...] "weak and old" [...] nation as the French weekly death rate exceeded the birthrate by 2,000, and he had no interest in an alliance with France. [...] Such was the extent of Mussolini's belief that it was Italy's destino to rule the Mediterranean because of Italy's high birth rate that Mussolini neglected much of the serious planning and preparations necessary for a war with the Western powers. The only arguments that held Mussolini back from full alignment with Berlin were his awareness of Italy's economic and military weakness, meaning he required further time to rearm, and his desire to use the Easter Accords of April 1938 as a way of splitting Britain from France. A military alliance with Germany as opposed to the already existing looser political alliance with the Reich under the Anti-Comintern Pact (which had no military commitments) would end any chance of Britain implementing the Easter Accords. The Easter Accords in turn were intended by Mussolini to allow Italy to take on France alone by sufficiently improving Anglo-Italian relations that London would presumably remain neutral in the event of a Franco-Italian war (Mussolini had imperial designs on Tunisia, and had some support in that country. [...] ). In turn, the Easter Accords were intended by Britain to win Italy away from Germany. In the 8 November 1938 entry of his diary Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law and Foreign Minister, summed up the dictator's foreign policy objectives regarding France: Djibouti would have to be ruled in common with France; [...] "Tunisia, with a more or less similar regime; Corsica, Italian and never Frenchified and therefore under our direct control, the border at the river Var." [...] As for Savoy, which was not [...] "historically or geographically Italian", Mussolini claimed that he was not interested in it. On 30 November 1938, Mussolini invited the French ambassador André François-Poncet to attend the opening of the Italian Chamber of Deputies, during which the assembled deputies, at his cue, began to demonstrate loudly against France, shouting that Italy should annex [...] "Tunis, Nice, Corsica, Savoy!", which was followed by the deputies marching into the street carrying signs demanding that France turn over Tunisia, Savoy, and Corsica to Italy. The French Premier Édouard Daladier promptly rejected the Italian demands for territorial concessions, and for much of the winter of 1938-39, France and Italy were on the verge of war.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a historical {{examination of the}} influence of the <b>Darwinian</b> metaphor 'the <b>struggle</b> for existence' on a variety of scientific theories which inform our current understanding of the prospects for sustainable development. The first part of the paper traces the use of the metaphor of struggle through two distinct avenues of thought relevant to the search for sustainable development. One of these avenues leads to the biophysical critique of conventional development popularised by 'ecological economists' such as Georgescu-Roegen and Daly. This critique suggests that modern economic systems have gone astray by failing to respect the biological and physical limits to development and that they should be adapted to make them more like ecological systems. The other avenue leads to the modern insights of evolutionary psychology. These latter insights suggest that in certain key respects, the economic system (and actors within it) are already behaving more or less like an ecological system, driven as they are by evolutionary imperatives. Consequently, this second avenue appears to offer far bleaker prospects for achieving sustainable development than the first. However, the final part of the paper re-examines the historical roots of the metaphor itself, and suggests a number of ways in which a critical response to those historical roots might influence our understanding of the prospects for sustainable development.

40|$|Prose, {{of varying}} length, tone, purpose, and style, {{made up the}} vast {{majority}} of periodical content throughout the nineteenth century. It was the vehicle for conveying news, assessing cultural, political and social events, offering personal opinions, and entertaining readers. The variety of competing prose discourses in the nineteenth-century periodical provides a rich field for research but is not always the easiest terrain to navigate. Structuring an analysis of these prose forms inevitably gives rise to questions about readership and precedence. We find ourselves asking how we should read across these competing voices, how do we prioritise, and how did nineteenth-century readers do so? Which is more important: the editorial which allows us to orient the periodical’s political outlook, the cryptic “Notice to Correspondents” advising an individual in difficulties, or the serialised fiction that attracted the eye of the casual reader? Furthermore, do we see these different pieces of prose in periodical issues as competing with one another for attention and even survival; or does this <b>Darwinian</b> language of <b>struggle</b> gloss over the connections and correspondences between an issue’s separate units? A scholarly analysis of prose forms in nineteenth-century periodicals cannot recreate the reading practices of previous centuries, nor can it hope to trace all the connections or contradictions that exist between the pieces of prose in a particular run of periodicals. It can, though, explore the most prominent prose forms across the nineteenth-century press and give a sense of how they fitted into the larger context of the periodical issue and the publishing world...|$|R

5000|$|The Ukrainian {{nationalism}} of the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries {{had been largely}} liberal or socialist, combining Ukrainian national consciousness with patriotism and humanist values. In contrast, the nationalists who emerged in Galicia following the First World War, much as {{in the rest of}} Europe, adopted the form of nationalism known as Integral nationalism. According to this ideology, the nation was held to be of the highest absolute value, more important than social class, regions, the individual, religion, etc. To this end, OUN members were urged to [...] "force their way into all areas of national life" [...] such as institutions, societies, villages and families. Politics was seen as a <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> between nations for survival, rendering conflict unavoidable and justifying any means that would lead to the victory of one's nation over that of others. In this context willpower was seen as more important than reason, and warfare was glorified as an expression of national vitality. Integral nationalism became a powerful force in much of Europe during the 1920s and 1930s. The OUN's conceptualization of this idea was particular in several ways. Because Ukraine was stateless and surrounded by more powerful neighbors, the emphasis on force and warfare was to be expressed in acts of terrorism rather than open warfare, and illegality was glorified. Because Ukrainians did not have a state to glorify or serve, the emphasise was placed on a [...] "pure" [...] national language and culture rather than a State. There was a strain of fantastic romanticism, in which the unsophisticated Ukrainian rejection of reason was more spontaneous and genuine than the cynical rejection of reason by German or Italian integral nationalists.|$|E

5000|$|Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) {{pointed out}} that we all shape our {{experience}} of things through the filter of our mind, a view sometimes called epistemological solipsism. The mind shapes that experience, and among other things, Kant believed the concepts {{of space and time}} were programmed into the human brain, as was the notion of cause and effect. We never have direct experience of things, the noumenal world, and what we do experience is the phenomenal world as conveyed by our senses, this conveyance processed by the machinery of the mind and nervous system. Kant focused upon this processing. Kant believed in a priori knowledge arrived at independent of experience, so-called synthetic a priori knowledge. In particular, he thought that by introspection some aspects of the filtering mechanisms of the mind/brain/nervous system could be discovered. The following observations summarize Kant's views upon the subject-object problem, called Kant's Copernican revolution: [...] "It has hitherto been assumed that our cognition must conform to the objects; but all attempts to ascertain anything about these objects a priori, by means of conceptions, and thus to extend the range of our knowledge, have been rendered abortive by this assumption. Let us then make the experiment whether we may not be more successful in metaphysics, if we assume that the objects must conform to our cognition. This appears, at all events, to accord better with the possibility of our gaining the end we have in view, that is to say, of arriving at the cognition of objects a priori, of determining something with respect to these objects, before they are given to us. We here propose to do just what Copernicus did in attempting to explain the celestial movements. When he found that he could make no progress by assuming that all the heavenly bodies revolved round the spectator, he reversed the process, and tried the experiment of assuming that the spectator revolved, while the stars remained at rest. We may make the same experiment with regard to the intuition of objects." [...] Immanuel Kant Although Kant has posed the issue of built-in aspects of mind, the particulars that depend upon the science of his day have become outmoded. A more recent approach to these limitations is proposed by Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker. Like Kant, Noam Chomsky raised the issue of the mind's inherent programming. Chomsky selected as a particular example the acquiring of language by children. Of course, language is indispensable in the formulation and communication of our perceptions of the objective world: [...] "People do not think in English or Chinese or Apache; they think in a language of thought. This language of thought probably looks a bit like all these languages;...But compared with any given language, mentalese must be richer in some ways and simpler in others." [...] Steven Pinker [...] Chomsky marshaled evidence that a child's rapid mastery of the complexity of language indicated an innate ability programmed into the development of the human mind from birth that could not be explained by the [...] "blank slate" [...] view of the infant mind. Rather, the mind has a built-in propensity to process symbolic representations. The origins of this ability were sought by Steven Pinker in a <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> that established the survival value of the ability to communicate. [...] According to Pinker, Charles Darwin himself [...] "concluded that language ability is 'an instinctive tendency to acquire an art', a design that is not peculiar to humans but seen in other species such as song-learning birds." [...] This observation is strongly supported by research on crows.|$|E

Economic liberals believe that Germany’s economic success is rooted in the innate superiority of the Germans, that they were diligent and productive, unlike the citizens of the southern European countries that were suffering from crisis, and were pre-conditioned for linking economic superiority to cultural and national superiority.

The richest male testators left twice as many children as the poorest. Consequently the modern population of the English is largely descended from the economic upper classes of the middle ages. At the same time, from 1150 to 1800 in England there are clear signs of changes in average economic preferences towards more “capitalist ” attitudes. The highly capitalistic nature of English society by 1800 – individualism, low time preference rates, long work hours, high levels of human capital – may thus stem from the nature of the <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> in a very stable agrarian society in the long run up to the Industrial Revolution. The triumph of capitalism in the modern world thus may lie as much in our genes as in ideology or rationality...|$|E
40|$|In W. H. Hudson’s Green Mansions (1904) {{the mysterious}} and enchanting {{quality of the}} natural world is {{represented}} through the writer’s powerful imagination, and the exotic landscape of the South American rainforest is related to British territorial expansion: according to a long-standing literary tradition, the European colonial desire is projected onto remote, unknown places. On the one hand, the pristine forest appears a pure space, a site unspoiled by colonial expansion, the primitive and sacred world nourishing Western exotic dreams. On the other hand, by revisiting the myth of the lost paradise, Hudson conveys the late nineteenth-early twentieth century European perception of the tropical world, a patchwork of Charles Darwin’s theories, Biblical echoes and colonial ideology. Abel surrenders to the influence of the wild, ventures into the weird and entangled forest, seemingly refusing male invasion and domination. Rima’s subsequent death symbolizes the ecological catastrophe brought about by the Europeans in the primitive world of South America: the feathered bird-girl is assimilated to an Edenic being at the mercy of destructive forces. At the same time, Abel’s wish to possess the land reinforces the colonial viewpoint of the narration, while the movement from civilization to the wilderness implies the representation of a <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle.</b> Hudson frames the tropical space as substantially ambiguous, attractive and destructive for both colonizers and colonized, and through his narrative he introduces the fear of natural loss in the extreme form of the extinction of the green world. <br /...|$|E
40|$|There is {{much debate}} {{as to how}} best to exploit the {{potential}} of the internet when designing distance education (DE) courses; the "formula for success" is still to be determined. In this <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> for "market share" Athabasca University (AU) has established itself as the leading DE university in Canada. Courses at AU include four in nutrition. Enrollment growth has been rapid in recent years. We investigated factors that may be responsible for this success. We garnered the opinions of former nutrition students using a mailed questionnaire (response rate: 57. 1 %; 176 returned). We investigated the following factors with respect to the highest enrollment nutrition course: (1) why students took the course at AU (rather than a similar course at another university); (2) student opinions of the course; (3) student preferences for receiving course materials in a printed format or via a computer; and (4) student opinions of AU. The leading reason for taking the nutrition course by DE is work commitment, followed by family commitment, a preference for DE, a recommendation, and no other one was available. The learning materials for the course are print based. This appears to be important as only 4 % of students prefer to receive their textbook via a computer rather than printed. Another factor is that AU is well respected by its students: only 11 % feel that AU courses are of lower academic credibility than similar courses at other Canadian universities...|$|E
40|$|In {{a society}} where {{economic}} and social hierarchies were increasingly being {{defined in terms of}} scientific explanations of the natural world, late Victorian women poets (like Webster, Greenwell and Blind) represent poetry as a humanizing agent, demanding not only that it be contemporary but that it provide a more humane vision of the world. Mathilde Blind´s work, in particular, articulates existence in terms of struggle, where the success of the ‘strong’ is bought at the cost of the suffering of the ‘weak’. Her epic verse narrative The Ascent of Man (1889), whose title seems to mock Charles Darwin’s own in the Descent of Man (1871), is an attempt to recast Christian mythological formations and to posit a transcendent, and feminized, alternative to the brutality of the <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> for survival. But, paradoxically, Blind’s is also an ardently Darwinian vision of the world, boisterous and celebratory (charged with images of natural power), mitigated by her passion for Shelley, whom she considers a ‘higher type of man’, and her inclination to mix Romantic thought and Evolutionary discourse. In fact, she draws on Darwin’s definition of imagination as ‘one of the highest prerogatives of man’. Being aware that poetry conflicted in a fundamental way with scientific modes of cognition, Blind still believed that both were ‘universal languages’, with power to transform the natural world and to retrieve triumph from defeat (i. e. violence and death). This chapter will thus attempt to ‘disentangle’ both discourses and to unravel their power of transformation in Blind’s ambitious poem...|$|E
40|$|An extreme materialist {{hypothesis}} {{explaining the}} Industrial Revolution would be simply genetic. Gregory Clark asserts such {{a theory of}} sociobiological inheritance in his Farewell to Alms (2007). Rich people proliferated in England, Clark argues, and by a social <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> the poor and incompetent died out, leaving a master race of Englishmen with the bourgeois values to conquer the world. Clark will have no truck with ideas as causes, adopting a materialist (and as he believes is implied by materialism a quantitative) theory of truth. His method, that is, follows Marx in historical materialism, as many scholars did 1890 to 1980. But he does not follow through on his promise to show his argument quantitatively. The argument fails, on many grounds. For one thing, non-English people succeeded, as for instance the Chinese now are succeeding. And such people have always done fine in a bourgeois country. For another, Clark does not show that his inheritance mechanism has the quantitative oomph to change people generally into bourgeois, nor does he show that bourgeois habits of working hard mattered, or that bourgeois values caused innovation. What made for success in 1500 is not obviously the same as what made for innovation in 1800. And {{in the modern world}} of literacy such values are not transmitted down families, but across families. Literal inheritance anyway dissipates in reversion to the mean. What mattered in modern economic growth was not a doubtfully measured change in the inherited abilities of English people. What mattered was a radical change 1600 - 1776, “measurable” in every play and pamphlet, in what English people wanted, paid for, revalued. ...|$|E
40|$|Economists {{typically}} {{view their}} discipline as a progressive science in which superior new ideas relentlessly supplant inferior old ones in a <b>Darwinian</b> <b>struggle</b> toward the truth. Thus {{it came as}} something of a shock when Milton Friedman challenged this belief in the May 1975 issue of the American Economic Review. In response to the question “What have we learned in the past 25 years?”, Friedman argued that what monetary economists have learned since 1950 are hardly new ideas but rather a rediscovery of old ideas inherited from David Hume and his contemporaries more than 200 years ago. Three years later, the British economist Ivor F. Pearce shocked his readers even more. He denied that the Keynesian Revolution had contributed a single new or useful idea to monetary economics. Instead, he insisted that “human history is guided not by new ideas, for there are none, ” but rather by “some ephemeral sub-group of [...] . old ideas. ” Such old ideas, “often believed to be new, ” are “seized upon as the [...] . solution to whatever difficulties immediate experience has made to seem important, and congealed into a crust of dogma by endless repetition and obeisance ” (Pearce 1978, p. 93). The above sentiments express what every doctrinal historian knows, namely that much of what passes for novelty and originality in monetary theory and policy is ancient teaching dressed up in modern guises. To be sure, the increasing application of mathematical modeling has given these concepts greater rigor and precision. Likewise, better data and more powerful empirical techniques have improved our statistical estimates of the relevant quantitative magnitudes. Still, the basic ideas themselves often remain much the same. Thus instea...|$|E
