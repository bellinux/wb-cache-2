50|$|In contrast, {{permanent}} ferrite magnets {{are made}} of hard ferrites, which have a high coercivity and high remanence after magnetization. Iron oxide and barium or strontium carbonate are used in manufacturing of hard ferrite magnets. The high coercivity means the materials are very resistant to becoming demagnetized, an essential characteristic for a permanent magnet. They also have high magnetic permeability. These so-called ceramic magnets are cheap, and are widely used in household products such as refrigerator magnets. The maximum magnetic field B is about 0.35 tesla and the magnetic field strength H is about 30 to 160 <b>kiloampere</b> turns per meter (400 to 2000 oersteds).

They transform the 750 volt direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three-phase alternating current used in the motors. The frequency and amplitude of the current fed to the engines varies depending on the train's speed. The MX3000 introduced regenerative brakes, that allow the electromagnetic brakes to feed power back to the power supply when braking. In addition, there is a back-up disc brake on each axle. Acceleration in the range 0 to 40 km/h is limited to 1.3 meters per second squared (4.3 ft/s2). In this phase, the fully loaded train uses 5.0 <b>kiloampere.</b> For use in areas without a third rail, such as at depots, the trains are equipped with a 110 V battery.

40|$|Current {{inertial}} {{fusion reactor}} designs require heavy ion beams in the <b>kiloampere</b> range and beam diameters {{of less than}} a centimeter. The final transport of these beams is challenging, since no focusing magnets can be placed inside the reactor chamber. Plasma channels are a solution: they can easily be created by discharges inside the chamber and they possess an azimuthal magnetic field of up to several tesla. Calculations with a hybrid magnetohydrodynamics and particle-in-cell code {{have shown that the}} fields created by a 60 kA discharge are sufficient to transport the ion beams over several meters inside the channel[1]. Naturally, <b>kiloampere</b> heavy ion beams are not available yet. Therefore our experiments at the UNILAC accelerator facility at GSI do {{not take into account the}} large spacecharge effects of a reactor beam. Nevertheless studies of the channel evolution and stability and proof-of-principle experiments regarding beam transport are possible. Our initial experiments used a 50 cm long chamber with a diameter of 60 cm[2]. Recently the chamber was prolonged to 1 m to be closer to the reactor parameters. This required electric field calculations to improve the chamber design. The gas breakdown depends on the electric field, the gas pressure and the initial ionization of the gas. A breakdown to the metallic chamber walls can therefore be prevented by reducing the gas density on the axis (laser induced channels) or by ionizing the gas before the discharge (ion beam induced channels). However, these methods still require a reasonable field distribution in the chamber. Of particular importance for the breakdown is the minimum electric field on the axis. Poisson, part of the Poisson/Superfish[3] software package from the Los Alamos National Laboratories, was used to calculate the electric field right before the start of the discharge.
