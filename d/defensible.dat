5|$|The fortifications {{were named}} the Floriana Lines after their architect. By June 1640, {{the lines were}} {{considered}} partially <b>defensible,</b> although still incomplete.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of whether or not economic competition is <b>defensible</b> requires an examination from two perspectives: the moral point of view and the technical point of view.|$|E
5|$|Carpenter, {{seeking a}} more {{defensive}} posture closer to Beaver Creek, advanced {{for a short}} period then circled the supply wagons in a <b>defensible</b> area. This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action. On his command, Carpenter's men rushed inside at the gallop. They dismounted and took up a defensive firing line at the gap between the wagons they had just entered.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began {{shifting}} strategies. The UN began to redeploy its forces to more <b>defensible</b> locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack or take hostage. More importantly, Gen. Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Group E {{is located}} {{to the west}} of Group C. Group E is largely {{surrounded}} by steep ravines; the inhabitants of the city cut the cliffs to make them steeper and more <b>defensible,</b> and reinforced them with a retaining wall. Archaeological investigations failed to find any access stairway through the retaining wall to Group E.|$|E
5|$|Many hillsides, {{such as at}} Cadbury Castle, Ham Hill and Maes Knoll, and {{sheltered}} valleys provided <b>defensible</b> {{locations for}} early human settlements. Trade was established early. The large tidal variation provided access inland, {{a key factor in}} distributing goods and produce, using rivers such as the Parrett and Avon. The tidal range of , is second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Once {{this was}} done, Pedro de Alvarado sent Juan de Chávez, {{one of his}} trusted officers, {{at the head of}} 40–50 Spanish {{soldiers}} and some 1500–2000 native auxiliaries to explore the mountainous interior of the province, and find a good, <b>defensible</b> location for a new colonial capital, ideally to provide a communication route between Higueras and Guatemala.|$|E
5|$|Ashina She'er's {{soldiers}} were organized in five columns. The Tang army bypassed Karasahr and struck at Kucha {{from the north}} by moving through the Dzungarian Basin, which was {{the territory of the}} Chuyue (possibly Chigil) and Chumi, two Turkic tribes allied with the oasis state. The Tang army defeated the Chuyue and Chumi before entering the Tarim Basin, upon which the king of Karasahr fled his capital city and tried to find a <b>defensible</b> position in Kucha's eastern territories. Ashina She'er's forces pursued the Karasahr king, took him captive, and then executed him.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily <b>defensible,</b> and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when the threat from the Arabs increased.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{a second}} hostage crisis, General Smith {{and other top}} UN commanders began to shift strategy. The UN began redeploying its forces to more <b>defensible</b> locations, {{so that they would}} be harder to attack and so that it would be more {{difficult}} to take UN personnel hostage. General Michael Rose established the UN Rapid Reaction Force, a heavily armed land unit with more aggressive rules of engagement, designed to take offensive action if necessary to prevent hostage-taking and enforce peace agreements.|$|E
5|$|Group F is to {{the west}} of Group E. Mound F is the main {{structure}} within Group F. It slopes gradually away to the west and was not easily <b>defensible</b> on that side, however it lay outside the strong retaining walls of the fortress and appears to have been an observation platform covering the western pass to the city. A retaining wall supported the mound above the pass and a round earth platform upon the mound may have supported a perishable watchtower.|$|E
5|$|In 1360 {{the king}} {{conducted}} {{an inquiry into}} Southampton's defences and in 1363 he established a wider commission to examine how best to improve them. The commission came {{to a number of}} conclusions: the town walls should be better maintained and kept clear of housing and other obstructions; the number of gateways in the walls should be reduced; and a water-filled ditch should be built to further reinforce the walls on the west. The enquiry also concluded that the outer doors and ground floor windows of properties facing the sea should be filled in to form a more <b>defensible</b> line.|$|E
5|$|In 1880, a {{war broke}} out between Pangala' and Baruppu', a {{neighbouring}} state led by Pasusu. Tiku took {{an active role in}} a successful campaign against the neighbouring state, and when Pasusu was defeated Tiku took his place as ruler of Baruppu'. The newly annexed kingdom was rich in rice fields and easily <b>defensible,</b> giving Tiku great power. Although the Torajans traditionally valued manpower and did not kill more people than necessary, Baruppu' oral history describes Tiku as killing men, women, and children with abandon.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{benefits}} of more <b>defensible</b> forts are evident: they could act as temporary refuges for overwhelmed local troops during barbarian incursions, while they waited for reinforcements. The forts were difficult for the barbarians to take by assault, as they generally lacked the necessary equipment. The forts could store sufficient supplies to enable the defenders to hold {{out for a few}} weeks, and to supply relieving troops. They could also act as bases from which defenders could make sorties against isolated groups of barbarians and to cooperate with relieving forces.|$|E
5|$|The main {{features}} of late Roman fortification clearly presage those of medieval castles. But the defensibility of late Roman forts {{must not be}} exaggerated. Late Roman forts were not always located on <b>defensible</b> sites, such as hilltops {{and they were not}} designed as independent logistic facilities where the garrison could survive for years on internal supplies (water in cisterns or from wells and stored food). They remained bases for troops that would sally out and engage the enemy in the field.|$|E
5|$|The {{regiment}} subsequently {{retreated to}} Chonan, where, {{the next night}} the 3rd Battalion was heavily engaged in another delaying action. The 34th Infantry lost its commander, Colonel Robert R. Martin {{as well as two}} thirds of its 3rd Battalion's strength. The exhausted 34th Infantry Regiment retreated to the Kum River, near the 24th Infantry Division's headquarters. The 24th Infantry Division would make one final delaying action before it would be forced to make its final stand around Taejon, the only major <b>defensible</b> city left before the Pusan Perimeter being established by the Eighth Army.|$|E
5|$|These escaped {{slaves were}} able to defeat a small force of troops sent after them from Capua, and equip {{themselves}} with captured military equipment {{as well as their}} gladiatorial weapons. Sources are somewhat contradictory on the order of events immediately following the escape, but they generally agree that this band of escaped gladiators plundered the region surrounding Capua, recruited many other slaves into their ranks, and eventually retired to a more <b>defensible</b> position on Mount Vesuvius.|$|E
5|$|They were {{introduced}} into Scotland during the Bronze Age from around 1000 BCE. The largest group {{are from the}} Iron Age, with over 1,000 hillforts, mostly below the Clyde-Forth line, {{most of which were}} abandoned during the period of Roman occupation of Britain. There are also large numbers of vitrified forts, which have been subjected to fire, many of which may date to this period. After Roman occupation in the early Middle Ages some hillforts were reoccupied and petty kingdoms were often ruled from smaller nucleated forts using <b>defensible</b> natural features, as at Edinburgh and Dunbarton.|$|E
5|$|To the north, {{from the}} Masan-Chinju highway to the Nam River, were several easily <b>defensible</b> positions. The most {{favorable}} {{was the high}} ground near Chungam-ni, which controlled an important junction connecting the Masan road with the road over the Nam River to Uiryong. It was essential for the US 25th Infantry Division's right flank {{to connect with the}} left flank of the US 24th Infantry Division at the confluence of the Nam and the Naktong Rivers. Therefore, the 25th Infantry Division also moved to protect the Komam-ni road intersection where the Chindong-ni-Haman road met the Masan-Chinju highway.|$|E
5|$|Zaculeu {{was likely}} {{originally}} developed {{because of its}} proximity to the Seleguá River, providing a permanent water supply and transportation waterway, together with its easily <b>defensible</b> hilltop location. Zaculeu has 43 structures. The majority of construction activity took place in one burst in the Early Classic, with minor alterations thereafter. The smaller platforms situated in the plazas were late additions; they show the influence of central Mexican civilization. The entrance to the site was via a narrow land bridge to the north, which was protected by a fortified structure that occupied three-quarters of {{the width of the}} land bridge.|$|E
5|$|A <b>defensible</b> barracks made of brick, {{faced in}} Kentish ragstone on the fort's exterior, closes off the gorge. Its line is {{indented}} to facilitate small arms fire from loopholes and windows with armoured steel shutters. The {{first floor of}} the barracks had a veranda facing towards the fort's interior and supported on cast-iron pillars. The barracks provided accommodation for a wartime complement of six officers and 180 NCO and men, though in peacetime only small maintenance detachments occupied the fort. It also accommodated storerooms and a hospital with room for fourteen patients. Although much of the barracks is now in poor condition, two of the kitchen ranges still survive and two rooms still contain service crests painted on their walls during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Tyre, on 27 July the crusaders {{decided to}} move to the plain on {{the eastern side of the}} city, which was less heavily {{fortified}} but had much less food and water. It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less <b>defensible</b> position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home. Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had by now arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible to return to their better position. The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city. First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by Turkish archers who constantly harassed them.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} June 1775, Colonel Joseph Goreham {{had been ordered}} by General Thomas Gage to raise the Royal Fencible American Regiment of Foot and natives in Nova Scotia {{for the defense of}} the {{province}} against Patriot activity. Arriving at the fort in the summer of 1776, Colonel Goreham and a garrison of 200 Loyalist troops of the RFA did what they could to restore the premises to a <b>defensible</b> condition. But Goreham had not been adequately provisioned and his men lacked everything from victuals to uniforms. Furthermore, the locals were generally sympathetic to the Patriot cause, and refused to assist in rehabilitating the fort, even trying to induce members of the garrison to defect.|$|E
5|$|By the 14th century, castles were {{combining}} defences with luxurious, sophisticated {{living arrangements}} and landscaped gardens and parks. Early gunpowder weapons {{were used to}} defend castles {{by the end of}} the 14th century and gunports became an essential feature for a fashionable castle. The economics of maintaining castles meant that many were left to decline or abandoned; in contrast, a small number of castles were developed by the very wealthy into palaces that hosted lavish feasts and celebrations amid elaborate architecture. Smaller <b>defensible</b> structures called tower houses emerged in the north of England to protect against the Scottish threat. By the late medieval period, town walls were increasingly less military in character and more often expressions of civic pride or part of urban governance: many grand gatehouses were built in the 14th and 15th centuries for these purposes.|$|E
5|$|Cannan resumed {{command of}} the 15th Infantry Battalion in Egypt on 21 January 1916. It {{departed}} Alexandria for Marseilles on 1 June 1916, to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. Cannan led his battalion into action again at the Battle of Pozières and Battle of Mouquet Farm. On the night of 8 August 1916, the 15th Infantry Battalion launched {{an attack on the}} German trench in front of Mouquet Farm known as Park Lane. Cannan's men captured their objectives, and indeed went beyond them in some places. However, the Suffolk Regiment on his flank was mown down by German machine gun fire and Cannan was compelled to withdraw part of his force to a more <b>defensible</b> position.|$|E
5|$|Charles advised {{his brother}} of the French Directory's offer, but it was flatly refused by the Emperor and the {{civilian}} military advisers on the Aulic Council. Charles was instructed to lay siege to the fortresses, to take them, and secure any possible French access to southern Germany via the Rhine. The Aulic Council still believed Austrian forces could relieve Mantua. Consequently, by tying Charles down at the Rhine, besieging the highly <b>defensible</b> Vauban fortresses at the river at Kehl and Hüningen, the Council effectively sealed the fate of Wurmser's troops in Mantua. After {{it became clear that}} Charles was locked into place on the Rhine, Moreau moved 14 demi-brigades to Italy, leaving behind modest forces on the French border. Two Austrian columns sent from Vienna failed to reach their beleaguered counterparts in Mantua, which fell on 2 February 1797.|$|E
5|$|For Walther, at the bridge, the {{position}} appeared <b>defensible</b> {{for as long}} as it would take to remove Ney's force through Winterthur, yet the shock of the Austrian force, as it hit his defences, was sufficient to break his line after 90 minutes of brisk fighting. But there the Austrian forward momentum stalled. Although Hotze's men forced Walther's from the bridge, they themselves could not cross it. From the ridge, Ney's rear guard maintained a steady stream of cannon fire on any of the Austrians who crossed the bridge and attempted to advance up the hill. Hotze recognised the futility of throwing his men into direct cannon fire and ordered instead a steady musketry barrage. This proved effective, for Ney was again injured, this time in his left hand, and his second horse was killed; he relinquished command to Gazan, who organised the continued withdrawal from {{the position}}.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} the Kaqchikel served as loyal {{allies of the}} K'iche' Maya. The growing power of the Kaqchikel within the {{alliance}} eventually caused such friction that the Kaqchikel were forced to flee the K'iche' capital and found the city of Iximche. The Kaqchikel established their new capital upon an easily <b>defensible</b> ridge almost surrounded by deep ravines. Iximche developed quickly as a city and within 50 years of its foundation it had reached its maximum extent. The rulers of Iximche were four principal lords drawn from the four main clans of the Kaqchikel, although it was the lords of the Sotz'il and Xahil clans who held the real power.|$|E
5|$|General William Howe {{had taken}} his army from New York City by sea on a {{campaign}} to capture Philadelphia instead of moving north to meet Burgoyne. Most of Burgoyne's Indian support had fled following the loss at Bennington, and his situation was becoming difficult. He needed to reach <b>defensible</b> winter quarters, requiring either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, {{and he decided to}} advance. He then deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He ordered Baron Riedesel, who commanded the rear of the army, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and then had the army cross the Hudson just north of Saratoga between September 13 and 15.|$|E
5|$|Generalfeldmarschall Gerd von Rundstedt, supreme {{commander}} of the German forces in the west (OB West), directed on 1 July that Caen should be gradually abandoned and {{the bulk of the}} German armoured divisions be shifted to the west end of the beachhead against the US First Army but the city and its surroundings were considered by Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW, Armed Forces High Command) to be fundamental to the defence of Normandy. OKW wanted an arc of <b>defensible</b> terrain from the English Channel to the western banks of the Orne to be held and Adolf Hitler sacked Rundstedt and replaced him with Generalfeldmarschall Günther von Kluge. Learning of this through Ultra, the Allied ground forces commander, General Bernard Montgomery, planned an offensive to capture Caen and to prevent a large redeployment of German forces from the Anglo-Canadian sector to the American front.|$|E
5|$|Hieroglyphic texts at Seibal {{indicate}} that the city's newly refound vigour was sponsored by a new alliance formed by the cities of Caracol and Ucanal in the east, two sites that had so far survived the spreading Classic Maya collapse. It is likely that they were attempting to reopen the old Pasión-Usumacinta trade route and were drawn to Seibal by its <b>defensible</b> location overlooking the Pasión River. Seibal's refounding took place in AD 830 with the installation of Wat'ul Chatel as a vassal of Chan Ek' Hopet of Ucanal. The new king dedicated a new building and stelae in 849, overseen by Jewel K'awil of Tikal, and Chan Pet, king of Calakmul. Wat'ul Chatel built an innovative new temple-stelae arrangement {{to the south of}} the Central Plaza of GroupA. StructureA-3 consists of a low radial pyramid with an inventive arrangement of sculpted monuments.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{approximately}} 5,500 French soldiers {{landed in}} Rhode Island to assist their American allies in operations against British-controlled New York City. Following {{the arrival of}} dispatches from France that included the possibility {{of support from the}} French West Indies fleet of the Comte de Grasse, Washington and Rochambeau decided to ask de Grasse for assistance either in besieging New York, or in military operations against a British army operating in Virginia. On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton, was eventually ordered to build a <b>defensible</b> deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown, Virginia. Cornwallis' movements in Virginia were shadowed by a Continental Army force led by the Marquis de Lafayette.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verde is {{best known}} for a large number of well-preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock {{overhangs}} along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly <b>defensible</b> quarters during the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the years}} {{scholars}} have postulated {{a number of}} theories about what Stowe {{was trying to say}} with the novel (aside from the obvious themes, such as condemning slavery). For example, as an ardent Christian and active abolitionist, Stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel. Some scholars have stated that Stowe saw her novel as offering a solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents: whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil. Was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally <b>defensible?</b> Which of Stowe's characters should be emulated, the passive Uncle Tom or the defiant George Harris? Stowe's solution was similar to Ralph Waldo Emerson's: God's will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them.|$|E
5|$|The {{applications}} from Tone intrigued the Directory, which understood that by attacking Ireland {{they would be}} striking at the least <b>defensible</b> part of the British Isles. Support for the British government was weakest there and the United Irishmen optimistically claimed {{to be able to}} raise an irregular army of as many as 250,000 waiting to join the French once they had landed, with the additional attraction that a successful establishment of an Irish Republic would prove an ideological coup for the French Republic. Finally and most significantly, a large expeditionary force in Ireland could provide an ideal springboard for an invasion of Britain, especially in combination with a plan then under development to land 2,000 uniformed criminals in Cornwall, who would distract the British Army during the invasion of Ireland and could potentially provide a beachhead for future operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache {{territory and}} reported that the Kejache towns were situated in easily <b>defensible</b> locations and were often fortified. One of these was built on a rocky outcrop near a lake and a river that fed into it. The town was fortified with a wooden palisade and {{was surrounded by a}} moat. Cortés reported that the town of Tiac was even larger and was fortified with walls, watchtowers and earthworks; the town itself was divided into three individually fortified districts. Tiac was said to have been at war with the unnamed smaller town. The Kejache claimed that their towns were fortified against the attacks of their aggressive Itza neighbours.|$|E
