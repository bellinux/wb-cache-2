We consider what prototypes are, what the prototyping process is, and how software development approaches adopt prototyping for exploration, experiment or evolution.

40|$|International audiencePhotovoltaic {{cells are}} {{characterized}} via a static relationship that describes their current-voltage relationship. This relationship {{is a complicated}} implicit algebraic equation that depends, in a nonlinear way, on two critical uncertain parameters: temperature and solar irradiance. The efficient operation of the panel relies on the knowledge of these key parameters. While it is technologically feasible to measure the former, a sensor for the latter is usually expensive and difficult to calibrate. In this paper, we propose a globally convergent estimator for solar irradiance which is developed using the principles of immersion and invariance recently reported in the control literature. To design the estimator, a suitable reparameterization of the current-voltage characteristic, which effectively exhibits a monotonic behavior, is introduced. The approach is validated through detailed computer simulations and <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping</b> using real outdoor measurements...|$|E
40|$|Transfer chutes {{represent}} a critical element in any bulk solids handling operation. The design of these chutes {{is based on}} a combination of past experience, <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping,</b> empirical rules and unpublished in-house models. Whilst these methods have served industry well, there remains a lack of understanding of the flow behaviour of complex bulk solids, particularly around components that exhibit sharp geometlic changes, and under dynamic flow conditions. Sustained capacity is critical to bulk handling operations and hence there is strong motivation for an improved predictive capability, This paper focuses on the application of three-dimensional DEM to the simulation of coal flow through industrial scale chutes. Models are presented to demonstrate the effect of chute friction and inter-particle propel 1 ies on capacity. The effect of flow centralisers on belt loading is also examined...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Donald Schön {{described}} designing as a re fl ective {{conversation with}} the materials of a situation, and proposed a phenomenological account of designing. Ray McCall proposed an extension and generalization of Schön’s model that more easily allows for computer support. Building {{on the work of}} Schön and McCall, this chapter adopts an evolutionary perspective on the design process and proposes “predecessor artifacts ” as a new concept for understanding the re fl ective conversation with design materials. Predecessor artifacts emerge in creative activities and they encapsulate design history. The concept is applied to software design. Based on a literature survey, <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping,</b> and empirical analyses in two user organizations, three types of predecessor artifacts are explored: (1) reusable design material, (2) alternative functionality, and (3) reusable design concepts. A goal with PAs is to understand design reuse in software applications from a phenomenological viewpoint...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal design {{process for the}} steering system of a forklift vehicle. An efficient procedure for minimizing the engine-induced idle vibration is developed in this study. Reciprocating unbalance and gas pressure torque as two major sources of engine excitation are studied. Using the field vibration tests and FEM analysis, the cause and characteristics of steering system’s idle vibration are recognized. So as to distribute the characteristic modes based on the optimization strategy, global sensitivity analysis of the main parameters is also carried out to achieve the optimal combination of the optimization factors. Based on all analysis above, some structure modifications for optimization are presented to control the idle vibration. The effectiveness and rationality of the improvements are also verified through <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping</b> testing. This study also {{makes it possible to}} provide a design guideline using CAE (computer aided engineering) analysis for some other objects...|$|E

40|$|The issue how {{to achieve}} a principled {{transition}} from knowledge acquisition to implementation such that a knowledge-based system (kbs) of high quality results is rarely discussed in the knowledge engineering literature. Here, this topic is addressed {{in the context of}} the design phase of the MIKE approach to kbs development. In MIKE, design decisions are motivated primarily by non-functional requirements. Due to the iterative nature of the design process, design decisions have to be evaluated early. In MIKE, this can be achieved by <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping,</b> but also by quantitative measures associated to requirements. Furthermore, in order to improve transparency and traceability, the description of the design includes a record of the design decisions and their motivation in addition to a description of the artefact.

40|$|Measuring solar {{irradiance}} allows for direct maximization of the efficiency in photovoltaic power plants. However, devices for {{solar irradiance}} sensing, such as pyranometers and pyrheliometers, are expensive {{and difficult to}} calibrate and thus seldom utilized in photovoltaic power plants. Indirect methods are instead implemented {{in order to maximize}} efficiency. This paper proposes a novel approach for solar irradiance measurement based on neural networks, which may, in turn, be used to maximize efficiency directly. An initial estimate suggests the cost of the sensor proposed herein may be price competitive with other inexpensive solutions available in the market, making the device a good candidate for large deployment in photovoltaic power plants. The proposed sensor is implemented through a photovoltaic cell, a temperature sensor, and a low– cost microcontroller. The use of a microcontroller allows for easy calibration, updates, and enhancement by simply adding code libraries. Furthermore, it can be interfaced via standard communication means with other control devices; integrated into control schemes; and remote–controlled through its embedded web server. The proposed approach is validated through <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping</b> and compared against a commercial device...|$|E
40|$|OAK B 204 Continuous-Wave Radar to Detect Defects Within Heat Exchangers and Steam Generator Tubes; Revised September 3, 2003. A {{major cause}} of {{failures}} in heat exchangers and steam generators in nuclear power plants is degradation of the tubes within them. The tube failure is often caused {{by the development of}} cracks that begin on the outer surface of the tube and propagate both inwards and laterally. A new technique was researched for detection of defects using a continuous-wave radar method within metal tubing. The technique is 100 % volumetric, and may find smaller defects, more rapidly, and less expensively than present methods. The project described in this report was a joint development effort between Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) and New Mexico State University (NMSU) funded by the US Department of Energy. The goal of the project was to research, design, and develop a new concept utilizing a continuous wave radar to detect defects inside metallic tubes and in particular nuclear plant steam generator tubing. The project was divided into four parallel tracks: computational modeling, <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping,</b> thermo-mechanical design, and signal detection and analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the context}} of {{innovation}} management organizations face two challenges: they must provide motivation for users to participate and they must inspire users to make creative contributions. One activity, which leads to motivation as well as creative outcome, is play. The paper aims to clarify if playing a multiplayer online game can motivate to generate creative ideas for real-world problems. Using ready-made software (“SCVNGR”) and adopting the method of <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping,</b> we therefore developed a multiplayer “online ideation game ” (OIG). The OIG was launched as a pilot at a large German university to generate new ideas for improving its services and infrastructure. 77 students {{took part in the}} game, although no extrinsic rewards (like marks or monetary compensation) were promised or given. 34 players were surveyed using an online questionnaire. To evaluate the creativity of ideas experts were interviewed using consensual assessment technique. Four motivational factors could be extracted, which explain why individuals played the game: a) receiving feedback and sense of accomplishment, b) dissatisfaction with existing services, c) learning and d) achievement. Results also indicate that players were highly involved and learning is the main driver of players ’ involvement. Overall, experts rated creativity of the ideas generated by the players as high. ...|$|E

An <b>experimental</b> <b>prototyping</b> systems currently in research is the Computer Aided Prototyping System (CAPS) managed under the Computer Science department of the Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, California. This thesis determines the qualitative value which may be realized by applying the Computer-Aided Prototyping Systems (CAPS) to {{the initial stages of}} the acquisition process for a software system on the scale of a prototype model, then projecting the results to a real-time distributed computer system. As a prelude to this analysis, information is presented concerning how the acquisition process is currently managed within DoD and what role prototyping plays within that process. An introduction to the CAPS is then given, along with a description of its capabilities obtained through personal examination of the system. Following this walkthrough of the CAPS, software acquisition is discussed further, including an analysis of its major obstacles and where a CAPS could best be used within the acquisition cycle. This thesis concludes with a cost analysis and results from a comparison of performing a requirements analysis and feasibility study with and without a CAPS. [URL] United States Air Forc...|$|E
