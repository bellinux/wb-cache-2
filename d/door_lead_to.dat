50|$|Theodosia Ford and {{her four}} {{children}} occupied {{two of the four}} downstairs bedrooms and reserved the kitchen for her own personal use. Her daughter, Elizabeth Ford, who was 12 when Washington stayed at the mansion, stayed in her mother's room. During the winter months of 1779 to 1780 she read and learned a total of 25 stitches. Theodosia's boys stayed in another room downstairs. The room featured two doors. One <b>door</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the servants' side of the house above the pantry and the other <b>door</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> the center hall.

50|$|Soon {{after the}} mist develops, {{something}} plugs the store generator's exhaust vent. When a young bag boy named Norm steps outside {{to fix the}} problem, he is pulled into the mist by a swarm of tentacles. David and Ollie Weeks, the store's assistant manager, witness Norm's death and try to convince the remaining survivors of the danger lurking outside. Norton and {{a small group of}} others refuse to believe, accusing David of lying. They venture out into the mist to seek help, where they are killed by a huge, unseen creature. This, along with a deadly incursion into the store by a pterosaur-like creature and a disastrous expedition to the pharmacy next <b>door,</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> paranoia and panic consuming the remaining survivors. This spiraling breakdown leads to the rise to power of a religious zealot named Mrs. Carmody, who convinces most of the remaining survivors that these events fulfill the biblical prophecy of the end time, and that a human sacrifice must be made to save them from God's wrath.|$|E
5000|$|In Labyrinth, the protagonist's {{solution}} is to ask: [...] "Answer yes or no. Would he tell me that this <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the castle?". As the question is about the other persons response, it will either result in a lie about the other truthfully saying which <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> freedom or a truth about the other lying about which <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> freedom. Either way, the response will be {{the opposite of what}} a truthful person would say had you asked them whether their <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> freedom.|$|R

5000|$|The puzzle {{is based}} on Knights and Knaves puzzles. One setting for this puzzle is a fictional island {{inhabited}} only by knights and knaves, where knights always {{tell the truth and}} knaves always lie. A visitor to the island must ask a number of yes/no questions in order to discover what he needs to know (the specifics of which vary between different versions of the puzzle). One version of these puzzles was popularized by a scene in the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth. There are two doors with two guards. One guard lies and one guard does not. One <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the castle and the other <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> 'certain death'. The puzzle is to find out which <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the castle by asking one of the guards one question. In the movie, the protagonist Sarah, does this by asking, [...] "Would he other guard tell me that this <b>door</b> <b>leads</b> <b>to</b> the castle?" ...|$|R
