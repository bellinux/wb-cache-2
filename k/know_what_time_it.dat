5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} {{was the idea of}} a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E

500|$|Mehldau often plays a {{separate}} melody with each hand, {{and one of}} the central features of his music is the playing of improvised counterpoint. He stated in 2002 that some of the content of his playing is affected by the music that he has recently been listening to: [...] "If I'm digging a Brahms intermezzo that'll find its way in. If it's McCoy Tyner, there'll be more of that." [...] Mehldau's performances often employ unusual rhythmic meters; for example, he plays his arrangement of [...] "All the Things You Are" [...] on Art of the Trio 4 in 7/4 time, and [...] "I Didn't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> <b>It</b> Was" [...] on Art of the Trio 1 in 5/4. He developed this ability over a period of around a year, with the help of Rossy. Mehldau is able to reach tenth and eleventh intervals on the piano.|$|E

500|$|In 1957 Costa {{was again}} leader, {{recording}} Eddie Costa Quintet with Woods, Art Farmer, Teddy Kotick, and Paul Motian. Their repertoire featured interpretations of [...] "I Didn't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> <b>It</b> Was" [...] and Dave Brubeck's recent composition [...] "In Your Own Sweet Way"; the latter focused on Costa's vibes and Farmer's muted trumpet, with Woods switching from his usual alto saxophone to the piano. The Billboard review was positive, calling it [...] "a first rate jazz set" [...] on which [...] "Costa swings as ever on piano". A trio {{appearance at the}} 1957 Newport Jazz Festival also brought Costa greater attention. Some of his playing at the festival – as a trio with Ernie Furtado (bass) and Al Beldini (drums), and as a quintet {{with the addition of}} Rolf Kühn and Dick Johnson – was released later in 1957 as part of a Verve album. Billboard commented that [...] "Costa [...] will attract many new endorsers with the musicianship displayed".|$|E
500|$|Before his {{departure}} from Jive, Big Boi planned {{to release the}} album in 2008. In January 2010, he announced a March 23 release through his Twitter account. In April, its release was pushed back to July 6 in the United States. However, in June, Jive attempted to block its release, claiming that Def Jam could not issue songs featuring both Big Boi and André 3000, as OutKast was represented as a duo by the former label. In a June 7 interview for GQ, Big Boi responded to a question concerning the blocking of his recordings with André 3000 for Sir Lucious Left Foot, stating [...] "Au contraire! They cannot block it. Au contraire. Either they're {{going to do it}} the right way, or they're going to do it my way... The fans' thirst will be quenched. You know, I'm no stranger to that Internet, baby. So you already <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> is. The thirst of the fans will be quenched". On June 10, his website released the album's track listing, which excluded tracks featuring André 3000. Of his songs with André 3000, he told GQ, [...] "We're gonna keep one of them for the next OutKast record".|$|E

The album included a number of pop-rock songs – [...] "Does Anybody Really <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> <b>It</b> Is?", [...] "Beginnings", [...] "Questions 67 and 68", and [...] "I'm a Man" [...] – which were later released as singles.

It should be noted that almost immediately after making this statement, Kramer overslept, causing an acquaintance to nearly miss running in the New York City marathon.

2500|$|In 1958, Patchen's Selected Poems and {{his book}} When We Were Here Together {{received}} significant praise from the reviewer Frederick Eckman in Poetry magazine.

He called When We Were Here Together [...] "a beautiful book, inside and out." [...] However, in the very same issue of Poetry, the reviewer Robert Beum wrote a brief, negative review of Patchen's book Hurrah for Anything, calling it dull and clichéd.|$|E
2500|$|A longstanding {{desire of}} Parker's was to perform {{with a string}} section. He was a keen student of {{classical}} music, and contemporaries reported he was most interested in the music and formal innovations of Igor Stravinsky and longed {{to engage in a}} project akin to what later became known as Third Stream, a new kind of music, incorporating both jazz and classical elements as opposed to merely incorporating a string section into performance of jazz standards. On November 30, 1949, Norman Granz arranged for Parker to record an album of ballads with a mixed group of jazz and chamber orchestra musicians. Six master takes from this session comprised the album Charlie Parker with Strings: [...] "Just Friends", [...] "Everything Happens to Me", [...] "April in Paris", [...] "Summertime", [...] "I Didn't <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>Time</b> <b>It</b> Was", and [...] "If I Should Lose You".|$|E

50|$|This early {{version of}} Jack Reacher will seem {{significantly}} more vulnerable, fallible and emotional to those reading the series out of sequence. For example, though killing quite a few human beings, Reacher makes a great effort to spare dogs who were set on him by the militia. The character thus appears to evolve into a more powerful, fearsome and efficient killing machine as he ages. Another noticeable idiosyncrasy in these early novels {{is that one of}} the very few possessions Reacher has is a wrist watch he kept after leaving the Army. In later novels, it is often noted that Reacher always <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> is in his head, and has no need for a watch.|$|R

5000|$|The English word clock {{comes from}} an Old French word for [...] "bell," [...] for the {{striking}} feature of early clocks was a greater concern than their dials. Shakespeare's Sonnet XII begins, [...] "When I do count the clock that tells the time." [...] Even after {{the introduction of the}} clock face, clocks were costly, and found mostly in the homes of aristocrats. The vast majority of urban dwellers had to rely on clock towers, and outside the sight of their dials or the sound of their bells, clock time held no sway. Clock towers did define the time of day, at least for those who could hear and see them.

The fight was scheduled for 10 rounds. In front of a pro Algieri 7,628 crowd, Spence became the first boxer to stop Algieri inside the distance. Spence did what Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan could not do before him. This was also a seventh straight knockout. After the bout Spence claimed he was the mandatory for Kell Brook's IBF World title saying [...] "Kell Brook <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> is. We got to get in the ring and fight.". IBF later stated that Spence must have a final eliminator before he is declared mandatory challenger. The end came when Spence delivered a left hook to Algieri’s face. The hard shot sent Algieri straight to the canvas and referee Benjy Esteves didn’t hesitate to stop the fight. For the fight, Spence earned $225,000 whilst Algieri earned $325,000. CompuBox punch statistics showed that Spence landed 96 of 311 punches (31%), whereas Algieri landed 36 of 114 thrown (32%). The fight averaged 1.482 million viewers on NBC.|$|R

"You see," [...] said he, in a jocular tone, {{for it was}} a most unusually severe {{accident}} indeed that could drive {{the fun out of}} our little friend--"you see, after I lost sight of Jack, I took a leaf out of the hare's book, and doubled on my course. This brought me, unhappily, to the banks of the river, where I came upon one of the pitfalls that are made by the niggers here to catch wild beasts, and in I went. I kept hold of the surface boughs, however, scrambled out again, and pushed on. But I had not gone ten yards when the ground began to crackle and sink. I made a desperate bound to clear it, but my foot caught in a branch, and down I went head foremost into the pit. And that's the whole of my story. How long I remained there I know not. If I had <b>known</b> <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was when I dived in, and you were to tell me what o'clock it is now, we might arrive at a knowledge of the time I have spent at the bottom of that hole.
