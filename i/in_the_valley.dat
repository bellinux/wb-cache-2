5|$|Most park {{visitors}} stay {{just for}} the day, and visit only those locations within Yosemite Valley that are easily accessible by automobile. There is a US$25-30 per automobile user fee to enter the park, depending on the season. Traffic congestion <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley</b> {{is a serious problem}} during peak season, in summer. A free shuttle bus system operates year-round <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>valley,</b> and park rangers encourage people to use this system since parking within the valley during the summer is often nearly impossible to find.|$|E
