"LoveGame" [...] was {{released}} as the album's third single in North America and Europe {{and the fourth}} single in Australia, New Zealand, and Sweden after [...] "Eh, Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say)". In the US it was sent to Contemporary hit radio (CHR) formats for airplay from May 12, 2009. The track initially had been planned as the third single release in the United Kingdom, but deeming its lyrics and music video potentially controversial, {{it was decided that}} [...] "Paparazzi" [...] would be released instead. [...] "LoveGame" [...] has received a number of remix treatments, one of which featured rocker Marilyn Manson in the vocals. Rolling Stone reported that the remix was conceived during Gaga's photoshoot with the magazine in May 2009, when Manson arrived at the set. The rocker was impressed by the shoot and wanted to collaborate with Gaga, saying that [...] "she's a great musician, she's a great singer, and she's laughing when she's <b>doing</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> same way that I am". In return, Gaga also lent vocals for a remix of a song from Manson's seventh studio album, The High End of Low.|$|E
500|$|Construction of the {{monument}} began in 1848 with the excavation of the site, the laying of the cornerstone on the prepared bed, and laying the original foundation around {{and on top of}} the cornerstone, before the construction of its massive walls began the next year. Even though slave labor is not mentioned, no paid laborers whatsoever are listed among the small paid labor force of 21 used to construct the foundation in 1848, which included 14 stonemasons and 2 stonecutters. In contrast, the maximum work force during the second phase was 170, including 100 stonecutters, with laborers second in number. Washington Monument Historian John Steele Gordon stated [...] "I can’t say for certain, but the stonemasonry was pretty highly skilled, so it’s unlikely that slaves would’ve been <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> stones were cut by stonecutters, which is highly skilled work; and the stones were hoisted by means of steam engines, so you’d need a skilled engineer and foreman for stuff like that. Tending the steam engine, building the cast-iron staircase inside — that wasn’t grunt work." [...] According to historian Jesse Holland, it is very likely that African-American slaves were among the construction workers, given that slavery prevailed in Washington and its surrounding states at that time, and slaves were commonly used in public and private construction.|$|E

After Guerrero and Tajiri lost the titles to Team Angle on the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, Guerrero turned on Tajiri, slamming his partner through the windshield of his low-rider truck.

Christian recounted in 2014: [...] "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and he helped me shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." [...] They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets.

40|$|In {{preparation}} for this interview I watched the documentary (that 2 ̆ 7 s what <b>the</b> producers call <b>it,</b> anyway) 2 ̆ 2 Loose Change 9 / 11 : An American Coup. 2 ̆ 2 Of course it 2 ̆ 7 s absolutely loony. In fact, it 2 ̆ 7 s so loony that I {{began to wonder if}} the director, Dylan Avery, wasn 2 ̆ 7 t having us on. It 2 ̆ 7 s hard to tell whether 2 ̆ 2 Loose Change 2 ̆ 2 is a you 2 ̆ 7 ve-gotta-hear-this conspiracy theory or a tongue-firmly-in-cheek parody of a conspiracy theory. Maybe I 2 ̆ 7 m just jaded, but it seems to me—particularly after reading David Aaronovitch 2 ̆ 7 s excellent book Voodoo Histories: The Role of Conspiracy Theory in the Shaping of Modern History (Penguin, 2010) —that we 2 ̆ 7 ve heard all this before: Satan 2 ̆ 7 s children <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Freemasons <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Illuminati <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Jews <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> Commies <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Mafia <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> John Birch Society <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Trilateral Commission <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Bilderberg Group <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> <b>the</b> Club of Rome <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> Skull and Bones <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> PNAC <b>did</b> <b>it,</b> and everyone else has done 2 ̆ 2 it 2 ̆ 2 whatever 2 ̆ 2 it 2 ̆ 2 happens to be.

You 2 ̆ 7 d think we 2 ̆ 7 d have learned by now not to believe that 2 ̆ 2 dark, hidden forces 2 ̆ 2 are behind everything because, well, they demonstrably aren 2 ̆ 7 t. But people want to believe these things, particularly when they seem to explain why something distrubing—say, the collapse of Germany in WWI, the high costs of rapid industrialization in the USSR in the 1930 s, or America 2 ̆ 7 s evident lack of {{preparation for}} 9 / 11 —wasn 2 ̆ 7 t 2 ̆ 2 our 2 ̆ 2 fault, but rather someone else 2 ̆ 7 s. I would like to think that David 2 ̆ 7 s wonderful book will put an end to loopy conspiracy theories so that we can get on with the important business of fixing things that matter. It probably won 2 ̆ 7 t, but nonetheless Voodoo History is certainly a fine step in that direction and I applaud David for writing it (and you for reading it) ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the album}} and two {{supporting}} tours, Schuldiner put Death aside to pursue Control Denied with Christy and Hamm. Clendenin was dropped {{in favor of}} Steve Di Giorgio, who was once again available, and an underground power metal singer named Tim Aymar. Though the line-up and writing style was largely the same, Schuldiner created Control Denied {{in large part because}} he was displeased with the harsher vocals for Death. However, rather than betray what the band Death meant and sounded like to the fans, he opted to create a new band: [...] "For me, it {{is just a matter of}} evolving, <b>doing</b> <b>it</b> <b>the</b> right way. I didn't put out a Death record with this stuff on it. I made the right choice and changed the name of the band. I tried to do everything the right way." [...] As Schuldiner finished Control Denied's debut album, he was diagnosed with brain cancer, forcing the band to scrap plans for a U.S. and Canadian tour. As he worked on the second release, Schuldiner's condition improved, but the tumor left him in a weakened, vulnerable state. He contracted pneumonia and was placed in a hospital. On December 13, 2001, Schuldiner was released and returned home an hour later, where he died. His death was exactly three years after Death's final concert.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} the 1920s, it was {{proposed}} to introduce a large pelagic predator such as the Nile perch to improve the fisheries in the lake. At {{the same time it}} was warned that this could present a serious danger to the native fish species and required extensive research into possible ecological effects before done. These warnings primarily concerned the native tilapia O. esculentus, as the smaller haplochromine cichlids (despite playing an important role in local fisheries) were regarded as [...] "thrash fish" [...] or even a vermin by the British colonial authorities. In the following decades, the pressure to introduce the Nile perch continued, as did warnings about the possible effects of <b>doing</b> <b>it.</b> <b>The</b> first introduction of Nile perch to the region, done by the Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (then part of the British Colonial rule) and local African fish guards, happened upstream of Murchison Falls directly after the completion of the Owen Falls Dam in 1954. This allowed it to spread to Lake Kyoga where additional Nile perch were released in 1955, but not Victoria itself. Scientists argued that further introduction should wait until research showed the effect of the introduction in Kyoga, but by the late 1950s, Nile perch began being caught in Lake Victoria. As the species was already present, there were few objections when more Nile perch were transferred to Victoria to further bolster the stock in 1962—63. The origin of the first Victoria introductions in the 1950s is not entirely clear and indisputable evidence is lacking. Uganda Game and Fisheries Department (UGFD) officials denied that they were involved, but circumstancial evidence suggests otherwise and local Africans employed by UGFD have said that they introduced the species in 1954—55 under the directive of senior officials. UGFD officials argued that Nile perch must have spread to Lake Victoria by themselves by passing through the Owen Falls Dam when shut down for maintenance, but this is considered highly unlikely by many scientists. The Nile perch had spread throughout the lake by 1970. Initially the population of the Nile perch was relatively low, but a drastic increase happened, peaking in the 1980s, followed by a decline starting in the 1990s.|$|E
