In {{the aftermath of the}} global financial crisis, the market share of US <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> is increasing, while that of their European counterparts is declining. We present evidence that US <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> {{are on the verge of}} taking over pole position in European <b>investment</b> <b>banking.</b> Meanwhile, since 2015, Chinese <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> have overtaken American and European <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> in the Asia-Pacific market. Credit rating agencies and <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> are the gatekeepers of the capital markets. The European supervisory institutions can effectively supervise the European operations of these US-managed players. On the political side, we suggest that the European Commission should continue to view its, albeit declining, banking industry as a strategic sector. The Commission, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England should jointly develop a strategic agenda for the EU-US Regulatory Dialogue. Finally, corporates rely on <b>investment</b> <b>banks</b> to issue new securities. We recommend that the big European corporates should cherish the (few) remaining European <b>investment</b> <b>banks,</b> by giving them at least one place in otherwise US- dominated banking syndicates. That could help to avoid complete dependence on US <b>investment</b> <b>banks...</b>|$|R
