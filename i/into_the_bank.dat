5|$|Hugh Mason {{was born}} in Stalybridge, Cheshire, on 11May 1817 and christened there. He was the {{youngest}} of four children of Thomas Mason, a former textile manager, and Mary, the daughter of John Holden, Esq. The family had moved to Stalybridge from Derbyshire in 1776. After working as the manager of a mill in Ashton-under-Lyne, Thomas established his own business in 1815 in partnership with James Booth and Edward Hulton at Currier Slacks Mill in the town. Rapid growth in their enterprise saw them expand <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> Mill and Royal George Mills in the 1820s and Albion Mill in the 1830s. At the age of 10, Hugh was working in the mill, and his education consisted of attending Methodist Sunday schools in Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge and spending three years at a private school in Ashton-under-Lyne.|$|E
5|$|From {{an early}} period, the Court was also {{assisted}} by two Registrars, who enrolled decrees {{of the court}} and orders; their books documented the legal precedent set by the court. At the same time, two Examiners were appointed to assist the Master of the Rolls in examining witnesses. The positions were regularly and openly sold by the Master of the Rolls and Lord Chancellor– Masters in Chancery went for £6,000 in 1625. To avoid the sale of offices, and due to the corruption of many court officials, an Act was passed that year requiring that fees be paid directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of England, and creating an Accountant-General to oversee the financial aspects of the court. In 1813 the first Vice-Chancellor was appointed {{to deal with the}} increasing number of cases submitted to the Court. With the backlog growing larger, two more were appointed in 1841 under a second Act of Parliament, although this provided for two life appointments, not two new positions; when the new Vice-Chancellors died, there could be no replacements. With the dissolution of the Court in 1873, the position of Vice-Chancellor ceased to exist.|$|E

25|$|Less than 24 {{hours after}} {{the signing of the}} decree, on the morning of September 14, 1936, members of the Spanish Carabineers and various militiamen, sent by the Ministry of Finance, walked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of Spain. The {{appropriation}} operation was led by the Treasury Director-General and future Minister of Finance under the government of Juan Negrín, Francisco Méndez Aspe. He was accompanied by Captain Julio López Masegosa and 50 or 60 metallurgists and locksmiths.|$|E
25|$|The Paymaster General Act 1782 {{ended the}} post as a lucrative sinecure. Previously, Paymasters {{had been able}} to draw on money from HM Treasury at their discretion. Now they were {{required}} to put the money they had requested to withdraw from the Treasury <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bank</b> of England, from where it was to be withdrawn for specific purposes. The Treasury would receive monthly statements of the Paymaster's balance at the Bank. This act was repealed by Shelburne's administration, but the act that replaced it repeated verbatim almost the whole text of the Burke Act.|$|E

25|$|On 2 July 1816 Méduse {{ran into}} {{increasingly}} shallow water, both Chaumareys and Richefort ignoring signs such as white breakers and mud in the water. Eventually, Lieutenant Maudet {{took it upon}} himself to start taking soundings off the bow, and, measuring only 18 fathoms (ca. 32 metres), warned his captain. Realising the danger at last, Chaumareys ordered the ship brought up into the wind, but it was too late, and Méduse ran aground 50 kilometres off the coast. The accident occurred at a spring high tide, which made it difficult to re-float the frigate. The captain refused to jettison the 14 three-tonne cannons and so the ship settled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hepzibah Smith, {{who owned}} the cup, was a distant {{descendant}} of Helga Hufflepuff. Riddle killed Smith, stole the cup, then framed her house elf Hokey for the crime. Voldemort entrusted the cup to Bellatrix Lestrange, who kept it protected in her vault at Gringotts Bank, a place to which Harry guessed a once penniless Voldemort would have always coveted a connection. Additional protective spells, including Gemino (multiply curse) and Flagrante (fire curse), were used to protect {{the contents of the}} vault. Harry, Ron and Hermione, with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix, broke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> and stole the cup. Hermione later destroyed the Horcrux using a fang from the remains of the Basilisk still in the Chamber of Secrets.|$|E
25|$|It {{was agreed}} before the series that {{one half of}} total gate {{receipts}} would be distributed among the players, with the victors receiving the spoils on a winner-takes-all basis. All receipts were put <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> in a joint account held by the team owners, with no disbursal of funds to take place until one team had won a majority of games in the 7-game series. A similar winner-takes-all allocation of {{the other half of}} the proceeds was made by the respective teams' owners. Total receipts for the series were $13,920.10, from which was first deducted the $100 salaries of the umpires and team travel expenses. The remaining funds were split in half between Browns players and team owner Chris Von der Ahe, with each player taking home slightly over $500.|$|E

25|$|The {{need for}} secure storage {{stretches}} {{far back in}} time. The earliest known locks {{were made by the}} Egyptians. Ancient Romans used a more sophisticated locking system, called warded locks. Warded locks had special notches and grooves that made picking them more difficult. Lock technology advanced independently in ancient India, Russia, and China, where the combination lock is thought to have originated. In the United States, most banks relied on small iron safes fitted with a key lock up until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century. After the Gold Rush of 1849, unsuccessful prospectors turned to robbing banks. The prospectors would often break <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> using a pickax and hammer. The safe was usually small enough that the thief could get it out a window, and take it to a secluded spot to break it open.|$|E
25|$|All of the Gremlins {{are killed}} except Stripe, who escapes {{to a local}} YMCA and jumps into a {{swimming}} pool, spawning an army of gremlins who wreak chaos around Kingston Falls. Billy tries to warn the police, but they don’t believe him. Many people are injured or outright killed by the gremlins' rampage, including Mrs. Deagle, who is launched {{out of her house}} on a stair lift that has been sabotaged by the creatures. At the local bar, the gremlins have fun until the barmaid Kate Beringer, Billy’s girlfriend, flashes them with a camera and escapes <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> with Billy and Gizmo. While hiding, she reveals her father died in a chimney while dressed as Santa Claus. Billy and Kate discover the town has fallen silent and the Gremlins are watching Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in the local theater. They set off an explosion, killing all the Gremlins except Stripe.|$|E
500|$|During the Second World War, part of {{the city}} walls near the Dane John Gardens were turned into an {{ammunition}} depot, dug <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> of the wall. German bombing campaigns in 1942 caused extensive damage to Canterbury, including the city walls around Riding Gate. [...] The bomb damage provided fresh opportunities for archaeological investigation, however, and work by the Canterbury Excavation Committee began in 1944. This research disproved older theories about the shape of the Roman city walls, demonstrating that the Roman and medieval defences formed an identical circuit.|$|E

500|$|A {{new feature}} called [...] "Big Bank" [...] was added {{for the second}} season.

Once the Big Bank was claimed by a contestant, it was reset to $3,000.|$|E

At dinner, Randy explains to Stan {{that the economy is}} failing due to people spending their money on luxuries, and ironically, he continues his tirade while making himself a margarita in a Margaritaville-brand mixer, the noise of which drowns out his voice for part of the tirade.|$|E
500|$|Muskrats {{normally}} live {{in groups}} {{consisting of a}} male and female pair and their young. During the spring, they often fight with other muskrats over territory and potential mates. Many are injured or killed in these fights. Muskrat families build nests to protect themselves and their young from cold and predators. In streams, ponds, or lakes, muskrats burrow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> with an underwater entrance. These entrances are [...] wide. [...] In marshes, push-ups are constructed from vegetation and mud. These push-ups are up to [...] in height. In snowy areas, they keep the openings to their push-ups closed by plugging them with vegetation, which they replace every day. Some muskrat push-ups are swept away in spring floods {{and have to be}} replaced each year. Muskrats also build feeding platforms in wetlands. They help maintain open areas in marshes, which helps to provide habitat for aquatic birds.|$|E
