25|$|For much of {{his career}} Flew was known as a strong {{advocate}} of atheism, arguing that one should presuppose atheism until empirical evidence of a God surfaces. He also criticised the idea of life after death, the free will defence to the problem of evil, and the meaningfulness of the concept of God. In 2003 {{he was one of the}} signatories of the Humanist Manifesto III. However, in 2004 he stated an allegiance to deism, more specifically a belief in the Aristotelian God. He stated that in keeping his lifelong commitment to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> evidence leads, he now believed in the existence of a God.|$|E
25|$|Then {{there was}} the debate within the Nader {{campaign}} over where to travel in {{the waning days of}} the campaign. Some Nader advisers urged him to spend his time in uncontested states such as New York and California. These states – where liberals and leftists could entertain the thought of voting Nader without fear of aiding Bush – offered the richest harvest of potential votes. But, Martin writes, Nader – who emerges from this account as the house radical of his own campaign – insisted on spending {{the final days of the}} campaign on a whirlwind tour of battleground states such as Pennsylvania and Florida. In other words, he chose to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> votes were scarcest, jeopardizing his own chances of winning 5 percent of the vote, which he needed to gain federal funds in 2004.|$|E

I always like to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

2500|$|On April 11, 1873, {{after months}} of false starts and aborted meetings, Canby went to another parley, unarmed and with some hope of final resolution.

2500|$|The New Girl {{production}} {{offices are}} on the Fox lot in Los Angeles, next to those of Homeland. New Girl had 11 writers during its first season and 15 during the second season, half of them male. Stories are developed in a collaborative effort and are aimed at viewers of all genders. The first season had no planned story arcs, but focused on setting up the characters, while the second season was to show different sides of the characters. Overarching storylines usually culminate at a season's end; the actors are generally not told the ending. Meriwether said the writers did not [...] "have a lot of plans. I think we really just to try to <b>go</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> show wants to go." [...] The writers challenge themselves to create new stories and to change the show's dynamics to keep things fresh, while aiming to be [...] "as emotionally real as possible" [...] with [...] "Every story having to feel like it was grounded in some emotional arc as opposed to going from the joke into the story." [...] As the show's jokes rely on the actors' performance instead of perfectly constructed punch lines, Meriwether looks for the actors' strengths before writing. The A story generally revolves around Jess and has an emotional core. Still, Meriwether sees the show as an ensemble about friendship with [...] "everybody having their own stories and people being interested {{in all of the}} characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{planned to be}} developed simultaneously with the previous Zero Escape game, Virtue's Last Reward, with the two games being [...] "paired as a set", and with Virtue's Last Reward having a cliffhanger ending. With Zero Time Dilemma, Uchikoshi intended to resolve all mysteries left from the previous game, {{as well as all}} introduced in the third, while also attempting to make the story enjoyable for first-time players. This was used as a [...] "basic framework" [...] to write the story within. In addition to figuring out how to explain the mysteries while avoiding contradictions with Virtue's Last Reward, they added side stories to the narrative to give it [...] "a little extra punch". They also took the time-travel ability some characters in Virtue's Last Reward have into consideration, as it opened up for more narrative possibilities. Uchikoshi worked with two other writers; the three helped each other come up with ideas and figure out the best ways to make the story work. When coming up with the story, he knew from the start that he wanted Sigma, Phi and Diana to be on one team, and Akane on another; this left open slots in the teams, which were filled with other characters as story development progressed. The script took one year to write. While Uchikoshi had already had an idea for the setting and events of Zero Time Dilemma when writing Virtue's Last Reward, the game structure changed when the time came to implement it. One reason was that characters [...] "take on {{a life of their own}} and make their own decisions" [...] when he writes from their point of view, and that characters might pull the story in a different direction than he had originally planned; most of the time, he would let the story <b>go</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> characters want to go rather than forcing it to follow his original plans, leading to changes in story and structure. The budget partly dictated the game's setting in an enclosed space as it required few art assets to develop.|$|E
