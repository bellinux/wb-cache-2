50|$|The NASA program hosted {{technical}} conferences, inviting international partners. NASA even helped refurbish {{and operate}} the Danish three-bladed <b>Gedser</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> between 1977 and 1979, {{so that its}} operation and characteristics could be studied {{as a model for}} larger units. This 1957 unit designed by Johannes Juul generated 200 kW for 11 years, and used a three-bladed upwind rotor with a lattice tower and blades supported partly by internal guy wires. The effort produce research data on its aerodynamic, electrical, and mechanical characteristics. An important result of this effort was the development of an engineering design model used by the industry for passive power control.|$|E
50|$|As a 17-year-old, Johannes Juul (1887-1969) {{had studied}} wind {{electricity}} applications under Poul la Cour at Askov Højskole, a folk high school, in 1904. In the early 1950s, he built two smaller alternating current turbines which operated at Vester Egesborg near Næstved {{and on the}} island of Bogø. His three-bladed Gedser facility (1957) was Denmark's first large wind turbine. With a blade span of 24 m, it produced 200 kW of alternating current fed directly into the grid. Its electromechanical yawing, asynchronous generator, and the three stall-regulated blades with emergency aerodynamic tip brakes (these were invented by Juul) is a design that is still widely used in Denmark. Stall control was provided through an asynchronous generator. The turbine, which for many years was the world's largest, operated from 1957 to 1967 without maintenance, demonstrating incredible durability. In connection with NASA testing for the U.S. wind energy programme, it was refurbished in 1975 and brought back into operation. It continued to run for a few years, providing test data for the further development of wind turbines in Denmark. Over the course of its lifetime, the <b>Gedser</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generated 2.2 million kW-hours (7.9 TJ).|$|E
50|$|In 1962, the windpower {{committee}} {{stated that}} the Gedser turbine had operated well and {{had been able to}} withstand the pressures of use. It had also been able to produce power for the grid. In the meantime, power produced by coal-fired plants cost 8 to 9 Danish crowns per Gcal while power from the Gedser turbine was costing 19 crowns per Gcal. They therefore concluded {{there was no reason to}} continue to develop wind power. Juul, who at the time was 75 and had long been retired, totally disagreed explaining that the experimental turbine at Gedser was over-dimensioned and a compromise between various options with the result that it was only 40% efficient compared to the Bogø efficiency of 53%. Moreover, new materials such as plastics and fibreglass would bring increases in efficiency. Juul's visionary conclusions in 1962 turned out to be confirmed by subsequent progress in the Danish wind industry which 40 years later had become the greatest supplier of turbines to the world market. Today the <b>Gedser</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> referred to as the Danish design, is widely regarded as the basis on which new turbines were developed. The inventor was Johannes Juul.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} 50 <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> along the Westermeerdijk and 5 <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> on {{and near the}} Zuidermeerdijk. The new wind farm will generate significantly more energy than the current wind farm, thanks to improved <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> technology. One new onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> provides as much electricity as the current 50 <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> put together. It is planned to dismantle the existing <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> once the new farm is constructed.|$|R

With the increase of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> sales, the technology of wind power in China also gets improved. Stimulated {{by the development of}} offshore wind power, leading manufacturers of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> and component begin to develop large-scale turbines, Chinese manufacturers, such as Sinovel and Goldwind, also begin to develop large-scale <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> and many enterprises succeed in developing <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with and above 5  MW capacity. <b>Wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with three blades, horizontal axis, upwind, doubly-fed, variable pitch, variable speed, and constant frequency take the initiative in Chinese <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> market, which is also the main technique in global <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> market. Besides, Chinese manufacturers also focus on the development of MW-class <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with vertical axis, consistent with foreign leading manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The {{majority}} of small <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are traditional horizontal axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> but vertical axis <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are a growing type of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> in the small-wind market.

40|$|We study {{whether a}} <b>wind</b> {{augmented}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is effective {{for improving the}} efficiency of <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> or not.

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{reliability}} margin of offshore floating <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{need to be}} higher than that of onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> due to larger environmental loads and higher operational and maintenance costs for offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> compared to onshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> However rotor cyclic loads coupled with 6 DOFs motions of the substructure, amplifies the fatigue damage in offshore floating <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> In general a lower fatigue design factor is used for offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> compared to that of the stationary oil and gas platforms. This is because the consequence of a failure in offshore <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in general is lower than that of the offshore oil and gas platforms. In offshore floating <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> a sub-system fault in the electrical system and blade pitch angle controller also induces additional fatigue loading on the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> structure...|$|R
25|$|The <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{originally}} {{operated on}} a wind farm in Denmark, which resold the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> while repowering to newer, larger <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> The ground around the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> features an art display entitled Shadow and Light. The display includes walkways that align with the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine's</b> shadow at solar noon and two hours, eleven minutes after solar noon, respectively. On the vernal and autumnal equinoxes, the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine's</b> shadow also aligns with the walkways by length. Thus the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{functions as a}} large gnomon in an incomplete sundial. The display includes boxes of light bulbs encased in concrete {{on one side of}} a plaza around the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine's</b> base, representing the amount of electricity consumed by the average American household in a year.|$|R
40|$|The {{output power}} of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is {{determined}} by wind speed. The Output power can be adjusted by controlling the generator speed and pitch angle of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> When the <b>wind</b> speed below the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rated, the output power of generator can be maximized by controlling the generator speed at point of maximum power coefficient. When the wind speed above the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> rated, output power of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> will exceed the power generators rated. In this condition, the output power of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> needs to be regulated {{to conform to the}} generator power rate. Output power of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> can be regulated by adjusting the pitch angle of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> In this paper is developed the control strategies based intelligent control for controlling the generator speed and pitch angle of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> so the maximum output power tracking (MOPT) of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> can be obtained at any wind speed variations.

40|$|Abstract. With an {{increasing}} amount of wind energy installed, {{the behavior of}} <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> during grid disturbances {{becomes more and more}} important. This paper introduces the basic structures of doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and analyses the capability of low voltage ride through (LVRT) of the <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Finally this paper elaborates the principle and the procedures of the LVRT tests. The results of the tests show that: Doubly-fed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> and direct-drive permanent magnet synchronous <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are equipped with LVRT capability. The turbines are able to operate normally without disconnection and provide reactive power to support grid restoration during the dip.

30|$|Doubly-fed {{induction}} generator (DFIG) <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> {{has become the}} most widely used one in wind farms, since it has noticeable advantages, such as decoupled controls of active and reactive powers, and the use of a power converter with a rated power of 25  % of total system power [1]. The equivalent methods for <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> have been studied in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The method proposed in [2] is based on the dynamic simplification of each <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> and the model of an equivalent <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> is different from that of individual <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> The method proposed in [1, 3] divides the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> model into two parts: a simplified model is used to represent the mechanical part of each <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> and the generator parts of all <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are aggregated into an equivalent generation system. The method requires non-negligible computation burden by solving those differential equations representing the mechanical parts of <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, a {{simulation}} study on dynamic characteristics of <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generators is performed. The {{generation of electricity}} using <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is being recently spotlighted as a renewable way. The wind is an infinite primary energy source. Further, other environmental impacts of wind power are limited as well. Therefore, the <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generation itself has many advantages. However, when generators using <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> {{are connected to the}} conventional power system, the impact of the power system is {{different from that of the}} power system that consists of only synchronous generators, especially in dynamic characteristics. Therefore, it is essential to examine the characteristics of <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in order to ensure reliable <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generation in the power system containing <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> generators. In this paper, the dynamic characteristics of GE 1. 5 MW <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> are simulated by using PSS/E. In the simulation of GE 1. 5 MW <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> win...|$|R

40|$|Wind {{energy is}} a viable option to {{complement}} other types of pollution-free generation. In the early development of wind energy, the majority of <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> were operated at constant speed. Recently, the number of variable-speed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> installed in <b>wind</b> farms has increased and more <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> manufacturers are making variable-speed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> This paper covers the operation of variable-speed <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> with pitch control.
