5|$|Ambulance {{services}} that have historical origins {{such as the}} Order of St John, the Order of Malta Ambulance Corps and Malteser International often use the Maltese cross to identify their ambulances. This is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> countries such as Australia, where St. John Ambulance operate one state and one territory ambulance service, and all of Australia's other ambulance services use variations on a red Maltese cross.|$|E
5|$|Music {{and dance}} were popular {{entertainments}} {{for those who}} could afford them. Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular. In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia. The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> religious ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The diet {{typically}} {{includes a}} large variety of plants, and invertebrates and small mammals, {{as well as}} birds. The olive baboon eats leaves, grass, roots, bark, flowers, fruit, lichens, tubers, seeds, mushrooms, corms, and rhizomes. Corms and rhizomes are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> times of drought, because grass loses {{a great deal of}} its nutritional value. In dry, arid regions, such as the northeastern deserts, small invertebrates like insects, spiders, and scorpions fill out its diet.|$|E

5|$|Contemporary {{political}} sociology includes these areas of research, {{but it has}} been opened up to wider questions of power and politics. Today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another; the politics of who knows how and with what authority; and questions of how power is contested in social interactions {{in such a way as}} to bring about widespread cultural and social change. Such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively. The study of social movements and their effects has been <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> relation to these wider definitions of politics and power.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine as a {{manufactured}} {{medication is}} sold under the trade names Intropin, Dopastat, and Revimine, among others. It {{is on the}} World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is most commonly used as a stimulant drug {{in the treatment of}} severe low blood pressure, slow heart rate, and cardiac arrest. It is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> treating these in newborn infants. It is given intravenously. Since the half-life of dopamine in plasma is very short—approximately one minute in adults, two minutes in newborn infants and up to five minutes in preterm infants—it is usually given in a continuous intravenous drip rather than a single injection.|$|E
5|$|Comparative {{analyses}} between metagenomes {{can provide}} additional {{insight into the}} function of complex microbial communities and their role in host health. Pairwise or multiple comparisons between metagenomes can be made {{at the level of}} sequence composition (comparing GC-content or genome size), taxonomic diversity, or functional complement. Comparisons of population structure and phylogenetic diversity can be {{made on the basis of}} 16S and other phylogenetic marker genes, or—in the case of low-diversity communities—by genome reconstruction from the metagenomic dataset. Functional comparisons between metagenomes may be made by comparing sequences against reference databases such as COG or KEGG, and tabulating the abundance by category and evaluating any differences for statistical significance. This gene-centric approach emphasizes the functional complement of the community as a whole rather than taxonomic groups, and shows that the functional complements are analogous under similar environmental conditions. Consequently, metadata on the environmental context of the metagenomic sample is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> comparative analyses, as it provides researchers with the ability to study the effect of habitat upon community structure and function.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{significance}} of the organization, proposals have occasionally been discussed to relocate its headquarters. Complaints about its current location include diplomats who find it difficult to obtain visas from the United States and local residents complaining of inconveniences whenever the surrounding roads are closed due to visiting dignitaries as well as the high costs to the city. A telephone survey in 2001 found that 67% of respondents favor moving the United Nations headquarters out of the country. Countries critical of the USA, such as Iran and Russia, are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> questioning the current location of the United Nations. Arguing that the United States government could manipulate the work of the General Assembly through selective access to politicians from other countries, with the aim of having an advantage over rival countries. Due to accusations of espionage by the United States, the subject of the relocation of the UN headquarters was again discussed, this time for security reasons.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century {{existing}} Christian denominations {{were joined}} by other organisations, including the Brethren and Pentecostal churches. Although some denominations thrived, after World War II there was a steady overall decline in church attendance and resulting church closures for most denominations. In the 2011 census, 53.8% of the Scottish population identified as Christian (declining from 65.1% in 2001). The Church of Scotland is the largest religious grouping in Scotland, with 32.4% of the population. The Roman Catholic Church accounted for 15.9% {{of the population and}} is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> West Central Scotland and the Highlands. In recent years other religions have established a presence in Scotland, mainly through immigration and higher birth rates among ethnic minorities, with a small number of converts. Those with the most adherents in the 2011 census are Islam (1.4%, mainly among immigrants from South Asia), Hinduism (0.3%), Buddhism (0.2%) and Sikhism (0.2%). Other minority faiths include the Bahá'í Faith and small Neopagan groups. There are also various organisations which actively promote humanism and secularism, included within the 43.6% who either indicated no religion or did not state a religion in the 2011 census.|$|E
5|$|The sea {{and ships}} have been {{depicted}} in art ranging from simple drawings of dhows {{on the walls}} of huts in Lamu to seascapes by Joseph Turner. The genre of marine art became <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>in</b> the paintings of the Dutch Golden Age, with works showing the Dutch navy at the peak of its military prowess. Artists such as Jan Porcellis, Simon de Vlieger, Jan van de Cappelle, Hendrick Dubbels, Willem van de Velde the Elder and his son, Ludolf Bakhuizen and Reinier Nooms created maritime paintings {{in a wide variety of}} styles. The Japanese artist Katsushika Hokusai created colour prints of the moods of the sea, including The Great Wave off Kanagawa showing the destructive force of the sea at the same time as its ever-changing beauty. The 19th century Romantic artist Ivan Aivazovsky created some 6,000 paintings, the majority of which depict the sea.|$|E
