25|$|However, the {{violence}} of the second intifada and the political success of Hamas (a group dedicated to Israel's destruction) have convinced many Israelis that peace and negotiation are not possible and a two state system <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> Hardliners believe that Israel should annex all Palestinian territory, or at least all minus the Gaza Strip. Israelis view the peace process as hindered and near impossible due to terrorism on the part of Palestinians and do not trust Palestinian leadership to maintain control. In fact, Pedahzur goes as {{far as to say that}} suicide terrorism succeeded where peace negotiations failed in encouraging withdrawal by Israelis from cities in the West Bank. A common theme throughout the peace process has been a feeling that the Palestinians give too little in their peace offers.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, {{after the}} Jyllands-Posten Muhammad {{cartoons}} controversy, Harris wrote, [...] "The idea that Islam is a 'peaceful religion hijacked by extremists' {{is a dangerous}} fantasy—and {{it is now a}} particularly dangerous fantasy for Muslims to indulge. It {{is not at all clear}} how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world, but deluding ourselves with euphemisms <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> [...] It now appears to be a truism in foreign policy circles that real reform in the Muslim world cannot be imposed from the outside. [...] But it is important to recognize why this is so—it is so because the Muslim world is utterly deranged by its religious tribalism. In confronting the religious literalism and ignorance of the Muslim world, we must appreciate how terrifyingly isolated Muslims have become in intellectual terms." [...] He states that his criticism of the religion is aimed not at Muslims as people, but at the doctrine of Islam.|$|E
60|$|Now <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to {{the puzzle}} this: That God is impartial; that He is no respecter of persons, but causing His sun to shine on the evil {{and on the}} good, and His rain to fall on the just and on the unjust; and so {{rewarding}} every man according to his work, paying him for all work done, of whatever kind it may be? Some work for this world, which we do see, and God gives them what they earn in this life; some work for the world above, which we cannot see, and God gives them what they earn in this life, for ever and ever likewise. If a man wishes for treasure on earth, he can have it if he will, and enjoy {{it as long as}} it lasts. If a man wishes for treasure in heaven, he can have it if he will, and enjoy it as long as it lasts. God deals fairly with both, and pays both what they have earned.|$|E
