40|$|A models lunar {{mining method}} is {{proposed}} that illustrates the {{problems to be}} expected in lunar mining and how they might be solved. While the method is quite feasible, it is, more importantly, a useful baseline system against which to test other, possible better, methods. Our study group proposed the slusher to stimulate discussion of how a lunar mining operation might be successfully accomplished. Critics of the slusher system were invited to propose better methods. The group noted that while nonterrestrial mining has been {{a vital part of}} past space manufacturing proposals, no one has proposed a lunar mining system in any real detail. The group considered it essential that the design of actual, workable, and specific lunar mining methods begin immediately. Based on an earlier proposal, the method is a three-drum slusher, also known as a cable-operated <b>drag</b> <b>scraper.</b> Its terrestrial application is quite limited, as it is relatively inefficient and inflexible. The method usually finds use in underwater mining from the shore and in moving small amounts of ore underground. When lunar mining scales up, the lunarized slusher will be replaced by more efficient, high-volume methods. Other aspects of lunar mining are discussed...|$|E

In its early years, the Galion name appeared {{on a wide range}} of road-building and other construction equipment, such as <b>drag</b> <b>scrapers,</b> plows, wagons, stone unloaders, rock crushers, and a variety of other [...] "experimental machines". By 1911, Galion had begun production of a light-duty, horse-drawn road grader.|$|R

50|$|Ground {{engaging}} {{tools are}} the expendable replacement parts of costly mining, construction, dredging, crushing, conveying, recycling {{equipment such as}} excavators, <b>scrapers,</b> <b>drag</b> lines, shovels, dippers, graders, dozers, loaders, haulers, dredging cutter heads, backhoes and skid steers. GET protects expensive equipment from {{the wear and tear}} common in high-impact or high-abrasion environments (from hard rock mining to dredging and oil sands extraction). GET includes such wear parts as tooth systems, buckets, blades, end bits, couplers, thumbs, ripper systems, lip systems, dozer packages, liner packages, shrouds, chain, chain sprockets, traction wheels, and shredder hammer components.|$|R
