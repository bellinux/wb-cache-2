5|$|The Coffelt Memorial Room {{is located}} in the {{basement}} of the property; it is named after police officer Leslie Coffelt, who was killed while defending Blair House against an attack by Puerto Rican separatists in 1950. The room is used as a <b>day</b> <b>room</b> by the United States Secret Service Uniformed Division detachment assigned to the property. It was dedicated in 1990 and contains a portrait of Coffelt and his framed medals, which were donated by his step-daughter.|$|E
5|$|The {{prisoner}} reformer John Howard {{reported in}} 1777 that the gaol was very small, forming a main room with three separate cages running along one side; {{one of these}} cages was reserved for female prisoners. The upper room {{was used as a}} chapel, and food for the inmates was lowered through a hole by the prison gaoler. In 1779, after complaints were made by about the conditions, £500 was granted by Parliament and the gaol was enlarged to comprise a <b>day</b> <b>room</b> and a total of seven cells for male and female prisoners, with accommodation for the prison governor on the first floor. In exchange, the county agreed to take over the maintenance of the gaol. By 1795, Hugh Percy, the 2nd Duke of Northumberland, had become an important local landowner in the region and acquired the rights to the post of constable from the Duke of Cornwall, the then Prince George.|$|E
5|$|West Gate {{continued}} {{to be used as}} the city gaol, resulting in it surviving the destruction of the other city gates. When the reformer John Howard visited the gaol in the mid-1770s, he noted that it contained a large <b>day</b> <b>room</b> for male and female prisoners and two small night rooms, but no courtyard for exercise. Prison reform became an important issue during the early 19th century, and the West Gate gaol was considered unsatisfactory, being condemned as dirty, cramped and insecure, resulting in the extension of the gaol into Pound Lane and the consequent dismantling of the adjacent city wall. There was a legal attempt to demolish the West Gate altogether in 1859, in order to allow the Wombwell Circus to march a parade of elephants into the city; the gatehouse was only saved by the casting vote of Canterbury's mayor. In 1865 the prison was closed and the West Gate became used first for the storage of archives and then as a museum.|$|E
50|$|Modern hotels fill daytime {{occupancy}} {{by offering}} <b>day</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>Day</b> <b>rooms</b> are booked in {{a block of}} hours typically between 8 am and 5 pm, before the typical night shift. For example, the Four Points, a Sheraton hotel in Los Angeles, began offering <b>day</b> <b>rooms.</b> Also, the Rodeway Inn and Suites near Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida offers <b>day</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Choice Hotels began {{offering}} day use and <b>day</b> <b>rooms</b> {{for business and}} airport cruise port travelers in certain hotels. <b>Day</b> <b>rooms</b> allow customers to purchase a room while waiting for a flight, cruise, meeting, or business event. They are typically less expensive than purchasing an overnight stay in a room. Rodeway Inn and Suites, Fort Lauderdale Airport and Port Everglades Cruise Port {{was the first to}} implement this.|$|R
50|$|Some hotels fill daytime {{occupancy}} with <b>day</b> <b>rooms,</b> for example, Rodeway Inn and Suites near Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. <b>Day</b> <b>rooms</b> are booked in a {{block of}} hours typically between 8 am and 5 pm, before the typical night shift. These are similar to transit hotels in that they appeal to travelers, however, unlike transit hotels, they do not eliminate the need to go through Customs.|$|R
25|$|Since 1979, in {{addition}} to his novels and occasional essays, DeLillo has been active as a playwright. To date, DeLillo has written five major plays: The Engineer of Moonlight (1979), The <b>Day</b> <b>Room</b> (1986), Valparaiso (1999), Love Lies Bleeding (2006), and, most recently, The Word For Snow (2007). Stage adaptations have also been written for DeLillo's novels Libra and Mao II.|$|E
25|$|The most {{accurate}} {{measurement of the}} size of a human penis can be derived from several readings at different times since there is natural minor variability in size depending upon arousal level, time of <b>day,</b> <b>room</b> temperature, frequency of sexual activity, and reliability of measurement. When compared to other primates, including large examples such as the gorilla, the human penis is thickest, both in absolute terms and relative {{to the rest of the}} body.|$|E
500|$|To {{the south}} of the church a cloister was laid out, {{surrounded}} by the domestic buildings of the house. The east range, which was completed first (probably by around 1250), held the chapter house, sacristy, the monks' dormitory, <b>day</b> <b>room,</b> and a [...] long reredorter (latrine). The south range was built next, it contained the kitchens, warming house and refectory which projected south beyond {{the main body of the}} building, following the usual Cistercian plan.|$|E
50|$|Each building, or 'villa', was {{designed}} for a category of resident i.e. children, adolescents, adults, geriatrics, or severely disabled and many were linked in pairs {{in order to have}} shared dining accommodation and <b>day</b> <b>rooms.</b> Residents who were bed-bound would be able to have sight of the activities taking part in the <b>day</b> <b>rooms</b> and each villa had a hobbies room along with baths, showers, changing and drying facilities and treatment rooms. Each villa had an internal courtyard with seating and on the west and southern aspects, a terraced area could be found.|$|R

500|$|The parlour lies south, an austere, barrel vaulted room {{little more}} than a {{passageway}} through the building. Here the monks could talk without disturbing the silence in the cloister, which Cistercian rules insisted on. South of this runs a long vaulted hall with a central row of pillars supporting the roof. This room was much altered over time and probably served several purposes during the lifetime of the abbey. Initially, it may have served as the monks' <b>day</b> <b>room</b> and accommodation for novices, but as time went on it may have been converted into the misericord where the monks—initially only the sick, but by the later middle ages the whole convent—could eat meat dishes not normally allowed in the main dining hall.|$|E
500|$|By 1870 the {{architectural}} fashion had {{moved away from}} the corridor design in favour of a pavilion style based on the military hospitals built during and after the Crimean War, providing light and well-ventilated accommodation. Opened in 1878, the Manchester Union's infirmary comprised seven parallel three-storey pavilions separated by [...] "airing yards"; each pavilion had space for 31beds, a <b>day</b> <b>room,</b> a nurse's kitchen and toilets. By the start of the 20th century new workhouses were often fitted out to an [...] "impressive standard". Opened in 1903, the workhouse at Hunslet in West Riding of Yorkshire had two steam boilers with automatic stokers supplying heating and hot water throughout the building, a generator to provide electricity for the institution's 1,130 electric lamps, and electric lifts in the infirmary pavilion.|$|E
2500|$|Only the {{foundations}} of the church remain. The remains of the former monastic buildings are more extensive. [...] The west range, which was the lay brothers' dormitory, consists of two stories, and is roofed. [...] This is currently used as a Roman Catholic church hall. [...] To the south of the cloister, part of the walls of the former kitchen and refectory remain. [...] The east range is more complete and includes parts of the walls of the former monks' <b>day</b> <b>room,</b> parlour and vestry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{relations}} between the base and Dodge City were uniformly good. The limited size of the town created problems of housing for married officers and enlisted men, {{but this was the}} universal and normal wartime condition. The people of Dodge City showed themselves most co-operative in welcoming a large number of troops into their community. For example, during February 1943, various civic organizations co-operated in furnishing <b>day</b> <b>rooms</b> for the squadrons on the base. In March, the local Rotary, Kiwanis, and Lions Clubs presented a minstrel show which netted about $1,200 to aid in furnishing the <b>day</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{the use of}} <b>day</b> <b>rooms</b> dates as {{far back}} as the hotel itself. In {{literary}} history, has been associated with the idea of renting rooms on an hourly basis.
