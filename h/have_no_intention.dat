25|$|Socially {{the island}} is highly diverse, with the {{creative}} sector (artists, musicians, scientists, writers, poets and actors) and eccentrics strongly represented. It has 1,206 businesses but around 1,000 people commute daily to Auckland as career opportunities are limited. 60.9 per cent of the residents are in employment. The main employment sectors are hospitality (23 per cent) and retail (15%) followed by education, agriculture/horticulture and healthcare (10% each). Gentrification and land speculation is having an impact, with high rates and mortgage interest rates forcing some people on fixed incomes to relocate. New Zealand council rates are based on land and building valuations, which take into account potential value for redevelopment even if the owners live on the property and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> to sell or redevelop. The cost of living is higher compared to the mainland, due to the shipping-freight costs of most foodstuffs, fuel and amenities.|$|E

Madonna responded by releasing a statement saying she was saddened that Banda had chosen to act negatively about her endeavors. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of being distracted by these ridiculous allegations," [...] she added.

500|$|Save the G!, the Riders Alliance, {{and other}} {{organizations}} have also lobbied {{for the creation of}} new free out-of-system transfers to nearby stations. The most prominent is between Broadway on the Crosstown Line and either Hewes Street or Lorimer Street on the BMT Jamaica Line, which are both about three blocks away; this transfer has been previously proposed. In 2005, an MTA spokesperson stated, [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of making that a permanent free transfer." [...] This sentiment was repeated in 2013, with the MTA citing the loss of around $770,000 in revenue if the transfer were to become free. Temporary free transfers have been provided in the past, including one to Lorimer Street in 1999 due to suspended service over the Williamsburg Bridge on the , and again during the Summer 2014 G service suspension north of Nassau Avenue. The temporary Lorimer Street–Broadway transfer is due to be reinstated for 18 months beginning in January 2019, when the BMT Canarsie Line tunnels under the East River are closed for construction related to the Fix and Fortify program initiated by the MTA after Hurricane Sandy.|$|E
500|$|Bennett's {{attitudes to}} the music of his {{continental}} contemporaries, aside from that of Mendelssohn, were cautious. Arthur Sullivan claimed that Bennett was [...] "bitterly prejudiced against the new school, as he called it. He would not have a note of Schumann; and as for Wagner, he was outside the pale of criticism." [...] In Bennett's 1858 lecture on [...] "The visits of illustrious foreign musicians to England", the latest mention is of Mendelssohn, bypassing Chopin, Wagner, Verdi and Hector Berlioz, (who all only came to England after Mendelssohn's last visit); Liszt (who visited London in 1827) is omitted. In a subsequent lecture he opined that Verdi was [...] "immeasurably inferior" [...] to Gioachino Rossini, and could only say in favour of Berlioz that he [...] "must be allowed the character of a successful and devoted artist... it cannot be doubted that his treatment of a great orchestra is masterly in the extreme." [...] Of Wagner, [...] "the hero of the so-called 'music of the future'", Bennett noted [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of treating him disrespectfully; that I entirely misunderstand him and his musical opinions may be my fault and not his. At any rate he possesses an influence at this moment over musical life, which {{it would be impossible to}} overlook." ...|$|E

500|$|Arriving {{shortly after}} the initial contact, the lead platoon from B Company—5 Platoon under Second Lieutenant John O'Halloran—was forced to jump from their {{helicopters}} as {{they were unable to}} land after taking fire at the landing zone. The platoon quickly formed up and moved into the vegetation on {{the western edge of the}} landing zone, with the remainder of the company following them as they landed. Meanwhile, O'Brien estimated that A Company was facing at least a company dug-in across a [...] frontage, armed with five or six machine-guns. Unable to use artillery because of the helicopters still flying-in the remainder of the battalion, while the mortars were still with the APCs and had not yet arrived, O'Brien was without support and any further advance would not be possible. Unlike previous encounters during which the Viet Cong had attempted to avoid battle, the force now confronting A Company appeared to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of withdrawing and was instead mounting an unexpectedly determined defence. The Australians suspected that this uncharacteristic willingness to fight during daylight indicated that the Viet Cong force may have been covering the withdrawal of their command elements. Under heavy fire from what appeared to be a Viet Cong base area, O'Brien extricated his platoons with difficulty and subsequently broke contact, withdrawing [...] with the wounded to the southern edge of the landing zone.|$|E
500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first thing I did when I got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever else was there. I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E
500|$|Just {{over two}} weeks after the convention, it was {{revealed}} that Eagleton had been hospitalized and received electroshock therapy for [...] "nervous exhaustion" [...] and [...] "depression" [...] several times during the early to mid-1960s (years later, Eagleton's diagnosis was refined to bipolar II disorder). McGovern initially supported Eagleton, in part because he saw parallels with his daughter Terry's battles with mental illness, and on the following day, July 26, stated publicly, [...] "I am 1,000percent for Tom Eagleton and <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>intention</b> of dropping him from the ticket." [...] Though many people still supported Eagleton's candidacy, an increasing number of influential politicians and newspapers questioned his ability to handle the office of vice president and, potentially, president or questioned the McGovern campaign's ability to survive the distraction. The resulting negative attention – combined with McGovern's consultation with preeminent psychiatrists, including Karl Menninger, as well as doctors who had treated Eagleton – prompted McGovern to accept, and announce on August 1, Eagleton's offer to withdraw from the ticket. It remains the only time a major party vice-presidential nominee has been forced off the ticket. Five prominent Democrats then publicly turned down McGovern's offer of the vice presidential slot: in sequence, Kennedy again, Abraham Ribicoff, Humphrey, Reubin Askew, and Muskie (Larry O'Brien was also approached but no offer made). Finally, he named United States Ambassador to France Sargent Shriver, a brother-in-law of John F. Kennedy. McGovern's 1,000 percent statement and subsequent reneging made him look both indecisive and an opportunist, and has since been considered one of the worst gaffes in presidential campaign history. McGovern himself would long view the Eagleton affair as having been [...] "catastrophic" [...] for his campaign.|$|E
