500|$|The {{critic for}} The Times {{reflected}} that [...] "the mood of For Your Eyes Only is, in fact, {{a good deal}} more sober and, perhaps, weary than before"; the critic also thought that the short form worked well with Bond, and that [...] "the girls, though a short story allows them only walk-on parts, are as wild and luscious as ever". Philip Stead, writing in The Times Literary Supplement thought that [...] "Mr. Fleming's licensed assassin is <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> form." [...] Stead considered that in the stories [...] "occasionally there seem to be echoes of [...] and glimpses of Rogue Male, but the Bond ambience is persuasive".|$|E

His morale was <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> shape and the indications were {{that he was getting}} a good, balanced diet, fish and vegetables, and any medical attention he needed." [...] He also reported to Graham's father that Graham and Knight were kept together in a shuttered 16-by-16-foot room, and that they didn't get much light or outside exercise.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for The Village Voice, music critic Robert Christgau found Tench's singing pretentious and the songs tedious: [...] "Despite some superb textures, {{this is as}} sloppy and self-indulgent as ever." [...] Roy Carr, writing in NME, felt that the album [...] "falls into that trap whereby the performance far exceeds the material. Beck hasn't lost any of his fire as he rips off solo after solo with flashy confidence". On the other hand, Rolling Stone magazine's Stephen Davis said that Rough and Ready is [...] "a surprisingly, fine piece of work {{from a man who}} wasn't really expected to come back. Beck is back, and <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> shape too." [...] Derek Johnson of NME reviewed the single [...] "Got the feeling" [...] positively and called it [...] "an excellent disc combining a strong commercial element with an altogether more progressive approach".|$|E

2500|$|Smash Hits {{awarded the}} album an 8 out of 10 rating and singled out tracks [...] "New Beginning", [...] "You and your Heart so Blue" [...] and [...] "I Hear Talk" [...] as being {{particularly}} strong. Reviewer Tom Hibbert said that [...] " [...] is awesomely brilliantly conceived pop music performed with relish", while the songs [...] "are thoroughly ravishing, proper popular music". Number One magazine {{was impressed by}} the adult rock sound of many of the tracks, but feared that the album wouldn't stand up to repeated listenings. Nevertheless, they gave the album a 4 out of 5 rating, commenting that [...] "Writing On the Wall sees [...] the Fizzers moving ever further away from their light pop of old, [...] a fair impression of American AOR rockers – in the most melodic way possible of course". The newly established Q Magazine rated the album 3 out of 5 and favoured the tracks [...] "Keep Each Other Warm" [...] and [...] "The Company You Keep". On the re-issue in 2004, The Daily Mirror stated that though the album may not be cutting-edge, it had class, while Music Week labelled the album [...] "a gem". Reviewing the 2012 re-release, Music News.com said the album saw the group lose their identity in a largely negative review. The album was rated two stars out of five but did compliment the group's performance, stating [...] "The band themselves are <b>in</b> <b>pretty</b> <b>good</b> form and the performances are solid but subtleties are clobbered by the production".|$|E
