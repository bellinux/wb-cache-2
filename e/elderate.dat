5|$|A Soviet {{military}} base {{was established in}} the current Šiaurės miestelis section of Žirmūnai during the 1950s. The heavily wooded northernmost part of the <b>elderate</b> was thinly populated until the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The Žirmūnai <b>elderate</b> {{occupies}} 5.7km² or 1.4% of {{the total}} area of the municipality of Vilnius according to data used for the 2001 census. Žirmūnai is located north of central Vilnius, along the western bank of the River Neris, on a flat plain which rises to the north. The <b>elderate</b> extends for about 4.4kilometres from north to south, and is about 1.5kilometres across at its widest point. The southernmost point of the Žirmūnai <b>elderate</b> is only some 450metres from Vilnius' Cathedral Square, in {{the centre of the}} city. Žirmūnai is bordered by the elderates of Verkiai in the north and Šnipiškės in the west, and is separated from Vilnius' Old Town and Antakalnis by the Neris. Žirmūnai's western boundary is defined by the following streets (from north to south): Verkių, Žvalgų, Kalvarijų, Žalgirio, and Rinktinės. The River Neris serves as Žirmūnai's northern, eastern and southern boundary. Žirmūnų Street is the district's main artery.|$|E
25|$|In 1861, after {{announcing the}} {{abolition}} of serfdom, peasants acquired civil rights, among them a right to self-governmence. To facilitate such a right townships (Russian: volost, Lithuanian: valsčius) and <b>elderates</b> (Russian: mir, Lithuanian: seniūnija) were established. By the end of 1861 there were 1,479 <b>elderates</b> in 181 townships of Vilna Governorate and 1,033 <b>elderates</b> in 153 townships of Kovno Governorate. The <b>elderates</b> would elect an elder (Russian: starosta, Lithuanian: seniūnas) and representatives to a township council (Lithuanian: valsčiaus sueiga). However, these institutions had very little power and were dependent on the local nobles. The power was concentrated {{in the hands of}} governors, all of whom were appointed by the tsar.|$|R
50|$|Before Lithuania regained independence, {{the city}} was {{generally}} known in English as Kovno, the traditional Slavicized form of its name; the Polish name is Kowno; the Belarusian name is Koўна, Kowna. An earlier Russian name was Ковно Kovno, although Каунас Kaunas has been used since 1940. The Yiddish name is Kovne (קאָװנע), while its names in German include Kaunas and Kauen. The city and its <b>elderates</b> also have names in other languages (see Names of Kaunas in other languages and names of Kaunas <b>elderates</b> in other languages).|$|R
5|$|As of {{the census}} taken in April 2001, the ethnic makeup of Žirmūnai was 59.2% Lithuanian, 16.8% Russian (the third highest {{percentage}} among Vilnius' <b>elderates,</b> behind Naujoji Vilnia and Naujininkai), 14.4% Poles, 3.8% Belarusian, 1.7% Ukrainian, 0.8% Jewish, 0.2% Tatar, 0.1% Latvian, 0.1% Armenian, and 2.9% other or unspecified ethnicity.|$|R
5|$|Žirmūnai is well-served by Vilnius' bus and {{trolleybus}} transportation network. One of Vilnius' trolleybus hubs {{is located}} in the northernmost part of Žirmūnai <b>elderate,</b> and Vilniaus Autobusai, Vilnius' main bus operator, is headquartered and has its main depot in Žirmūnai. Žirmūnai suffers from rush hour traffic jams. The street network in the district was primarily designed in the Soviet era for a much lower vehicle traffic.|$|E
5|$|A {{building}} {{close to}} the western border of the Žirmūnai <b>elderate,</b> an example of Socialist historicism built soon {{after the end of}} World War II, was the home of the Tėvynė ("Motherland") Cinema until the early 1990s; it has been hosting the New York musical theatre and club since 2004. It is unclear whether this building will be demolished to make way for underground parking lots or saved by virtue of its inclusion into the Registry of Cultural Values.|$|E
5|$|A map of Vilnius {{published}} in 1942, while {{the city was}} under Nazi rule, shows {{the northern part of}} Žirmūnai as Paneriškės, the middle section as Kareiviškės ("place of soldiers") and the southern part, close to the Tuskulėnai Manor, as Mantiškės ("a place named in honour of Mantas"). One of the streets in the area, Enriko Manto Street, referred to Herkus Mantas (Herkus Monte), a hero of the Great Prussian Uprising; today H. Manto Street is a short street in the Šnipiškės <b>elderate</b> ending at the boundary of Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|Modern apskritys {{should not}} be {{confused}} with apskritys that existed in the independent Lithuania during the interwar period. At that time Lithuania had a two-step administrative division: apskritys that were subdivided into valsčius. Lithuania now has a three-step division: counties, municipalities, and <b>elderates</b> (apskritys, savivaldybės, and seniūnijos). See subdivisions of Lithuania for details.|$|R
5|$|However, thanks {{largely to}} the crime {{prevention}} programme Saugus miestas ("Safe City"), crime rates in Žirmūnai, as in all other <b>elderates</b> of Vilnius, are declining. For instance, 886 crimes were registered in Žirmūnai during {{the first four months}} of 2005, versus 672 during the same period of 2006, a decline of about 24%. If this trend continues, Žirmūnai's crime rate for 2006 would decrease to about 37.2 crimes per 1,000 residents.|$|R
500|$|Three of the 19 brick chapels of the Vilnius Stations of the Cross (Vilniaus Kalvarijos), part of Verkiai Regional Park, {{are located}} at the extreme northwestern corner of Žirmūnai, just within the <b>elderate's</b> border. Once {{destroyed}} in 1963 and completely rebuilt, the three chapels, symbolizing the Mount of Olives and the Gardens of Gethsemane, are found only 20 meters away from the relatively busy Verkių Street, and about a hundred meters downhill {{from a group of}} Soviet multi-storey apartment buildings.|$|R
5|$|Žirmūnai's southernmost section, {{which lies}} {{on the bank of}} the River Neris {{opposite}} the Vilnius Castle Complex, was part of the settlement known as Žvejai; another part of that settlement is now located within the <b>elderate</b> of Šnipiškės. According to archaeological surveys from 2005, a fishing village may have been located here as early as the late 14th century, giving the area its name, literally, Fishermen; it was later settled by craftsmen and housed the Orthodox Church of St Barbara. During the 16th century, the only glass factory in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was located in the suburb of Žvejai. In 1563, after the construction of the first bridge over the River Neris (at the approximate location of today's Mindaugas Bridge), the suburb of Žvejai became an integral part of the city of Vilnius. During Tsarist rule in the 19th century, the name of Žvejai was superseded by that of Piramont, originating from the small estate of Piramont in the area (now Kalvarijų 1). Piramontskij Alley can be seen in a 1904 map of Vilnius where today's A. Juozapavičiaus Street in the <b>elderate</b> of Šnipiškės is located, close to the boundary of Žirmūnai. The usage of Piramont as a placename gradually became limited to the southern part of Žvejai.|$|E
500|$|According to the 2001 census, Žirmūnai was {{the most}} populous <b>elderate</b> in Vilnius (47,410 residents, {{comprising}} 8.7% of Vilnius' total population) and the third most populous in Lithuania after Šilainiai and Dainava, Kaunas. The population density was 8,317.5/km². According to the census, there were 21,363 private households in the Žirmūnai <b>elderate,</b> making for an average household size of about 2.2 persons. The population of Žirmūnai has been rapidly increasing, largely due to construction of residential buildings in the Šiaurės miestelis section of the <b>elderate.</b> A former elder of Žirmūnai estimated its 2002 population to be about 60,000 residents [...] an increase of about 13,000 over the 2001 census figure. This rapid growth has placed a strain on city services.|$|E
500|$|Žirmūnai ( [...] is {{the most}} populous {{administrative}} division (<b>elderate)</b> in Vilnius. It is also a neighbourhood in the Lithuanian capital city Vilnius, encompassing the city district of the same name, built in the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Lithuania was {{occupied}} by the Soviet Union on June 15, 1940. However, due to ensuring World War II the authorities did not introduce major changes to the administrative divisions, just <b>elderates</b> were renamed to apylinkė. After the second occupation in 1944, the number of counties grew from 26 to 41: eleven counties were added in 1946–47 and four more were introduced in 1949. At the end of 1947 there were 37 counties subdivided into 320 townships that were further subdivided into approximately 2,900 apylinkės.|$|R

500|$|In 2005, 2,317 {{crimes were}} {{registered}} in the Žirmūnai <b>elderate.</b> [...] This is the third highest figure among Vilnius' elderates, behind the Old Town and Naujamiestis. [...] Using the population data of the latest available census (2001), this would amount to about 48.9 crimes per 1,000 residents per year (only the eighth highest figure, due to the elderate's large population; Vilnius' total crime rate, using the same population data, would be about 51 crimes per 1,000 residents). [...] In terms of crime density, 406.5 crimes per 1 square kilometre were registered (the fourth highest figure, behind the Old Town, Naujamiestis and Šnipiškės; Vilnius' total crime density, using the same population data, would be about 70.4).|$|E

[...] However, {{it is likely that the}} average age of Žirmūnai's residents has decreased since the last census, and will continue to decrease, as a result of the active construction of new dwellings, which are acquired primarily by younger people. As housing prices rise, retirees are motivated to sell their apartments with the goal of acquiring cheaper housing elsewhere with funds to spare.|$|R

Of the remaining residents, 0.4% owned a share of individual housing, 0.7% lived in hostels, and almost 99% lived in apartments. The scarcity of lots means {{that the number of}} single-family dwellings is not likely to increase; a reverse process is taking place: old wooden houses are being demolished, making room for new residential and commercial constructions. As of 2007, {{there were only a few}} modern single-family houses in Žirmūnai.|$|R
500|$|The <b>elderate</b> of Žirmūnai embraces three {{historical}} {{suburbs of}} Vilnius: Žvejai, Tuskulėnai and Šiaurės miestelis. Fishing village Žvejai {{dating to the}} 14th century included the only glass factory in the 16th century Lithuania, {{as well as the}} largest Jewish cemetery. It became an integral part of Vilnius in the 16th century. The area south of Žvejai became known after the name of the Tusculanum Manor. Manor itself was a property of noble families and officials, and is the oldest building in Žirmūnai. In the 19th century, a military garrison was established in [...] the present-day Šiaurės miestelis, which was used by Russian, French and Polish armies. These territories were consolidated into Vilnius city during the [...] period of rapid growth that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. The Tuskulėnai Manor was used as the KGB officers' apartments back then. In the last years, a housing renovation program was launched in Žirmūnai.

25|$|The war had irreversibly {{altered the}} town – {{most of the}} {{predominantly}} Polish and Jewish population had been expelled and exterminated respectively, {{during and after the}} German occupation. Some members of the intelligentsia and former Waffen SS members hiding in the forest were now targeted and deported to Siberia after the war. The majority of the remaining population was compelled to relocate to Communist Poland by 1946, and Sovietization began in earnest. Only in the 1960s did Vilnius begin to grow again, following an influx of Lithuanians and Poles from neighbouring regions as well as from other areas of the Soviet Union (particularly Russia and Belarus). Microdistricts were built in the <b>elderates</b> of Šeškinė, Žirmūnai, Justiniškės and Fabijoniškės.|$|R
5000|$|Somaliland has {{a hybrid}} system of {{governance}} combining traditional and western institutions. In a series of inter-clan conferences, culminating in the Borama Conference in 1993, a qabil (clan or community) system of government was constructed, which consisted of an Executive, with a President, Vice President, and legislative government; a bicameral Legislature; and an independent judiciary. The traditional Somali <b>elderates</b> (guurti) was incorporated into the governance structure and formed the upper house, responsible for managing internal conflicts. Government became in essence a [...] "power-sharing coalition of Somaliland's main clans," [...] with seats in the Upper and Lower houses proportionally allocated to clans according to a pre-determined formula. In 2002, after several extensions of this interim government, Somaliland finally made the transition to multi-party democracy, with district council elections contested by six parties.|$|R
25|$|During the interwar, Lithuania regained independence. The {{first law}} on {{administrative}} sub-units was passed on July 1, 1919. It declared that Lithuania {{was divided into}} twenty counties (Lithuanian: singular – apskritis, plural – apskritys). Several more counties (including Zarasai, Naujieji Švenčionys, Vilnius, Eišiškės, Lida, Ashmyany and Hrodna) were reserved for territories in the Vilnius Region, that Lithuania had claims to, but were under Polish or Russian control. Later on Suwałki county was lost to Poland, but Zarasai (also known as Ežerėnai) county was acquired. Two of the designated counties, Trakai and Sejny, had their proclaimed capitals outside the de facto borders of Lithuania and had their temporary capitals established at Kaišiadorys and Lazdijai. After the Klaipėda Region was acquired in 1923, it was divided into three counties (Klaipėda, Šilutė and Pagėgiai). That way the number of counties increased to twenty three and remained stable until 1939. According to a law passed in 1931 eleven first-class cities became independent of county administration and had their own government. In March 1939, after an ultimatum from Hitler, Lithuania lost the Klaipėda Region with its three counties. In October Soviet Union returned one fifth of the Vilnius Region in exchange for Red Army stations in Lithuania. Acquired Vilnius Region was divided into three counties (Vilnius, Eišiškės, and Naujieji Švenčionys). Therefore, {{at the end of}} 1939 Lithuania again had twenty three counties. Counties were further subdivided into townships (Lithuanian: singular – valsčius, plural – valsčiai). In 1933 there were 365 townships.
