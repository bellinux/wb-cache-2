2500|$|Propp {{broke up}} fairy tales into {{sections}}. Through these sections {{he was able}} to define the tale into a series of sequences that occurred within the Russian fairytale. Usually there is an <b>initial</b> <b>situation,</b> after which the tale usually takes the following 31 functions. Propp used this method to decipher Russian folklore and fairy tales. First of all, there seems to be at least two distinct types of structural analysis in folklore. One is the [...] "syntagmatic" [...] manner of assessment (as termed following Lévi-Strauss 1964: 312), covering Propp's Morphology among others in which the structure of a piece folklore is described in the chronological order of the linear events it comprises. If a tale consists of elements A to Z, the structure of the tale is thus delineated in the same sequence. The other type of analysis is termed [...] "paradigmatic" [...] (cf. Sebag 1963:75), and describes instead the underlying pattern (usually based upon a priori binary principle of opposition) of the folkloric text, independent of chronology. Elements of the plot may be taken out of their [...] "given" [...] order and regrouped in various analytic schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Complying with Curtin's directive, albeit reluctantly, Blamey {{arrived in}} Port Moresby on 23 September 1942 {{with only a}} small {{personal}} staff. [...] It was a situation which Blamey felt was quite reasonable but with which Rowell saw significant difficulties. [...] Rowell's objections were that the circumstances of Blamey's presence in his headquarters would ultimately undermine the good conduct of its operation by forcing it to serve two masters. [...] McCarthy's reporting of the <b>initial</b> <b>situation</b> suggests that Blamey, while maintaining his position, was conciliatory and empathetic toward Rowell's concerns. Allen recounts that Rowell's objection was not to Blamey using his headquarters {{as much as the}} expectation that he (Rowell) was expected to be Blamey's chief-of-staff. Horner observes that this was much how the headquarters subsequently operated under Herring. [...] Underpinning the events that followed was bad blood between them stemming from Blamey's conduct in the Middle East and Greece. Perhaps, more importantly, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in Blamey's lack of support by way of resolve to oppose the decision to send Blamey to New Guinea.

2500|$|Firemen {{frequently}} pitched two- or three-inning outings to earn saves. The modern closer, {{reduced to}} a one-inning role, is available to pitch more save opportunities. In the past, a reliever pitching three innings one game would be unavailable to pitch the next game. Gossage had more saves {{of at least two}} innings than saves where he pitched one inning or less. [...] "The times I did a one-inning save, I felt guilty about it. It's like it was too easy", said Gossage. ESPN.com wrote that saves have not been determined to be [...] "a special, repeatable skill—rather than simply a function of opportunities". It also noted that blown saves are [...] "non-qualitative", pointing out that the two career leaders in blown saves—Gossage (112) and Rollie Fingers (109)—were both inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Fran Zimniuch in Fireman: The Evolution of the Closer in Baseball wrote, [...] "But {{you have to be a}} great relief pitcher to blow that many saves. Clearly, [...] saved many, many more than he did not save." [...] More than half of Gossage's and Fingers' blown saves came in tough save situations, where the tying run was on base when the pitcher entered. In nearly half of their blown tough saves, they entered the game in the sixth or seventh inning. Multiple-inning outings provide more chances for a reliever to blow a save. [...] The pitchers need to get out of the <b>initial</b> <b>situation</b> and pitch additional innings with more chances to lose the lead. A study by the Baseball Hall of Fame found modern closers were put into fewer tough save situations compared to past relievers. The modern closer also earned significantly more [...] "easy saves", defined as saves starting the ninth inning with more than a one-run lead. The study offered [...] "praise to the combatants who faced more danger for more innings." ...|$|E

For the private sector, our model focuses on the type of interaction (simultaneous, sequential or joint decision-making games) that should emerge between agents after the introduction of the activity-based ﬁnancing system. In the public sector, the elasticity of the demand to the level of inputs seems to play a more crucial role in the transition. hospital's ﬁnancing system, strategic interaction, activity-based pay- ment system. ...|$|R

40|$|Societies are {{sometimes}} divided into groups that behave {{in different ways}} or have strongly opposing opinions. At other times, everyone seems to behave according to similar principles and opinions. It is likely that individual decisions on behavior or opinions are affected by social networks through influence and selection processes. However, the outcomes are not necessarily optimal for the society as a whole. Two types of problems might arise: (a) polarization of the society into two camps that do not reach consensus, possibly leading to conflict; (b) actors choosing suboptimal behavior, because changing behavior is too risky if done unilaterally. Simulations show that if a society is rather segregated initially, there exists a heightened probability that this situation will worsen. The effect of network density is twofold. First, density has {{a positive effect on}} reaching a uniform opinion and, therefore, decreases the likelihood of polarization. Second, density increases the likelihood that actors do not change their behavior, worsening the inefficiency of already suboptimal <b>initial</b> <b>situations.</b> ...|$|R

Such measures are being developed in the INKA BB project using an action research approach, which is based on a participative and transdisciplinary collaboration between scientists and farmers. The action research was implemented using SWOT analysis, a flexible tool which can be used to assess <b>initial</b> <b>situations</b> as well as to plan and evaluate. Using this method, project partners identified weaknesses in the water and nitrogen supply in Brandenburg caused by climate change, on the level of farming methods and as well as of individual organic farms. With this as a basis, on-farm and small-plot experiments were developed to test farming methods adapted to climate change. These were carried out at six farms. The experimental results were, in turn, evaluated with a SWOT analysis. This made clear that a combination of measures including reduced tillage, adapted plant varieties, catch crops and adjusted sowing dates could be an approach to adapting to climate change...|$|R

40|$|The {{changes in}} economy and society have brought up new socio-political {{problems}} that represent an important {{challenge for the}} authorities {{in charge of the}} system of social security (especially social assistance). The causes of this socio-political kind of problems are mostly general and locally independent developments. Nevertheless, the related problems appear to be linked to the territory. Varying <b>initial</b> <b>situations,</b> the difference in the economic structures as well as the different sizes of the centres, regions and communities lead to a different urgent call for action {{in order to get the}} hang of the new problems. Thus, the economic and social costs of a general development are very inequally distributed among the regions. Therefore, mechanisms are needed to compensate the regional and financial differences of the costs. The prerequisites are indicators which make charges comparable. This article is concerned with the unequal distribution of costs and discusses possible indicators for the registering of these costs. ...|$|R
40|$|The MinMax k-means {{algorithm}} {{is widely used}} to tackle the effect of bad initialization by minimizing the maximum intraclustering errors. Two parameters, including the exponent parameter and memory parameter, {{are involved in the}} executive process. Since different parameters have different clustering errors, it is crucial to choose appropriate parameters. In the original algorithm, a practical framework is given. Such framework extends the MinMax k-means to automatically adapt the exponent parameter to the data set. It has been believed that if the maximum exponent parameter has been set, then the programme can reach the lowest intraclustering errors. However, our experiments show that this is not always correct. In this paper, we modified the MinMax k-means algorithm by PSO to determine the proper values of parameters which can subject the algorithm to attain the lowest clustering errors. The proposed clustering method is tested on some favorite data sets in several different <b>initial</b> <b>situations</b> and is compared to the k-means algorithm and the original MinMax k-means algorithm.

40|$|Low {{interest}} rates are becoming {{a threat to the}} stability of the life insurance industry, especially in countries such as Germany, where products with relatively high guaranteed returns sold in the past still represent a prominent share of the total portfolio. This contribution aims to assess and quantify the effects of the current low interest rate phase on the balance sheet of a representative German life insurer, given the current asset allocation and the outstanding liabilities. To do so, we generate a stochastic term structure of {{interest rates}} as well as stock market returns to simulate investment returns of a stylized life insurance business portfolio in a multi-period setting. Based on empirically calibrated parameters, we can observe the evolution of the life insurers' balance sheet over time with a special focus on their solvency situation. To account for different scenarios and in order to check the robustness of our findings, we calibrate different capital market settings and different <b>initial</b> <b>situations</b> of capital endowment. Our results suggest that a prolonged period of low interest rates would markedly affect the solvency situation of life insurers, leading to relatively high cumulative probability of default for less capitalized companies...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{homogeneous}} {{water condensation}} in a vortex is numerically {{studied in the}} present work by using an extended method of moments (EMOM). The EMOM {{is based on the}} liquid phase so that the gas phase and the liquid phase can be treated separately, having their own governing equations respectively. The EMOM is integrated into a well validated numerical method-VAS 2 D (two-dimensional & axisymmetric vectorized adaptive solver), which is a MUSCL-type finite-volume method developed for the unstructured quadrilateral grids. The interactions between the two phases are realized through the source terms including the exchange of momentum and heat. The new numerical method is then applied to a vortex flow with a mixture of nitrogen and water vapor. Several cases with different <b>initial</b> <b>situations</b> are investigated. The evolution of the flow field is discussed. The case with the undersaturated gas apart from the nucleation region has a smooth diffusion of the droplets. But for the case with the supersaturated gas, the droplets continuously grow when they move to the new supersaturated region under the effect of centrifugal force. It leads to a more complex interaction between the vortex and the condensation...|$|R
30|$|The European and the South and Southeast Asian Region {{are very}} {{different}} regarding {{their commitment to the}} refugee convention. While Europe is the only continent, where all countries are signatories of the Convention and the Protocol of 1967, the latter is the region with the most non-signatories. 43 states are not signatories or have not ratified the treaty, although they host large refugee contingents, notably in ASEAN. Only the Philippines (since 1981) and Cambodia (since 1992) of ASEAN are signatories. Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, India, Pakistan, Vietnam and even Singapore are all non-Parties. South Korea and Japan are both members. Hence, the <b>initial</b> <b>situations</b> in an interregional comparison look very different. Being a non-Party does not exempt those states from customary law. The central principle of non-refoulement belongs to customary law. It states that refugees cannot be sent back to countries where they fled from when the conditions they fled have not changed and are covered by the Convention. Yet, many other important matters are not customary law or are at least disputed. Contracting partners give refugees the right to receive travel documents, free access to courts, administrative assistance, identity papers, the right to transfer their assets, rights related to marriage, and so forth. These examples show the centrality of the convention for the refugees.|$|R
