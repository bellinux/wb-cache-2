2500|$|The {{experiments}} {{show that}} water in fuel ethanol inhibits <b>dry</b> <b>corrosion.</b> At 10,000 ppm {{water in the}} E50 experiments by JARI and 3,500 ppm water in the E20 experiments by TU Darmstadt [...] the alcoholate/alkoxide corrosion stopped. In the fuel ethanol this resembles 20,000 ppm or 2 volume% {{in the case of}} JARI and 5 x 3500 = 17,500 ppm of 1.75 volume% in the case of TU Darmstadt. The observations are in line with the fact that hydrous ethanol is known for being less corrosive than anhydrous ethanol. The reaction mechanism will be the same at lower-mid blends. When enough water is present in the fuel, the aluminum will react preferably with water to produce aluminum oxide, repairing the protective aluminum oxide layer, which is why the corrosion stops. The aluminum alcoholate/alkoxide does not make a tight oxide layer, which is why the corrosion continues. In other words, water is essential to repair the holes in the oxide layer. Based on the Japanese/German results, a minimum of 2 vol.% or 2.52% m/m water is currently proposed in the revision of the hydrous ethanol specification for blending in petrol at E10+ levels. Water injection has additional positive effects on the engine performance (thermodynamic efficiency) and reduces overall CO2 emissions.|$|E

40|$|LectureSince 2007, the hot-filament Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) {{technology}} for crystalline diamond thin-film coatings has {{found its way}} into the mechanical seal market to combat the problems of <b>dry</b> running, <b>corrosion</b> and abrasion. This new technology has proved successful in hundreds of pumping applications {{in a wide range of}} services and duties. The reliability and lifetime of mechanical seals are improved by using diamond-coated faces. One such application involved the sealing of large boiler feed and steam generator pumps in power plants. The duty conditions for the pump?s seals can be as high as pressures up to 580 psig (40 bar), shaft RPMs up to 6, 500 and temperatures up to 400 ?F (200 ?C). Consequently, the mechanical seal faces are highly loaded in a fluid with far less than ideal lubricating qualities. It is evident, therefore, that these applications are technologically challenging for mechanical seal manufacturers not only from a tribological perspective, but also from a corrosion viewpoint when the feed water has a low electrical conductivity or is free of impurities.

Stabilised ferritic stainless steels are widely used in automotive and cosmetic appliances but are also concerned by sticking phenomenon. These grades, having high <b>dry</b> <b>corrosion</b> and creep resistance, are enriched in specific chemical elements such as Cr, Nb or Ti, limiting also slab oxidation during hot rolling. Nevertheless, the mastered oxidation of slab surface is a way to protect metal surface from direct contact with rolls. In order to better understand initiation of sticking, a first campaign was based on topography and rolls surface state wear analysis. This study revealed that sticking initiation is not due to the presence of roll scratches which depth is higher than oxide layer thickness. Indeed, the probability that roll scratches are deeper than oxide layer thickness is very low. In a second time, a pilot was designed, reproducing tribological conditions of a roll bite, to better understand mechanisms that initiate sticking. Keeping in mind the importance of rolls and slab surface state, this pilot is able to use specimen taking from industrial products, having the original oxide layer surface.

40|$|Corrosion science {{exhibits}} a major division between dry and wet corrosion. <b>Dry</b> <b>corrosion</b> {{is dominated by}} high temperature oxidation of metals and {{is controlled by the}} rate at which oxygen can diffuse through the oxide skin and by stable oxide adhesion to the metal substrate involved. Wet corrosion involves electrolytic interactions that require the presence of an aqueous solution. Good design can prevent onset of in service (wet) corrosion by limiting the contact of the electrolyte. However, changes in operational procedures and manufacture can reverse any good design practice. Furthermore, the combined effects of stress and corrosion can result in a special type of failure known as stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Stress corrosion cracking presents an especially difficult problem, since not only is it highly localised but it can occur in environments that are only mildly corrosive to the material. The damaging concentration of harmful ions in that environment may be quite small and difficult to detect and, {{even in the absence of}} applied stress, residual stresses in a structure can often be of a sufficiently high level to cause SCC and failure in service. The role of the forensic or failure engineer in this arena is often to assess if basic design, manufacture and material choice reflect professional engineering practice. To this end a brief review of salient points relating to corrosion and stress corrosion as product failure mechanisms is presented and illustrated by numerous studies from the authors' forensic casebooks...|$|E

A novel approach is being used since such installations must {{be understood as a}} global system comprised of various materials and hardware components, canisters, concrete and steel structures and specific procedures covering engineering steps from construction to operation including monitoring, care and maintenance as well as licensing. The challenge set by such a lifetime design goal made the R&D people focus on issues at stake and relevant to long term HLW storage in particular heat management, the effect of time on materials and the sustainability of care and maintenance. This opened up the R&D field from fundamental research areas to more conventional and technical aspects. Two major guiding principles have been devised as key design goals for the storage concepts under consideration. One is the paramount function of retrievability, which must allow the safe retrieval of any HLW package from the facility at any given time. Next is the passive containment philosophy requiring that a dual-barrier system be considered.

Therefore, the overriding strategy of preventing corrosion and material degradation to achieve canister protection, and therefore containment of radioactive material throughout the time of period envisaged, is at the heart of the R&D program and several design alternatives are being studied to meet that objective.

This corrosion occurs everywhere- from factories, refineries, and power plants to tanks and bridges to automobiles and architectural structures. And, as you are well aware, corrosion is a real concern in <b>dry</b> kilns. <b>Corrosion</b> not only shortens {{the life of a}} kiln, but can seriously affect its operating efficiency as well. Corrosion is defined as deterioration of a substance (usually metal, but also wood, concrete, plastic, etc [...] .) or its properties {{as a result of a}} reaction with its environment. Corrosion is an electrochemical reaction and can be controlled when one or more elements of this reaction are eliminated. Paints and coatings are used as barriers to eliminate or prohibit this reaction by separating the elements- oxygen and moisture from the substrate, usually steel and its impurities- carbon, etc. If the surface is dry nothing happens. If a little water and some air, particularly salt air, are exposed to the steel all the components necessary for the formation of a minute galvanic cell are present. It is this galvanic cell which causes the electrochemical reaction which results in corrosion. However, as stated earlier, if one or more of the elements of the reaction are eliminated, corrosion cannot occur. In order for a paint to perform as a barrier and successfully eliminate or separate the elements, thus prohibiting the reaction and the resulting corrosion, it must be properly formulated, specified and applied. Corrosion is worse if moist air is present rather than dry air; polluted air rather than clean; high oxygen content rather that low; hot water rather than cold; salt water rather than fresh; acid environment rather than alkaline. Corrosion under any of these conditions will not occur if the proper paint is specified and applied. The following five characteristics are necessary in order for a protective coating to perform as a "barrier " and separate the substrate from the elements...|$|R

Here, the association between the deliquescence phase transitions (solid-aqueous) of a single salt, NaCl, and the corrosion response of steel contaminated with this salt is examined. Specific focus is given to mechanisms that allow corrosion below the deliquescence relative humidity of NaCl (76 % RH). Mild steel loaded with aqueous NaCl drops or crystals (9 μg · cm− 2) was subjected to isohumidity exposures for up to 300 days. The resulting damage was quantified by optical profilometry. The corrosion chemistry that developed was identified using EDS and Raman spectroscopy. The wetting and <b>drying</b> of simulated <b>corrosion</b> chemistries were characterized by impedance measurements across an interdigitated electrode sensor. Taken together, these results show that corrosion can initiate by adsorbed water on NaCl crystals at as low as 33 % RH. At 53 % RH and above, attack proceeded at rates comparable to that observed above the deliquescence RH due to the development of hygroscopic corrosion chemistry.

Two cleaners, including a hydrofluoroether (HFE) and an azeotrope of the HFE and isopropyl alcohol (IPA), have been studied as potential replacements for flammable solvents. Cleaning efficacy, short-term and long-term materials compatibility, <b>corrosion,</b> <b>drying</b> times, flammability, environment, safety and health (ES&H) and accelerated aging issues were among the experiments used to screen candidate solvents by the interagency team performing this work. This report presents cleaning efficacy results as determined by the contact angle Goniometer as well as materials compatibility results of various metal alloys and polymers. The results indicate that IPA (baseline cleaner) and the HFE/IPA azeotrope are roughly equivalent in their ability to remove fluorinated grease, silicone grease, and a simulated finger print contaminant from various metal alloys. All of the ASTM sandwich and immersion corrosion tests with IPA, HFE or the HFE/IPA azeotrope on metal alloys showed no signs of corrosion. Furthermore, no deleterious effects were noted for polymeric materials immersed in IPA, HFE, or the HFE/IPA azeotrope...|$|R
40|$|This project {{involves}} {{basic research}} in chemistry and physics aimed at providing information {{pertinent to the}} safe long-term dry storage of spent nuclear fuel (SNF), {{thousands of tons of}} which remain in water storage across the DOE complex. The Hanford Site K-Basins alone hold 2, 300 tons of spent fuel, much of it severely corroded, and similar situations exist at Savannah River and Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory. The DOE plans to remove this fuel and seal it in overpack canisters for dry interim storage for up to 75 years while awaiting permanent disposition. Chemically-bound water will remain in this fuel even following proposed drying steps, leading to possible long-term corrosion of the containers and/or fuel rods themselves, generation of H{sub 2 } and O{sub 2 } gas via radiolysis (which could lead to deflagration or detonation), and reactions of pyrophoric uranium hydrides. No thoroughly tested model is currently available to predict fuel behavior during pre-processing, processing, or storage. In a collaboration between Rutgers University, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory, the authors are studying the radiolytic reaction, <b>drying</b> processes, and <b>corrosion</b> behavior of actual SNF materials, and of pure and mixed-phase samples. The authors propose to determine what is omitted from current models: radiolysis of water adsorbed on or in hydrates or hydroxides, thermodynamics of interfacial phases, and kinetics of drying. A model will be developed and tested against actual fuel rod behavior to insure validity and applicability to the problems associated with developing dry storage strategies for DOE-owned SNF. This report summarizes work after eight months of a three-year project. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to identify High Early-Age Strength (HES) concrete batch designs, and evaluate their suitability for use in the rapid repair of highways and bridge decks. To this end, two criteria needed to be met; a minimum compressive strength of 20. 68 MPa (3000 psi) in no later than 12 hours, and a drying shrinkage of less than 0. 06 % at 28 days after curing. The evaluations included both air-entrained, and non-air-entrained concretes. The cement types chosen for this study included Type III and Type V Portland cement and “Rapid Set” − a Calcium Sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement. In addition, two blended concretes containing different ratios of Type V Portland cement and CSA cement were investigated. The evaluation of the studied concretes included mechanical properties (compressive and flexural strength) and transport properties (absorption, rapid chloride penetration– RCPT, rapid chloride migration– RMT, and water permeability). Additionally, dimensional stability (drying shrinkage) and durability (corrosion of steel, frost resistance, and abrasion resistance) were investigated. Evaluations were conducted based on cement type and common cement factor. Fresh property tests showed that in order to provide a comparable workability, and still remain within manufactures guideline for plasticizer, the water-to-cement ratio was adjusted for each type of cement utilized. This resulted in the need to increase the water-to-cement ratio as the Blaine Fineness of the cement type increased (0. 275 for Type V Portland cement, 0. 35 for Type III Portland cement, and 0. 4 for Rapid Set cement). It was also observed that negligible changes in setting time occurred with increasing cement content, whereas changes in cement type produced notable differences. The addition of air-entrainment had beneficial effect on workability for the lower cement factors. Increasing trends for peak hydration heat were seen with increases in cement factor, cement Blaine Fineness, and accelerator dosage. Evaluation of hardened properties revealed opening times as low as 5 hours for Type V Portland cement with 2. 0 % accelerator per cement weight and further reduction in opening time by an hour when accelerator dosage was increased to 2. 8 % by cement weight. When Type III Portland cement and Rapid Set cement were used, the opening time reduced to as low as 4. 5 hours and 1 hour, respectively. The results for Type V Portland cement concretes showed that as cement factor increased so did mechanical properties until the cement factor exceeded 504 kg/m 3 (850 lb/yd 3), at which point the peak heat of hydration exceeded 46. 1 °C (115 °F) and the mechanical properties decreased. Other evaluations on the studied High Early-Age Strength Type V Portland cement concretes revealed increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, <b>drying</b> shrinkage, <b>corrosion</b> resistance, and resistance to wear with increases in cement content. On the other hand, rapid chloride migration and frost resistance decreased with increasing cement factor. Increasing the accelerator dosage resulted in an increase in all properties of the HES Type V cement concretes except for frost resistance, which decreased. The addition of air-entrainment had adverse effects on compressive strength, absorption, and rapid chloride migration; while showing lower values for rapid chloride penetration. Curing had positive effects on all hardened properties of the studied HES concretes containing Type V cement. When examining the studied Type III Portland cement concretes, it was seen that an increase in cement content led to decreases in mechanical properties. It is noted that the peak heat of hydration for these concrete exceeded the threshold of 46. 1 °C (115 °F). In addition, increases in cement factor also resulted in decreases in rapid chloride migration, frost resistance and resistance to wear. Increases in cement content resulted in increases in absorption, rapid chloride penetration, water permeability, <b>drying</b> shrinkage, and <b>corrosion</b> resistance. The use of air-entrainment imparted decreases in compressive strength and rapid chloride penetration, increases in absorption, and negligible effects on rapid chloride migration. Extending curing period resulted in beneficial effects on all properties of the studied Type III cement concretes. The studied CSA cement concretes had slightly decreasing strength trends as cement content was increased. Concretes containing CSA cement produced the lowest opening time (one hour) and the highest peak hydration heats of all concretes studied. While its corrosion and frost resistance reduced as cement content increased, the absorption and rapid chloride penetration increased with increasing cement content. For drying shrinkage, opening time curing showed more volume change with increasing cement content, whereas extending curing to 24 hours and 28 days resulted in reduction of drying shrinkage. Increasing cement factor had minimal effects on water permeability and abrasion resistance. Air-entrainments reduced compressive strength, but increased absorption and rapid chloride penetration. Rapid chloride migration was found to be incompatible with CSA cements concretes. All hardened properties of the studied CSA cement concretes improved once curing age was extended to 24 hours and 28 days. When considering the results of the HES blended cement concretes, as Type V cement content increased, 28 -day compressive strength, flexural strength, drying shrinkage (opening time and 24 -hour), corrosion resistance, and resistance to wear increased. Conversely, 24 -hour compressive strength, absorption, rapid chloride penetration, 28 -day rapid chloride migration, water penetration, 28 -day drying shrinkage, and frost resistance reduced with an increase in Type V Portland cement of the High Early-Age Strength blended cement concretes. Reductions in compressive strength and absorption occurred for both studied blended cement concretes when air-entraining admixtures were used. Longer curing provided favorable results for properties of all studied blended cement concretes...|$|R
40|$|In {{post-tensioned}} (PT) bridges, {{prestressing steel}} tendons {{are the major}} load carrying components. These tendons consist of strands, ducts, and cementitious grout that fill the interstitial space between the strands and ducts. However, inspections on PT bridges have reported the presence of voids, moisture, and chlorides inside grouted ducts as the major cause of accelerated corrosion of strands. Corrosion of the strands has resulted in PT bridge failures in Europe and tendon failures in the United States. As most of the PT bridges have high importance measures {{and the consequences of}} failure are significant, it is important to maintain high levels of safety and serviceability for these bridges. To meet this goal, bridge management authorities are in dire need of tools to quantify the long-term performance of these bridges. Time-variant structural reliability models can be useful tools to quantify the long-term performance of PT bridges. This doctoral dissertation presents the following results obtained from a comprehensive experimental and analytical program on the performance of PT bridges. 1) Electrochemical characteristics of PT systems 2) Probabilistic models for tension capacity of PT strands and wires exposed to various void and environmental conditions 3) Time-variant structural reliability models (based on bending moment and stress limit states) for PT bridges 4) Time-variant strength and service reliabilities of a typical PT bridge experiencing HS 20 and HL 93 loading conditions and different exposure conditions for a period of 75 years The experimental program included exposure of strand specimens to wet-dry and continuous-atmospheric conditions. These strand specimens were fabricated to mimic void and/or grout-air-strand (GAS) conditions inside the tendons. It was found that the GAS interface {{plays a major role in}} strand corrosion. The GAS interfaces that are typically located in the anchorage zones of harped PT girders or vertical PT columns can cause aggressive strand corrosion. At these locations, if voids are present and the environment is relatively <b>dry,</b> then limited <b>corrosion</b> of the strands occurs. However, if the presence of high relative humidity or uncontaminated and chloride-contaminated water exists at these interfaces, then corrosion activity can be high. The strands were exposed for a period of 12, 16, and 21 months, after which the remaining tension capacity was determined. The analytical program included the development of probabilistic strand capacity models (based on the experimental data) and the structural reliability models. The timevariant tension capacity predicted using the developed probabilistic models were reasonably consistent with the tendon failures observed in PT bridges in Florida and Virginia. The strength reliability model was developed based on the moment capacity and demand at midspan. Service reliability model was developed based on the allowable and applied stresses at midspan. Using these models, the time-variant strength and service reliabilities of a typical PT bridge were determined based on a set of pre-defined constant and random parameters representing void, material, exposure, prestress, structural loading, and other conditions. The strength and service reliabilities of PT bridges exposed to aggressive environmental conditions can drop below the recommended values at relatively young ages. In addition, under similar conditions the service reliability drops at a faster rate than the strength reliability...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} investigation with parallel field andlaboratory exposures {{has been}} conducted to elucidateatmospheric corrosion and metal runoff processes on copper andzinc used for roofing applications. Detailed studies have beenperformed to disclose the effect of various parameters on therunoff rate including: surface inclination and orientation,natural patination (age), patina composition, rain duration andvolume, rain pH, and length of dry periods inbetween rainevents. Annual and average corrosion rates and runoff rateshave been determined consecutively during urban field exposuresin Stockholm on naturally patinated copper and zinc of varyingage and patina composition. The corrosion rate was found todecrease with time, amounting to 6. 7 g Cu/(m 2. y) and 5. 0 gZn/(m 2. y) after 48 weeks of exposure, whereas the runoff ratewas relatively constant with time on a yearly basis, being 1. 3 g/(m 2. y) and 3. 1 g/(m 2. y) for copper and zinc, respectively. The annual runoff rate {{was found to be}} significantly lower thanthe corresponding corrosion rate for both copper and zinc. Somewhat higher runoff rates of copper were determined fromnaturally green-patinated copper (> 40 years old, 2. 0 g/(m 2. y)) compared to brown-patinated copper (1 year old). Themain reasons are specific environmental conditions combinedwith characteristics of the patina layer, which increase themagnitude of dissolved species flushed from the surface duringthe first flush volume of a rain event. No intrinsic effect ofpanel age on the runoff rate was seen for naturally patinatedzinc. However, differences in prevailing environmentalconditions during the initial exposure period and, hence,differences in formation rate and surface coverage of thecorrosion patina, resulted in variations in runoff rate. Thisinitial difference remained also during prolonged exposureperiods and was referred to as a memory effect. Model roof investigations and laboratory studies showedsurface orientation and inclination to have a detrimentaleffect on the runoff rate with high runoff rates from surfacesof low inclination from horizon and surfaces exposed towardsthe wind direction. Based on fieldexposures and literature data, a correlationwas established between the runoff rate and the prevailingSO 2 -concentration. The runoff rate increases with increasingSO 2 level for exposure sites of similar annual precipitationquantities (500 - 1000 mm/y). A rain device, using artificialrain, was shown to successfully simulate outdoor rain events ofvarying intensity and pH and result in realistic runoff ratesof both copper and zinc. The device was used to monitor changesin metal concentration and quantity of runoff water duringindividual rain events. High metal concentrations are found inthe initial rain volume flushing the surface (first flush),which decreased to rather constant metal concentrations duringthe subsequent rain volume (steady-state). The magnitude offirst flush depends primarily on environmental conditions priorto a rain event and the characteristics of the corrosionpatina. The metal concentration in runoff water increases withrain acidity, decreases with rain intensity and increases withlength of the dry period preceding a rain event. A comparison between instantaneous corrosion rates,monitored by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using a 2 -electrode set-up, and runoff rates during a continuous rainevent was performed for naturally patinated copper panels. Corrosion rates were found to be approximately 10 (brownishpatina) and 25 times (greenish patina) lower than correspondinginstantaneous runoff rates. A schematic description of the first flush and steady-stateregion of the runoff process was established. The magnitude ofthe concentration during first flush is primarily affected byprevailing environmental conditions prior to a rain event,while rain pH and intensity primarily affect the concentrationduring steady-state.

40|$|Titanium and its alloys {{are popular}} {{metallic}} implant biomaterials {{because of their}} excellent corrosion resistance and satisfactory biocompatibility. Among them, the β titanium alloys {{have the advantage of}} low Young’s moduli (compared with α and α+β titanium alloys), which can help stress transfer to the bone and reduce stress shielding. Ti- 12 Mo- 6 Zr- 2 Fe (TMZF) is one of the β titanium alloys which was developed for orthopaedics in the 1990 s. Based on the mechanical properties of TMZF in dry conditions, this alloy compares very favourably with the best of the available metallic implant materials and has been applied in total hip replacements (THR) since the 2000 s. However, after having been applied for nearly a decade, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled TMZF implants in 2011 [1]. The reason for recall is an unacceptable levels of ‘debris’ from the implant. This project is focussed on understanding the reasons and the mechanisms leading to such unacceptable levels of debris from TMZF implants in the body. THR’s operate in an aggressive saline environment, are subject to cyclic stresses for cycles of the order of 1 × 107 and the surfaces of the implant are abraded by minerals in bone, or by other artificial surfaces for multi-component implants. Any of the processes of corrosion, wear or fatigue, or synergistic combinations of them, may be responsible for the debris that led to the recall of these implants (and not of similar modular implants constructed of α+β titanium alloys). In this project, an experimental program was designed to deconstruct the complicated phenomena of corrosion-wear-fatigue into individual experiments on corrosion, wear and fatigue, followed by a systematic examination of the couplings of corrosion-wear and corrosion-fatigue. The corrosion process leads to the spontaneous formation of hydroxyapatite on the TMZF in SBF with nearly neutral pH, just as it does on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V (Ti 64) and the formation kinetics of hydroxyapatite are similar on both materials. This suggests TMZF does not have an intrinsically poor corrosion response in SBF and therefore this is unlikely to be the sole cause of the unacceptable levels of debris that led to the recall. The wear behaviour of TMZF and Ti 64 was compared in both dry conditions and in SBF (i. e. corrosion-wear). Since corrosion is an inherently time-dependent process, the coupling of corrosion with wear introduces a characteristic time scale into the wear problem. A type of ‘time dependent wear test’ was developed and performed in SBF and it is shown that unlike Ti 64 which tends to reduce its wear rate in SBF (because of lubricating properties of the fluid), the wear rate of TMZF increases dramatically in SBF, compared to <b>dry</b> conditions. The <b>corrosion</b> process in SBF leads to the deposition of particles of hydroxyapatite {{on the surface of the}} alloys which act as abrasive elements (like sand between two articulating surfaces) and greatly accelerates the wear rate of the TMZF alloy in SBF. Similar particles are formed on Ti 64 but in this case the alloy exhibits sufficient strain hardening to further strengthen the alloy and resist wear. TMZF is a β-Ti alloy and exhibits no strain hardening-any abrasive elements accelerate the wear process significantly and this is what is observed with the TMZF alloy. It is likely this is the origin of the debris that have led to the recall of this implant. The fatigue performance of TMZF was also measured in dry conditions and in SBF. Fatigue loading leads to the roughening of the component surfaces in SBF and accelerates fatigue failure. More importantly, the cyclic loading causes the cracks of the hydroxyapatite layer formed on TMZF surface leading to the release of hydroxyapatite particles from the surface layer into the surrounding environments or between the articulating surfaces. These particles act as third-body abrasives (just like the hydroxyapatite particles formed between the two sliding surfaces during corrosion-wear) to further accelerate the wear rate of TMZF alloy since it exhibit an inability to resist the abrasive wear due to the lack of strain hardening capacity. This lack of strain hardening is a general feature of β-Ti alloys and similar corrosion-wear problems should be expected for all β-Ti alloys being considered for implant applications...|$|R
