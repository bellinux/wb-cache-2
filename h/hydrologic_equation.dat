40|$|Department of Physics, 94 p. The TD 427. N 5 B 6 2009 Contamination of {{groundwater}} by nutrients originating from agricultural activities {{is an international}} environmental issue. Nitrogen leaches to groundwater {{in the form of}} nitrate, which is very mobile with negligible sorption. Field studies {{of groundwater}} quality around Lake Naivasha have indicated nitrate contamination from the agricultural activities in the area. In this study a numerical model simulating nitrate fate and transport processes in groundwater at this place was developed. The equation governing chemical fate and transport through a porous media in the saturated zone was used. The <b>hydrologic</b> <b>equation,</b> which combines the mass conservation and Darcy equation, was solved to yield the hydraulic head and consequently the velocity field that was used in the chemical transport and fate equation in accounting for the advection transport process of the chemical. Denitrification was regarded as the sole process of nitrate decay and was modeled by a first-order irreversible reaction. These equations were then discretised using the integrated finite difference method (IFDM). Various modules in solving the algorithm so obtained were implemented in object â€“ oriented computer codes. Model calibration was done using isolated field data sets obtained from empirical results on nitrate concentration levels in wells and borehole water samples around Lake Naivasha area. The model results were quantitatively in agreement with the field results. This proves the usefulness of the model as a possible management tool in monitoring groundwater quality in the area.

40|$|The hydrologic {{characteristics}} of watersheds in semiarid regions are dependent upon many variable and often interrelated factors. A quantitative {{knowledge of these}} factors and of their relative influence upon {{the system as a}} whole is needed in order to improve the efficiency of watershed management in these areas. In an attempt to develop a comprehensive simulation model of a semiarid watershed, research workers in the Agricultural Research Service considered the electronic quently signed with Utah State University. Analog modeling concepts are based upon the development of basic relationships which describe the various processes which occur within the surface hydrologic system of a semiarid watershed. Once established, the model is applicable to any particular geographic unit by determining the appropriate constants of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>equations.</b> The analog computer is ideally suited to the many time-dependent differential equations which are encountered in hydrologic systems. To test individual equations and to verify the model, a subbasin of Walnut Gulch watershed in southern Arizona was simulated. In preliminary tests, close agreement was achieved between the observed and computed runoff hydrographs for a single storm. Some progress is also reported in the development of an analog technique to plot isohyetal lines corresponding to selected time intervals {{during the course of a}} storm...|$|R
40|$|As demands upon {{available}} water supplies increase, {{there is an}} accompanying increase in the need to assess the downstream hydrologic system. At Utah State University this problem is being approached by electronic analog simulation of the hydrologic system. Modeling concepts are based upon the development of basic relationships which describe the various hydrologic processes. Within a system, these relationships are linked by the continuity -of-mass principle which requires a hydrologic balance at all points. Once established, the model is applied to any particular geographic unit by determining the appropriate constants of the <b>hydrologic</b> <b>equations.</b> The analog computer is ideally suited to {{the solution of the}} many time-dependent differential equations which are encountered in the hydrologic systems. The complexity of a hydrologic model depends to a large extent upon the magnitude of the time and spatial increments utilized in the model. In this study the mathematical development was based on the concepts of relatively small increments of space and large time increments. The model is, therefore, applicable to in-basin probelms involving a time increment of, for example, one month. To test individual equations and to verify the model, the Circle Valley subbasin of the Servier River system in Utah was simulated. Close agreement between computed and observed outflows was achieved on both a monthly and a total annual basis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: WEHY model takes a new {{approach}} to the modeling of hydrologic processes in order to account for the effect of heterogeneity within natural watersheds. Toward this purpose, the point-scale conservation <b>equations</b> for various <b>hydrologic</b> processes were upscaled in order to obtain their ensemble averaged forms at the scale of the computational grid areas. Over hillslopes these grid areas correspond to areas along a complete transect of a hillslope. The resulting upscaled conservation equations, although they are fundamentally one-dimensional, have the lateral source/sink terms that link them dynamically to other hydrologic component processes. In this manner, these upscaled equations possess the dynamic interaction feature of the standard point scale two dimensional <b>hydrologic</b> conservation <b>equations.</b> A significant computational economy is achieved by the capability of the upscaled <b>equations</b> to compute <b>hydrologic</b> flows over large transactional grid areas versus the necessity of computing hydrologic flows over small grid areas by point-scale equations in order to account for the effect of environmental heterogeneity on flows. The emerging parameters in the upscaled <b>hydrologic</b> conservation <b>equations</b> are areal averages and areal variances/covariances of the original point-scale parameters, thereby quantifying the spatial variation of the original point-scale parameters over a computational grid area, and, thus, the effect of land heterogeneity on hydrologic flows. Also, by requiring only areal average and areal variance/covariance of paramete...|$|R

Solution of the <b>hydrologic</b> continuity <b>equation</b> was the analytical method used in determining the budget. Outflow to the lake was obtained as the residual between all items of inflow and other items of outflow. Three budgets were made using different techniques of estimating {{some of the items}} in the equation in order to serve as comparison checks on the final value of outflow to the lake. The time base period for the three budgets was the 25 year period 1939 to 1963. The average annual outflow to the Great Salt Lake was estimated to be between 863, 000 and 1, 097, 000 acre feet...|$|R
40|$|Hydrologic {{modeling}} concerns {{itself with}} understanding and prediction of different {{components of the}} hydrologic cycle by solving abstract representations of respective hydrologic processes. This course develops a quantitative approach to the processes that govern movement and storage of water near and under the land-surface including interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration, groundwater baseflow, runoff, and transport of contaminants. After successful completion of this course, students will possess an in-depth understanding of how and where hydrologic models can be used, and will be prepared to address water quantity (e. g. floods, droughts, climate change impacts etc.) and quality (e. g. contamination of groundwater, lakes and river due to point and non-point sources) problems using computer models. The course discusses in detail different approximations of <b>hydrologic</b> process <b>equations</b> and limitations and uncertainty associated with different process representations. In regard to process approximations, models that are briefly discussed in the course include TopModel, Stanford Watershed Model, HEC-HMS, SWAT, HSPF, RUSLE, SPARROW, PIHM etc. The course, however, does not conduct tutorial of these models.

40|$|Estimates of {{ground-water}} recharge rates {{developed from}} hydrologic modeling studies are presented for 3 -Springs and East Stewart basins, two small basins (analog sites) located in central Nevada. The analog-site studies {{were conducted to}} aid in the estimation of recharge to the paleohydrologic regime associated with ground water in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain under wetter climatic conditions. The two analog sites are located to the north and at higher elevations than Yucca Mountain, and the prevailing (current) climatic conditions at these sites is thought to be representative of the possible range of paleoclimatic conditions in the general area of Yucca Mountain during the Quaternary. Two independent modeling approaches were conducted at each of the analog sites using observed hydrologic data on precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, stream discharge, and chloride-ion water chemistry for a 6 -year study period (October 1986 through September 1992). Both models quantify the <b>hydrologic</b> water-balance <b>equation</b> and yield estimates of ground-water recharge, given appropriate input data. Results of the modeling approaches support the conclusion that reasonable estimates of average-annual recharge to ground water range from about 1 to 3 centimeters per year for 3 -Springs basin (the drier site), and from about 30 to 32 centimeters per year for East Stewart basin (the wetter site). The most reliable results are those derived from a reduced form of the chloride-ion model because they reflect integrated, basinwide processes in terms of only three measured variables: precipitation amount, precipitation chemistry, and streamflow chemistry...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 18 Manual (HEC-18) was {{published}} by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This manual includes several techniques of estimating scour depth. The empirical scour equations for live bed scour, clear water scour, and local scour at piers and abutment are shown in Chapter 5-General Scour section. The total scour depth is determined by adding three scour components which includes the long-term aggradation and degradation of the river bed, general scour at the bridge and local scour at the piers or abutment. However, research had shown that the standard equations in HEC-18 over-predict scour depth {{for a number of}} hydraulic and geologic conditions. Most of the HEC-18 relationships are based on laboratory flume studies conducted with sand-sized sediments increased with factors of safety that are not easily recognizable or adjustable. Sand and fine gravel are the most easily eroded bed materials, but streams frequently contain much more scour resistant materials such as compact till, stiff clay, and shale. The consequences of using design methods based on a single soil type are especially significant for many major physiographic provinces with distinctly different geologic conditions and foundation materials. This can lead to overly conservative design values for scour in low risk or non-critical <b>hydrologic</b> conditions. Thus, <b>equation</b> improvements are continued to be made in an effort to minimize the underestimation and overestimation of scour.|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{population}} growth, constructions, urbanization, and industrialization {{have increased}} impervious area causing hazardous impact towards rate of stormwater infiltrated into soil. Thus the surface overland flow in a post-development area becomes {{greater than the}} pre-development area. Concepts of infiltration mechanism need to be reviewed in order to sustain the existing environmental condition. This study aims to determine areas and volume of overland flow generated from Infiltration Excess Overland Flow (IEOF) process by comparing the empirical Horton equation and physically based Green-Ampt equation with the visualisation of spatially based Geographic Information System (GIS) <b>hydrologic</b> modelling. Both <b>equations</b> are analysed by stressing on spatial data handling techniques of map projections and scales. This study is carried out at Sungai Pinang basin, located in North East coast of Penang Island, Malaysia. The areas and volume of IEOF are determined and compared with two different map projections; the Rectified Skew Orthomophic (RSO) and Cassini-Soldner projections with the map scale of 1 : 25 000. Digital layers of Sungai Pinang basin are developed using Autodesk Map 2004 software, while GIS based hydrologic modelling to determine areas and volumes of IEOF are performed using Avenue Script and Spatial Analyst extension within ArcView GIS software.
