5000|$|In the Bode plot of a {{transimpedance}} amplifier with no compensation, the flat curve with the peak, labeled I-to-V gain, is the frequency {{response of the}} {{transimpedance amplifier}}. The peaking of the gain curve is typical of uncompensated or poorly compensated transimpedance amplifiers. The curve labeled AOL is the open-loop response of the amplifier. The feedback factor, plotted as a reciprocal, is labeled 1/β. In Fig. 5 the 1/β curve and AOL form an equilateral triangle with the frequency axis. The two sides have equal but opposite slopes, since one {{is the result of}} a first-order pole, and the other of a first-order zero. Each slope has a magnitude of 20 dB/decade, corresponding to a phase shift of 90°. When the amplifier's 180° of phase inversion is added to this, the result is a full 360° at the fi intercept, indicated by the dashed vertical line. At that intercept, 1/β = AOL for a loop gain of AOLβ = 1. Oscillation will occur at the frequency fi because of the 360° phase shift, or positive feedback, and the unity gain.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 As CMOS {{processes}} keep {{scaling down}} devices, the maximum operating frequencies of CMOS devices increase, and hence circuits can process very wide band signals. Moreover, the small physical dimensions of transistors allow the placing of many more blocks {{into a single}} chip, including highly accurate analog blocks and complicated digital blocks, which can process audio to communication data. Nowadays, wideband and low-power data converter is mandatory for mobile applications which need a bridge between analog and digital blocks. In this dissertation, low-power and wideband techniques are proposed. An embedded-adder quantizer with dynamic preamplifier is proposed to achieve power-efficient operation. Various double-sampling schemes are studied, and novel schemes are presented to achieve wideband operation without noise folding effect. To reduce timing delay and idle tones, a high speed DEM which alternates two sets of comparator references is proposed. Multi-cell architecture is studied to insure higher performance {{when the number of}} modulators increases. 0. 18 um double-poly/ 4 -metal CMOS process was used to implement a prototype IC. 20 MHz signal bandwidth was achieved with a 320 MHz sampling clock.
