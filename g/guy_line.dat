A nonintrusive measuring system is proposed to monitor the integrity of such <b>guy</b> <b>line</b> ground anchors. The natural longitudinal frequency of the partially buried anchor rod with a terminal buried plate attached can be measured periodically with an accelerometer. An increase in this frequency over time would indicate a possible corrosion-induced loosening of the ground anchor from its buried terminal plate, and the need for anchor replacement. A case study involving an aging and failed utility pole anchor illustrates the need for such frequency monitoring...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of fixed}} {{platforms}} {{of either the}} gravity of jacket type in water depths exceeding three hundred and fifty meters would so escalate the size of these conventional platforms as to render recovery of oil uneconomical. Alternative platform concepts such as the guyed tower (Finn, 1976) {{take advantage of the}} effect of compliance to the wave action. However, such a concept introduces the main problem for deep-water platforms namely the dynamic interaction of waves and structure. Assuming the tower to be of uniform flexuaral rigidity and uniform weight per unit length, a modified Morison’s equation was used to determine the horizontal wave loads on the tower. The equation of motion for the horizontal displacement of the deck was set up and a Crank-Nicholson finite-difference algorithm was employed to solve the equation of motion of the tower. Water particle velocity and acceleration used in the wave loading computation were obtained using linear diffraction theory (MacCamy and Fuchs, 1954). In the development of the computer model the tower was represented as an equivalent be 3 am and the distributed wave load was resolved into concentrated nodal forces. Experimentally determined coefficients for damping, restoring and the mass of the tower were used for solving equation of motion. – In order to compare the predictions of the computer model with the performance of a physical model, a model of the guyed tower was constructed and tested in a wave tank. The tower was supported by eight guy wires each having a model weight per unit length of 5. 21 N/m. Deck displacements of the tower were monitored by means of rotary transducers and the <b>guy</b> <b>line</b> tensions were monitored using ring transducers placed directly in the lines. The damping coefficient of the model was determined experimentally by displacing the model and using the logarithmic decrement obtained from a record of its free oscillation. The restoring coefficient was also determined experimentally by generating a plot of total restoring force versus deck offset of the model tower. Fairly good agreement between the computer model results and the physical model test results was found for the deck displacement...|$|E
40|$|Several topics {{related to}} lifting {{gantries}} have been studied. These are the modelling of the structure, the structural behaviour of the gantry, the input {{parameters of the}} model and the standards used for the design. A hand calculation model, based on the analysis of built-up compression members in EN 1993 - 1 - 1, has been developed that describes the behaviour of a portal like gantry structure. The model executes geometrically non-linear calculations, that {{take into account the}} second order effects from the deformation of the gantry, and determines the resistance of the gantry based on the axial forces in its chords and on stability checks. Three different mast sections, out of which the gantry columns are made, have been investigated: MSG, DS and NYW. The latter is currently under developed by Mammoet and is called a New York Wheel mast section. The focus is on the application of this section type. The gantry in the model is subject to a vertical load from the self-weight of the mast sections, a vertical load from the weight of the payload and a horizontal point load {{at the top of the}} gantry. The latter accounts for operational loads and wind loads on both the structure and the payload. In the model the horizontal load is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the payload. The resistances obtained from the hand calculation model are within 5 % of the resistances obtained from a numerical benchmark model, for the gantry configurations considered. Therefore, the model is considered accurate enough for a preliminary design. It is able to represent a rigid and a flexible foundations, as well as a hinged and a rigid connection between the columns and beam(s) of the gantry. From the calculations with the hand calculation model several conclusions were drawn. The horizontal load is of large influence for the maximum payload, much larger than the influence of the global imperfection. The difference can easily be between 10 -to- 30 % for the NYW mast sections, between 2 % and 4 % horizontal load. Also, the influence is larger for a gantry with a rigid beam-column connection than for a hinged connection. Calculating with a different imperfection, for example no imperfection instead of 1 / 250 of the gantry height, result in a 6 -to- 10 % resistance difference. The resistance of a gantry with a rigid connection at the top is considerably larger than for a hinged connection, for an asymmetric section like the NYW mast sections. A rigid connection yields a 1. 5 to 4 times higher resistance than a hinged connection, when NYW sections are used on a rigid foundation. The resistance for the three mast section types under consideration has been compared for a rigid foundation. It turns out that for both a hinged and a rigid beam-column connection the NYW sections can bear the highest payload, by far. The resistance to tensile forces, mostly governed by the strength of the connections, is much lower for the MSG sections than for the DS sections. Also, a rigid connection significantly improves the asymmetrical DS sections. For relevant gantry heights the MSG sections can bear a payload that is roughly 50 % of the payload that the DS sections can carry, for a hinged top connection. For a rigid connection it is around 30 %. The DS sections can carry 15 -to- 25 % of the load the NYW sections can carry, for a hinged connection. For a rigid connection it is 25 -to- 35 %. The stiffness of the foundation has been modelled with the method of Pais and Kausel (1988). It appeared that the stiffness of the foundation can have a significant influence on the resistance of the gantry. The MSG sections are more susceptible to a flexible foundation, because of their relatively small base frame. This results in a much smaller rotational stiffness at the bottom of the gantry columns. A foundation on dense sand leads to a resistance decrease around 5 % for the NYW sections and around 35 % for the MSG sections. One of the goals of this thesis was to incorporate the use of guy lines into the model and to investigate their influence on stability, stiffness and ultimately resistance. A preliminary study showed great potential for the use of guy lines. The buckling length can be reduced by around 50 %, almost to the point where a column with a fixed end at the top is resembled. Also, the first order deflection can be reduced significantly, as over 75 % of the horizontal load is taken by the guy lines. This means that the second order effects are drastically reduced. The reduction also has a positive effect on the first order bending moments in the column. A <b>guy</b> <b>line</b> that is installed under a 60 degree angle with the foundation turns out to be effective in both supporting the column and minimizing the gantry footprint. The behaviour of guy lines is highly non-linear. Therefore, it was found challenging to incorporate them in the final hand calculation model accurately. However, the evidence from the preliminary design leads to the recommendation to further investigate the application of guy lines. Several standards have been studied for the design of the gantry. It was concluded that the European crane standard EN 13001 - 1 is best suited to take into account the loads on the structure and that the structural behaviour of the gantry is best described using the European building standard EN 1993 - 1 - 1. The global imperfection of the gantry is a parameter of interest. Mammoet wants to calculate with an imperfection that equals one thousandth of the height of the gantry, since they believe their gantries can be erected with such high precision. The standards under consideration prescribe a larger imperfection, typically 1 / 500. The fabrication and erection tolerances are however much tighter for the mast sections than provided by the standards. Therefore, a smaller imperfection (1 / 1000) can be justified, except for very tall gantries and gantries in storm conditions. The horizontal load on the gantry varies between 2. 5 % and 4 % of the weight of the payload, depending on the direction, the weight of the payload and whether or not skidding of the load is involved. A larger portion of the horizontal load comes from wind loads, of which the load on the object to be lifted is a substantial part. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the wind load.
