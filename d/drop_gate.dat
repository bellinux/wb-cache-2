(Note that lock 6 had been converted to a <b>drop</b> <b>gate,</b> and later converted back to a V gate.)

60|$|Kala Nag stood ten fair {{feet at the}} shoulders, and his tusks {{had been}} cut off short at five feet, and bound round the ends, to prevent them splitting, with bands of copper; but he could do more with those stumps than any untrained {{elephant}} could do with the real sharpened ones. When, after weeks and weeks of cautious driving of scattered elephants across the hills, the forty or fifty wild monsters were driven into the last stockade, and the big <b>drop</b> <b>gate,</b> made of tree trunks lashed together, jarred down behind them, Kala Nag, at the word of command, would go into that flaring, trumpeting pandemonium (generally at night, when the flicker of the torches {{made it difficult to}} judge distances), and, picking out the biggest and wildest tusker of the mob, would hammer him and hustle him into quiet while the men {{on the backs of the}} other elephants roped and tied the smaller ones.|$|E
6000|$|Now {{you must}} be content to skip ten or eleven whole years, and only guess at all the {{wonderful}} life that Mowgli led among the wolves, because if it were written out it would fill ever so many books. He {{grew up with the}} cubs, though they, of course, were grown wolves almost before he was a child. And Father Wolf taught him his business, and the meaning of things in the jungle, till every rustle in the grass, every breath of the warm night air, every note of the owls above his head, every scratch of a bat's claws as it roosted for a while in a tree, and every splash of every little fish jumping in a pool meant just as much to him as the work of his office means to a business man. When he was not learning he sat out in the sun and slept, and ate and went to sleep again. When he felt dirty or hot he swam in the forest pools; and when he wanted honey (Baloo told him that honey and nuts were just as pleasant to eat as raw meat) he climbed up for it, and that Bagheera showed him how to do. Bagheera would lie out on a branch and call, [...] "Come along, Little Brother," [...] and at first Mowgli would cling like the sloth, but afterward he would fling himself through the branches almost as boldly as the gray ape. He took his place at the Council Rock, too, when the Pack met, and there he discovered that if he stared hard at any wolf, the wolf would be forced to drop his eyes, and so he used to stare for fun. At other times he would pick the long thorns out of the pads of his friends, for wolves suffer terribly from thorns and burs in their coats. He would go down the hillside into the cultivated lands by night, and look very curiously at the villagers in their huts, but he had a mistrust of men because Bagheera showed him a square box with a <b>drop</b> <b>gate</b> so cunningly hidden in the jungle that he nearly walked into it, and told him that it was a trap. He loved better than anything else to go with Bagheera into the dark warm heart of the forest, to sleep all through the drowsy day, and at night see how Bagheera did his killing. Bagheera killed right and left as he felt hungry, and so did Mowgli--with one exception. As soon as he was old enough to understand things, Bagheera told him that he must never touch cattle because he had been bought into the Pack at the price of a bull's life. [...] "All the jungle is thine," [...] said Bagheera, [...] "and thou canst kill everything that thou art strong enough to kill; but {{for the sake of the}} bull that bought thee thou must never kill or eat any cattle young or old. That is the Law of the Jungle." [...] Mowgli obeyed faithfully.|$|E

However, assembly problems and malfunctioning hardware on drop gates can cause the formation of gaps, which have been attributed to infant deaths and other major injuries. In June 2011, the United States implemented new safety standards requiring all infant beds manufactured and sold in the country to have fixed sides. In June 2016, Canada implemented a similar ban on the sale, importation, or distribution of any infant bed containing drop sides effective December 29, 2016.|$|E

50|$|Under normal tidal conditions, {{the gates}} {{are full of}} water and rest in their housing structures.

For this study, ageing has been obtained using repetitive short-circuit operations. Among monitored parameters during ageing, on-state resistance and short-circuit current level are those, which have the strongest evolution. The top-metal degradation has been characterized via the on-state resistance measurement during ageing. In particular, we clearly show that the top-metal restructuration due to ageing leads to an additional voltage <b>drop</b> between <b>gate</b> and source terminals and results to a lower gate-source junction voltage...|$|R
