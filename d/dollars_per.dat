5|$|Because of its rarity, it {{is among}} the most {{expensive}} elements. Price for pure scandium fluctuates between 4 000 and 20 000 US <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> kilogram. Meanwhile, the limited market generates a variety of prices at any given time. In 2010, {{at the peak of the}} rare-earths shortage, the price of scandium rose to over 15,000 US <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> kilogram, and the widely commercially used scandium oxide (Sc2O3) was selling above 7 000 US <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> kilogram. Since then the limited demand coupled with steady production keeps the price at its 20-year average.|$|E
5|$|The interdiction campaigns {{were also}} expensive. Igloo White cost around one billion <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> year to operate. The {{cost of the}} bombing {{operations}} that the sensors supported amounted to approximately 18.2million <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> week.

30|$|In this case, {{short-term}} {{scheduling problem}} is solved considering DRP. It {{should be noted}} that the consumer load profile is changed. In this case, the corresponding DisCo and DGO benefits are equal to 4368.16 and 1768.31 <b>dollar</b> <b>per</b> day in passive management, respectively. In active management, for DisCo and DGO benefits these values will be 6176.78 and 1687.76 <b>dollar</b> <b>per</b> day, respectively. Results indicate that DisCo and DGO benefits have increased with considering DRP in passive network. In active network, because the sold reactive power by DGO will be zero, the result is slightly different so that DGO benefit is decreased.|$|R

5|$|Woods {{decided the}} jury for the Broadway run would employ some jury service {{rules of the}} New York courts. One such rule was the payment of jurors three <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> day for their participation, which meant the {{selected}} audience members profited by at least 25 cents after subtracting the ticket price. Another was that only men could serve on a jury, although Woods made exceptions, for example at the performance Keller attended. He later loosened the rule to allow women jurors at matinee performances twice a week. Unlike a normal criminal trial, verdicts required only a majority vote rather than unanimity.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{calculate}} the true economic value of unpaid work, which {{is not included in}} measures such as gross domestic product, have shown that this value is enormous. In the United States, it has been estimated to be between 20–50%, meaning that the true value of unpaid work is trillions of <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> year. For other countries, the percentage of GDP may be even higher, such as the United Kingdom, where is may be as high as 70%. Because this unpaid work is largely done by women and is unreported in economic indicators, it results in these contributions by women being devalued in a society.|$|E

5|$|In 1994, the Nuclear Posture Review study {{determined}} that, of the 18 Ohio SSBNs the U.S. Navy {{would be}} operating in total, 14 {{would be sufficient}} for the strategic needs of the U.S. The {{decision was made to}} convert four Ohio-class boats into SSGNs capable of conducting conventional land attack and special operations. As a result, the four oldest boats of the class—Ohio, Michigan, Florida, and Georgia—progressively entered the conversion process in late 2002 and were returned to active service by 2008. The boats could thereafter carry 154 Tomahawk cruise missiles and 66 special operations personnel, among other capabilities and upgrades. The cost to refit the four boats was around US$1billion (2008 <b>dollars)</b> <b>per</b> vessel.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{choosing}} an open register are varied and include tax avoidance, {{the ability to}} avoid national labor and environmental regulations, {{and the ability to}} hire crews from lower-wage countries. National or closed registries typically require a ship be owned and constructed by national interests, and at least partially crewed by its citizens. Conversely, open registries frequently offer on-line registration with few questions asked. The use of flags of convenience lowers registration and maintenance costs, which in turn reduces overall transportation costs. The accumulated advantages can be significant, for example in 1999, 28 of the American company SeaLand's fleet of 63 ships were foreign-flagged, saving the company up to 3.5 million <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> ship every year.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol has a {{long history}} of use and misuse {{throughout}} recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness led to the failed prohibition of alcohol being considered and eventually enforced briefly in America. In 2005 alcohol dependence and abuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220 billion <b>dollars</b> <b>per</b> year, more than cancer and obesity.|$|E
