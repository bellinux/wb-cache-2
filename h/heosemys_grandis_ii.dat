40|$|Specimens of 6 {{species of}} threatened, vulnerable, and {{endangered}} turtles (Cuora amboinensis, Cyclemys dentata, <b>Heosemys</b> <b>grandis,</b> Orlitia borneensis, Pyxidea mouhotii, and Siebenrockiella crassicollis) belonging to family Bataguridae, were confiscated in Hong Kong, China on 11 December 2001 by international authorities. Endohelminth studies on these turtle species are scarce, and this study provided {{a rare opportunity}} to examine a limited number of specimens for endohelminths. Ten different parasite species were collected and there were 16 new host records. This is the first record of a parasite from P. mouhotii. The parasite prevalences found in this study provide a basis for {{a better understanding of the}} phylogenetic relationships of the family Bataguridae to other families, especially Testudinidae. Based on known life cycles, parasites found provided an indication of food preferences of these 6 turtle species that support previous studies of the turtles' feeding habits. However, the results of the parasite survey from O. borneensis provided additional feeding habit information. The list of endohelminths herein is intended to provide a foundation for future parasite studies of the 6 species of Asian turtles...|$|R
40|$|The {{oropharynx}} as {{a functional}} entity plays {{a fundamental role in}} feeding. Transitions from aquatic to terrestrial lifestyles in vertebrates demanded major {{changes of the}} oropharynx for the required adaptations to a different feeding environment. Extant turtles evolved terrestrial feeding modes in three families (testudinids, emydids, geoemydids) –independently from other amniotes–and are therefore important model organisms to reconstruct morpho-functional changes behind aquatic-terrestrial transitions. In this study we hypothesized that the oropharyngeal morphology in semiaquatic turtles of the geoemydid family shows parallels to testudinids, the only purely terrestrial extant lineage. We provide an in-depth description of the oropharynx in the semiaquatic geoemydid <b>Heosemys</b> <b>grandis</b> by using a combination of micro computed tomography (micro-CT) and subsequent digital in situ 3 -D reconstruction, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and histology. We show that H. grandis has a large tongue with rough papillose surface and well-developed lingual muscles. The attachment sites of the lingual muscles on the hyolingual skeleton and their courses within the tongue are nearly identical with testudinids. The hyolingual skeleton itself is mainly cartilaginous and shows distinct–but compared to testudinids rather small–anterior extensions of the hyoid body and hypoglossum. Oral glands are well developed in H. grandis but are smaller and simpler than in testudinids. Similarly, oropharyngeal keratinization was minimal and found only in the anterior palate, regions close to the beak, and tongue tip. We conclude that H. grandis shows distinct oropharyngeal morpho...|$|R
40|$|Quaternary fauna and flora fossils {{were found}} in situ in a sand pit at the Khok Sung village of Khok Sung Subdistrict, Muang District, Nakhon Ratchasima province. Six lithostratigraphic units from unit 1 to unit 6 in {{ascending}} order were recognized in the sand pit. The sediments in the Khok Sung sand pit were deposited as two meandering channel sets. Units 1, 2, and 3 form the lower channel sequence, and units 4, 5, and 6 form the upper channel sequence. The lower channel unconformably overlies bedrock and generally flowed northward, whereas the upper channel flowed eastward. The parent rocks of the Khok Sung sediments crop out in the western margins of the Khorat Plateau. The flora fossils include fruits (Ziziphus khoksungensis (Rhamnaceae), Dipterocarpus costatus (Dipterocarpaceae), Melia azedarach, and Dracontomelon dao (Anacardiaceae)), seeds, leaves, wood, tubers (Cyperus or Bolboschoenus (Cyperaceae)), amber, and pollen. This assemblage suggests the presence of tropical mixed deciduous and dry evergreen forests. The fauna fossils include fish, gavial (Gavialis cf. bengawanicus), tortoise (Batangur cf. trivittata, Heosemys annandalii, <b>Heosemys</b> cf. <b>grandis,</b> and Malayemys sp.), soft shell turtle (Chitra sp., and cf. Amyda sp.), bovids, rhinoceros, deer, an advanced form of Stegodon, and hyena. The fauna indicate that the climate differed from today, with heavier rainfall and more extensive grassland areas during the Pleistocene. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus {{is a vast}} genus {{encompassing}} species used as ornamentals, for landscaping {{but also}} for wood production. The possibility to clone field selected individuals by rooted cuttings was assessed on Eucalyptus urophylla × Eucalyptus grandis, studying the influences of donor plant age, within-shoot position and season on adventitious rooting ability of the cuttings. The plant material consisted of (i) 8 year-old mature rooted cuttings derived from a 24 year-old E. urophylla × E. <b>grandis</b> genotype and (<b>ii)</b> 3 month-old juvenile seedlings issued from the same parents as the mature genotype. Crown-collected terminal cuttings rooted better when coming from juvenile than from mature individuals particularly {{during the dry season}} but not during the rainy season. Nodal cuttings collected from sprouting stumps of the same juvenile and mature sources after felling of the original ortets displayed similar survival and rooting rates, notwithstanding noticeable variations according to the seasons and to the initial position of the cuttings within the shoot from which they originated. Overall, juvenile nodal cuttings produced more adventitious roots than mature ones, but this criterion had no significant practical impact on further survival and growth of the rooted cuttings at the planting time and later.

40|$|Specimens of {{the genus}} Bactrocera were {{collected}} from several host plants in northern and western Thailand. They were morphologically recognized as Bactrocera tau and were subdivided into eleven samples according to host plant, geographic origin and time of collection. Twelve landmarks of the right wing were described {{in a total of}} 264 males and 276 females. An exploratory analysis using kernel density estimates was performed on the multivariate morphometric space. Non-parametric classification highlighted the existence of two non-overlapping clusters within both males and females. The clusters were not congruent with geography. One cluster (cluster I) contained only one plant, Momordica cochinchinensis, the other one (cluster II) contained five different plants including M. cochinchinensis. Further morphometric analyses on selected samples indicated that the influence of the plants on the shape of the wing could not explain satisfactorily the presence of two clusters. Genetic techniques identified the presence of B. tau cryptic species C in M. cochinchinensis from cluster I. and of B. tau cryptic species A in Coccinia <b>grandis</b> from cluster <b>II.</b> Our working hypothesis is that the two clusters identified by geometric morphometrics were species A and C, respectively...|$|R
