60|$|The {{case of the}} East India Company is {{different}} even {{from that of the}} greatest of these corporations. No monopoly of trade, beyond their own limits, is vested in the corporate body of any town or city in the kingdom. Even within these limits the monopoly is not general. The Company has the monopoly of the trade of half the world. The first corporation of the kingdom has for the object of its jurisdiction only a few matters of subordinate police. The East India Company governs an empire, through all its concerns and all its departments, from the lowest office of economy to the highest councils of state,--an empire to which Great Britain is in comparison but a respectable province. To leave these concerns without superior cognizance would be madness; to leave them to be judged in the courts below, on the principles of a confined jurisprudence, would be folly. It is well, if the whole legislative power is competent to the correction of abuses which are commensurate to the immensity of the object they affect. The idea of an absolute power has, indeed, its terrors; but that objection lies to every Parliamentary proceeding; and as no other can regulate the abuses of such a charter, it is fittest that sovereign authority should be exercised, where it is most likely to be attended with the most effectual correctives. These correctives are furnished by the nature and course of Parliamentary proceedings, and by the infinitely diversified characters who compose the two Houses. In effect and virtually, they form a vast number, variety, and succession of judges and jurors. The fulness, the freedom, and publicity of discussion leaves it easy to distinguish what are acts of power, and what the determinations of equity and reason. There prejudice corrects prejudice, and the different asperities of party zeal mitigate and neutralize each other. So far from violence being the general characteristic of the proceedings of Parliament, whatever the beginnings of any Parliamentary process may be, its <b>general</b> <b>fault</b> in the end is, that it is found incomplete and ineffectual.|$|E

However, {{there is a lack}} of compelling evidence that they are useful for finding faults, specifically so when compared to random testing. This paper challenges the idea of using coverage crite-ria for test selection and instead proposes an approach based on fault models. We define a <b>general</b> <b>fault</b> model as a transformation from cor-rect to incorrect programs and/or a partition of the input data space. Thereby, we leverage the idea of fault injection for test assessment to test derivation. We instantiate the developed <b>general</b> <b>fault</b> model to describe existing fault models.

50|$|A <b>general</b> {{protection}} <b>fault</b> (GPF) in the Intel x86 and AMD x86-64 {{instruction set}} architectures (ISAs), {{as well as}} other ISAs, is a fault (a type of interrupt) initiated by ISA-defined protection mechanisms in response to an access violation caused by some running code, either in the kernel or a user program. The mechanism is first described in Intel manuals and datasheets for the 80286 CPU, which was introduced in 1983; it is also described in section 9.8.13 in the Intel 80386 programmer's reference manual from 1986. A <b>general</b> protection <b>fault</b> is implemented as an interrupt (vector number 13 in decimal) in both the x86 and the AMD64 architectures.

We then develop bisimulation proof techniques to verify fault tolerance properties of distributed programs and show they are sound with respect to our definitions for fault tolerance...|$|R
