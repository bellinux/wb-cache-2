40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to define the {{pharmacology}} of an intestinal epithelial [3 H]strychnine binding site. Strychnine, bru-cine, verapamil and desmethoxyverapamil bind to small intes-tinal mucosal homogenates with nanomolar affinity at a site {{not related to the}} strychnine receptor, which is in the spinal cord. The antidiarrheal agents, <b>fluperamide</b> and loperamide, and sev-eral alkaloids have an order of magnitude lower affinity. Agents that bind to cytochrome P 45011 D 6 also displace H]strychnine binding, which implies that the binding site may have some properties similar to the catalytic site of this cytochrome P 450 enzyme. We sought to define the identity of an intestinal [3 H]strychnine binding site by probing it with various phar-macological agents. Is strychnine binding in the intestine associated with chloride channels found in intestinal tissues or with some other function, such as detoxification by a P 450 complex, which is also prominently expressed in intestinal epithelia? Strychnine and brucine are alkaloids that cause convulsions of the central nervous system. Strychnine causes excitation by blocking at the conduction pore of the glycine-activated chloride channel of inhibitory neurons localized in the spinal cord and brainstem (Zarbin et al., 1981). The glycine-activated chloride channel is an outwardly rectifying channel (Bormann et al., 1987), which is a glycoprotein with a molecular mass of 246 kD that is composed of three polypeptides of molecular weights near 48, 58 and 93 k...|$|E
