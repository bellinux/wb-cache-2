40|$|In Fixing <b>Failed</b> <b>States,</b> John Yoo shows why {{intervening}} {{states that}} seek to massively transform the social, economic, and political framework of <b>failed</b> <b>states</b> aim {{to do too much}} and ultimately fail.

To give a fair reply to Yoo 2 ̆ 7 s well-argued essay, Part I will outline in some detail the major highlights of his argument and its rationale. In Part II, I will offer my response. In my view, Yoo overstates the benefits of loosening the prohibition against the use of force and the rule that occupied countries be restored to full sovereignty. By proceeding primarily from a security perspective, he offers a military solution that risks exacerbating rather than resolving the problem of <b>failed</b> <b>states.</b> His argument would have been more powerful if it were backed up by persuasive evidence and case studies to support the efficacy of his proposals.

In his 1993 book on nationalism, Pandaemonium, he wrote that as time progressed, he began to view the Soviet Union in less ideological terms. He regarded it less as an expansionist, imperialist Marxist state, and more as a weak realist state in decline. He believed it was most motivated by self-preservation. This view would influence his thinking in subsequent years, when he became an outspoken proponent of the then-unpopular view that the Soviet Union was a <b>failed</b> <b>state</b> headed for implosion.|$|E

25|$|The last {{edition of}} the Index ranks 163 {{countries}} on their internal and external levels of peace. According to the 2017 Global Peace Index, Iceland is the most peaceful {{country in the world}} while Syria is the least peaceful one. Fragile States Index(formerly known as the Failed States Index) created by the Fund for Peace focuses on risk for instability or violence in 178 nations. This index measures how fragile a state is by 12 indicators and subindicators that evaluate aspects of politics, social economy, and military facets in countries. The 2015 <b>Failed</b> <b>State</b> Index reports that the most fragile nation is South Sudan, and the least fragile one is Finland. University of Maryland publishes the Peace and Conflict Instability Ledger in order to measure peace. It grades 163 countries with 5 indicators, and pays the most attention to risk of political instability or armed conflict over a three-year period. The most recent ledger shows that the most peaceful country is Slovenia on the contrary Afghanistan is the most conflicted nation. Besides indicated above reports from the Institute for Economics and Peace, Fund for Peace, and University of Maryland, other organizations like the Economist Intelligence Unit and George Mason University release indexes that rank countries in terms of peacefulness.|$|E

500|$|As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's {{shift in}} favor of {{military}} intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called [...] "convening power" [...] to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime.
