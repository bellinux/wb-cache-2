Napoleon Murphy Brock played a saxophone amplified through a wah-wah pedal in the Frank Zappa movie The <b>Dub</b> <b>Room</b> Special, as well as on some of Zappa's albums. David Sanborn can be heard playing an alto saxophone modified by a wah-wah pedal on the David Bowie album Young Americans. Noted saxophonist King Curtis was also known to use a wah-wah pedal.
