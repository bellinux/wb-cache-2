25|$|There {{are several}} NSAIDs {{available}} for topical use, including diclofenac. A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence {{is available only}} for use of topical diclofenac and <b>ketoprofen</b> in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis. The use of topical capsaicin to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not.|$|E

50|$|In Lithuania, <b>ketoprofen</b> {{is called}} Ketoprofenum and Ketoprofenas. For topical application: the name brands are Fastum with 2.5% (gel) which {{is over the}} counter, and Ketospray with 10% (liquid spray), which must be prescribed. In Switzerland, an {{innovative}} <b>ketoprofen</b> formulation based on transfersome technology for direct application on the skin above the site to be treated has been approved.|$|E
50|$|There is {{evidence}} for topic <b>ketoprofen</b> for osteoarthritis but not other chronic musculoskeletal pain.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen</b> is {{generally}} prescribed for arthritis-related inflammatory pains or severe toothaches {{that result in}} the inflammation of the gums.|$|E
50|$|Although {{its name}} {{does not suggest}} {{similarity}} with propionic acid derivatives (e.g., <b>ketoprofen,</b> flurbiprofen, naproxen, ibuprofen, carprofen, etc.), ketorolac is an isostere of <b>ketoprofen.</b> More precisely, it is a derivative of dihydropyrrolizine carboxylic acid structurally related to indomethacin. NSAIDs are not recommended for use with other NSAIDs {{because of the potential}} for additive side effects. The protein-binding effect of most non-aspirin NSAIDs are inhibited by the presence of aspirin in the blood.|$|E
5000|$|A {{systematic}} review indicated [...] "The efficacy of orally administered <b>ketoprofen</b> in relieving moderate-severe pain and improving functional status and general condition was {{significantly better than}} that of ibuprofen and/or diclofenac." [...] A Cochrane review investigating <b>ketoprofen</b> as a single-dose by mouth in acute, moderate-to-severe postoperative pain concluded that its efficacy is equivalent to drugs such as ibuprofen and diclofenac. In particular, after dental surgery, doses >25 mg provide at least 50% pain relief to more than 60% of people treated, giving relief for about 5 hours.|$|E
5000|$|The patches {{have been}} shown to provide rapid and {{sustained}} delivery to underlying tissues without significantly increasing levels of drug concentration in the blood when compared to the traditional oral administration. <b>Ketoprofen</b> undergoes metabolism in the liver via conjugation with glucuronic acid, CYP3A4 and CYP2C9 hydroxylation of the benzoyl ring, and reduction of its keto function. [...] <b>Ketoprofen</b> is used for its antipyretic, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (COX-1 and COX-2) enzymes reversibly, which decreases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin precursors.|$|E
50|$|It {{was derived}} from propionic acid by the {{research}} arm of Boots UK during the 1960s, a period which also included the discovery of ibuprofen, indometacin, diclofenac, naproxen, <b>ketoprofen,</b> and sulindac.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen</b> was {{available}} over-the-counter in the United States {{in the form}} of 12.5 mg coated tablets (Orudis KT and Actron), but this form has been discontinued. It is available by prescription capsules.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen,</b> (RS)-2-(3-benzoylphenyl)-{{propionic acid}} (chemical formula C16H14O3) {{is one of}} the propionic acid class of nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAID) with analgesic and antipyretic effects. It acts by inhibiting the body's production of prostaglandin.|$|E
50|$|Experiments {{have found}} <b>ketoprofen,</b> like diclofenac, is a {{veterinary}} drug causing lethal effects in red-headed vultures. Vultures feeding on the carcasses of recently treated livestock suffer {{acute kidney failure}} within days of exposure.|$|E
50|$|Ibuprofen and <b>ketoprofen</b> are now {{available}} in single, active enantiomer preparations (dexibuprofen and dexketoprofen), which purport to offer quicker onset and an improved side-effect profile. Naproxen has always been marketed as the single active enantiomer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen</b> is also {{available}} as a 2.5% gel for topical application, and it is {{also available}} as a patch for topical analgesia and anti-inflammatory action. However, the gel is not sold in the United States.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} some {{differences}} in the propensity of individual agents to cause gastrointestinal ADRs. Indomethacin, <b>ketoprofen</b> and piroxicam appear to have the highest prevalence of gastric ADRs, while ibuprofen (lower doses) and diclofenac appear to have lower rates.|$|E
50|$|Some of the {{important}} clinical interactions of probenecid include those with captopril, indomethacin, <b>ketoprofen,</b> ketorolac, naproxen, cephalosporins, quinolones, penicillins, methotrexate, zidovudine, ganciclovir, lorazepam, and acyclovir. In all these interactions, the excretion of these drugs is reduced due to probenecid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen</b> {{should not}} be used in {{combination}} with other NSAIDs or corticosteroids, as this increases the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) ulceration. It should also be used with caution with other anticoagulants. It is commonly used with omeprazole, sucralfate, and cimetidine to help protect the GI tract.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen</b> is {{a common}} NSAID, antipyretic, and {{analgesic}} used in horses and other equines. It is most commonly used for musculoskeletal pain, joint problems, and soft tissue injury, as well as laminitis. It {{is also used to}} control fevers and prevent endotoxemia. It is also used as a mild painkiller in smaller animals, generally following surgical procedures.|$|E
50|$|Ibuprofen is {{produced}} industrially as a racemate. The compound, like other 2-arylpropionate derivatives (including <b>ketoprofen,</b> flurbiprofen, naproxen, etc.), does contain a chiral {{center in the}} α-position of the propionate moiety. So two enantiomers of ibuprofen occur, {{with the potential for}} different biological effects and metabolism for each enantiomer. Indeed, the (S)-(+)-ibuprofen (dexibuprofen) was found to be the active form both in vitro and in vivo.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen,</b> when {{administered}} intravenously, {{is recommended}} for a maximum of five days of use. Its analgesic and antipyretic effects begin to occur one to two hours following administration. The most common dosage is 1 mg/ lb, once per day, although this dosage may be lowered for ponies, which are most susceptible to NSAID side effects. It is also available as a capsule dosage form and a tablet.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{benoxaprofen}} {{is highly}} phototoxic. The free radical decarboxylated derivative {{of the drug}} is the toxic agent which, {{in the presence of}} oxygen, yields singlet oxygen and superoxy anion.Photochemical decarboxylation via a radical mechanism and in single-strand breaks of DNA is caused by irradiation of benoxaprofen in an aqueous solution. This also happens to <b>ketoprofen</b> and naproxen, other NSAIDs, which are even more active in this respect than benoxaprofen.|$|E
50|$|Facial grimacing by mice after {{undergoing}} laparotomy surgery indicates {{postoperative pain}} lasts for 36 to 48 h (and at relatively high levels for 8 to 12 h) with relative exacerbation {{during the early}} dark (active) photo-phase. Furthermore, the grimacing indicates that buprenorphine is fully efficacious at recommended doses against early postoperative pain, but carprofen and <b>ketoprofen</b> are efficacious only at doses much higher than currently recommended: acetaminophen is not efficacious.|$|E
50|$|In horses, it {{is given}} at {{a dose of}} 2.2 mg/kg/day. Studies have shown {{that it does not}} inhibit 5-lipoxygenase and {{leukotriene}} B4, as originally claimed. It is therefore not considered superior to phenylbutazone as previously believed, although clinical signs of lameness are reduced with its use. In fact, phenylbutazone was shown superior to <b>ketoprofen</b> in cases of experimentally-induced synovitis when both drugs were used at labeled dosages.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketoprofen</b> {{can also}} be used for {{treatment}} of some pain, especially nerve pain such as sciatica, postherpetic neuralgia and referred pain for radiculopathy, {{in the form of a}} cream, ointment, liquid, spray, or gel, which may also contain ketamine and lidocaine, along with other agents which may be useful, such as cyclobenzaprine, amitriptyline, acyclovir, gabapentin, orphenadrine and other drugs used as NSAIDs or adjuvant, atypical or potentiators for pain treatment.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} NSAIDs {{available}} for topical use, including diclofenac. A Cochrane review from 2016 concluded that reasonably reliable evidence {{is available only}} for use of topical diclofenac and <b>ketoprofen</b> in people aged over 40 years with painful knee arthritis. Transdermal opioid pain medications are not typically recommended {{in the treatment of}} osteoarthritis. The use of topical capsaicin to treat osteoarthritis is controversial, as some reviews found benefit while others did not.|$|E
50|$|The {{other major}} group of analgesics are nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAID). Acetaminophen/paracetamol {{is not always}} included in this class of medications. However, acetaminophen may be administered as a single medication or {{in combination with other}} analgesics (both NSAIDs and opioids). The alternatively prescribed NSAIDs such as <b>ketoprofen</b> and piroxicam have limited benefit in chronic pain disorders and with long-term use are associated with significant adverse effects. The use of selective NSAIDs designated as selective COX-2 inhibitors have significant cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risks which have limited their utilization.|$|E
5000|$|Dexketoprofen is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID). It is {{manufactured by}} Menarini, under the tradename Keral. It {{is available in}} the UK, as dexketoprofen trometamol, as a prescription-only drug and in Latin America as Enantyum, produced by Menarini. Also, in Italy and Spain it is available as an over-the-counter drug (OTC) under the tradenames Enantyum, and Ketesgel, respectively. In Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia it is available as an over-the-counter drug (OTC) under tradename Dolmen. In Mexico it is available in tablet form as [...] "Stadium" [...] made by Menarini. It is the dextrorotatory stereoisomer of <b>ketoprofen.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical {{offers a}} variety of {{prescription}} and over-the-counter products including transdermal patches and skin care products. Its product lines include the Salonpas pain relief patches; Mohrus Tape, a transdermal patch containing <b>ketoprofen</b> for the treatment of back pain; Vesicum, a formulation containing ibuprofen piconol; and Estrana, a transdermal therapeutic estradiol drug. According to the company, Mohrus and Mohrus-Tape have the largest market share in prescription external anti-inflammatory drugs in Japan with 54% in 2nd generation NSAID patches. [...] The firm’s over-the-counter Salonpas products include a range of external pain relieving patches and aerosols for pains such as arthritis, backache, muscle strains, sprains and bruises.|$|E
50|$|Another {{attraction}} of Transfersome {{technology is the}} carrier's ability to target peripheral, subcutaneous tissue. This ability relies on minimisation of the carrier-associated drug clearance through cutaneous blood vessels plexus: the non-fenestrated blood capillary walls in the skin together with the tight junctions between endothelial cells preclude vesicles getting directly into blood, thus maximising local drug retention and propensity to reach the peripheral tissue targets. The Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) <b>ketoprofen</b> in a Transfersome formulation gained marketing approval by the Swiss regulatory agency (SwissMedic) in 2007; the product {{is expected to be}} marketed under the trademark Diractin. Further therapeutic products based on the Transfersome technology, according to IDEA AG, are in clinical development.|$|E
50|$|Together with UGT2B4, UGT2B7 {{is capable}} of glucosidation of hyodesoxycholic acid in the liver, but, unlike the 2B4 isoform, 2B7 is also able to glucuronidate various steroid hormones (androsterone, epitestosterone) and fatty acids. It is also able to {{conjugate}} major classes of drugs such as analgesics (morphine), carboxylic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (<b>ketoprofen),</b> and anticarcinogens (all-trans retinoic acid). UGT2B7 is the major enzyme isoform for the metabolism of morphine to the main metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) which has no analgesic effect and morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G), which has analgesic effects more potent than morphine. As a consequence, altered UGT2B7 activity can significantly affect both the effectiveness and side-effects of morphine, {{as well as some}} related opiate drugs.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of other {{pharmacological}} drugs have been evaluated to determine their efficacy in reducing the frequency or severity of migraine attacks. These drugs include beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, neurostabalizers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), other antidepressants, and other specialized drug therapies. The US Headache Consortium lists five drugs as having medium to high efficacy: amitriptyline, divalproex, timolol, propranolol and topiramate. Lower efficacy drugs listed include aspirin, atenolol, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, fluoxetine, gabapentin, <b>ketoprofen,</b> metoprolol, nadolol, naproxen, nimodipine, verapamil and Botulinum A. Additionally, most antidepressants (tricyclic, SSRIs and others such as Bupropion) are listed as [...] "clinically efficacious based on consensus of experience" [...] without scientific support. Many of these drugs may give rise to undesirable side-effects, or may be efficacious in treating comorbid conditions, such as depression.|$|E
