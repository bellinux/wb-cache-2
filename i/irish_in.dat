5|$|Irish or English Irish – In England, the Irish is {{standardized}} by the NFRS as an {{equilateral triangle}} of white {{with a side}} that begins at the chest, or between the front legs, and where the point ends mid length.

5|$|A {{secondary}} rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> {{regard to}} Wood's patent; {{the rest of}} the constitutional debate was over the nature of Poynings' Law, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.|$|E
5|$|De Gray also faced {{resistance}} from the northern <b>Irish.</b> <b>In</b> 1212 he led a campaign against Áed Méith, in the promotion of which he constructed castles at Cáer Uisce, Belleek, and Clones, bases for raids against the Ua Néill territory in the north. A naval campaign was also launched, but to no avail. De Gray suffered a defeat {{at the hands of}} Cormac O'Melaghlin in 1212 at Fircal, Offaly, and left Ireland the following year. He continued to hold the office of governor for a time, but by July 1213 he had been replaced by Henry de Loundres, the Archbishop of Dublin. One of de Gray's final acts as justiciar was to take a force of Irish knights to England to help repel a threatened invasion by the French king Philip II.|$|E
5|$|Innocent consecrated Stephen Langton as {{archbishop}} against John's wishes, {{triggering a}} long {{dispute between the}} papacy and the King. The pope imposed various sanctions on England and John; at one point de Gray {{was one of only}} two bishops still legitimately holding office in England. In 1209 he became governor of Ireland for John, and spent until 1213 attempting to impose royal government on the Anglo-Norman barons and the native <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> that country. Recalled to England to help defend against a threatened invasion by the French, de Gray then travelled to Rome to secure a papal pardon after the final settlement of John and Innocent's dispute over the bishop's abortive elevation to Canterbury. After securing his pardon de Gray was appointed Bishop of Durham, but he died {{on his way back to}} England.|$|E

5|$|The Midshipmen, using {{a triple}} option {{offensive}} scheme under head coach Paul Johnson, had gained the most rushing yards of {{any team in}} the nation and had a record of 4–4 through the first eight games of the season. In their ninthgame the team defeated the Notre Dame Fighting <b>Irish</b> <b>in</b> triple overtime, ending a 43-year losing streak in the Notre Dame–Navy rivalry and improving the team's record to 5–4. With threegames remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least one more to become bowl eligible. Sponsors had arranged for Navy (which was unaffiliated with any college football conference) to play in the Poinsettia Bowl if they won six games. The Midshipmen defense allowed an average of 38.8 points per game.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Ernest {{was staying}} with the King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the <b>Irish.</b> <b>In</b> January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it would have little support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E
