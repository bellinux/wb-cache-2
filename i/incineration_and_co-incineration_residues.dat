The requirements of the Directive were developed to reflect the ability of modern incineration plants to achieve high standards of emission control more effectively.

40|$|Essent {{operates}} a coal-fired power plant, called AC- 9, in Geertruidenberg. A gasifier connected to AC- 9 thermally treats waste wood through gasification. The waste wood Essent used is demolition and construction wood, the so-called B-wood. The gas produced through gasification is {{fed into the}} connected AC- 9 where it is used as fuel. However, after the BVA’s (Besluit Verbranden Afvalstoffen) entry into force, Essent had to stop the gasification of waste wood and the subsequent use of the resulting gas as fuel. The BVA is the Dutch implementing measure of the Waste Incineration Directive (Directive 2000 / 76 /EC, WID). According to the BVA, any power plant co-incinerating products of thermal treatment of waste {{is regarded as a}} co-incineration plant irrespective {{of the quality of the}} product. In the case of a power plant connected to a gasifier, the BVA treats the whole plant as a co-incineration plant. This raises the question of whether the plant of Essent, which is treated as a co-incineration plant by the BVA, is regarded as a co-incineration plant by the WID as well. To answer the question, first, the report dealt with the highly complicated issue of what constitutes waste. Second, it studied how the WID defines <b>incineration</b> <b>and</b> <b>co-incineration</b> plant. Third, it analysed the consistency of the BVA with the WID and the EC Treaty. Fourth, to find out whether the purified producer gas from the gasifier can be characterized as a ‘clean’ secondary fuel on which the BEES (Besluiten emissie-eisen stookinstallaties A en B) should be applicable, the properties of the gas were examined and compared with the properties of clean biomass. The report also investigated how the emissions per generated MJ looked like if the power plant is fired on only coal and on a combination of coal and producer gas. Finally, the criteria distilled from the case law of the European Court of Justice were applied to the producer gas of Essent. ...|$|R
40|$|Treatment of {{municipal}} wastewater results worldwide {{in the production}} of large amounts of sewage sludge. The major part of the dry matter content of this sludge consists of nontoxic organic compounds, in general a combination of primary sludge and secondary (microbiological) sludge. The sludge also contains a substantial amount of inorganic material and a small amount of toxic components. There are many sludge-management options in which production of energy (heat, electricity, or biofuel) {{is one of the key}} treatment steps. The most important options are anaerobic digestion, co-digestion, incineration in combination with energy recovery, co-incineration in coal-fired power plants, co-incineration in combination with organic waste focused on energy recovery, use as an energy source {{in the production of}} cement or building materials, pyrolysis, gasification, supercritical (wet) oxidation, hydrolysis at high temperature, production of hydrogen, acetone, butanol, or ethanol, and direct generation of electrical energy by means of specific micro-organisms. <b>Incineration</b> <b>and</b> <b>co-incineration</b> with energy recovery and use of sewage sludge in the production of Portland cement are applied on a large scale. In these processes, the toxic organics are destructed and the heavy metals are immobilized in the ash or cement. The energy efficiency of these processes strongly depends upon the dewatering and drying step. It is expected that these applications will strongly increase in the future. Supercritical wet oxidation is a promising innovative technology but is still in the development stage. With the exception of biogas production, the other biological methods to produce energy are still in the initial research phase. Production of biogas from sewage sludge is already applied worldwide on small, medium, and large scales. With this process, a substantial experience exists and it is expected that this application is getting more and more attention. Besides the increasing focus on the recovery and reuse of energy, inorganics, and phosphorous, there is also an increasing focus to solve completely the problem of the toxic organics and inorganic compounds in sludge. In the assessment and selection of options for energy recovery by means of biological methods, this aspect has to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|Recycling plastic {{solid waste}} (PSW) is {{becoming}} more and more important, due to (i) increasing landfilling constraints and taxes and (ii) the potential recovery of energy or chemicals. Three different routes for the beneficial utilisation of PSW are primary (re-extrusion of clean production scrap), secondary (mechanical treatment of production scrap and post consumer waste) and tertiary (energy recovery through <b>incineration</b> <b>and</b> <b>co-incineration</b> in cement kilns) recycling. (Co-) incineration requires an extensive flue gas purification to meet the stringent emission norms, especially regarding some contaminants that are present in PSW, such as heavy metals (pigments), flame retardants (Br, Sb, P, ) and volatile organic compounds formed by incomplete combustion. A fourth PSW treatment route is therefore considered, namely the valorization of chemicals, which can be used as feedstock for the production of similar products. Recently, the research focus has shifted towards thermo-chemical conversion of PSW into chemicals and/or fuel, i. e. by pyrolysis in the absence of oxygen. Pyrolysis can overcome certain drawbacks of recycling <b>and</b> <b>incineration</b> because of (i) the low process temperature (350 - 500 °C), at which the contaminants remain in the carbonaceous char; (ii) the inert process atmosphere and (iii) the possibility to work on small scale. The doctoral research focuses on thermo-chemical valorization of PSW and includes: - evaluation of the impact of legislation on the evolution of the sector- critical literature survey to determine strengths and weaknesses of previous research, which will result in a final research strategy (methods, analysis techniques, ) - initial screening of plastic solid waste streams and their potential in the waste-to-chemicals concept: PE, PP, PS, PET, polycarbonate, rubber and bio-polymers- selection of the target polymers and/or elastomers- full characterization of decomposition (isothermal, dynamic, reactor) to obtain (i) kinetic expressions, (ii) product identification as function of varying process conditions and (iii) mass and energy balances for the processes- characterization of the formed formed and the potential and/or required further processing to enable reuse- selection of reactor types, preferably fluidized beds (in case they can meet the process condition requirements) - experimental analysis of the process conditions in these reactors- determination of the essential parameters (mixing, residence time, temperature, ) versus the required conversion- final combination of the different research topics in a practical design method together with calculation models- techno-economic evaluation with focus on product valorizationnrpages: 226 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Environmentally harmful {{consequences}} of fossil fuel utilisation andthe landfilling of wastes {{have increased the}} interest among the energy producers to consider the use of alternative fuels like wood fuels and Refuse-Derived Fuels, RDFs. The fluidised bed technology that allows the flexible use {{of a variety of}} different fuels is commonly used at small- and medium-sized power plants ofmunicipalities and industry in Finland. Since there is only one mass-burn plantcurrently in operation in the country and no intention to build new ones, the co-firing of pre-processed wastes in fluidised bed boilers has become the most generally applied waste-to-energy concept in Finland. The recently validated EU Directive on Incineration of Wastes aims to mitigate environmentally harmful pollutants of waste <b>incineration</b> <b>and</b> <b>co-incineration</b> of wastes with conventional fuels. Apart from gaseous flue gas pollutants and dust, the emissions of toxic tracemetals are limited. The implementation of the Directive's restrictions in the Finnish legislation is assumed to limit the co-firing of waste fuels, due to the insufficient reduction of the regulated air pollutants in the existing flue gas cleaning devices. Trace metals emission formation and reduction in the ESP, the condensing wet scrubber, the fabric filter, and the humidification reactor were studied, experimentally, in full- and pilot-scale combustors utilising the bubbling fluidised bed technology, and, theoretically, by means of reactor model calculations. The core of the model is a thermodynamic equilibrium analysis. The experiments were carried out with wood chips, sawdust, and peat, and their refuse-derived fuel, RDF, blends. In all, ten different fuels or fuel blends were tested. Relatively high concentrations of trace metals in RDFs compared to the concentrations of these metals in wood fuels increased the trace metal concentrations in the flue gas after the boiler ten- to hundred-folds, when RDF was co-fired with sawdust in a full-scale BFB boiler. In the case of peat, lesser increase in trace metal concentrations was observed, due to the higher initial trace metal concentrations of peat compared to sawdust. Despite the high removal rate of most of the trace metals in the ESP, the Directive emission limits for trace metals were exceeded in each of the RDF co-firing tests. The dominat trace metals in fluegas after the ESP were Cu, Pb and Mn. In the condensing wet scrubber, the flue gas trace metal emissions were reduced below the Directive emission limits, whenRDF pellet was used as a co-firing fuel together with sawdust and peat. High chlorine content of the RDFs enhanced the mercuric chloride formation and hence the mercury removal in the ESP and scrubber. Mercury emissions were lower than theDirective emission limit for total Hg, 0. 05 mg/Nm 3, in all full-scale co-firingtests already in the flue gas after the ESP. The pilot-scale experiments with aBFB combustor equipped with a fabric filter revealed that the fabric filter alone is able to reduce the trace metal concentrations, including mercury, in the flue gas during the RDF co-firing approximately to the same level as they are during the wood chip firing. Lower trace metal emissions than the Directive limits were easily reached even with a 40 % thermal share of RDF co-firing with sawdust. Enrichment of trace metals in the submicron fly ash particle fraction because of RDF co-firing was not observed in the test runs where sawdust was used as the main fuel. The combustion of RDF pellets with peat caused an enrichment of As, Cd, Co, Pb, Sb, and V in the submicron particle mode. Accumulation and release oftrace metals in the bed material was examined by means of a bed material analysis, mass balance calculations and a reactor model. Lead, zinc and copper were found to have a tendency to be accumulated in the bed material but also to have a tendency to be released from the bed material into the combustion gases, if the combustion conditions were changed. The concentration of the trace metal in the combustion gases of the bubbling fluidised bed boiler was found to be a summary of trace metal fluxes from three main sources. They were (1) the trace metal flux from the burning fuel particle (2) the trace metal flux from the ash in the bed, and (3) the trace metal flux from the active alkali metal layer on the sand (and ash) particles in the bed. The amount of chlorine in the system, the combustion temperature, the fuel ash composition and the saturation state of the bed material in regard to trace metals were discovered to be key factors affecting therelease process. During the co-firing of waste fuels with variable amounts of e. g. ash and chlorine, it is extremely important to consider the possible ongoingaccumulation and/or release of the trace metals in the bed, when determining the flue gas trace metal emissions. If the state of the combustion process in regard to trace metals accumulation and/or release in the bed material is not known,it may happen that emissions from the bed material rather than the combustion of the fuel in question are measured and reported...|$|R
