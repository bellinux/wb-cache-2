5|$|The three destroyers and 16 {{small boats}} left Falmouth, Cornwall, at 14:00 on 26 March 1942. They formed into {{a convoy of}} three lanes, with the destroyers in the middle. On arrival at St Nazaire the {{portside}} MLs were {{to head for the}} Old Mole to <b>disembark</b> their Commandos, while the starboard lane would make for the old entrance to the basin to <b>disembark</b> theirs. Not having the range to reach St Nazaire unaided, the MTB and MGB were taken under tow by Campbeltown and Atherstone.|$|E
5|$|Commandos {{on board}} would then <b>disembark</b> and use {{demolition}} charges to destroy nearby dock installations, searchlights and gun emplacements. The destroyer {{would then be}} blown up. At {{the same time the}} RAF would carry out a number of diversionary air raids in the area. Most of them failed because of heavy clouds and fog and very few bombers.|$|E
5000|$|All {{passengers}} boarding in Toronto {{must pay}} the regular TTC fare upon boarding. Upon crossing into York Region, TTC buses {{operate on a}} [...] "pay as you leave" [...] policy, where the YRT fare must be paid on <b>disembarking</b> from the vehicle, even if passengers board within York Region. This essentially prevents {{the use of the}} rear door for <b>disembarking.</b> However, passengers <b>disembarking</b> at Steeles Avenue do not have to pay YRT fares, even if <b>disembarking</b> {{on the north side of}} Steeles Avenue.|$|R

5|$|Siboney {{had already}} {{embarked}} troops {{for her next}} voyage when, on 3November, she was ordered to <b>disembark</b> them. She sailed the following day with an army brigadier general and his staff, and a naval draft of 500men. She arrived at Saint-Nazaire on the 12November, shortly after {{the announcement of the}} Armistice, and was met by a cheering crowd.|$|E
5|$|After briefly {{stopping}} in Albany, where its convoy was delayed due to {{concerns over the}} presence of German warships en route, the 10th Battalion departed Australian waters in November and proceeded towards Egypt. Initially, the plan had been for the battalion to continue on the United Kingdom from where it would subsequently move to the Western Front. Poor conditions and overcrowding in training camps in the United Kingdom resulted {{in the decision to}} <b>disembark</b> the Australians in Alexandria instead. Arriving there on 4 December 1914, the battalion was sent into camp at Mena, near Cairo.|$|E

40|$|Manual {{assistance}} to wheelchair-users while boarding and <b>disembarking</b> a bus {{may be an}} important risk factor for musculoskeletal disorders of bus drivers, but no study has yet assessed biomechanical loads associated with the manual assist operations. In this study, off-duty bus drivers simulated wheelchair-user assisting operations using forward and backward strategies for boarding and <b>disembarking</b> ramps. Low-back compression and shear forces, shoulder moments and percent population capable of generating required shoulder moment were estimated using the University of Michigan Three-Dimensional Static Strength Prediction Program. L 4 -L 5 compression force ranged from 401. 6 N for forward boarding to 2169. 3 N for backward boarding (pulling), and from 2052. 4 N for forward <b>disembarking</b> to 434. 2 N for backward <b>disembarking</b> (pushing). The shoulder moments were also consistently higher for the pushing tasks. It is recommended that bus drivers adopt backward boarding and forward <b>disembarking</b> strategies to reduce the biomechanical loads on the low back and shoulder. ope...|$|R
5|$|Extra {{training}} commenced {{on board}} ship, including how {{the men were}} {{to get to their}} boat stations to <b>disembark.</b> Each troop also rehearsed its own part in the mission. Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed {{one on top of the}} other, became a small compass.|$|E
5|$|In Nova Scotia, Governor Lawrence had easily {{captured}} Fort Beauséjour, and {{had then}} embarked {{on what has}} since {{become known as the}} Great Expulsion, the forcible removal of more than 12,000 Acadians from Nova Scotia. When some of the ships carrying the Acadians entered Boston Harbor in early December 1755, Shirley ordered that they not <b>disembark.</b> For three winter months, until March 1756, the Acadians remained on the ships, where half died from the cold weather and malnutrition.|$|E

5|$|On 2 December 2016, Jet Airways flight 9W7083 from Bhopal to Mumbai {{was held}} up by {{a large group of}} {{passengers}} headed for a marriage in Mumbai. There were allegations from other passengers that the wedding party was politically connected and attempted to coerce the cabin crew to <b>disembark</b> passengers, so that additional members of their party could be accommodated. The airline claimed it was a technical glitch in their booking system which led to overbooking.|$|E
5|$|Refusing to {{surrender}} until all options had been exhausted, Willoughby dispatched boats to Sirius, asking Pym if {{he believed it}} would be practical to send boats to tow Nereide out of range. Pym replied that with the boats engaged in attempting to tow Sirius and Magicienne off the reef {{it was not possible}} to deploy them under fire to tow Nereide. Pym also suggested that Willoughby <b>disembark</b> his men and set fire to his ship in the hope that the flames would spread to the French ships clustered on shore. Willoughby refused this suggestion as it was not practical to <b>disembark</b> the dozens of wounded men aboard Nereide in the growing darkness and refused to personally abandon his men when Pym ordered him to transfer to Sirius. At 11:00 pm, Willoughby ordered a boat to row to Bellone and notify the French commander that he had surrendered. However, Willoughby's boat had been holed by shot and was unable to make the short journey. The message was instead conveyed by French prisoners from Nereide who had dived overboard and reached the shore during the night. Recalling the false flags used on 20 August, Bouvet resolved to wait until morning before accepting the surrender.|$|E
5|$|Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. {{has been}} synonymous with crime and violence, and {{has one of}} the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all {{categories}} of crimes). Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, and Southern Avenue stations has existed for many years, although statistics only partially support these concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons why, in 1991, Prince George's County residents fought bus route changes that would have forced riders to <b>disembark</b> at Anacostia Station.|$|E

5|$|The convoy {{stopped for}} a few hours at Buna on 3 September, where men on the LCIs were allowed to <b>disembark.</b> At around 12:15, nine Japanese Betty bombers {{attacked}} the landing craft at Morobe, but inflicted no damage or casualties. On the night of 3/4 September, the final voyage to the landing beaches began. The landing was preceded by a short naval bombardment from five US destroyers. It was unopposed by Japanese land forces, with the small number of Japanese that were guarding the shore choosing to abandon their posts rather than fight.|$|E
5|$|After some {{discussion}} he was persuaded to <b>disembark</b> {{so that the}} Helmuth could continue operations. Leaving demolition parties aboard the cargo vessels, Ritchie then took the Helmuth further downriver to check for other shipping, but the small ship grounded on a sandbar. Assuming the route was blocked, {{he returned to the}} two cargo ships on one of the expedition's small launches. It was at this stage, whilst conducting a final inspection, that he made the discovery {{of a large number of}} empty ammunition cases and discarded bullets in the holds of the cargo ships. Deducing that the German crew had armed themselves before they left their vessels, he suspected preparations were underway to ambush his force when it attempted to leave the harbour.|$|E
5|$|As part of post-war reclamation, the old pier was demolished. Work {{commenced}} in February 1954 {{on a new}} pier on the new waterfront {{designed in}} a modern utilitarian style. The structure {{was described as a}} U-shaped plan, with an open-sided superstructure. It consisted of tiled reinforced concrete base and pillars, and was modelled after previous piers in the area. Its flat roof was also made of concrete, topped with bitumen waterproofing. Five sets of stairs allowed boat passengers to board and <b>disembark,</b> three located on the north side, one on the east and one on the west.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{conductors}} {{and engineers}} often {{knew where the}} locals lived or were headed, trains would make non-scheduled stops to <b>disembark</b> passengers to allow them a shorter walk. In the 1960s, the number of round trips was reduced to three per day, allowing the whole service to be operated with a single unit. NSB used steam power for freight trains until 1970, when NSB's last scheduled steam locomotive service hauled a gravel train from Svene to Kongsberg. For a short period during the 1980s, there were also school trains, but as this forced NSB to operate two multiple units on the line, it proved too expensive and was soon afterwards again provided by bus.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the second}} force, {{comprising}} {{the majority of}} the Brazilian troops (about 12,000 men) under the command of Caxias, had remained in Colonia del Sacramento. The Brazilian commander took the steamship Dom Afonso (named in honor of the late Prince Afonso) and entered the port at Buenos Aires to select the best place to <b>disembark</b> his troops. He expected to have to defeat the Argentine flotilla anchored there, but the force did nothing to stop him and he safely returned to Sacramento to plan his assault. The attack was aborted, however, when news arrived of the Allied victory at Caseros.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November the commandos gave {{control of}} Flushing to the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and {{prepared}} to move by sea to support {{the rest of the}} brigade at Westkapelle. Before they could <b>disembark,</b> weather conditions deteriorated and they were forced to march around the coast to reach brigade headquarters at Zoutelande. Lack of supplies curtailed their involvement in the battle for the next two days. Supplies eventually caught up with them and on 6 November they prepared to continue. By now intelligence from Dutch residents and prisoners had revealed that the remaining Germans were holed up in the wooded area between Domburg and Vrouwenpolder.|$|E
