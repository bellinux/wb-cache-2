5|$|Early games <b>involved</b> varying {{numbers of}} players. Games {{could also be}} played with uneven numbers on each side either because some failed to show or one side offered a handicap. The first match between Sheffield and Hallam <b>involved</b> 16 players versus 20. Games {{predominantly}} <b>involved</b> larger numbers than used in the modern games. In October 1863, Sheffield declared that it would only play 11 a side matches. Despite this it continued to do so on occasions. By 1867 {{the vast majority of}} matches in Sheffield <b>involved</b> teams of between 11 and 14.|$|E

5|$|Dean, a {{scientist}} and former astrologer, and psychologist Ivan Kelly conducted {{a large scale}} scientific test that <b>involved</b> {{more than one hundred}} cognitive, behavioural, physical, and other variables—but found no support for astrology.
