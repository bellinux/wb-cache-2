40|$|In {{this paper}} the intergrinding of clinker and {{limestone}} is studied and the fineness of each material is estimated Clinker and limestone, {{which are the}} main constituents of Portland-limestone cements, have different <b>grindabilities</b> and the cement properties {{are affected by the}} particle size distribution of each component. Four clinker/limestone mixtures, containing 10, 20, 30 and 40 % limestone respectively, were ground to 4 different degrees of fineness, and a sedimentation method was used in order to collect samples of different particle size. In each size fraction the limestone content was determined and finally the particle size distribution of clinker and limestone was computed. It is concluded that the presence of the easily ground limestone leads to a wider particle size distribution of the mixture. In addition, limestone is concentrated in the fine fractions (< 8 mu m) while the clinker is concentrated in the coarser fractions, Finally: it is concluded that a limestone content over 30 % obstructs the grinding of both clinker and limestone.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program {{was to develop a}} cost-effective method to determine the <b>grindability</b> of ceramics leading to cost-effective methods for machining such ceramics. In this first phase of activity, Chand Kare Technical Ceramics directed its efforts towards development of a definition for ceramic <b>grindability,</b> design of grindability-test experiments, and development of a ceramics-grindability test system (CGTS). The <b>grindability</b> study also included the establishment of the correlation between the <b>grindability</b> and conventional grinding practices. The above goals were achieved. A definition based on material removal rate under controlled force grinding was developed. Three prototypes CGTSs were developed and tested; suitable design was identified. Based on this, a fully automatic CGTS was developed and is ready for delivery to Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Comprehensive <b>grindability</b> tests for various commercially available engineering ceramics were conducted. Experimental results indicated that ceramics have significantly different grindabilities even though their mechanical properties were not significantly different. This implies that <b>grindability</b> of ceramics can be greatly improved. Further study is needed to establish correlations between microstructure and <b>grindability.</b> Therefore, <b>grindability</b> should be evaluated during the development of new ceramics or improvement of existing ones.

Firstly, the lignite samples were collected,prepared and analyzed for calorific value, total sulfur content, and proximate analysis. After that the Hardgrove grindabilitytest using ball-race test mill was performed. Knowing the Hardgrove indices, the Bond work indices of some samples wereestimated using the Aplanâ€™s formula. The approximate work indices were determined by running a batch dry-grinding testusing a laboratory ball mill. Finally, the work indices obtained from both methods were compared. It was found that allsamples could be ranked as lignite B, using the heating value as criteria, if the content of mineral matter is neglected. Similarly,all samples can be classified as lignite with the Hargrove <b>grindability</b> indices ranging from about 40 to 50. However, there isa significant difference in the work indices derived from Hardgrove and simplified Bond <b>grindability</b> tests. This may be due todifference in variability of lignite properties and the test procedures.

40|$|Crushability and <b>grindability</b> are {{traditionally}} {{used to describe}} the material properties in comminution. These parameters neglect the main objective of ore comminution, the mineral liberation and therefore information is incomplete. A new concept called liberability: the easiness of mineral liberation in comminution is introduced to fill the gap. Establishing a liberability map of a deposit requires <b>grindability</b> tests and liberation measurements for the grinding product. The liberability curve shows the degree of liberation of the mineral against grinding energy and offers better baseline for resource optimization than the <b>grindability</b> curve. A case study with a magnetite iron ore from Malmberget, northern Sweden, shows that certain shortcuts can be applied to keep the experimental effort reasonable which is important, particularly when applying the liberability in a geometallurgical program.

40|$|Utilization {{of biomass}} as a co-feed in coal and biomass {{co-firing}} and co-gasification requires size {{reduction of the}} biomass. Reducing biomass to below 0. 2 mm without pretreatment is difficult and costly because biomass is fibrous and compressible. Torrefaction is a promising thermal pretreatment process and has the advantages of increasing energy density, improving <b>grindability,</b> producing fuels with more homogenous compositions and hydrophobic behavior. Temperature {{is the most important}} factor for the torrefaction process. Biomass <b>grindability</b> is related to cell wall structure, thickness and composition. Thermal treatment such as torrefaction can cause chemical changes that significantly affect the strength of biomass. The objectives of this study are to understand the mechanism by which torrefaction improves the <b>grindability</b> of biomass and discuss suitable temperatures for thermal pretreatment for co-gasification/cofiring of biomass and coal. Wild cherry wood was selected as the model for this study. Samples were prepared by sawing a single tangential section from the heartwood and cutting it into eleven pieces. The samples were consecutively heated at 220, 260, 300, 350, 450 and 550 oC for 0. 5 hr under flowing nitrogen in a tube furnace. Untreated and treated samples were characterized for physical properties (color, dimensions and weight), microstructural changes by SEM, and cell wall composition changes and thermal behaviors by TGA and DSC. The morphology of the wood remained intact through the treatment range but the cell walls were thinner. Thermal treatments were observed to decompose the cell wall components. Hemicellulose decomposed over the range of ~ 200 to 300 oC and resulted in weakening of the cell walls and subsequently improved <b>grindability.</b> Furthermore, wood samples treated above 300 oC lost more than 39 % in mass. Therefore, thermal pretreatment above the hemicelluloses decomposition temperature but below 300 oC is probably sufficient to improve <b>grindability</b> and retain energy value...|$|E

Experimental data have indicated that low rank coals are highly responsive to microwave radiation, possibly due to their higher inherent moisture content. There is evidence to suggest that gaseous evolution (water vapour and volatile matter) and localised zones of differential expansion (arising for example from occluded mineral matter) in coal during heating give rise to crack formation and hence are the probable causes for the measured increase in coal <b>grindability.</b> The composition of the various coals treated by microwave radiation remained relatively unaltered and there was no significant change in coal calorific value or the proximate and ultimate analyses (dry, mineral matter free basis). Initial (laboratory-scale) microwave trials and pilot-scale testwork demonstrated an improvement in the <b>grindability</b> of various coals. However, the gross energy input for these tests were excessively high (220 k WhIt) in comparison to that used mechanically for pulverised coal production (15 - 20 kWhlt). Improvements in microwave cavity design and increased electric field strengths may increase the energy efficiency of the process; however, further work would be required. Additional studies were carried out to evaluate the potential use of microwave technology for coal desulphurisation. The results were encouraging and show that substantial improvements in pyrite separation can be achieved with some coals.

The main aim of investigations was determination {{of the influence of}} the hardening rate of moulding sands with the GEOPOL binder on technological properties of these sands (bending strength, tensile strength, permeability and <b>grindability).</b> In addition, the final strength of moulding sands of the selected compositions was determined by two methods: by splitting strength and shear strength measurements. No essential influence of the hardening rate on such parameters as: permeability, <b>grindability</b> and final strength was found. However, the sand in which the slowest hardener (SA 72) were used, after 1 hour of holding, had the tensile and bending strength practically zero. Thus, the time needed for taking to pieces the mould made of such moulding sand will be 1. 5 - 2 hours...|$|E
