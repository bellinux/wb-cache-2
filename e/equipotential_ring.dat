40|$|Abstract. Based on {{the working}} {{principle}} of the capacitive sensor, {{according to the requirements}} of deep hole diameter measuring, a capacitance probe sensor was designed, and then the design and type-selection of probe structure, cable inner structure to the capacitance probe sensor were done. At the same time, in order to overcome the measurement error caused by eccentricity, the capacitance sensor probe and inner hole of the corresponding fastener both are designed to a taper, taper positioning is relatively accurate positioning way. The design is to avoid the measurement position offset, and ensures the coaxality on the mechanical structure. The <b>equipotential</b> <b>ring</b> technology effectively overcomes the problem of edge effect of capacitance sensor, and makes the probe’s effective measurement electrode under the condition of limited long, can effectively guarantee the measure precision. By moving the capacitance probe in the hole to the different position, we will realize the deep hole diameter measurement in different cross section...|$|E
40|$|High {{resolution}} spectroscopy of doped {{molecules in}} 4 He nano-droplets and clusters gives a signature of superfluidity in microscopic system, termed as microscopic superfluidity. Ro-vibrational spectrum of 4 HeN-M clusters is studied {{with the help}} of some important observations, revealed from experiments (viz., localised and orderly arrangement of 4 He atoms, although, being free to move in the order of their locations; individual 4 He atoms can not be tagged as normal/ superfluid, etc.) and other factors (e. g., consideration that the 4 He atoms which happen to fall in the plane of rotation of a molecule, render a <b>equipotential</b> <b>ring</b> and thus, do not take part in rotation; etc.) which effect the rotational and vibrational spectrum of the system. This helps us in successfully explaining the experimental findings which state that the rotational spectrum of clusters have sharp peaks (indicating that the molecule rotates like a free rotor) and moment of inertia and vibrational frequency shift have a non-trivial dependence on N...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that the use of a series of resistors, {{connected}} between the <b>equipotential</b> <b>rings</b> of a Van de Graaff generator, improves the axial voltage grading of the generator. The work reported in this paper shows how the resistor chain also improves the radial voltage gradient. The electrolytic field mapping technique was adopted in the present work...|$|R
40|$|Topological {{insulators}} (TI) nanowires (NW) are {{an emerging}} class of structures, promising both novel quantum effects and potential applications in low-power electronics, thermoelectrics and spintronics. However, investigating the electronic states of TI NWs is complicated, {{due to their}} small lateral size, especially at room temperature. Here, we perform scanning probe based nanoscale imaging to resolve the local surface potential landscapes of Bi 2 Te 3 nanowires (NWs) at 300 K. We found <b>equipotential</b> <b>rings</b> around the NWs perimeter that we attribute to azimuthal 1 D modes. Along the NW axis, these modes are altered, forming potential ripples in the local density of states, due to intrinsic disturbances. Potential mapping of electrically biased NWs enabled us to accurately determine their conductivity which was found to increase with the decrease of NW diameter, consistent with surface dominated transport. Our results demonstrate that TI NWs can {{pave the way to}} both exotic quantum states and novel electronic devices...|$|R
40|$|Silicon carbide (SiC) is {{well known}} for its large {{potentiality}} for power device applications. SiC presents a high critical electric field, allowing small dimensions and relatively high doping levels, favorable for reduced power losses in the on-state together with high blocking voltage capability. SIC has a wide band-gap, inducing very low intrinsic carrier concentrations even at high temperature. and consequently allows very low leakage currents and off-state pou sr losses. The present paper focuses on problems related to the high voltage capability of SiC components. After dealing with the bulk breakdown voltage of a SiC semi-infinite parallel-plane abrupt junction, a short review of the methods allowing the potential distribution spreading near the periphery of the real junction is given. Some methods have been implemented and the edge-termination protection has been optimized by the way of numerical simulation. This includes <b>equipotential</b> <b>rings,</b> junction termination extension as planar protections, and MESA as an etched-contour periphery. Examples of realizations are given, and electrical characteristics are presented. They show a better capability of the junction termination extension periphery over the MESA technique to reach a 1500 V-blocking voltage objective...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} problem-solving procedures to troubleshoot electrostatic accelerators. A novel technique to diagnose issues with high-voltage components is described. The main application of this technique is noninvasive testing of electrostatic accelerator high-voltage grading systems, measuring insulation resistance, or determining the volume and surface resistivity of insulation materials used in column posts and acceleration tubes. In addition, this technique allows verification of {{the continuity of the}} resistive divider assembly as a complete circuit, revealing if an electrical path exists between <b>equipotential</b> <b>rings,</b> resistors, tube electrodes, and column post-to-tube conductors. It is capable of identifying and locating a “microbreak” in a resistor and the experimental validation of the transfer function of the high impedance energy control element. A simple and practical fault-finding procedure has been developed based on fundamental principles. The experimental distributions of relative resistance deviations (ΔR/R) for both accelerating tubes and posts were collected during five scheduled accelerator maintenance tank openings during 2013 and 2014. Components with measured ΔR/R>± 2. 5 % were considered faulty and put through a detailed examination, with faults categorized. In total, thirty four unique fault categories were identified and most would not be identifiable without the new technique described. The most common failure mode was permanent and irreversible insulator current leakage that developed after being exposed to the ambient environment. As a result of efficient in situ troubleshooting and fault-elimination techniques, the maximum values of |ΔR/R| are kept below 2. 5 % at the conclusion of maintenance procedures. The acceptance margin could be narrowed even further by a factor of 2. 5 by increasing the test voltage from 40  V up to 100  V. Based on experience over the last two years, resistor and insulator failures are less common now due to the routine use of the noninvasive ultrahigh impedance technique...|$|R
