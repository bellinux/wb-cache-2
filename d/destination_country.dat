30|$|At the macro-level, {{pressure}} to migrate is often defined rather loosely and differently, {{such as in}} terms of high demographic growth, low welfare and wellbeing or lack of employment (Castles et al. 2014). Some authors are more specific in their definition. For instance, Schaeffer (1993) defines migration pressure in a country {{in terms of the}} volume of long-term demand for income-earning opportunities abroad. This pressure is influenced by people’s expected economic, legal and social status abroad, costs of migration and other characteristics in <b>destination</b> <b>countries.</b> Potential migrants compare <b>destination</b> <b>countries</b> and country of residence regarding such features. Straubhaar (1993) defines migration pressure as excess supply of migration-willing people in origin countries relative to total demand for immigrants in <b>destination</b> <b>countries.</b> In this definition, great importance is attributed to the effect of migration policies in <b>destination</b> <b>countries</b> on migration pressure in origin countries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recent data on {{emigrant}} schooling {{suggests that}} emigrants are almost universally more skilled than non-emigrants {{from the same}} country. For the case of poor source <b>countries</b> and rich <b>destination</b> <b>countries,</b> this runs counter to the negative selection predicted by the Borjas-Roy model of income maximization. We present a different income maximization model that admits positive selection {{while at the same}} time making sharp predictions that can be tested with data on immigrants in multiple <b>destination</b> <b>countries.</b> The model predicts that emigrants from a given source country should sort themselves across <b>destination</b> <b>countries</b> according to the rewards to skill among destinations: destinations with larger rewards to skill should receive a higher-skilled mix of immigrants on average than destinations with lower rewards to skill. We test this prediction using data on emigrants from 192 source countries to a dozen OECD <b>destination</b> <b>countries.</b> Our tests are generally consistent with positive sorting. Furthermore, our results show that destination-country immigration policy has important effects on the skill composition of migrants. Economic and policy factors can explain a substantial share of the immigrant skill differences that we observe among <b>destination</b> <b>countries.</b> 1 1...|$|R

In addition to the level of societal gender equality of the origin and <b>destination</b> <b>countries</b> (the gender empowerment measure, or GEM) we use macro indicators of the educational systems, economic development, and religions of the countries of origin.

In addition, the higher the level of gender equality in the <b>destination</b> <b>countries,</b> the lower the reading and math scores of both the male and female migrants’ children in their <b>destination</b> <b>countries.</b> Further analyses suggest that the difference between the levels of gender equality, rather than the levels themselves, of the origin and <b>destination</b> <b>countries</b> explains more of the educational performance of both female and male migrant pupils.

25|$|Women outnumbered men {{in every}} age group besides 15 and under; the {{imbalance}} was most severe in the 25-39 age group, with only 71 men for every 100 women.

The high levels of unemployment among Koreans in New Zealand mean that their median personal income was only NZ$5,700, according to Department of Labour statistics.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue to}} {{consider}} is {{the freedom of the}} migrants. Some scholars have questioned whether these workers are moving into a state of “unfreedom”. Recruitment into circular migration may involve false promises and deception, leading to forced labor and debt bondage. Migrants have varying degrees of control concerning the choice and circumstances of migration, thus making the distinction between voluntary and forced migration unclear. Once in their <b>destination</b> <b>country,</b> migrants are sometimes met with abusive treatment, inadequate nutrition, poor lodging, and insufficient food. These factors are unlikely to bring a worker back to that area, thus discouraging circular migration. This dishonest recruitment leads {{to the question of whether}} the migrants are marginalized. Circular migrants are marginal in the area of destination in the sense that their true home is back in their home area, and they do not plan on living in the host area permanently.|$|E
25|$|Current {{migration}} policy rarely {{takes into account}} circular migration, instead mainly focusing on the dichotomous concepts of “permanent” and “temporary.” In contrast to temporary migration, circular migration allows the worker to simultaneously be engaged with both the home and host countries. Furthermore, it typically involves both return to the country of origin and repeated moves to the <b>destination</b> <b>country.</b> In many ways, being connected to both places provides an advantage for the migrant worker, {{because they do not}} have to make a definitive choice to stay in one. This allows for the maximization of capabilities, a concept articulated by Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum. By working in a high-income location with better earnings and spending in low-income, low-cost countries, the migrant worker is able to realize the best capabilities for both themselves and their families. Circularity also allows for the maintenance of traditions, citizenship, and family, an important part of human capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Circumvention {{tourism is}} also an area of medical tourism that has grown. Circumvention tourism is travel in order to access medical {{services}} that are legal in the <b>destination</b> <b>country</b> but illegal in the home country. This can include travel for fertility treatments that aren’t yet approved in the home country, abortion, and doctor-assisted suicide. Abortion tourism can be found most commonly in Europe, where travel between countries is relatively simple.

In Poland especially, it is estimated that each year nearly 7,000 women travel to the UK, where abortion services are free through the National Health Service. There are also efforts being made by independent organizations and doctors, such as with Women on Waves, to help women circumvent draconian laws in order to access medical services. With Women on Waves, the organization uses a mobile clinic aboard a ship to provide medical abortions in international waters, where the law of the country whose flag is flown applies.|$|E
25|$|Mexico {{remains the}} <b>destination</b> <b>country</b> of the {{greatest}} number of children abducted from or wrongfully retained outside the United States by parents or other relatives. Despite coordinated efforts undertaken by the U.S. Embassy, the U.S. Central Authority, and senior Department of State officials to press for more expeditious processing and resolution of cases, the systemic problems in Mexico's handling of Convention applications that were detailed in the 2002 Compliance Report persisted during the reporting period. The Department’s experience is that, relative to the large number of pending Convention cases in Mexico, the number of cases resolved annually in Mexico is quite small. Most Convention return applications remain pending and never progress to the point of a definitive adjudication. Among the U.S. Central Authority's greatest concerns is Mexico's inability to locate children. Other problems include long delays in adjudication of return applications, the Mexican Central Authority's lack of adequate resources to perform its role effectively, the absence of implementing legislation integrating the Convention into the Mexican legal system, and an apparent lack of understanding of the Convention among many Mexican judges, which has resulted in Convention cases being treated as custody matters or mishandled in other ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{home country}} {{organization}} will contact a partner {{organization in the}} country of the student’s choice. Students accepted for the program {{may or may not be}} screened by the organization in their home country. Partner organizations in the <b>destination</b> <b>country</b> each have differing levels of screening they require students to pass through before being accepted into their program. For example, students coming to the U.S. may be allowed to come on the recommendation of the organization in their home country, or the hosting partner may require the student to submit a detailed application, including previous school report cards, letters from teachers and administrators, and standardized English fluency exam papers. The U.S. agency may then accept or decline the applicant. Some organizations also have Rules of Participation. For example, almost all U.S. organizations cannot allow an exchange student to drive an automobile during their visit. Some organizations require a written contract that sets standards for personal behavior and grades, while others may be less rigorous. Lower cost programs can result in a student participating without a supervisor being available nearby to check on the student's well-being. Programs provided by agencies that provide compensation for representatives are more likely to retain local representatives to assist and guide the student and keep track of their well-being.|$|E
