It is well known that the high absorption of metallic parts degrades the quality of radiographic measurements (contrast) and causes typical metal artefacts in X-ray computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. It will be shown that these problems can be successfully solved utilizing the dual energy CT method (DECT), which is typically used for the material decomposition of complex objects. In other words, DECT can help differentiate object components with a similar overall attenuation or visualise low attenuation components that are next to high attenuation ones. The application of DECT to analyse honeycomb sandwich panels and CFRP parts joined <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>fasteners</b> will be presented in the article...|$|R

40|$|Ductile {{behavior}} of timber connections <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>fasteners</b> {{is essential to}} achieve a robust structure. Moreover, a ductile {{behavior of}} the fastener and the timber prior to failure is necessary to fulfill the boundary conditions for applying the Johansen theory (1949). If these boundary conditions are not fulfilled, the capacity of a connection is overestimated and brittle failure may occur. However, using sufficient spacing, end and edge distances reduces tensile stresses perpendicular to the grain, the main stresses initiating brittle failure. If {{in addition to that}} the influence of the relation between fastener diameter and timber volume is considered, brittle failure mechanisms can be avoided. This paper discusses quasi static tests carried out on dowelled connections with different spacing and loaded end distances chosen in accordance to the above criterion. The results were compared with the capacity calculation for dowelled connections of Eurocode 5, chapter 8. 2, the design approach against block shear failure of Eurocode 5, Annex A, and the design proposal for the avoidance of block shear failure proposed by Hanhijärvi and Kevarinmäki (2008).

40|$|In heavy timber structures, double-shear connections, {{including}} wood-wood-wood (WWW), wood-steel-wood (WSW) and steel-wood-steel (SWS) {{connections with}} either bolts or dowels as fasteners, {{are widely used}} to assembly structural members and transfer loads. However, connections <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> <b>fasteners</b> and components are potentially venerable links in fire exposure. A number of efforts have been devoted to study the fire performance of timber connections {{in the last two}} decades. With the knowledge and experimental data generated, new attempts have been made in order to develop new calculation methods and improve design rules for timber connections in fire. In this paper, existing models are discussed and new correlations are presented for the calculation of the fire resistances of double-shear timber connections. Various factors, i. e. timber thickness, fastener diameter, and load ratio are considered in the correlations. Comparison between the predictions using the correlations and the measured results in fire resistance tests shows good agreement. For timber connections with protective membranes, the component additive method (CAM) can be used by adding the additive fire resistances of the protective membranes to the fire resistances of unprotected timber connections. Connections with concealed fasteners and intumescent paint are also discussed in this paper...|$|R

The key reasons why timber construction continues to grow is the environmental aspects combined with the economically advantageous industrialised prefabrication process. One of the most commonly used connections in timber structures is the punched <b>metal</b> plate <b>fastener,</b> which {{is a perfect example of}} an effective connection that only can be used in a prefabrication process. It can be found in almost all kinds of buildings; from a rafter connection in small to middle sized houses up to reinforcement in heavier connections in arenas and warehouses. It is well known that the connections are the most critical parts of a structure and it is therefore crucial that these are designed for all eventualities. This project is a pilot study that seeks to evaluate the existing design methods for punched <b>metal</b> plate <b>fasteners</b> subjected to fire in Eurocode and in practice. The first conclusion is that such a method hardly exists, neither in codes nor in scientific theory, despite the fact that this is and has for decades been a very common structural detail. The theoretical analysis shows that it is very unlikely that a joint made <b>with</b> punched <b>metal</b> plate <b>fasteners</b> can withstand a standard fire scenario for even 15 minutes and the small-scale testing confirms this.

40|$|The {{research}} {{is aimed at}} developing seismic methods for the design and evaluation of the seismic vulnerability of wooden structures, using a displacement-based approach. After a brief introduction on the seismic behaviour of timber structures, the general Direct Displacement-Based Design (Direct-DBD) procedure and the state-of-the-art are presented, with clear reference to {{the application of the}} Direct-DBD method to wooden buildings. The strength of the Direct-DBD method is its ability to design structures {{in a manner consistent with}} the level of damage expected, by directly relating the response and the expected performance of the structure. The research begins with a description of the procedural aspects of the Direct-DBD method and the parameters required for its application. The research presented focuses on the formulation of a displacement-based seismic design procedure, applicable to one-storey wooden structures made with a portal system. This typology is very common in Europe and particularly in Italy. A series of analytical expressions have been developed to calculate design parameters. The required analytical Direct-DBD parameters are implemented based on the mechanical behaviour of the connections, made <b>with</b> <b>metal</b> dowel-type <b>fasteners.</b> The calibration and subsequent validation of design parameters use a Monte Carlo numerical simulation and outcomes obtained by tests in full-scale. After the description of the Displacement-Based method for one-storey wooden structures, a series of guidelines to extend the Direct-DBD methodology to other types and categories of timber systems are proposed. The thesis presents the case of a multi-storey wood frame construction, which is a simple extension of the glulam portal frame system. Part of this work has been done within the RELUIS Project, (REte dei Laboratori Universitari di Ingegneria Sismica), Research Line IV, which in the years between 2005 and 2008 involved several Italian universities and Italian institutes of research in the development of new seismic design methods.

Further, in limit state codes the strength variables are related to a deterministic value (usually the 5 -percentile).

Structural load-sharing that is the ability to redistribute load between members. In this paper, Monte Carlo simulations of a timber W-truss <b>with</b> punched <b>metal</b> plate <b>fasteners</b> (nail plates) are performed.
