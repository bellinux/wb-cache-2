50|$|If a load {{is placed}} on the lithosphere, it will tend to flex in the manner of an <b>elastic</b> <b>plate.</b> The {{magnitude}} of the lithospheric flexure {{is a function of the}} imposed load and the flexural rigidity of the lithosphere, and the wavelength of flexure is a function of flexural rigidity alone. Flexural rigidity is in itself, a function of the lithospheric mineral composition, thermal regime, and effective elastic thickness. The nature of the load is varied. For instance, the Hawaiian Islands chain of volcanic edifices has sufficient mass to cause deflection in the lithosphere.|$|E
50|$|In the Cretaceous {{after the}} Woodbine and Eagle Ford {{formations}} were deposited, the Sabine Uplift started to become elevated again {{due to its}} reactivation ~88 mya. A decrease in the effective <b>elastic</b> <b>plate</b> thicknesses caused the basin to subside, as the uplift became increasingly elevated. As a result, an estimated 150m of uplift over the Sabine region caused the eastern parts of the Woodbine and Eagle Ford formations to have a subaerial exposure, which eventually resulted in their easterly erosion. Deposition of the Austin Chalk after this erosional occurrence caused a sealing of the well-known East Texas petroleum reservoir, and creation of a middle Cretaceous unconformity. Currently, the Sabine Uplift is in the subsurface, and the middle Cretaceous unconformity is not seen because it is buried below a massive wedge of clastic sediments from the Late Cretaceous to the present.|$|E

5000|$|The Terceira Rift is 550 km long, and {{represents}} the world’s slowest spreading center, with plate divergence of 2-4 mm/year. It developed from a transform fault and now {{operates as a}} hyper-slow spreading center, as recognized by the relative movement between the African and Eurasian plates. [...] There is a strong resemblance between the Terceira Rift and other ultra- or super- slow spreading ridges, such as the Gakkel Rift and the Southwest Indian ridges. In particular, high obliquity values of 40°-65°, and a magmatic segmentation wavelength of 100 km, are similar to other very slow rifts. [...] Rift valleys present along the rift are 1000-2200 m deep, and 30-60 km wide, similar to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge median valley. However, the amplitude of the Terceira Rift along-strike topography is 2000-4000 m, which is much larger than expected for ultraslow spreading ridges. [...] This irregularity {{is thought to be}} due to the association of the rift with the Azores hotspot, in combination with slow spreading rates. Slow spreading results in a strong and thick axial <b>elastic</b> <b>plate,</b> and slower volcanic extrusions from the rift zone, resulting in high topography when merged with plume-related volcanism. [...] The large volume of volcanism associated with the hotspot is mainly controlled by regional extension between Africa and Eurasia, as indicated by strikes of extension fractures. [...] Furthermore, the majority of inter-plate deformation is focused on the Terceira Rift, although a clear deformation pattern has not yet been recognized.|$|E
