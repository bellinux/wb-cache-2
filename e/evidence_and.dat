5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial <b>evidence,</b> <b>and</b> no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|Since eliminative materialism {{claims that}} future {{research}} {{will fail to}} find a neuronal basis for various mental phenomena, it must necessarily wait for science to progress further.

5|$|A 2016 {{analysis}} of archaeological finds from Southwark in London, {{the site of}} the ancient Roman city Londinium in Roman Britain, suggests that two or three skeletons from a sample of twenty-two dating to the 2nd to the 4th centuries AD are of Asian ancestry, and possibly of Chinese descent. The assertion is based on forensics and the {{analysis of}} skeletal facial features. The discovery has been presented by Dr Rebecca Redfern, curator of human osteology at the Museum of London. No DNA analysis has yet been done, the skull and tooth samples available offer only fragmentary pieces of <b>evidence,</b> <b>and</b> the samples that were used were compared with the morphology of modern populations, not ancient ones.|$|E

There are several possible explanations for this gap between <b>evidence</b> <b>and</b> clinical practice. One major factor may be the lack of adequately trained dietitians, who are needed to administer a ketogenic diet programme.|$|E
