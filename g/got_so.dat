5|$|Throughout the series, {{there have}} been three filming {{locations}} for Sun Hill police station. From the first series, the police station consisted of a set of buildings in Artichoke Hill, Wapping, East London. However, these buildings were next to the News International plant and during the winter of 1985–86 there was much industrial action which resulted in some altercations between the strikers and what they thought were the real police but were actually actors working on The Bill. Working conditions <b>got</b> <b>so</b> dire, that the production team realised they needed to find another base to set Sun Hill police station.|$|E
5|$|What {{grabbed me}} at first {{actually}} {{was the fact}} it was so big. The melody starts off very soft but then it gets massive and kinda angsty. I've had lots of friends who've gone through 'Battlefield' situations in their relationships, so when I was singing the song I put myself in their position and {{tried to imagine what}} they were going through. I <b>got</b> <b>so,</b> so into it and I think you can tell.|$|E
5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by Dee Bradley Baker), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he <b>got</b> <b>so</b> smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

25|$|The Red River, {{which had}} been opened by Shreve in the 1830s, {{remained}} navigable throughout the Civil War. Water levels <b>got</b> <b>so</b> low {{at one point that}} Union Admiral David Dixon Porter was trapped with his gunboats north of Alexandria. His engineers quickly constructed a temporary dam to raise the water level and free his fleet.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} days as a session player Foster, having been self-taught, could not read music and freely admits that he bluffed {{his way through a}} lot of sessions. Finally at a session at Abbey Road Studios, playing with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, it <b>got</b> <b>so</b> {{difficult}} to follow the music by listening to the drummer and guitarist that he vowed to teach himself. This he then did.|$|E

25|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, more B-57Bs were moved from Clark AB to Bien Hoa to make good these losses and to {{reinforce}} the original deployment. The B-57s shared an open-air, three-sided hangar with the Vietnamese Air Force that flew A-1E Skyraider aircraft, and things <b>got</b> <b>so</b> crowded at Bien Hoa {{at that time that}} some of the B-57s had to be sent back to Clark AB. Also, maintenance facilities for the B-57 at Bien Hoa were scarce.|$|E
25|$|The funeral {{procession}} {{is a highly}} elaborate, visible and competitive public spectacle, designed to impress the public with altars, canopies, flowers, paper figurines, burnt offerings and most importantly, with the display of impressive tomb figurines. The competitive nature of {{funeral procession}}s <b>got</b> <b>so</b> out of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased’s social status. Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master’s living family.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, {{before the}} Nigerian civil war with Biafra {{broke out in}} 1967, with {{hostilities}} and killing of Igbo people rising, Nwokolo left Ibadan for Enugu {{with his wife and}} children. The political mood in Enugu at the arrival of the returnees from all parts of Nigeria was that of shock and awareness of danger. In Enugu, thousands of corpses and maimed and half dead, deprived, devastated and homeless refugees were pouring in from Northern Nigeria, without any hope of accommodation or food and nourishment. Things even soon <b>got</b> <b>so</b> agonising as civil war eventually broke out between Nigeria and Biafra.|$|E

25|$|The next ghetto {{liquidation}} action {{took place}} {{less than a}} month later in Łomazy lacking a rail line. The infants, the old and the infirm were shot by Battalion 101 already during the early morning roundups on 17 August 1942. Later that day, the Hiwi shooters arrived at the main square, and some 1,700 ghetto prisoners were marched on foot to the Hały forest outside the town, where the stronger Jewish men prepared a trench with entrance on one side. The killings of stripped naked Jews lasted till 7pm. The Ukrainian Trawnikis <b>got</b> <b>so</b> drunk that the policemen from the First, Second and Third Platoon under Lieutenant Hartwig Gnade had to continue shooting by themselves in half-a-metre of groundwater and blood.|$|E
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she knelt down at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it <b>got</b> <b>so</b> close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E
25|$|Ribault made at {{once for}} St. Augustine with two hundred sailors and four hundred soldiers, which {{included}} the best men of the garrison at Fort Caroline. At dawn {{the next day he}} came upon Menéndez in the very act of attempting to pass the bar and to land a sloop and two boats filled with men and artillery from the San Salvador which had sailed at midnight with the San Pelayo. The tide was out and his boats so loaded that only by great skill was he able to cross it with his sloop, and escape; for the French, who had at once attempted to prevent his landing and thus to capture his cannon and the supplies he had on board, <b>got</b> <b>so</b> close to him, that they hailed him, and summoned him to surrender, promising that no harm should befall him. As soon as Ribault perceived that the boats had gotten out of his reach, he gave up the attempt and started in pursuit of the San Salvador, which was already six or eight leagues away.|$|E

25|$|Compared to the 2011–12 {{team that}} {{finished}} 41–25, the Lakers offense had improved in points per 100 possessions (108.3 vs. 106.0), but their defense underperformed. The team was lacking continuity with the projected starting lineup {{at the beginning}} of the season having played just 117 minutes together, primarily due to injuries. Howard returned the following game as the Lakers won their first game of 2013, stopping their losing streak at six with a 113-93 win over the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers (9–30). In a move to improve the team's defense, D'Antoni began having Bryant guard the opponent's best perimeter player; Bryant was the primary defender on the Cavaliers' Kyrie Irving, who was held to 15 points. Bryant acknowledged he was a more focused defender when he had a challenging defensive assignment as opposed to when he played off the ball against weaker players. His defense disrupted opponents and freed Nash from unfavorable matchups. In addition to his leg injury, World Peace also suffered an injury to his right arm that made it difficult to bend. Things <b>got</b> <b>so</b> bad, D'Antoni moved him off the perimeter on defense and had him guard power forwards instead.|$|E
25|$|Orndorff and Hogan started {{teaming up}} to feud with Piper and Orton, facing them in tag team {{competition}} {{all over the}} country. Orndorff's feud with Piper and Orton continued to rage on while Hogan started to defend his title against other contenders; Orndorff faced both Orton and Piper in individual competition, usually without a conclusive outcome. After Orndorff fired Bobby Heenan as his manager, Heenan placed a $25,000 bounty on Orndorff, payable to anyone who could injure him. When no one succeeded, Heenan upped the bounty to $50,000. One of the first men to try and claim the new, higher bonus was Roddy Piper himself, but their matches <b>got</b> <b>so</b> out of hand that Bruno Sammartino was appointed as a special referee {{in the hopes of}} keeping peace. Instead of keeping peace, Sammartino became a target for Orton and Piper, which led to Orndorff and Sammartino teaming up. Orndorff teamed with a variety of opponents in his fights with Piper and Orton, including André the Giant. In February 1986, Bobby Heenan used a match between Hulk Hogan and Don Muraco as an opportunity to have King Kong Bundy attack Hogan, setting up their WrestleMania 2 match. While Hogan fought off Bundy, Orndorff battled Don Muraco in a match that ended in a double count out.|$|E
25|$|In late 2008, Chessman {{made a move}} to {{seemingly}} unite {{with his}} former stable the Black Family, but double-crossed them instead. Chessman turned to the Psycho Circus and together they won the National Atómicos Titles from the Black Family. Chessman's third run with the Atómicos titles ended after just 16 days when AAA Commissioner Vampiro stripped Chessman and the Psycho Circus of the titles after they had attacked him the previous night. The feud with the Black Family continued into 2009 until Chessman segued into a feud with the new AAA World Champion El Mesias. The Feud with El Mesias started during a television taping where Chessman and El Mesias faced off in a match, the match <b>got</b> <b>so</b> out of hand that Chessman ended up being thrown {{over the side of}} the balcony and through a stack of tables. The show went to commercial with Chessman looking seriously injured as he received medical treatment. The following week another singles match between the two was scheduled but Chessman came out on crutches wearing a neck brace. Just as El Mesias thought Chessman was going to announce that he was too injured to wrestle Chessman attacked him with a crutch revealing that the injury was nothing but a ruse to give Chessman an advantage. At Rey de Reyes (2009) Chessman challenged El Mesias for the AAA Mega title inside a Steel Cage but lost.|$|E

25|$|Lord Clifden {{started the}} 1864 {{season in the}} Claret Stakes in April, where he only faced two rivals. As Parr led him onto the course a large crowd {{surrounded}} him. They <b>got</b> <b>so</b> close {{that they had to}} be ordered to get back of course officials. After the start, Rapid Rhone had a clear lead. Lord Clifden never got on terms and faded in the straight to finish second, ten lengths behind Rapid Rhone. On 9 June at Royal Ascot he run in the Gold Cup {{in front of one of}} the largest crowds ever seen at Ascot. However he spent the whole of the race at the rear of the field and could not challenge the leaders. In the end he finished unplaced, over 20 lengths behind winner Scottish Chief. Little Stag was second and Lord Zetland third. In late July Lord Clifden was allotted top weight of 8st 12lb for the Chesterfield Cup run over one and a quarter miles at Goodwood. With half of a mile left to run, Lord Clifden was struck into by his half-sister Lady Clifden. This caused him to blunder and fall on his head, throwing John Osbourne to the ground, although the jockey did not sustain any serious injuries. The race was won by King of Utopia. Later the same day Lord Clifden walked over for a sweepstakes of £100 each. He was then retired to stud. For part of his four-year-old season, Lord Clifden was trained by William Bevill.|$|E
25|$|In summertime village cricket is {{the delight}} of everyone. Nearly every village has its own cricket field where the young men play and the old men watch. In the village of Lintz in County Durham {{they have their own}} ground, where they have played these last 70 years. They tend it well. The wicket area is well rolled and mown. The outfield is kept short. It has a good club house for the players and seats for the onlookers. The village team play there on Saturdays and Sundays. They belong to a league, {{competing}} with the neighbouring villages. On other evenings after work they practise while the light lasts. Yet now after these 70 years a judge of the High Court has ordered that they must not play there any more. He has issued an injunction to stop them. He has done it at the instance of a newcomer who is no lover of cricket. This newcomer has built, or has had built for him, a house {{on the edge of the}} cricket ground which four years ago was a field where cattle grazed. The animals did not mind the cricket. But now this adjoining field has been turned into a housing estate. The newcomer bought one of the houses on the edge of the cricket ground. No doubt the open space was a selling point. Now he complains that when a batsman hits a six the ball has been known to land in his garden or on or near his house. His wife has <b>got</b> <b>so</b> upset about it that they always go out at week-ends. They do not go into the garden when cricket is being played. They say that this is intolerable. So they asked the judge to stop the cricket being played. And the judge, much against his will, has felt that he must order the cricket to be stopped: with the consequence, I suppose, that the Lintz Cricket Club will disappear. The cricket ground will be turned to some other use. I expect for more houses or a factory. The young men will turn to other things instead of cricket. The whole village will be much the poorer. And all this because of a newcomer who has just bought a house there next to the cricket ground.|$|E
