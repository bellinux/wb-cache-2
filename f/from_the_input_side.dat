40|$|AbstractOne {{of the key}} {{problems}} of molecular bioenergetics is {{the understanding of the}} function of redox-driven proton pumps on a molecular level. One such class of proton pumps are the heme-copper oxidases. These enzymes are integral membrane proteins in which proton translocation across the membrane is driven by electron transfer from a low-potential donor, such as, e. g. cytochrome c, to a high-potential acceptor, O 2. Proton pumping is associated with distinct exergonic reaction steps that involve gradual reduction of oxygen to water. During the process of O 2 reduction, unprotonated high pKa proton acceptors are created at the catalytic site. Initially, these proton acceptors become protonated as a result of intramolecular proton transfer from a residue(s) located in the membrane-spanning part of the enzyme, but removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> catalytic site. This residue is then reprotonated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> bulk solution. In cytochrome c oxidase <b>from</b> Rhodobacter sphaeroides, <b>the</b> proton is initially transferred from a glutamate, E(I- 286), which has an apparent pKa of 9. 4. According to a recently published structure of the enzyme, the deprotonation of E(I- 286) is likely to result in minor structural changes that propagate to protonatable groups on the proton output (positive) side of the protein. We propose that in this way, the free energy available <b>from</b> <b>the</b> O 2 reduction is conserved during the proton transfer. On the basis of the observation of these structural changes, a possible proton-pumping model is presented in this paper. Initially, the structural changes associated with deprotonation of E(I- 286) result in the transfer of a proton to an acceptor for pumped protons <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> (negative) <b>side</b> of <b>the</b> membrane. After reprotonation of E(I- 286) this acceptor releases a proton to the output side of the membrane...|$|R
40|$|Secondary lymphatic valves are {{essential}} for minimizing backflow of lymph and are presumed to gate passively according to the instantaneous trans-valve pressure gradient. We hypothesized that valve gating is also modulated by vessel distention, which could alter leaflet stiffness and coaptation. To test this hypothesis, we devised protocols to measure the small pressure gradients required to open or close lymphatic valves and determine if the gradients varied {{as a function of}} vessel diameter. Lymphatic vessels were isolated from rat mesentery, cannulated, and pressurized using a servo-control system. Detection of valve leaflet position simultaneously with diameter and intraluminal pressure changes in two-valve segments revealed the detailed temporal relationships between these parameters during the lymphatic contraction cycle. The timing of valve movements was similar to that of cardiac valves, but only when lymphatic vessel afterload was elevated. The pressure gradients required to open or close a valve were determined in one-valve segments during slow, ramp-wise pressure elevation, either <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> or output <b>side</b> of the valve. Tests were conducted over a wide range of baseline pressures (and thus diameters) in passive vessels as well as in vessels with two levels of imposed tone. Surprisingly, the pressure gradient required for valve closure varied > 20 -fold (0. 1 – 2. 2 cmH 2 O) as a passive vessel progressively distended. Similarly, the pressure gradient required for valve opening varied sixfold with vessel distention.

Griffith obtained his results using highly aggregated data and a relatively simple empirical model. In this study we focus on confirming the earlier results by formally testing for competitive behaviour in the Australian grains and oilseeds industries using a more sophisticated empirical model and a less aggregated grains and oilseeds data set. We specify a general duality model of profit maximisation that allows for imperfect competition in both <b>the</b> <b>input</b> and output markets of the grains and oilseeds industries. The model also allows for variable-proportions technologies and can be regarded as a generalisation of several models appearing in the agricultural economics and industrial organisation literatures.

The model is estimated in a Bayesian econometrics framework. Results are reported in terms of the characteristics of estimated probability distributions for demand and supply elasticities and indexes of market power. Our results suggest that there is a positive probability that: (a) flour and cereal food product manufacturers exert market power when purchasing wheat, barley, oats and triticale; (b) beer and malt manufacturers exert market power when purchasing wheat and barley; and (c) other food product manufacturers exert market power when purchasing wheat, barley, oats and triticale. What is interesting is that each of the transaction nodes where market power is indicated is one where a farm commodity is sold to a processing sector that is, the evidence suggests oligopsonistic behaviour by grains buyers. The wheat and barley industries seem to be especially disadvantaged by this type of market conduct. A related and equally interesting result is that there was no consistent evidence of market power in the downstream nodes of the data set relating to the sales of flour and other cereal foods, or the sale of bread and other bakery products. These transaction points are where legal judgements against suppliers have been made in the recent past.

And these schemes require the voltage balance control of the voltage divide capacitors. This paper mentions about the transformer-less uninterruptible power supply which can omit the voltage divide capacitors. Delta-sigma modulation technique is introduced to the power supply and the proposed scheme has out-put voltage regulation functio...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{evidence on}} the empirical separability of input and output market imperfections. We specify a model of banking competition and simultaneously estimate bank conduct in output (loan) and input (deposit) markets. Our results suggest that firms display some degree of non-competitive behavior in both the loan and the deposit markets. Moreover, we find that <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> output side are empirically separable, that is, the measurement of market power {{on one side of}} the market is not affected by assuming that the other side of the market is perfectly competitive. Our results suggest that empirical studies of market power that concentrate on either <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>side</b> or <b>the</b> output side are not subject to significant misspecification error. Banks and banking; Markets...|$|R

The output side added line printers to these media. With the limited {{exception of the}} system operator's console, human beings did not interact with batch machines in real time at all.|$|R
40|$|We report {{high quality}} {{broadband}} spatial reflections of Rayleigh {{surface acoustic waves}} (SAWs) through a graded grooved surface. High quality means that no wave is allowed to transmit and the incident wave is nearly all reflected to <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> graded grooved surface is structured by drilling one dimensional array of graded grooves with increased depths on a flat surface. We investigate SAW dispersion relations, wave field distribution at several typical SAW wavelengths, and time evolution of a Gaussian pulse through the graded grooved surface. Results show that <b>the</b> <b>input</b> broadband Rayleigh SAWs can be slowed, spatially enhanced and stopped, and finally reflected to <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>side.</b> <b>The</b> study suggests that engraving the flat surface {{can be used as}} an efficient and economical way to manipulate Rayleigh SAWs, which has potential application in novel SAW devices such as filters, reflectors, sensors, energy harvesters, and diodes...|$|R
30|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} the voltage gain is to introduce a coupled inductor [22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]. However, the current through the coupled inductor is discontinuous. It goes against the lifetime of PV and fuel cell when the coupled inductor is placed on <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>side.</b> Especially for <b>the</b> low <b>input</b> voltage application, <b>the</b> <b>input</b> current is very large. Thus, <b>the</b> continuous <b>input</b> current is preferred.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we design a {{high-resolution}} line imaging device allowing for broadband operation at near-infrared wavelengths ranging from 1 µm to 2 µm utilizing {{the advantage of}} subwavelength light confinement in plasmonic waveguides. The device consists of an array of air-guided plasmonic waveguides in gold with fanned-out geometry. In {{the main part of}} the device the separation between waveguides increases gradually <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>input</b> towards <b>the</b> output. High resolution is achieved on <b>the</b> <b>input</b> <b>side</b> by tapering down the periodicity between channels to 150 nm, while simultaneously maintaining propagation losses of a few dB. The proposed design also minimizes optical cross-coupling between waveguides; each channel thus transmits optical fields independently allowing for high signal-to-noise ratio imaging. At the low-resolution side properly tailored output couplers are designed to enhance optical coupling to free space. This is also shown to be an effective method to reduce back reflection, thus minimizing Fabry-Perot effects in the waveguides and allowing for broadband operation...|$|R
