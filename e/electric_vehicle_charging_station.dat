40|$|Abstract. <b>Electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> are {{high-power}} load {{after they}} are accessed to the grid. Therefore it may result in the redistribution of the grid load, {{which leads to the}} change of the power flow and the grid loss increases. The load model of <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> is established in a typical distribution network model in this paper. The impact on the distribution network power flow after the <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> accessed to the grid is calculated. And then some measures to reduce the network loss are brought up, which are proved by relational calculation cases...|$|R

New energy such as wind, solar, <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> have strong {{intermittent}} and fluctuations. Their technical performance is poor to access to the grid. They inject harmonics into grid and have other issues. This paper describes the impact on the distribution network after the wind, photovoltaic power generation, <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>charging</b> <b>stations</b> connected to the grid. It is hoped that you can build smart grid distribution model,research in-depth and analysis the combined effects of smart distribution grid after new energy sources accessed, to achieve the monitoring of the various components of the distribution network and the best combination for electricity...|$|R
