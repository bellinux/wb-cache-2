5|$|Adequate {{potassium}} intake <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> {{eating a}} variety of foods. Potassium is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high potassium concentrations include yam, parsley, dried apricots, milk, chocolate, all nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut water, soybeans, and bran. Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no potassium.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Blood flow through the coronary vessels occurs in peaks and troughs relating to the heart muscle's relaxation or contraction.|$|E
50|$|Increase of bond {{strength}} and service temperature can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> formation of cross-links in the polymer after solidification.

5|$|Low-pressure {{deposition}} of thin films of cubic boron nitride is possible. As in diamond growth, {{the major problem}} is to suppress the growth of hexagonal phases (h-BN or graphite, respectively). Whereas in diamond growth this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> adding hydrogen gas, boron trifluoride is used for c-BN. Ion beam deposition, plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, pulsed laser deposition, reactive sputtering, and other physical vapor deposition methods are used as well.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{differences}} between the digestive systems of sharks and mammals is that sharks have much shorter intestines. This short length <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the spiral valve with multiple turns within a single short section instead of a long tube-like intestine. The valve provides a long surface area, requiring food to circulate inside the short gut until fully digested, when remaining waste products pass into the cloaca.|$|E
5|$|Scrolling {{through a}} long list or menu <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves {{as if it is}} pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly {{decelerating}} as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object.|$|E

5|$|The Harrier has two control {{elements}} {{not found in}} conventional fixed-wing aircraft: the thrust vector and the reaction control system. The thrust vector refers to the slant of the four engine nozzles and can be set between 0° (horizontal, pointing directly backwards) and 98° (pointing down and slightly forwards). The 90° vector is normally deployed for VTOL manoeuvring. The reaction control <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> manipulating the control stick and is similar in action to the cyclic control of a helicopter. While irrelevant during forward flight mode, these controls are essential during VTOL and STOL manoeuvres.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} Kenny's speech <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> Stone mumbling {{into his own}} hand as he {{provides}} Kenny's lines, while the recorded audio is then edited with Pro Tools, and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more {{like that of a}} fourth grader. As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.|$|E
5|$|The {{positive}} charge in ions <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> stripping away electrons from atomic nuclei. The number of electrons removed {{is related to}} either the increase in temperature or the local density of other ionised matter. This also can be accompanied by the dissociation of molecular bonds, though this process is distinctly different from chemical processes of ion interactions in liquids or the behavior of ions existing in metals. The response of plasma to electromagnetic fields can be usefully employed in many modern technological devices, such as plasma televisions or plasma etching.|$|E
5000|$|Thermocompression {{is useful}} {{whenever}} evaporator energy requirements {{need to be}} reduced.

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain {{reliable}} information on yield and root quality of new sugar beet hybrids, the micro varietal trials were {{set up on the}} experimental field of the Faculty of Agriculture at the University of Zagreb in the period from 2010 to 2013. The study included a total of 51 sugar beet hybrids owned by five breeding companies present in the Croatian market. There were significant differences among investigated hybrids in root and sugar yield and sugar content in the roots in all years of research, except in the dry 2011. However, a large number of hybrids achieved statistically equal values because the differences were within the statistical tolerance. In 2010, the highest root yield (107. 5 t/ha) and the highest technological sugar yield (13. 5 t/ha) <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Elvis. That year, the largest sugar content (15. 68 %) <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Markus. In 2012, the highest root yield (86. 4 t/ha), and the highest sugar yield (12. 0 t/ha) <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Serenada KWS. The largest root sugar content (17. 37 %) <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Denisa KWS. In 2013, the highest root yield (90. 2 t/ha) and the highest sugar yield (10. 8 t/ha) <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> the hybrid Terranova KWS.

5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg {{in front of the}} other in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E

5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and expelling it through the siphon. The ingress of water <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
5|$|The Osprey is the world's first {{production}} tiltrotor aircraft, {{with one}} three-bladed proprotor, turboprop engine, and transmission nacelle mounted on each wingtip. It {{is classified as}} a powered lift aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration. For takeoff and landing, it typically operates as a helicopter with the nacelles vertical and rotors horizontal. Once airborne, the nacelles rotate forward 90° {{in as little as}} 12 seconds for horizontal flight, converting the V-22 to a more fuel-efficient, higher speed turboprop aircraft. STOL rolling-takeoff and landing capability <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> having the nacelles tilted forward up to 45°. Other orientations are possible. It has a ferry range of over 2,100 nmi. Its operational range is 1,100 nmi.|$|E
5|$|The game's plot {{concerns}} a diminutive prince {{on a mission}} to rebuild the stars, constellations, and Moon, which were accidentally destroyed by his father, the King of All Cosmos. This <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>by</b> rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to people to mountains until the ball has grown great enough to become a star. Katamari Damacys story, characters, and settings are bizarre and heavily stylized, rarely attempting any semblance of realism, though the brands and items used are based on those current in Japan during the game's production.|$|E
