50|$|Su-min is {{an orphan}} who, having turned 18, is {{required}} to leave his orphanage. Unable to pay for university, he heads for Seoul where he works various jobs to pay for computer classes. One of those jobs is driving drunks home from bars. After losing his factory job, Su-min ends up taking {{a job at a}} <b>host</b> <b>bar.</b> Initially the boss of this <b>host</b> <b>bar</b> is reluctant to take him on, as he knows from experience that openly gay hosts will often leave when they become romantically involved with one of their clients. Having given up on love, Su-min believes that this won't happen to him, until one day a man from his past enters the <b>host</b> <b>bar.</b> That man, Jae-min, is a former driving client, who has fallen in love with Su-min. Su-min refuses his advances, and accepts him as a client only once, and threatens to kill him if he hires him again. Jae-min is undeterred, and after several weeks go by, Su-min gives in. They are very happy in their relationship until Jae-min's mother discovers them together. She orders Jae-min to marry the woman he's been dating halfheartedly. Su-min is angry. With another man from the <b>host</b> <b>bar,</b> they kidnap Jae-min one night and take him to a shallow grave in the forest. Su-min watches passively as his colleague throws dirt on Jae-min, but eventually moves to stop the plan. His colleague already depressed over a two-timing girlfriend, whacks Su-min with the shovel and leaves the two there in the grave. Jae-min later awakens and takes Su-min to the car and they crash a tree while going back. As dawn breaks in, the two of them start to awake at the same time cops show up at the scene but inside, without paying attention to the cops, Su-min and Jae-min silently reconcile.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{clientele}} who visit <b>host</b> <b>bars</b> are hostesses who finish work at around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m., causing <b>host</b> <b>bars</b> to often begin business at around midnight and {{finish in the}} morning or midday, and hosts to work to the point of exhaustion. But business times have changed in recent years by order of the police due to the increased incidence of illegal prostitution by host club customers who could not pay the host club debts they had accumulated. Nowadays most of these clubs open about 4:00 p.m. and have to be closed between midnight and 2:00 a.m. Drinks usually start at about 1000 yen but can reach around 3 million yen ($US 30,000) for a bottle of champagne.|$|R
50|$|Contrary to A's assertions, {{the claims}} {{they were more}} than friends, they were living together, she {{introduced}} him to a <b>host</b> <b>bar</b> for work, and she filmed their sexual intercourse are all false.

They are preparing to sue A for defamation."Hon will now be leaving the group, as stated in his letter due to the controversy.|$|E
50|$|Pay {{is usually}} {{determined}} by commission on drink sales with hosts often drinking far past a healthy limit, usually {{while trying to}} hide their drunkenness. Because the base hourly wage is usually extremely low, almost any man can become a host regardless of looks or charisma (depending on the bar). However, hosts who cannot increase their sales usually drop out very soon, because of the minimal wage. The environment in a <b>host</b> <b>bar</b> is usually very competitive, {{with tens of thousands}} of dollars sometimes offered to the host who can achieve the highest sales.|$|E

40|$|We {{present results}} from a survey of an {{unbiased}} sample of thirty-eight early-type (S 0 –Sa), lowinclination, optically barred galaxies in the field, using images both {{from the ground and}} from space. Our goal was to find and characterize central stellar and gaseous structures: secondary bars, inner disks, and nuclear rings. We find that bars inside bars are surprisingly common: at least one quarter of the sample galaxies (possibly as many as 40 %) are double-barred, with no preference for Hubble type or the strength of the primary bar. A typical secondary bar is ∼ 12 % of the size of its primary bar and extends to 240 – 750 pc in radius. Secondary bars are not systematically either parallel or perpendicular to the primary; we see cases where they lead the primary bar in rotation and others where they trail, which supports the hypothesis that the two bars of a double-bar system rotate independently. We see no significant effect of secondary bars on nuclear activity: our double-barred galaxies are no more likely to harbor a Seyfert or LINER nucleus than our single-barred galaxies. We find kiloparsec-scale inner disks in at least 20 % of our sample; they occur almost exclusively in S 0 galaxies. These disks are on average 20 % the size of their <b>host</b> <b>bar,</b> and show a wider range of relative sizes than do secondary bars. Nuclear rings are present in about a third of our sample.

A typical secondary bar is ~ 12 % of the size of its primary bar and 240 [...] 750 pc in radius. We see no significant effect of secondary bars on nuclear activity. We also find kiloparsec-scale inner disks in at least 20 % of our sample, almost exclusively in S 0 galaxies. These disks are on average 20 % the size of their <b>host</b> <b>bar,</b> and show a wider range of relative sizes than do secondary bars. Nuclear rings are present in about a third of our sample. Most are dusty, sites of current or recent star formation, or both; such rings are preferentially found in Sa galaxies. Three S 0 galaxies (15 % of the S 0 's) appear to have purely stellar nuclear rings, with no evidence for dust or recent star formation. The fact that these central stellar structures are so common indicates that the inner regions of early-type barred galaxies typically contain dynamically cool and disklike structures. This is especially true for S 0 galaxies, where secondary bars, inner disks, and/or stellar nuclear rings are present at least two thirds of the time.

50|$|Pattaya has derived {{part of its}} {{reputation}} as a tourist destination due to the sex industry and the resulting nightlife, and this notoriety has influenced the city's evolution in many ways. Prostitution in Thailand is technically illegal but tolerated in most cities, including Pattaya. The city's vast numbers of <b>host</b> <b>bars,</b> gogo bars, massage parlours, saunas, and hourly hotels, serve foreign tourists as well as locals.

40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{assessing}} if low surface brightness galaxies <b>host</b> stellar <b>bars,</b> and study the dependence of the occurrence of bars {{as a function of}} surface brightness, we use the Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset to construct a large volume-limited sample of galaxies, and segregate the galaxies as low and high surface brightness in terms of their central surface brightness. We find that the fraction of low surface brightness galaxies <b>hosting</b> strong <b>bars</b> is systematically lower than the one found for high surface brightness galaxies. The dependence of the bar fraction on the central surface brightness is mostly driven by a correlation of the surface brightness with the spin and the gas-richness of the galaxies, showing only a minor dependence on the surface brightness. We also find that the length of the bars shows a strong dependence on the surface brightness, and although some of this dependence is attributed to the gas content, even at fixed gas-to-stellar mass ratio, high surface brightness galaxies <b>host</b> longer <b>bars</b> than their low surface brightness counterparts, which we attribute to an anticorrelation of the surface brightness with the spin.
