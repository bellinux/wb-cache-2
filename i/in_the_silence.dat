25|$|Some {{objections}} to the historicity of the Guadalupe event, grounded <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> of the very sources which – so it is argued – are those {{most likely to have}} referred to it, were raised as long ago as 1794 by Juan Bautista Muñoz and were expounded in detail by Mexican historian Joaquín García Icazbalceta in a confidential report dated 1883 commissioned by the then Archbishop of Mexico and first published in 1896. The silence of the sources is discussed in a separate section, below. The most prolific contemporary protagonist in the debate is Stafford Poole, a historian and Vincentian priest in the United States of America, who questioned the integrity and rigor of the historical investigation conducted by the Catholic Church in the interval between Juan Diego's beatification and his canonization.|$|E

500|$|Actor Doug Hutchison was 33 when he {{auditioned for}} the part of Tooms, but the {{producers}} initially considered him too young for the role; Glen Morgan thought that Hutchinson [...] "looks twelve years old".

500|$|It {{was unclear}} if Jodie Foster (Clarice Starling) and Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) would reprise their {{respective}} roles {{for which they}} won Academy Awards <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs (best actress/actor). It {{became apparent that the}} producers and the studio could do without one of the original [...] "stars" [...] (and would go on to find a replacement). The withdrawal of both Foster and Hopkins could possibly have been terminal for the project, however. De Laurentiis confirmed this after the film's release: [...] "First and foremost, I knew we had no movie without Anthony Hopkins." ...|$|E
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around its two main characters, {{which had been}} defined early in conception as the [...] "believer" [...] and the [...] "skeptic". Of these, the [...] "believer", Fox Mulder, was created with a character-defining personal motivation, involving the disappearance of his younger sister during his childhood, which he would believe to {{be a result of}} alien abduction. The creation of the [...] "skeptic", Dana Scully, was influenced by Jodie Foster's portrayal of Clarice Starling <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs, leading the crew to decide that the character needed to seem [...] "real", as opposed to the [...] "bombshell" [...] type of character the studio was pressing for.|$|E
500|$|Comparisons {{have been}} drawn between the {{character}} of Dana Scully and that of FBI student Clarice Starling <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs. Rhonda Wilcox and J.P. Williams note the similarities in their appearances, {{as well as their}} positions in a patriarchal working environment. In [...] "Beyond the Sea" [...] in particular, parallels can be seen. Like Starling, Scully has an emotional connection with—and a need to prove herself to—her dead father. After William Scully's death, his daughter becomes particularly concerned with {{whether or not he was}} proud of her. Although by the end of the episode, Scully seems to have come to terms with her father's opinion of her, her worries resurface later in the series when she fears that he would have been ashamed of her actions ("Anasazi"). The connection to Clarice Starling is further shown by Scully's encounter with Luther Lee Boggs, an apparently helpful serial killer, which echoes Starling's relationship with serial killer Hannibal Lecter.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{includes}} various cultural references, including Johnson & Johnson's [...] "No more tears" [...] slogan. Peter is seen watching Spike TV. Stewie {{enters a}} fight with Susie over a Barbie doll. Stewie composes a song about his toned body, pronouncing the word body as [...] "bah-dy" [...] {{a reference to the}} pronunciation of the word in John Mayer's [...] "Your Body Is a Wonderland". Chris's nude dance is a reference to a similar scene <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> Of The Lambs; this is in itself an in-joke as Chris Griffin's voice was initially Seth Green's impression of Buffalo Bill. Brian compares Stewie's muscular body to actor Lou Ferrigno's feces. Lois and Brian sit on the couch while they watch Lady and the Tramp and Michael Vick. Adam Sandler's movie career is referenced. Connie's best friend Gina says that Chris smells like Fred Flintstone's behind. Folkloric figure Santa Claus is seen getting a DUI.|$|E
500|$|In {{the music}} video, Bieber {{highlights}} several social injustices around the world. Clips are shown from footage of earthquake-torn Haiti, a suffering post-Katrina New Orleans, and Bieber himself visiting sick children in hospital beds. More scenes feature military soldiers being reunited with their families, and homes being possessed because families cannot pay mortgage. The video is intercut with scenes of Bieber performing. Like the song itself, the video also includes religious undertones, including the video {{ending with the}} quote, [...] "God speaks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> of the heart.

[...] Bill Lamb of About.com likened the video to the saying, [...] "There are times when putting pictures to the words does indeed make a song more powerful than simply listening to the track."

500|$|Dino De Laurentiis {{produced}} Michael Mann's film Manhunter in 1986, {{based on}} Harris's 1981 novel Red Dragon, featuring the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter, played by Brian Cox. De Laurentiis {{did not like}} Mann's film: [...] "Manhunter was no good... it was not Red Dragon," [...] he said. De Laurentiis and his wife Martha (also his co-producer) had no direct involvement <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs, a decision De Laurentiis came to regret. They did, however, own {{the rights to the}} Lecter character and reportedly allowed Orion Pictures, which produced The Silence of the Lambs, to use the character of Lecter for free, not wishing to be [...] "greedy". When The Silence of the Lambs became a commercial and critical success in 1991, winning five Academy Awards, both Dino and Martha De Laurentiis found themselves sitting on a valuable asset and eager for a follow-up novel they could adapt. After a lengthy wait, De Laurentiis finally received a call from Harris telling him he had finished the sequel to The Silence of the Lambs and De Laurentiis purchased the rights for a record $10 million.|$|E

500|$|In the 1990s, Pfeiffer {{accepted}} and also turned down many high-profile roles, {{beginning with the}} title role in Pretty Woman (1990), which earned Julia Roberts a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She took {{the part of the}} Soviet book editor Katya Orlova in the 1990 film adaptation of John le Carré's The Russia House, opposite Sean Connery, a role that required her to adopt a Russian accent. For her efforts, she was rewarded with a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama. Pfeiffer then landed the role of damaged waitress Frankie in Garry Marshall's Frankie and Johnny (1991), a film adaptation of Terrence McNally's Broadway play Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, which reunited her with her Scarface co-star, Al Pacino. The casting was seen as controversial by many, as Pfeiffer was considered far too beautiful to play an [...] "ordinary" [...] waitress; Kathy Bates, the original Frankie on Broadway, also expressed disappointment over the producers' choice. Pfeiffer herself stated that she took the role because it [...] "wasn't what people would expect of [...]" [...] Pfeiffer was once again nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance. During this period, she turned down the role of Clarice Starling <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs (1991), a character that won Jodie Foster the Academy Award for Best Actress. Pfeiffer also declined the role of Catherine Tramell in Basic Instinct (1992), ultimately played by Sharon Stone, as well as the role of Louise in Ridley Scott's Thelma & Louise, which went to Susan Sarandon.|$|E
500|$|Scott {{has said}} he {{believes}} the underlying emotion of Hannibal is [...] "affection". [...] "In some instances, you might even wonder or certainly from one direction—is it more than affection? It is dark, because the story is of course essentially dark, but it's kind of romantic at the same time." [...] Scott openly admits to a [...] "romantic thematic" [...] running though the film. He told CNN that: [...] "Hannibal was quite a different target, essentially a study between two individuals. Funny enough, it's rather romantic and also quite humorous, but also there's some quite bad behaviour as well." [...] During the opera scene in Florence, Lecter attends an operatic adaptation of one of Dante's sonnets, and meets with Detective Pazzi and his wife, Allegra. She asks Lecter, [...] "Do you believe a man could become so obsessed by a woman after a single encounter?" [...] Lecter replies: [...] "Yes, I believe he could... but would she see through the bars of his plight and ache for him?" [...] This scene, in the film, is one which Scott claims most people [...] "missed" [...] the meaning of. It was in reference to Starling—to their encounter <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Silence</b> of the Lambs. The New York Times, in its review of the film, said Hannibal, [...] "toys" [...] with the idea of [...] "love that dare not speak its name". Composer Hans Zimmer believes there to be [...] "many" [...] messages and subtext in each scene of the film. He said, [...] "I can score this movie truly as a Freudian archetypal beauty and the beast fairy tale, as a horror movie, as the most elegant piece, on corruption in the American police force, as the loneliest woman on earth, the beauty in renaissance..." [...] Zimmer ultimately believes it to be a dark love story, centering on two people who should never be together—a modern day Romeo and Juliet. During the film's post-production, Scott, Zimmer and the editor passionately argued about what a single shot meant, where a tear slides down Starling's cheek during a confrontation with Lecter. They could not agree if it was a tear of [...] "anguish", [...] "loneliness" [...] or [...] "disgust". Scott told the New York Post that, the affair of the heart between Lecter and Starling is [...] "metaphorical". Rolling Stone magazine even said in their review, [...] "Scott offers a sly parody of relationships—think 'When Hannibal met Sally'." ...|$|E
