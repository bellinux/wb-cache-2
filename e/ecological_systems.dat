5|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>systems</b> are {{studied at}} several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E

Geographic {{features such as}} the Western Flatwoods, Eastern Flatwoods, and the Atlantic Coastal Ridge affect drainage patterns. Geologic elements, climate, {{and the frequency of}} storms and fire are formative processes for the Everglades. They help to sustain and transform the ecosystems in the Shark River Valley, Big Cypress Swamp, coastal areas and mangrove forests. Ecosystems have been described as both fragile and resilient. Minor fluctuations in water levels have far-reaching consequences for many plant and animal species, and the system cycles and pulses with each change.|$|E

5|$|Biogeography has a {{long history}} in the natural {{sciences}} concerning the spatial distribution of plants and animals. Ecology and evolution provide the explanatory context for biogeographical studies. Biogeographical patterns result from ecological processes that influence range distributions, such as migration and dispersal. and from historical processes that split populations or species into different areas. The biogeographic processes that result in the natural splitting of species explains much of the modern distribution of the Earth's biota. The splitting of lineages in a species is called vicariance biogeography and it is a sub-discipline of biogeography. There are also practical applications in the field of biogeography concerning <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> and processes. For example, the range and distribution of biodiversity and invasive species responding to climate change is a serious concern and active area of research in the context of global warming.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a new {{direction}} of eco-tourism development in China. Using the converse thinking method, we found China eco-tourism is still locating a lower level, and has some problems: the eco-tourism plan is simple and unreasonable; the eco-tourism development has mainly focused on better <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> resource but not the worse; the eco-tourism products mostly expense natural resource and damage <b>ecological</b> <b>system,</b> but not protect or rebuild it. Then we proposed the advice that the eco-tourism development should mainly focus on the destroyed ecosystem, go the length of “two not, one transition” when doing tourism exploitation of worse <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> resource, and emphasize that it must protect and rebuild the <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> but not damage it.

25|$|Because <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> are {{typically}} nonlinear, they often cannot be solved analytically {{and in order}} to obtain sensible results, nonlinear, stochastic and computational techniques must be used. One class of computational models that is becoming increasingly popular are the agent-based models. These models can simulate the actions and interactions of multiple, heterogeneous, organisms where more traditional, analytical techniques are inadequate. Applied theoretical ecology yields results which are used in the real world. For example, optimal harvesting theory draws on optimization techniques developed in economics, computer science and operations research, and is widely used in fisheries.|$|E
25|$|Human {{habitation}} within closed <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> in hostile environments, such as Antarctica {{and outer}} space, is expensive, typically limited in duration, and restricted to scientific, military, or industrial expeditions.

As of , no other celestial body has been visited by humans, although there has been a continuous human presence in space since the launch of the initial crew to inhabit the International Space Station on October 31, 2000.

25|$|Theoretical ecology is the {{scientific}} discipline {{devoted to the}} study of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> using theoretical methods such as simple conceptual models, mathematical models, computational simulations, and advanced data analysis. Effective models improve understanding of the natural world by revealing how the dynamics of species populations are often based on fundamental biological conditions and processes. Further, the field aims to unify a diverse range of empirical observations by assuming that common, mechanistic processes generate observable phenomena across species and ecological environments. Based on biologically realistic assumptions, theoretical ecologists are able to uncover novel, non-intuitive insights about natural processes. Theoretical results are often verified by empirical and observational studies, revealing the power of theoretical methods in both predicting and understanding the noisy, diverse biological world.|$|E

25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in <b>ecological</b> <b>systems,</b> such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.|$|E
25|$|Systems ecology {{can be seen}} as an {{application}} of general systems theory to ecology. It takes a holistic and interdisciplinary approach to the study of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems,</b> and particularly ecosystems. Systems ecology is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions. Like other fields in theoretical ecology, it uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems. It also takes account of the energy flows through the different trophic levels in the ecological networks. In systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows are considered formally analogous to the principles of energetics. Systems ecology also considers the external influence of ecological economics, which usually is not otherwise considered in ecosystem ecology. For the most part, systems ecology is a subfield of ecosystem ecology.|$|E
25|$|Historians {{have also}} noted {{population}} densities seem {{to concentrate on}} coastlines and that states with large coasts benefit from higher average incomes compared to those in landlocked countries. Coastal living has proven advantageous for centuries as civilizations relied on the coastline and waterways for trade, irrigation, and as a food source. Conversely, countries without coastlines or navigable waterways are often less urbanized and have less growth potential due to the slow movement of knowledge capital, technological advances, and people. They also {{have to rely on}} costly and time consuming over-land trade, which usually results in lack of access to regional and international markets, further hindering growth. Additionally, interior locations tend to have both lower population densities and labor-productivity levels. However, factors including fertile soil, nearby rivers, and <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> suited for rice or wheat cultivation can give way to dense inland populations.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For such {{industrial}} products commonly spread worldwide, a compromised viewpoint is often sought {{in order to}} reach a balance between their useful and harmful aspects with regards to all members of the <b>ecological</b> <b>system.</b> Before industrial upheaval, the six members of the closed <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> have been interacting while maintaining each one existence besides fulfilling its main vital needs. The industry-free <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> has then reached its balance state based on a Markovian process. A worldwide industrial product, however, features an introduced member with both useful and harmful aspects. The <b>ecological</b> <b>system</b> is thus expected to disturb for a certain period before ultimately reaching another balance state. The interaction rates between individual members are here experimentally measured and used as entries of 7 x 7 enlarged transfer matrix between two consecutive states. Application of the Markov ecological matrix to analyze motor vehicle environmental balance shows that more than 30 years are urgently required to reach the balance state. However, the balance state includes severe intolerable resource damages...|$|R

25|$|Located on the Middle American isthmus joining North and South America between ca. 10° and 22° {{northern}} latitude, Mesoamerica {{possesses a}} complex combination of <b>ecological</b> <b>systems,</b> topographic zones, and environmental contexts. A main distinction groups these different niches into two broad categories: the lowlands (those areas between sea level and 1000 meters) and the altiplanos, or highlands (situated between 1,000 and 2,000 meters above sea level). In the low-lying regions, sub-tropical and tropical climates are most common, {{as is true}} {{for most of the}} coastline along the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. The highlands show much more climatic diversity, ranging from dry tropical to cold mountainous climates; the dominant climate is temperate with warm temperatures and moderate rainfall. The rainfall varies from the dry Oaxaca and north Yucatán to the humid southern Pacific and Caribbean lowlands.|$|E
25|$|Biosphere 2 was {{originally}} meant {{to demonstrate the}} viability of closed <b>ecological</b> <b>systems</b> to support and maintain human life in outer space, defining mission one as eight humans for two years.

It also explored the use of closed biospheres in space colonization, and allowed the study and manipulation of a biosphere without harming Earth's.
