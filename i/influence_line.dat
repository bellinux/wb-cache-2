50|$|It is {{important}} to understanding where {{the slope of the}} <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> changes for this method because the influence-line equation will change for each linear section of the <b>influence</b> <b>line.</b> Therefore, the complete equation will be a piecewise linear function which has a separate influence-line equation for each linear section of the <b>influence</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} methods used for {{constructing}} the <b>influence</b> <b>line.</b> The {{first is to}} tabulate the influence values for multiple points along the structure, then use those points to create the <b>influence</b> <b>line.</b> The second {{is to determine the}} influence-line equations that apply to the structure, thereby solving for all points along the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> in terms of x, where x is the number of feet {{from the start of the}} structure to the point where the unit load is applied. [...] The third method is called the Müller-Breslau's principle. It creates a qualitative <b>influence</b> <b>line.</b> This <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> will still provide the designer with an accurate idea of where the unit load will produce the largest response of a function at the point being studied, but it cannot be used directly to calculate what the magnitude that response will be, whereas the influence lines produced by the first two methods can.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} find {{the effect of a}} {{distributed}} load, the designer can integrate an <b>influence</b> <b>line,</b> found using a point load, over the affected distance of the structure. For example, if a three-foot-long track acts between 5 feet and 8 feet along a beam, the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> of that beam must be integrated between 5 and 8 feet. The integration of the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> gives the effect that would be felt if the distributed load had a unit magnitude. Therefore, after integrating, the designer must still scale the results to get the actual effect of the distributed load.|$|E
50|$|While the <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> of statically {{determinate}} structures (as mentioned above) {{are made up}} of straight line segments, the same is not true for indeterminate structures. Indeterminate structures are not considered rigid; therefore, the <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> drawn for them will not be straight lines but rather curves. The methods above can still be used to determine the <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> for the structure, but the work becomes much more complex as the properties of the beam itself must be taken into consideration.|$|R

This means if the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> for a reaction is asked for simply start by pretending the beam is no longer attached to the reaction in question and is free to rotate about the other support. If the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> for a moment is desired, pretend the point in question is a hinge and the subsequent two sides can rotate about their supports. If the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> for shear is desired, again pretend the point in question is a shear release, again where both sides can rotate about their supports.|$|E
50|$|Once the {{influence}} values have been tabulated, the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> for the function at point A {{can be drawn}} in terms of x. First, the tabulated values must be located. For the sections in between the tabulated points, interpolation is required. Therefore, straight lines may be drawn to connect the points.

50|$|An <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> for a {{function}} differs from a shear, axial, or bending moment diagram.

The calculated values for each function are then plotted where the load was applied and then connected together to generate the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> for the function.|$|E

50|$|Influence {{lines are}} both scalar and additive. This {{means that they}} can be used even when the load that will be applied is not a unit load or if there are {{multiple}} loads applied. To find the effect of any non-unit load on a structure, the ordinate results obtained by the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> are multiplied by the magnitude of the actual load to be applied. The entire <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> can be scaled, or just the maximum and minimum effects experienced along the line.

40|$|To {{facilitate}} {{an effective}} assessment of stress-related bridge performance and safety, a baseline multiscale finite-element (FE) model and a corresponding model-updating technique are required {{so that the}} FE model can best represent the prototype {{and can be used}} to well predict both global and local responses. The companion paper demonstrates that considering modal frequencies alone as updating objectives cannot ensure the updated multiscale FE model being able to predict local (stress) responses accurately. This paper presents a new updating method that uses both modal frequencies and multiscale (displacement and stress) static <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> as updating objectives. The paper first explains the relationship between displacement <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> and mode shapes and the relationship between strain <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> and strain mode shapes. The formulation of the multiscale objective functions and the selection of updating parameters are then presented. As a case study, the proposed model-updating method is finally applied to the multiscale FE model of the Stonecutters Bridge. In light of the large number of degrees of freedom of the multiscale model, the response surface method is adopted in the optimization process to reduce computation time. The updated results show that the proposed model-updating technique can reduce the differences not only between measured and computed modal frequencies but also between measured and computed <b>influence</b> <b>lines.</b> Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|Influence lines graph the {{response}} of a beam or truss as a unit load travels across it. The <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> allows the designers to discover quickly where to place a live load in order to calculate the maximum resulting response {{for each of the}} following functions: reaction, shear, or moment. The designer can then scale the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> by the greatest expected load to calculate the maximum response of each function for which the beam or truss must be designed.Influence lines {{can also be used to}} find {{the response}}s of other functions (such as deflection or axial force) to the applied unit load, but these uses of influence lines are less common.|$|E
50|$|An <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> {{for a given}} function, such as a reaction, axial force, shear force, or bending moment, is a graph {{that shows}} the {{variation}} of that function at any given point on a structure due to {{the application of a}} unit load at any point on the structure.|$|E

50|$|Designing the bridge, Proskouriakov {{proposed}} a new constructive solution — an original trussed girder. By using featheredge design for its upper chord (similar to Schwedler truss), Proskouriakov extended {{the height of}} the main trusses up to 21.64 m. The engineer also utilized the theory of <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> for truss analysis that enabled more accurate calculation of internal forces in every member in a truss due to moving loads. Since then, the theory of <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> for truss analysis has been used in engineering both in Russia and around the world. Incidentally, the Yenisei bridge was the first in Russia, during the construction of which the incremental launching method was applied for the first time.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} {{multiple}} loads {{may be in}} effect, the <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> for the individual loads may be added together {{in order to obtain}} the total effect felt by the structure at a given point. When adding the <b>influence</b> <b>lines</b> together, it is necessary to include the appropriate offsets due to the spacing of loads across the structure. For example, a truck load is applied to the structure. Rear axle, B, is three feet behind front axle, A, then the effect of A at x feet along the structure must be added to the effect of B at (x - 3) feet along the structure—not the effect of B at x feet along the structure.|$|R
50|$|The Müller-Breslau Principle {{can only}} produce {{qualitative}} influence lines. This means that engineers {{can use it}} to determine where to place a load to incur the maximum of a function, but the magnitude of that maximum cannot be calculated from the <b>influence</b> <b>line.</b> Instead, the engineer must use statics to solve for the functions value in that loading case.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{calculate}} the response of a function {{to all of these}} point loads using an <b>influence</b> <b>line,</b> the results found with the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> can be scaled for each load, and then the scaled magnitudes can be summed to find the total response that the structure must withstand. The point loads can have different magnitudes themselves, but even if they apply the same force to the structure, {{it will be necessary to}} scale them separately because they act at different distances along the structure. For example, if a car's wheels are 10 feet apart, then when the first set is 13 feet onto the bridge, the second set will be only 3 feet onto the bridge. If the first set of wheels is 7 feet onto the bridge, the second set has not yet reached the bridge, and therefore only the first set is placing a load on the bridge.|$|E
50|$|R. C. Hibbeler states, in {{his book}} Structural Analysis, “All statically {{determinate}} beams will have influence lines that consist of straight line segments.” Therefore, {{it is possible to}} minimize the number of computations by recognizing the points that will cause a change in the slope of the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> and only calculating the values at those points. The slope of the inflection line can change at supports, mid-spans, and joints.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} how the beam will deflect under the function, it is necessary to remove the beam’s capacity to resist the function.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to create equations defining the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> across the entire span of a structure. This is done by solving for the reaction, shear, or moment at the point A caused by a unit load placed at x feet along the structure instead of a specific distance. This method {{is similar to the}} tabulated values method, but rather than obtaining a numeric solution, the outcome is an equation in terms of x.|$|E
50|$|Many loads are {{distributed}} rather than concentrated. Influence lines {{can be used}} with either concentrated or distributed loadings. For a concentrated (or point) load, a unit point load is moved along the structure. For a distributed load of a given width, a unit-distributed load of the same width is moved along the structure, noting that as the load nears the ends and moves off the structure only part of the total load is carried by the structure. The effect of the distributed unit load can also be obtained by integrating the point load’s <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> over the corresponding length of the structures.|$|E
5000|$|According to www.public.iastate.edu, “The Müller-Breslau Principle can be {{utilized}} to draw qualitative influence lines, which are {{directly proportional to}} the actual influence line.” [...] Instead of moving a unit load along a beam, the Müller-Breslau Principle finds the deflected shape of the beam caused by first releasing the beam at the point being studied, and then applying the function (reaction, shear, or moment) being studied to that point. The principle states that the <b>influence</b> <b>line</b> of a function will have a scaled shape {{that is the same}} as the deflected shape of the beam when the beam is acted upon by the function.|$|E
