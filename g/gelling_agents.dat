2500|$|The US EPA has {{acknowledged}} that toxic, carcinogenic chemicals, i.e. benzene and ethylbenzene, {{have been used as}} <b>gelling</b> <b>agents</b> in water and chemical mixtures for high volume horizontal fracturing (HVHF). [...] Following the hydraulic fracture in HVHF, the water, chemicals, and frack fluid that return to the well's surface, called flowback or produced water, may contain radioactive materials, heavy metals, natural salts, and hydrocarbons which exist naturally in shale rock formations. [...] Fracking chemicals, radioactive materials, heavy metals, and salts that are removed from the HVHF well by well operators are so difficult to remove from the water they're mixed with, and would so heavily pollute the water cycle, that most of the flowback is either recycled into other fracking operations or injected into deep underground wells, eliminating the water that HVHF required from the hydrologic cycle.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the ratio between the modulus of the oil {{droplets}} {{and that of the}} gel matrix (varied by changing <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentration and oil droplet size) on the large deformation properties of gelatine, ¿-carrageenan and whey protein isolate (WPI) gels was studied at different compression speeds. The effect of <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentration and oil droplet size on strain-dependency of modulus and viscoelastic properties was also studied. An increase in the concentration of <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> resulted in denser gels with more bonds between structural elements. This induced an increase of both Young's modulus and fracture stress for all gels. With increasing <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentration, polymer <b>gels</b> (gelatine and ¿-carrageenan) became less strain-hardening, and the particle gels (WPI) even became strain-softening. The effect of a decrease in the oil droplet size on the Young's modulus was generally according to the Van der Poel theory, unless when the oil droplets were aggregated. Moreover, a decrease in oil droplet size induced a decrease of the fracture strain in gels with non-aggregated bound droplets. The extent of these changes was shown to depend on the <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentration. The effect of a decrease of the oil droplet size on other fracture parameters and in other gel systems was minor. With decreasing oil droplet size gelatine gels with unbound droplets and WPI gels became more viscous and less elastic. Keywords: Carrageenan gels; Gelatine gels; WPI gels; Emulsion...|$|R
5000|$|Jellies and gums:Jellies and gums are thick {{liquid sugar}} candies. [...] Gums, such as wine gums, are drier than jellies. They {{are made from}} sugar syrup plus a <b>gelling</b> <b>agent.</b> They are cooked to the lowest {{temperature}} of all sugar candies and consequently have the highest water content of sugar candies, about 20 to 25% water. Their stiffness depends on the type and amount of <b>gelling</b> <b>agent,</b> the final concentration, the pH of the product, and other factors. The most popular forms of <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> are gelatin, agar-agar, starch (more typical of American jelly candies), and pectin (more typical of European candies).

40|$|Foods for People with Difficulty Swallowing in {{accordance}} with the new Foods for Special Dietary Use System enacted in April 2009 are based on three levels of criteria classifications corresponding to severity according to physical property criteria consisting of hardness, adhesion and aggregation. On the other hand, since in-depth testing of individual cases using Videofluoroscopic examination of swallowing (VF) and the like becomes increasingly indispensible as the severity of the patient's condition increases, in the case the patient uses commercially available foods certified as "Foods for People with Difficulty Swallowing", it is necessary that the type of foods selected coincide with test results. With this in mind, a study was conducted of conditions for preparing VF test foods suitable for each level of the aforementioned criteria classifications for the purpose of achieving a correlation between clinical findings and commercially available foods consumed on a daily basis. [Methods] Test foods were prepared by using a commercially available <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> and thickener in liquid barium diluted to 50 w/v%. At that time, physical properties of the test foods were measured while changing the concentrations of <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> and thickener. Measurements were made using a creep meter, while hardness, adhesion and aggregation were calculated based on methods defined in the regulations for approval of indication of foods for special dietary use. [Results] The hardness of the prepared test foods demonstrated higher values at 10 °C than at 20 °C in all cases. The test foods were determined {{to be able to be}} prepared at <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentrations of 1. 00 % and 1. 75 % for approval level I, at <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentrations of 0. 50 % and 2. 25 % for approval level II, and at a thickener concentration of 1. 00 % and <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentration of 2. 75 % for approval level III at 10 °C, and at <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentrations of 1. 00 % and 2. 00 % for approval level I, at <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentrations of 0. 75 % and 2. 50 % for approval level II, and at a thickener concentration of 1. 50 % and <b>gelling</b> <b>agent</b> concentration of 3. 00 % for approval level III at 20 °C. [Conclusion] The use of the results of this study will enable the preparation of test foods that satisfy each approval level of "Foods for People with Difficulty Swallowing" according to the new Food for Special Dietary Use System in the clinical setting. This suggested that it will be possible to achieve agreement between VF test results and commercially available foods...|$|R
