To achieve this goal, this study analyzed articles of “Youji no Kyoiku (Early Childhood Care and Education) ”. The result indicated that discussions can be classified into four stages: (1) From 1946 to the mid- 1947, various groups of the society discussed actively about the relationship and unification of kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries.</b> (2) From mid- 1947 to 1948, as a result of the enactment of the School Education Law and Child Welfare Act, the ECCE system was divided into two distinct forms of institutions: kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries,</b> but it was argued at the same time that educational contents of kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries</b> should be similar. (3) In 1949, ministry officials reemphasized fundamental differences between kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries.</b> (4) Likewise, after 1950, educators and experts started also look at some differences between kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries.</b> In conclusion, this study revealed that debates on the relationship between kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries</b> in occupied Japan varied over time and varied depending on the status and influence of social groups involved...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explain the {{development}} of systems and institutions for early childhood education and care in Ishikawa Prefecture before World War II from the viewpoint of both kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries.</b> Previous studies have focused on the history of kindergartens and have rarely mentioned the development of <b>day</b> <b>nurseries</b> in Ishikawa Prefecture, even though both provide education and care for young children. This study reveals the following three points: First, regarding kindergartens, their systems had existed prior to the establishment of institutions, and the first kindergarten in Ishikawa Prefecture was a private institution. After that, private kindergartens advanced the increase of kindergartens. Second, because Ishikawa Prefecture is a rural area, <b>day</b> <b>nurseries</b> were necessary so that parents or guardians could work during the day, especially during busy farming seasons, and to protect infants and young children while their parents were at work. Third, however kindergartens and <b>day</b> <b>nurseries</b> were established individually, they are related on the basis of early childhood education and care...|$|R

25|$|Women in the {{workforce}} meant that working mothers needed access to childcare. In anticipation of mothers in {{the workforce}}, the Federal Minister of Labour was empowered to enter into agreements {{for the establishment of}} daycare facilities for the children of mothers working in war industries. From 1942 to 1946, the Dominion-Provincial Wartime Agreement allowed for subsidized <b>day</b> <b>nursery</b> care for mothers working in essential wartime industries. Provinces that were most industrialized, such as Ontario and Quebec, saw a growing demand for this type of service and took advantage of this agreement to establish their own standards and regulations. This program provided aid to mothers working in war industries; however, it placed strict limitations similar services for women with young children in other work sectors. These wartime day nurseries boasted organized play, frequent outings and other features that would become early childhood education. In June 1946, with the war in Europe over, Federal funding for day nurseries was pulled and the majority of day nurseries were closed. However, some municipalities continued offering day care services and made up the shortfall.|$|E
