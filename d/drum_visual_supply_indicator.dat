40|$|The {{purpose of}} our {{research}} was to estimate the brain blood supply level by rheoencephalography method in junior students of the Medical academy and to determine the blood supply links with the autonomic regulation state, behavioural and alimentary factors. Rheo-encephalographic study, research of the autonomic nervous system state, heart rate regulation and questioning of 17 – 29 year-old students have been conducted. Basic hemodynamic indices were normal in all surveyed students. Increase in body weight index enhanced the probability of the brain blood supply deterioration. Adaptation mechanisms tension was accompanied by reduction of the rheographic index. Higher blood filling of the brain vessels corersponded to higher ratio “blood minute volume / due blood minute volume” defined {{taking into account the}} system arterial pressure. The quantity of links with indicators of the autonomic nervous system state was limited. Nonlinear dependence of the rheographic index on the Kerdo vegetative index was observed: the rheographic index value was the lowest in students with the autonomic balance by the Kerdo vegetative index; it was the highest in the group with the sympathetic prevalence. Risk factor of blood filling decrease was the reduction in the diet variety when foodstuffs of different groups were included into the diet less than twice a week, or they were excluded from the diet completely. Positive correlation of blood supply was observed more often with frequent consumption of fish, vegetables, and fresh fruits. Increase in the regular alcohol intake experience promoted decrease in brain blood supply and increase in asymmetries of blood <b>supply</b> <b>indicators.</b> The effect of alcohol was essential, despite young age of surveyed students and low level of alcohol consumption. Increase in the experience and intensity of smoking was accompanied by deterioration of brain blood <b>supply</b> <b>indicators.</b> Students with the best blood supply had the better academic progress. Observed multiple correlations of blood <b>supply</b> <b>indicators</b> with behavioural factors allowed to assert that reduction of risk factors (control of body weight, variety and full value of a diet, refusal of smoking, alcohol restriction even below doses which are considered safe) would allow to improve the brain blood supply...|$|R

40|$|The Cretaceous/Paleogene (K/Pg) {{boundary}} extinction {{event is}} {{inextricably linked to}} the Chicxulub impact. Envi- ronmental changes like sea level changes and changes in food supply prior to or after the impact could however {{have contributed to the}} biotic turnover. In this study, benthic foraminifera from two cores from the Brazos River area in Texas are quantitatively analyzed in order to reconstruct environmental changes across the K/Pg bound- ary. Cluster analysis as well as non-metric multidimensional scaling reveals three distinct benthic foraminiferal assemblages: an upper Maastrichtian assemblage, a post-impact assemblage, and a lower Danian assemblage. The rather uniform upper Maastrichtian assemblage at Brazos River, composed of e. g. Clavulinoides midwayensis, Gavelinella dumblei, Cibicidoides harperi, Gyroidinoides aequilateralis and Bulimina kickapooensis, indicates a stable paleodepth of about 75 – 100 m up to the K/Pg boundary. Food <b>supply</b> <b>indicators</b> such as percentage Buliminaceae and foraminiferal numbers suggest a relatively low and stable food supply during this interval. Environmental disruption caused by the Chicxulub impact led to the settlement of a typical pioneer assemblage, characterized by endobenthic morphotypes such as Ammobaculites spp. and Pseudouvigerina naheolensis. During the early Danian, the typical Midway-type benthic foraminiferal shelf fauna (e. g. Alabamina midwayensis, Anomalinoides acutus, Gyroidinoides subangulatus, Praebulimina carseyae and Cibicidoides alleni) developed, indicating a paleodepth of 75 – 100 m. No clear water depth changes can be derived from the benthic foraminiferal record dur- ing this interval, although the sedimentary record suggests a shallowing followed by a transgressive pulse in Zone P 1 a. Food <b>supply</b> <b>indicators</b> suggest a lower food supply in the early Danian than during the upper Maastrichtian. Because of the stability of the late Maastrichtian environment we conclude that environmental disruption caused by the impact was most likely the principal cause of the benthic foraminiferal turnover across the K/Pg boundary observed at Brazos River. status: publishe...|$|R
30|$|To {{maintain}} {{the growth of}} the organic sector {{there is a need for}} a mature and independent organic food market (Michelsen et al. 2001). This necessitates the establishment of a complete supply chain, which includes producers, processors, distributors and retailers (indicators 27 – 29). A complete supply chain will favour supermarkets as sale channel and will increase the availability of organic products (indicator 29), which in turn will increase demand (<b>indicator</b> 33) and <b>supply</b> (<b>indicator</b> 30) (Terra Nord 2005). Another important characteristic of the organic market is the price premium of organic products (indicators 32). Consumers that are more knowledgeable about organic farming will be willing to pay a higher price premium (indicator 31) (DFAF 2001). The demand for organic products increases when certification authority is considered reliable (indicator 34) (DFAF 2001).|$|R

The results suggest that both higher prices for existing homes and recent increases in development costs are positively associated with local single-family home permit rates.

The average local price elasticity of new single-family home supply is considerably less than one, with surprising differences across the urban hierarchy...|$|R

Several regulatory actions have been taken in this regard and have been applied at European level.

40|$|Objectives: Illegal {{drug use}} {{continues}} to be a major threat to community health and safety. We used international drug surveillance databases to assess the relationship between multiple long-term estimates of illegal drug price and purity. Design: We systematically searched for longitudinal measures of illegal drug <b>supply</b> <b>indicators</b> to assess the long-term impact of enforcement-based supply reduction interventions. Setting: Data from identified illegal drug surveillance systems were analysed using an a priori defined protocol in which we sought to present annual estimates beginning in 1990. Data were then subjected to trend analyses. Main outcome measures: Data were obtained from government surveillance systems assessing price, purity and/or seizure quantities of illegal drugs; systems with at least 10 years of longitudinal data assessing price, purity/potency or seizures were included. Results: We identified seven regional/international metasurveillance systems with longitudinal measures of price or purity/potency that met eligibility criteria.

However, the same cannot be said for the age group of 0 to 3, because only São Caetano do Sul has met that demand. The remaining cities accounted for, in 2010, a service in kindergarten lower than the expected 50 % in PNE 2001 - 2010.

This enabled a new estimation of the parameters with additional data, providing an update of those models. The methodology was based on spatial statistics and spatial modeling techniques. The results of the models developed here demonstrated that the incorporation of the new data secured a consistency equivalent to the previous models proposed by the cited authors. In particular, the performance of two models, both incorporating road infrastructure supply, was higher in the analyses involving the municipalities classified in the quadrant HH of the Moran scatterplot.
