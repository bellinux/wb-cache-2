40|$|This report {{presents}} {{the background and}} rationale for the IIED-IDS action research on <b>institutionalising</b> participatory approaches and people centred processes in natural resource management. The methodologies used in the different case studies (India, Indonesia, Senegal, Mexico and other settings) are then introduced, along with the complementary studies undertaken in this collaborative research programme. The last section of this report contains highlights of all the publications in the <b>Institutionalising</b> Participation Series, and a summary of each. The <b>Institutionalising</b> Participation project examines the dynamics of <b>institutionalising</b> people-centered processes and participatory approaches for natural resource management. How can organizations facilitate and support the participation of local actors throughout the participatory management process? Under what conditions can bureaucracies be refashioned or transformed {{to ensure that their}} outcomes (policies, programmes, resource allocation and projects) actually facilitate, rather than inhibit, participation and the local adaptive management of natural resources? How do roles, rights, responsibilities and the distribution of costs and benefits need to change among actors in civil society, government and the private sector...|$|R

5|$|Ideological and {{political}} rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, {{one of the}} most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and Yijing), was a Confucian.

In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously.

5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended from playing by the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned from playing. He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life <b>institutionalised</b> there.|$|E

5|$|Under {{pressure}} from London, the Demerara Court of Policy eventually passed an 'Ordinance for the religious instruction of slaves and for meliorating their condition' in 1825 which <b>institutionalised</b> working hours and some civil rights for slaves. The weekend {{was to be}} from sunset on Saturday to sunrise on Monday; field work was also defined to be from 6 am to 6 pm, with a mandatory two-hour break. A Protector of Slaves was appointed; whipping was abolished for women as was its use in the field. The rights to marriage and own property was legalised, as was the right to acquire manumission. Amendments and new ordinances continued to flow from London, each progressively establishing more civil rights for the slaves, but they were strongly resisted by the colonial legislature.|$|E
5|$|When Priestley's friend Theophilus Lindsey {{decided to}} found a new Christian {{denomination}} that would not restrict its members' beliefs, Priestley and others hurried to his aid. On 17 April 1774, Lindsey held the first Unitarian service in Britain, at the newly formed Essex Street Chapel in London; he had even designed his own liturgy, of which many were critical. Priestley defended his friend in the pamphlet Letter to a Layman, on the Subject of the Rev. Mr. Lindsey's Proposal for a Reformed English Church (1774), claiming that only the form of worship had been altered, not its substance, and attacking those who followed religion as a fashion. Priestley attended Lindsey's church regularly in the 1770s and occasionally preached there. He continued to support <b>institutionalised</b> Unitarianism {{for the rest of}} his life, writing several Defenses of Unitarianism and encouraging the foundation of new Unitarian chapels throughout Britain and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1876 Jenny Morris was {{diagnosed}} with epilepsy. Refusing {{to allow her to}} be societally marginalised or <b>institutionalised,</b> as was common in the period, Morris insisted that she be cared for by the family. When Janey took May and Jenny to Oneglia in Italy, the latter suffered a serious seizure, with Morris rushing to the country to see her. They then proceeded to visit a number of other cities, including Venice, Padua, and Verona, with Morris attaining a greater appreciation of the country than he had on his previous trip. In April 1879 Morris moved the family home again, this time renting an 18th-century mansion on Hammersmith's Upper Mall in West London. Owned by the novelist George MacDonald, Morris would name it Kelmscott House and re-decorate it according to his own taste. In the House's grounds he set up a workshop, focusing on the production of hand-knotted carpets. Excited that both of his homes were along the course of the River Thames, in August 1880 he and his family took a boat trip along the river from Kelmscott House to Kelmscott Manor.|$|E

5|$|The Turn of the Screw (also {{known as}} Ghost Story: The Turn of the Screw) is a British {{television}} film based on Henry James's 1898 ghost {{story of the}} same name. Commissioned and produced by the BBC, it was first broadcast on 30 December 2009, on BBC One. The novella was adapted for the screen by Sandy Welch, and the film was directed by Tim Fywell. Although generally true to the tone and story of James's work, the film {{is set in the}} 1920s‚Äîin contrast to the original 1840s setting‚Äîand accentuates sexual elements that some theorists have identified in the novella. The film's story is told in flashbacks during consultations between the <b>institutionalised</b> Ann (Michelle Dockery) and Dr Fisher (Dan Stevens). Ann tells how she was hired by an aristocrat (Mark Umbers) to care for the orphans Miles (Josef Lindsay) and Flora (Eva Sayer). She is met at the children's home, Bly, by Mrs Grose (Sue Johnston), the housekeeper. Ann soon begins to see unknown figures around the manor, and seeks an explanation.|$|E
5|$|The {{order of}} {{precedence}} had been <b>institutionalised,</b> whereby Taraki was responsible for defence and Amin responsible for assisting Taraki in defence related matters. Amin's position was given a further blow by the democratisation of the decision-making process, which allowed its members to contribute; {{most of them were}} against Amin. Another problem for Amin was that the office of HHDC Deputy Chairman had no specific functions or powers, and the appointment of a new defence minister who opposed him drastically weakened his control over the Ministry of National Defence. The reorganisation of ministers was a further blow to Amin's position; he had lost control of the defence ministry, the interior ministry and the ASGA. Amin still had allies at the top, many of them in strategically important positions, for instance, Yaqub was his brother-in-law and the Security Chief in the Ministry of Interior was Sayed Daoud Taroon, who was also later appointed to the HHDC as an ordinary member in April. Amin succeeded in appointing two more of his allies to important positions; Mohammad Sediq Alemyar as Minister of Planning and Khayal Mohammad Katawazi as Minister of Information and Culture; and Faqir Mohammad Faqir was appointed Deputy Prime Minister in April 1978. Amin's political position was not secure when Alexei Yepishev, the Head of the Main Political Directorate of the Soviet Army and Navy, visited Kabul. Yepishev met personally with Taraki on 7 April, but never met with Amin. The Soviets were becoming increasingly worried about Amin's control over the Afghan military. Even so, during Yepishev's visit Amin's position was actually strengthened; Taroon was appointed Taraki's aide-de-camp.|$|E
5|$|There {{are further}} {{multiple}} problems with Gorman's version of events. An apartment at 6 Cleveland Street {{could not have}} been raided in April 1888, since by that time Nos. 4‚Äì14 Cleveland Street had been demolished, and the house no longer existed. Annie and Alice were not supported by a wealthy patron, such as Albert Victor, but were paupers who occasionally lived in workhouses. Annie was not <b>institutionalised</b> for insanity but because of recurrent epilepsy. The Ripper victims were not known to be acquainted with each other or Annie Crook, who lived {{on the other side of}} Central London. Even if they had known her or her child, it is unlikely that their tale of royal illegitimacy would be believed, so any attempt by them to reveal the supposed scandal would merely have been dismissed. Gull retired from practice in 1887 after suffering a stroke, which left him temporarily partially paralysed and unable to speak. Gull did recover, but he suffered further attacks before his death in 1890. Furthermore, neither Lord Salisbury, nor Sir James Anderson, nor Sir William Gull were freemasons, and there is no documentary evidence linking Netley to the other suspects, nor did he drown in the Thames. He was actually killed in 1903 after falling under the wheels of his own van. The forensic evidence indicates that the bodies of the victims were not moved, and so were not dissected in a carriage and then moved to where they were discovered. Some of the streets where the victims were found were too narrow for a carriage. Sickert did not have a studio in Cleveland Street, and there is no proof that he knew the Princess of Wales. Anderson was in Switzerland at the time of the double murder, and so was not one of the perpetrators.|$|E

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{exists that}} organisations {{do not do}} much to ensure the institutionalisation of business ethics in general, and more specifically, the ethical behaviour of their employees. The possibility that mentoring may act {{as a vehicle to}} <b>institutionalise</b> corporate ethical practices was proposed as a possible solution to the aforementioned problem. This possibility was formulated {{in the form of a}} research question. A literature study on mentoring and ethics was applied as theoretical foundation to this research. The aim of this part of the study was to answe r the first six research sub-questions related to mentoring and ethics. A qualitative study followed to answer the remaining sub-questions, namely whether organisations do make use of mentoring as a tool to <b>institutionalise</b> ethical behaviour; to establish how organisations make use of mentoring to <b>institutionalise</b> ethical behaviour; and whether mentoring is a suitable vehicle to <b>institutionalise</b> corporate ethical practices. From this study, it became evident that organisations do implement mentoring to a certain extent, but do not formally use mentoring as a tool to convey ethical messages. This study revealed that mentors transfer ethical messages on an informal basis, although the organisation does not expect them to do so. Further, no previous research could be found on the role of mentoring in the institutionalisation of business ethics. All participants of this study agreed that mentoring would be suitable as vehicle to <b>institutionalise</b> corporate ethical principles. This process needs to be formalised and integrated. An integrated model of mentoring in the institutionalisation of business ethics was generated which highlights the compatibility of these two processes. This model could be a handy tool firstly for designers of mentoring programmes, secondly for organisations implementing mentoring programmes and finally for tertiary institutions that train managers.
