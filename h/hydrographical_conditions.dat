40|$|The {{dependence}} of recruitment strength on <b>hydrographical</b> <b>conditions</b> has been studied, i. e., possible {{relationship between the}} transport of sprat larvae from the Skagerak to the stock in western Norway and the thickness of Skagerak water in the coastal current. The material consists of data from 23 years of hydrographical observations and catch statistics. A correlation analysis gave the correlation coefficient r= 0. 4713 (P≈ 0. 02). which means that good catches seem to be conditioned by a great thickness of Skagerak water the previous year. The validity of the material is discussed, especially the use of catch statistics as numerical expression of recruitment strength. An analysis {{of the influence of}} prevailing winds on the <b>hydrographical</b> <b>conditions</b> and on the catch distribution has been carried out. Weak northerly winds during summer seem to give the southernmost county in western Norway a greater proportion of the total sprat catch the following year.

50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{believe that}} the poet Kalidasa {{who was in the}} court of Chandra Gupta II Vikramaditya, really narrated in canto IV of his Raghuvansha, the conquering tour (digvijaya) of Samudra Gupta under the poetic disguise of Raghu. At any rate, Kalidasa {{in the beginning of the}} fifth century A.D. must have recorded the facts concerning the countries of India mentioned in his book according to his own knowledge of those countries. For instance, the <b>hydrographical</b> <b>condition</b> of Bengal at that time is clearly referred to in canto IV, verses 34 to 38. The poet mentions that Raghu's son Aja selected the king of Kamarupa as his best man in his marriage with Indumati. This shows that the king of Kamarupa of his time, who was probably Samudra Varman, was a very important monarch belonging to an old and reputed dynasty; otherwise the poet would not have made him the best man of the son of his hero.|$|R
40|$|With global warming, annual {{temperature}} on the Tibetan Plateau, where {{is also known}} as the “Third Pole” and the “Water Tower of Asia”, has increased significantly during the last decades. Climate change on the Tibetan Plateau has caused a series of problems, for example, changed <b>hydrographical</b> <b>condition,</b> accelerated glacial melting and expedited permafrost degradation. There is a growing concern that water chemical compositions (e. g. ions, elements, dissolved carbon and nitrogen) in rivers of the Tibetan Plateau will be affected by changes in <b>hydrographical</b> <b>condition</b> as well as human activities. Based on the study in nine rivers of the Tibet Plateau (e. g. the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Yarlung Tsangpo, etc.), we found that water ionic chemistry in rivers of the plateau is significantly affected by natural processes such as rock weathering, soil erosion and evaporation-crystallization. Nevertheless, high concentrations of toxic elements (i. e. Hg, Tl, Cd and Pb) that appeared in the Yangtze River and the Yarlung Tsangpo suggested that anthropogenic activities (e. g. mining, factories and tourism) have played critical roles in regional water chemistry budget of the Tibetan Plateau. Chemical substances such as dissolved carbon and nitrogen in rivers will affect GHGs emissions to the atmosphere. In this study, related information in rivers of the plateau are provided. It was found that concentrations of DIN and DON in rivers of the Tibetan Plateau were similar to the world average level, while concentrations of DIC were much higher than that of most other rivers due to intensive water erosion within the catchments. With the first insights of isotope compositions of DOC, we found that the average radiocarbon ages in rivers of the Tibetan Plateau were fairly old, indicating that ancient carbon from the permafrost regions of the plateau might be exported to rivers with its melting/degradation. In addition, despite their low partial pressures, GHGs emission fluxes in rivers of the Tibetan Plateau were demonstrated comparable with many other rivers in the world (e. g. the Amazon and rivers in boreal region) due to large flow velocity and elevated DIC concentrations. Therefore, with climate change in this ecological fragile region, we can come to a safe conclusion that there will be an increasing export of dissolved carbon, nitrogen and GHGs from rivers of the Tibetan Plateau, which will in turn potentially add feedbacks to the regional climate...|$|R
40|$|The Kongsfjorden is a fjord {{ecosystem}} on {{the west}} coast of Spitsbergen. Because of its unique location the fjord is seen as a model system for the effects of global warming in the Arctic. For this reason a lot of scientific research takes place in the Kongsfjorden. The influence of warm Atlantic water masses entering the Kongsfjorden from the West Spitsbergen Current may cause the warming of the Arctic to occur faster in the Kongsfjorden than {{in the rest of the}} Arctic region. These unique oceanographical circumstances have an effect on the community composition making it a mix between boreal and Arctic species. Because of the increasing warming of the climate and the increasing inflow of Atlantic Water the Arctic community members are threatened. Organisms constituting the base of the food web like the phyto- and zooplankton are strongly linked to their original water masses. Other primary producers like benthic macroalgae experience additional negative effects of the warming climate by changing <b>hydrographical</b> <b>condition</b> in the fjord caused by an increasing runoff of melt water from the adjacent glaciers. These effects cascade through the entire ecosystem threatening to change the community composition in the Kongsfjorden from a mixed to a more Atlantic composition. ...|$|R

40|$|During the 1990 – 2008 period {{heterotrophic}} prokaryotes abundance (HP) in {{the northern}} Adriatic showed a substantial decrease after 2003. Before 2003 the HP annual cycle was characterized by minimal values during winter (100 – 134 · 107 cell l− 1, on average) and a gradual increase toward summer (up to 212 · 107 cell l− 1, on average). After 2003 HP was low during the most {{part of the year}} (27 – 63 · 107 cell l− 1, on average), with somewhat higher values only at the end of summer and in April (up to 80 · 107 cell l− 1 in average). The overall higher Leu/TdR ratio after 2003 showed that prokaryotes were increasing their cellular biomass butmore slowly dividing than before. Therewere indications that changed hydrographic conditions, reduced substrate supply and quality changes might be the most responsible factors for the observed HP decrease and change in their growth characteristics. As a consequence of lower HP heterotrophic flagellates abundance (HF) after 2003 (average 0. 57 · 106 cell l− 1) generally decreased by about three times.

Temporal changes in nutrients concentrations and their relative abundance were found to induce a clear shift in the phytoplankton composition.

40|$|A {{significant}} element characterizing {{a lasting}} development in Braila Plain region, {{but also in}} any other similar area, would be an environment factor that is the water, with an increasing importance when considered against the high dryness background. Generally speaking, both the consumed water and the consumption structure reflect {{the quality and quantity}} of water resources and, implicitly, the economic potential of the region at issue. As for Braila Plain, here there is a paradox to be considered: even if the region is bordered by highly significant rivers (The Danube and Siret) with huge flows – not to mention here the salty water lakes or underground streams with a more or less drinking water – the need of drinking water becomes obvious, mostly in summer and autumn. The climate, morphometric and lithological conditions confer certain peculiarities upon the waters resources of the Northern-Eastern Romanian Plain. One can say about the Braila Plain hydrographical network that it is poor and this is due to the discharge, situated under the value of 1 l/sqkm, but also to the very low relief energy. The allochthonous Rivers: the Danube, Siret, Buzau and Calmatui are affected by the relief climate conditions and also by the size and the geographic position of the hydrographical basins [...] dryness, evapo-perspiration, mineralization, <b>hydrographical</b> basin, climate <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{variability}} {{of the carbon}} dioxide in the eastern North Atlantic Ocean was investigated by studying three seasons with different <b>hydrographical</b> and meteorological <b>conditions</b> that lead to two main different situations: upwelling and downwelling. No correlation between surface pCO 2 and chlorophyll was found in spring, although significant correlation was found in autumn when strong downwelling was the observed. The convergence developed over the slope produce different regimes of stability of the water column on the shelf creating areas of high and low pCO 2 levels. A positive correlation (r 2 = 0. 50; n= 33) between surface pCO 2 and chlorophyll points out during the upwelling season. High pCO 2 is found when the greatest concentration of chlorophyll exists. The uptake of carbon by photosynthetic activity masks the increase of dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in surface due to the upwelling event. Without this biological effect the increase of pCO 2 during the upwelling will be even higher. Air-sea fluxes of CO 2 were calculated for the three studied seasons. The average CO 2 flux from the atmosphere to the ocean (0. 47 mmol m- 2. d- 1) in the eastern margin of North Atlantic was slightly lower than those given in previous studies in the North Atlantic ocean because of the influence of upwelling. 1...|$|R
40|$|The Cochin backwaters {{which form}} {{more or less}} a northward {{extension}} of the Vembanad lake have all the characteristics of a typical estuary. On the southern side of the backwaters there is the influx of waters of the Pampa river and on the northern side, the Periyar. The channel to the west opening out into the Arabian Sea is the main area for the exchange between the sea and the estuary. These backwaters thus form a very interesting subject of study not only {{from the point of view}} of the seasonal variation in the various hydrographic parameters, but also this is an area where there is considerable scope for a theoretical study of magnitude of exchanges across the transition. The tidal exchanges across the channel are fairly high, as also the influx of freshwater. Apart from the influence of monsoon rains and the considerable amount of evaporation during hot months in this shallow environment, the influence of various types of phenomena in the Arabian Sea such as upwelling, sinking, coastal piling etc. is quite considerable and these result in certain characteristic variations in the <b>hydrographical</b> and associated <b>conditions</b> in this area.

The aim is to discuss relevant updates published in international peer-reviewed research papers and monographs, bearing in mind that a comprehensive overview of the studies up to the mid- 1990 s is available (Alenius et al. 1998). We start the discussion with updates on the basic <b>hydrographical</b> and stratification <b>conditions,</b> and progress {{in the understanding of}} atmospheric forcing and air-sea interaction.

The South China Sea (SCS), where aerosol loading is {{among the highest in the}} world, however, is poorly studied, particularly on the in situ response of phytoplankton community structures to atmospheric deposition. By conducting a series of microcosm bioassays at different hydrographical locations and simulating different aerosol event scales, we observed both positive and negative responses to the input of East Asian (EA) aerosol with high nitrogen (N) and trace metal contents, in terms of biomass, composition and physiological characteristics of phytoplankton communities. High levels of aerosol loading relieved phytoplankton nitrogen and trace metal limitations in SCS, and thus increased total phytoplankton biomass, enhanced their physiological indicators (e. g. photosynthetic efficiency) and shifted phytoplankton assemblages from being dominated by picoplankton to microphytoplanton, especially diatoms. However, under low levels of aerosol loading, the composition shift and biomass accumulation were not apparent, suggesting that the stimulation effects might be counterbalanced by enhanced grazing mortality indicated by increased abundance of protist grazers. Trace metal toxicity of the aerosols might also be the reason for the reduction of picocyanobacteria when amended with high EA aerosols. The magnitude and duration of the deposition event, as well as the <b>hydrographical</b> and trophic <b>conditions</b> of receiving waters are also important factors when predicting the influence of an aerosol deposition event.

Considering both <b>hydrographical</b> and geomorphologic <b>conditions,</b> the study area was divided in four geographical sectors. Multivariate techniques were applied to identify assemblages and their main species, and to investigate the influence of environmental variables in the slope communities. Fishery-independent and fishery-dependent indicators were calculated, both at specific and community level, for the assemblages identified. In all cases, they were summarised using the Traffic Light approach. Three assemblages {{have been identified in}} the slope trawl fishing grounds off the Balearic Islands: (1) the almost unexploited shelf break, where teleosts predominate; (2) the upper slope, where teleosts still predominate but crustaceans are also very important (with Nephrops norvegicus as target species); (3) and the middle slope, where crustaceans predominate (with Aristeus antennatus as target species). Depth was the main factor affecting the species composition of the assemblages, although other factors such as area, year and effort level also affect. Indicators estimated from both sets of data suggested an improvement in the state of N. norvegicus, although the results suggest the influence of other factors than fishing impact in the state of this resource. For A. antennatus, marked differences have been found depending on the data source. In the upper slope, indicators suggested an improvement in the state of this assemblage, which can be related to a decreasing trend found in the fishing effort exerted in this depth range. Indicators from the middle slope showed differences for both sets of data.

[...] 141 pagesWe have analysed {{the relationship}} of the ictioplankton community with its fisical and trophic environment in two <b>hydrographical</b> contrasting <b>conditions</b> (summer stratification versus autumn mixed column), and we have characterized the larval diet of five teleost species in the NW Mediterranean: the three clupeiform of the region [anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) ], a small tuna [bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) ] and the most important demersal species of the region [hake (Merluccius merluccius) ]. These species have been chosen because they represent two different morphotypes, 1) that of the clupeiforms, which correspond to a stylized larvae with small mouth, long body and digestive tract linked to the tail, and 2) that of bullet tuna and hake, which correspond to a robust larvae with big mouth, robust body and compact digestive tract independent of the tail. Moreover, we have studied the diet variations i) along development, in relation to ii) prey availability and iii) morphology of the feeding-related structures like visual system, mouth and digestive tract. Feeding is an important aspect of the larval fish ecology that affects the population dynamics (through larval survival and subsequence recruitment fluctuations). The factors that affect the larvae in their prey selection and the feeding strategies have been scarcely studied for these species in the Catalan Sea. These factors can be different depending on the species and can change with ontogeny. The main objective of this Ph. D has been to understand the specific trophic strategies of the larvae of these five important species in Mediterranean fisheries. We can point out three types of strategies: 1) The hake’s one, which from the onset specializes feeding in a prey type (Clausocalanus spp.) and only increases the number of copepods to respond to the nutritional requirements of growth. 2) Anchovy and sardine’s type, which show low feeding incidence at the beginning, and they change the size and number of preys step by step along development without showing abrupt changes in the diet. 3) Bullet tuna and hake’s type, opportunist species which deeply adjust their prey type (and size) in their larval period as they enhance their abilities [ [...] . ]Esta Tesis Doctoral ha sido realizada gracias a una beca/contrato predoctoral del Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (España) durante 4 años que se encuadra dentro del Programa de Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI) y ha comprendido un periodo de tiempo desde el 1 de Agosto de 2005 hasta el 30 de julio de 2009 Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of recent {{developments}} in artificial propagation of cod fry {{it has been suggested}} that propagated cod fry may be released in the Barents Sea and the Svalbard region, the feeding areas of North-East Arctic cod. The aim would be to improve the periodical bad state of this stock. The North-East Arctic cod is spawning from February to April, and the first abundance index of a new yearclass is assessed at an age of six months by midwater trawl survey. Estimates of year class abundance (VPA) vary between 115 and 1818 million fish at age 3, a much smaller range than indicated by the 0 -group survey indexes for six months old cod. In August/September the 0 -group cod are distributed in the Barents Sea, around Bear Island and along West-Spitsbergen. Strong yearclasses have a much wider distribution than poor ones. Information from this survey may be used in planning the release of artificially propagated cod fry, which could then take place in September. Because of lack of reliable basis for estimating the natural mortality of cod; especially on the younger age groups, the number of cod fry in September cannot be precisely estimated. However, for areas on able range of natural mortalities, the number of fry needed to raise a poor year class to a strong one at the 0 -group stage would be in the order of 2600 - 5200 million. Artificial propagation of cod fry would have to start in March, but it may be stopped later in years with high natural production of fry in order to reduce the effects of density dependent growth. Artificially propagated fry should have to be released in the most suit able areas. Observations on <b>hydrographical</b> and food <b>conditions</b> are therefore needed for the most suitable time. In order to avoid a high degree of cannibalism, the distribution of l- 3 -group cod would also have to be taken into account. A programme for artificial propagation of North-East Arctic cod fry would be justifiable in years or periods with low potential yearclass strength. However, our state of knowledge about the many factors involved does not at present justify such an extensive programme...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the R and D project 'Rechnergestuetzte Kollisionsvermeidung' (Computer Assisted Collision Avoidance) has been developed a system which supports the officer on watch in the handling of complex traffic situations by the output of suggestions for collision-avoidance tracks. The integration of information and functionalities of ARPA (Automatic Radar Plotting Aid) and ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information System) facilitates the calculation of evasive tracks which fit both the traffic situation and the <b>hydrographical</b> <b>conditions.</b> The main aspects of the project has been the development of methods for the handling of multi-ship encounters, the integration of ECDIS {{and the creation of a}} ergonomically designed man-machine interface.

40|$|Surveys {{designed}} to capture Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus, postlarvae and young immatures {{were carried out}} around Sørøya in North Norway in 1985, 1986 and 1987. <b>Hydrographical</b> <b>conditions</b> and the current features in the area were also investigated. The ichthyoplankton trawls (MOCNESS, Tucker-trawl) filtered more than 200. 000 m 3 of sea water in the March months. Only one single pelagic postlarvae, 11. 9 mm long and in a stase of first feeding, was captured, {{near the center of}} a cyclonic vortex in Sørøysundet. Most probably, the filtering capacity of the equipment used was too low given the low concentrations in which halibut larvae seem to occur. Trawling with a pelagic trawl in May yielded no pelagic postlarvae. The shallow (20 - 60 m) area north of sørøya act as a halibut nursery area where considerable amounts of young, immature fish aged 2 - 4 years are found...|$|E

This survey {{has been carried out}} from the Chilean Navy Oceanographic vessel "YELCHO" in January 1978. An {{stratification}} in the area closed with the Antarctic surface waters has been observed. The temperature ranged between - 1, 60 º C to 1, 30 º C in Port Foster and 0, 46 ºC to 1, 70 ºC in Chile Bay; the salinity ranged between 33. 80 ‰ to 34, 24 ‰ in Port Foster and 33, 61 ‰ to 34 ‰ in Chile Bay; the dissolved oxygen varied between 3, 47 to 7, 02 ml O 2 /l in both area.

30|$|As in many {{instances}} soil erosion is the outcome of continuous firing, it is but natural that the <b>hydrographical</b> <b>conditions</b> of a countryside should, pari passu, be effected for the worse. Indeed, this is all too frequently exemplified in forest regions in South and East Africa—a steady but sure reduction in stream-flow and an increased desiccation following years of severe firing. In this special connection, I am convinced from observations made in the sub-tropics and the tropics, that complete protection from fire of the summits and slopes of uplands must be put into effect through education of the European public and the native, and by legislation supported by adequate measures to ensure carrying out of the regulations. Loss by vegetation from water-catchment-areas not only means that the natural vegetation sponge necessary for the absorption and conservation of water is removed, but also that the cooling surface supplied by the plants, and of such definite use in the condensation of hydrometeoric mists, (vide Phillips 1928 A) is lost.|$|E

40|$|The fluffy layer was sampled {{repeatedly}} during nine expeditions between October 1996 and December 1998 at four stations situated along a S-N-transect {{from the}} Oder Estuary to the Arkona Basin. Geochemical and mineralogical {{analyses of the}} fluff show regional differences (trends) in composition, attributed to provenance and to <b>hydrographical</b> <b>conditions</b> along their transport pathways. Temporal variability is very high at the shallow water station of the estuary, and decreases towards the deeper stations in the north. In the shallow water area, intensive resuspension of the fluff due to wind-driven waves and currents leads to an average residence time of only one to two days. Near-bottom lateral transport of the fluff is the main process that transfers the fine grained material, containing both nutrients and contaminants, from the coastal zone into the deeper basins of the Baltic Sea. Seasonal effects (e. g. biogenic production in relation to trace metal variation) are observed at the Tromper Wiek station, where the residence time of the fluffy material is in the scale of seasons. Thus, the fluffy layer offers suitable material for environmental monitoring programs...|$|E
