500|$|Arsenal {{began the}} season with a 2–0 home victory against {{promoted}} Birmingham City; goals from Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord extended the club's winning run to fourteen matches – a new top-flight record. A late equaliser by Wiltord in their next match at West Ham United earned Arsenal a point, having trailed 2–0 in the first half. Three days later, a 5–2 win against West Bromwich Albion moved Arsenal {{to the top of the}} league table. Although they drew to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, having lost captain Vieira through a sending-off, a win against Manchester City meant Arsenal leapfrogged local rivals Tottenham Hotspur to first position. A 3–0 win at Charlton Athletic on 15 September 2002 pleased Wenger, who indicated after the match the league was theirs to lose: [...] "We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> win the league. We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be stronger. At this stage last season we were not as good as we are now." [...] Striker Kanu scored a stoppage time winner against Bolton Wanderers to win their eleventh successive home game.|$|E

[...] Merritt, who had a British accent, {{said that she had}} [...] "the utmost respect for Canada.

500|$|In the quarter-finals, Arsenal met fellow English club Chelsea. The draw {{disappointed}} vice-chairman Dein: [...] "One of {{the joys}} of playing in Europe is playing teams from overseas – and having played Chelsea three times, {{it is a bit}} anti-climactic." [...] The first leg, played at Stamford Bridge ended in a draw with Guðjohnsen and Pirès scoring for their respective clubs. Arsenal were unable to take advantage of Marcel Desailly's dismissal in the second half, but Wenger felt his team were in a good position to progress: [...] "Our main aim will be to win the game at Highbury and we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do that." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearl Jam toured relentlessly {{in support}} of Ten.

[...] The band's manager, Kelly Curtis, stated, [...] "Once people came and saw them live, this lightbulb would go on. Doing their first tour, you kind of knew it was happening and there was no stopping it." [...] Early on in Pearl Jam's career, the band became known for its intense live performances. Looking back at this time, Vedder said that [...] "playing music and then getting a shot at making a record and at having an audience and stuff, it's just like an untamed force...But it didn't come from jock mentality. It came from just being let out of the gates." ...|$|E

While in Detroit, Michigan, for a concert tour, the band was listening to [...] "Sing" [...] in their dressing room. Once they went on stage for a soundcheck, they thought of writing a song based from it. According to guitarist Jonny Buckland, [...] "We recorded some of it in a church up the road that's now a studio. In a huge room with a piano and organ going at the same time." [...] In an interview with The Sun, Martin said, [...] "The line in this song 'Just because I'm losing doesn't mean I'm lost' is what the whole record came out of because we were feeling {{down at the end of}} the last tour. That line arrived and it was, 'OK, that's how we kinda feel. We <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> improve." [...] The ensuing track evolved in different versions.|$|E

[...] Pearl Jam faced a relentless touring schedule for Ten. Drummer Dave Abbruzzese joined the band for Pearl Jam's live shows supporting the album. Halfway through its own planned North American tour, Pearl Jam cancelled the remaining dates in order to take a slot opening for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on the band's Blood Sugar Sex Magik tour in the fall of 1991 in North America. The spot was arranged by Jack Irons, who had called his former band asking for them to get an opportunity to his friend Vedder. The Smashing Pumpkins and Nirvana were also supporting acts. Nirvana was initially brought in because the tour promoters [...] decided that Pearl Jam should be replaced with a more successful act, but the departure of The Smashing Pumpkins still kept the group in the concert bill. Epic executive Michael Goldstone observed that [...] "the band did such an amazing job opening the Chili Peppers tour that it opened doors at radio." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Lévy's 1988 paper [...] "", {{he defines}} {{a notion of}} optimal sharing, such that no work is duplicated. For example, {{performing}} a beta reduction in normal order on (λx.xx) (II) reduces it to II (II). The argument II is duplicated by the application to the first lambda term. If the reduction was done in an applicative order first, we save work because work is not duplicated: (λx.xx) (II) reduces to (λx.xx) I. On the other hand, using applicative order can result in redundant reductions or even possibly never reduce to normal form. For example, performing a beta reduction in normal order on (λf.f I) (λy.(λx.xx) (y I)) yields (λy.(λx.xx) (y I)) I, (λx.xx) (II) which we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do without duplicating work. Doing the same but in applicative order yields (λf.f I) (λy.y I (y I)), (λy.y I (y I)) I, I I (I I), and now work is duplicated.|$|E
