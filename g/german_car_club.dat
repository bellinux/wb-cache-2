5000|$|... 1959 saw {{the race}} {{go to the}} {{ultra-fast}} AVUS circuit in Berlin. This was the only Formula One race that took place there and was won by Brooks in a Ferrari. The AVUS circuit was now made up of two 2.5-mile straights, a tight left-handed hairpin {{at one end and}} a huge 43° brick banking constructed in 1937 on the other end, which was known as [...] "The Wall of Death". The straights could only go as far as 2.5 miles because if they went any further, the circuit would cross into East Germany. Frenchman and prominent Formula One driver Jean Behra was killed during a support sportscar race driving a Porsche. He lost control and the Porsche went up and flew off the banking there, which had no safety wall or barrier of any kind. Behra was thrown 300 feet from his car and his head struck a flagpole; killing him instantly. Behra had been fired by Ferrari after an altercation in a restaurant with the Scuderia's manager shortly before his death.1960 was a one-off Formula 2 race held on the smaller 4.7-mile (7.7 km) Sudschleife (South Loop) section of the Nürburgring. This race was given the title German Grand Prix because the <b>German</b> national <b>car</b> <b>club</b> (ADAC), the organizers of the race, had made the decision to run the race as a Formula 2 race at the Sudschleife because of complaints by some of the drivers (even by Stirling Moss, a champion of a certain amount of danger in motor racing) of the extreme danger, speed and even blandness of the AVUS track- which, as described above, had a very uncomplicated layout. In an indication of the rather cavalier attitude towards safety in motor racing in those days, the drivers felt the risk of AVUS was not worth it, they then refused to race there and the Formula 1 race was cancelled.|$|R

40|$|In {{the current}} {{transport}} landscape, where chronic {{problems such as}} congestion, insufficient parking spaces and air pollution beset urban areas, car sharing has been suggested {{as an alternative to}} mitigate these issues. With the emergence and growing popularity of the sharing economy, a shifting perception towards car ownership has paved the way towards rapid growth in shared mobility. The <b>car</b> <b>club</b> – or <b>car</b> sharing – as a service, enables people to go without their own car, yet use one when they need to. This flexible transport option has grown rapidly in many metropolises around the world. In London, it is forecast that the total number of round-trips <b>car</b> <b>club</b> memberships will increase from 137, 000 in 2013 to approximately 264, 000 by 2020 (Frost & Sullivan, 2014). As car sharing’s popularity rises, it is critical to better understand <b>car</b> <b>club</b> users with their varied lifestyles and mindsets. Therefore, this research focuses on obtaining an in-depth understanding of <b>car</b> <b>club</b> users and exploring more deeply the role of the <b>car</b> <b>club</b> from the users’ perspective. Three key questions were asked: 1. What are the users’ perspectives towards existing <b>car</b> <b>clubs?</b> 2. What are their key suggestions as to how to improve the <b>car</b> <b>club</b> model? 3. What are the critical aspects of the proposed <b>car</b> <b>club</b> model, from the users’ perspective? The research adopts a multidisciplinary approach, with further contextual research and expert interviews with service designers in order to evaluate the role service design might play in enticing more people to consider the use of such mobility services in the future. The ultimate aim of this research is to provide a set of mobility service guidelines designed to enhance the overall level of user experience for <b>car</b> <b>clubs.</b> Advancing the operating models of <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> should help existing operators fulfil their role as a more adaptable and reliable alternative transport mode in urban areas. The research outcome is expected to contribute to current <b>car</b> <b>club</b> operators’ future plans and provide guidance for vehicle OEMs when developing their own mobility models in the future...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, <b>car</b> <b>club</b> {{and racing}} {{websites}} and forums {{have become an}} increasingly popular way for car enthusiasts to access racing and <b>car</b> <b>club</b> news, chat-rooms and message boards. However, no North American research {{has been found that}} has examined opinions and driving experiences of car and racing enthusiasts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine <b>car</b> <b>club</b> members’ opinions about and experiences with various aspects of driving, road safety and traffic legislation, with a particular focus on street racing. A web-based questionnaire (Survey Monkey) was developed using the expert panel method and was primarily based on validated instruments or questions that were developed from other surveys. The questionnaire included: 1) driver concerns regarding traffic safety issues and legislation; 2) attitudes regarding various driving activities; 3) leisure-time activities, including club activities; 4) driving experiences, including offences and collisions; and 5) socio-demographic questions. The survey was pre- tested and piloted. Electronic information letters were sent out to an identified list of <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> and forums situated in southern Ontario. <b>Car</b> <b>club</b> participants were invited to fill out the questionnaire. This survey found that members of <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> share similar concerns regarding various road safety issues with samples of Canadian drivers, although a smaller percentage of <b>car</b> <b>club</b> members are concerned about speeding-related driving. <b>Car</b> <b>club</b> members had varied opinions regarding Ontario’s Street Racers, Stunt and Aggressive Drivers Legislation. The respondents agreed the most with the new offences regarding not sitting in the driver’s seat, having a person in the trunk, or driving as close as possible to another vehicle, pedestrian or object on or near the highway without a reason. The majority disagreed with police powers of impoundment and on-the-spot licence suspensions. About three quarters of respondents reported no collisions or police stops for traffic offences in the past five years. Of those who had been stopped, the most common offence was reported as speeding. This study is the first in Canada to examine <b>car</b> <b>club</b> members’ opinions about and experiences with various aspects of driving, road safety and traffic legislation. Given the ubiquity of <b>car</b> <b>clubs</b> and fora in Canada, insights on members’ opinions and practices provide important information to road safety researchers...|$|R
