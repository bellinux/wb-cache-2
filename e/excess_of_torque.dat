40|$|We {{consider}} the angular momentum exchange at the corotation resonance between a two-dimensional gaseous disk and a uniformly rotating external potential, {{assuming that the}} disk flow is adiabatic. We first {{consider the}} linear case for an isolated resonance, for which we give an expression <b>of</b> the corotation <b>torque</b> that involves the pressure perturbation, and which reduces to the usual dependence on the vortensity gradient {{in the limit of}} a cold disk. Although this expression requires the solution of the hydrodynamic equations, it provides some insight into the dynamics of the corotation region. In the general case, we find an additional dependence on the entropy gradient at corotation. This dependence is associated to the advection of entropy perturbations. These are not associated to pressure perturbations. They remain confined to the corotation region, where they yield a singular contribution to the corotation torque. In a second part, we check our torque expression by means of customized two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. In a third part, we contemplate the case of a planet embedded in a Keplerian disk, assumed to be adiabatic. We find an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> corotation <b>torque</b> that scales with the entropy gradient, and we check that the contribution of the entropy perturbation to the torque is in agreement with the expression obtained from the linear analysis. We finally discuss some implications <b>of</b> the corotation <b>torque</b> expression for the migration of low mass planets in the regions of protoplanetary disks where the flow is radiatively inefficient on the timescale of the horseshoe U-turns.

40|$|What is {{the central}} {{question}} of this study? Do tendon and/or muscle–tendon unit stiffness influence rate <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> development? What is the main finding and its importance? In our experimental conditions, some measures of relative (to maximal voluntary torque and tissue length) muscle–tendon unit stiffness had small correlations with voluntary/evoked rate <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> development over matching torque increments. However, absolute and relative tendon stiffness were unrelated to voluntary and evoked rate <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> development. Therefore, the muscle aponeurosis but not free tendon influences the relative rate <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> development. Factors other than tissue stiffness more strongly determine the absolute rate <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> development. The influence of musculotendinous tissue stiffness on contractile rate <b>of</b> <b>torque</b> development (RTD) remains opaque. In this study, we examined the relationships between both patellar tendon (PT) and vastus lateralis muscle–tendon unit (MTU) stiffness and the voluntary and evoked knee-extension RTD.
