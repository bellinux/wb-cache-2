Bearing vibration signal separation is essential for fault detection of gearboxes, especially where the vibration is nonstationary, susceptible to background noise, and subjected to an arduous transmission path from the source to the receiver. This paper presents a methodology for improving fault detection via a series of vibration signal processing techniques, including signal separation, synchronous averaging (SA), spectral kurtosis (SK), and envelope analysis. These techniques have been tested on experimentally obtained vibration data acquired from the transmission system of a CS- 29 Category A helicopter gearbox operating under different bearing damage conditions. Results showed successful enhancement of bearing fault detection on the second planetary stage of the <b>gearbo...</b>|$|E
