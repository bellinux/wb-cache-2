The {{aim of the research}} was to elu- cidate the effect of the preparation conditions on the structural and morphological characteristics of silica and the resulting mechanical reinforcement. The structure of the in situ generated silica was analyzed by 29 Si high-reso- lution solid-state NMR spectroscopy, which evidenced a high condensation degree of TEOS that decreased with increasing the sol–gel reaction time. The silica dispersion became less homogeneous as the TEOS content and the reaction time were increased. The incorporation of a cou- pling agent (OTES, octyltriethoxysilane) in the reaction mixture promoted full conversion of TEOS. Lower particle size, better silica dispersion, and higher filler-matrix adhe- sion were noticed if the incorporation of OTES was delayed compared to TEOS. Uniaxial tensile tests evi- denced that the tensile strength typically increased in the first 60 min of reaction and then leveled off. A similar behavior was observed for the high deformation stiffness, whereas at low deformations, the stiffness increased monotonically with the reaction time. In the vulcanizates with silica contents higher than 25 wt %, a drastic stiffness decrement was observed passing from low to high defor- mations. This reduction was ascribed to the disruption of the secondary filler network occurring in these materials when severely stretched...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work is to {{evidence}} {{the role of the}} linked phospholipids of natural rubber (NR) in the rubber-carbon nanotube (CNT) interactions in rubber composites. Three rubbers namely NR, deproteinized NR (DPNR) and a synthetic <b>rubber</b> <b>isoprene</b> (<b>IR)</b> were used as matrix for CNTs. The selective wetting of CNTs in miscible NR/IR and DPNR/IR blends was investigated by means of the modified wetting concept based on Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) analysis of the rubber-filler gel of blends. It revealed that the surface of CNTs is entirely wetted by NR or DPNR molecules, respectively, but not by IR. This result emphasizes that proteins do not influence the affinity between NR and CNTs, while the linked phospholipids interact with CNT surface through cation- linkage. This linkage acts as anchor point supporting NR molecules to wet CNT surface effectively. The modified wetting concept can be used for characterization of selective wetting of different fillers in bl ends consisting of miscible rubber components...|$|R

Different reaction condi- tions were investigated with variations in the initial TEOS content, the reaction time of the sol–gel process, and the presence of a coupling/surfactant agent (octyltriethoxy- silane). Organic–inorganic hybrid materials with a silica content up to 70 phr were obtained with the complete con- version of TEOS to silica for a long enough sol–gel reac- tion time. A very homogeneous dispersion of silica particles was observed in all cases together with a very good adhesion between the filler and matrix. The size of the in situ generated silica was controlled by the appropri- ate addition of octyltriethoxysilane. Swelling and extrac- tion tests and dynamic mechanical analysis indicated that the vulcanization process of <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> was per- turbed by the sol–gel process; this led to a slight decrease in the crosslinking degree.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{reinforcement}} of elastomers {{by the addition}} of fillers {{is one of the most}} important aspects in rubber science and technology. In order to optimise the filler – polymer interface, innovative in situ generation of silica within <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> was carried out by means of a bottom-up approach through a sol – gel process starting from tetraethoxysilane as silica precursor. The main aim was the study of the effect of the silica concentration and of the presence of coupling agent on the morphology and the dynamic mechanical behaviour of the composites. RESULTS: The in situ generated silica particles were homogeneously dispersed in the vulcanised rubber with dimensions from a few nanometres to the submicrometre scale. In the presence of coupling agent a good polymer – filler adhesion was observed. The dynamic mechanical behaviour was nonlinear for silica contents higher than 20 wt%. In this range of compositions silica exerted a marked reinforcement on the low-amplitude storage modulus, which is related to the silica content according to the Huber–Vilgis model. CONCLUSION: <b>Isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> can be effectively reinforced by the in situ generation of silica for silica contents higher than 20 wt%, and the interaction at the silica – rubber interface can be optimised by using suitable coupling agents...|$|R

Solomonson had consulted Trafford about this matter at Vevey, and had heard with infinite astonishment that Trafford had already roughly prepared and was proposing to complete and publish, unpatented and absolutely unprotected, first a smashing demonstration of the unsoundness of Behrens' claim and then a lucid exposition of just what had to be done and what could be done to make an indiarubber absolutely indistinguishable from the natural product. The business man could not believe his ears.|$|R

Wetting of the graphite materials by the I 2 /Br 2 /HBr mixture is needed to start the reaction, and a small amount of Br 2 /HBr/IBr is needed to complete the charge transfer between iodine and carbon. The interplanar spacings for the graphite materials need to be in the 3. 35 to 3. 41 A range. The X-ray diffraction data obtained from the halogenated HOPG indicate that the distance between the two carbon layers containing intercalate is 7. 25 A. Electrical resistivity of the fiber product is from 3 to 6. 5 times the pristine value, The presence of a small amount of <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> in the reaction significantly increased the iodine-to-bromine ratio in the product. In this reaction, rubber is known to generate HBr and to slowly remove bromine from the vapor. The halogenation generally caused a 22 percent to 25 percent weight increase. The halogens were found uniformly distributed in the product interior. However, although the surface contains very little iodine, it has high concentrations of bromine and oxygen. It is believed that the high concentrations of bromine and oxygen in this surface cause the halogenated fiber to be more resistant to structural damage during subsequent fluorination to fabricate graphite fluoride fibers...|$|R
40|$|A {{process for}} {{producing}} tires for vehicles wheels comprises the following steps: (a) obtaining {{at least one}} crosslinkable elastomeric material; (b) making a raw tire by assembling a plurality of structural elements, {{at least one of}} which comprising the at least one crosslinkable elastomeric material; (c) molding and crosslinking the raw tire so as to obtain a finished tire. The step of obtaining the at least one crosslinkable elastomeric material includes: (i) mixing at least one layered clay, at least one further filler and at least one elastomer, so as to at least partially delaminate the at least one layered clay within the at least one elastomer; (ii) adding to the mixt. prepd. in step (i) at least one quaternary alkyl onium cation selected from quaternary alkyl ammonium or quaternary alkyl phosphonium or mixt. thereof. Thus, a crosslinkable elastomeric material with superior properties was prepd. by mixing in a first phase, <b>isoprene</b> <b>rubber</b> (100 phr), carbon black (50 phr), Dellite HPS nanosized layered clay (4. 8 phr) and Arquad HC (3. 5 phr) in a Banbury mixer, followed by admixing Silane NXT (0. 8 phr) and phthalic anhydride (1. 0 phr), after which the masterbatch was discharged at approx. 145. In Phase 2, the masterbatch, stearic acid (2. 0 phr), zinc oxide (4. 0 phr) and 6 PPD (2. 0 phr) were introduced into the mixer at approx. 700, mixed for about 3. 5 min and finally discharged at approx. 125. Productive mixing was performed on a two roll mill by adding sulfur, DCBS and PVI to the masterbatch, at 50 - 70 for about 5 min...|$|R
