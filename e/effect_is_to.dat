5|$|Closed circuit rebreathers {{are usually}} {{controlled}} {{to provide a}} fairly constant partial pressure of oxygen during the dive (set point), and may be reset to a richer mix for decompression. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> keep the partial pressure of inert gases as low as safely practicable throughout the dive. This minimizes the absorption of inert gas in the first place, and accelerates {{the elimination of the}} inert gases during ascent.|$|E
5|$|Magma {{sitting in}} an {{underground}} chamber for many years will start to see higher melting point constituents such as olivine crystallizing out. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the concentration of dissolved gases (mostly sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide) in the remaining liquid magma, making the subsequent eruption more violent. As gas-rich magma approaches the surface during an eruption, the huge drop in internal pressure caused by the reduction in weight of the overlying rock (which drops to zero at the surface) causes the gases {{to come out of}} solution, the volume of gas increasing explosively from nothing to perhaps many times that of the accompanying magma. Additionally, the removal of the higher melting point material will raise the concentration of felsic components such as silicates potentially making the magma more viscous, adding to the explosive nature of the eruption.|$|E

5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

5000|$|The Canuck {{letter was}} a forged {{letter to the}} editor of the Manchester Union Leader, {{published}} February 24, 1972, two weeks before the New Hampshire primary of the 1972 United States presidential election. It implied that Senator Edmund Muskie, a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, held prejudice against Americans of French-Canadian descent. The letter's immediate <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> compel the candidate to give a speech in front of the newspaper's offices, subsequently known as [...] "the crying speech". The letter's indirect <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> contribute to the implosion of Muskie's candidacy.|$|R

25|$|One {{justification}} of Occam's razor {{is a direct}} result of basic probability theory. By definition, all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong.|$|E
25|$|When using a count-controlled loop {{to search}} through a table, {{it might be}} {{desirable}} to stop searching {{as soon as the}} required item is found.

40|$|To {{study the}} {{relationship}} between seed yield and its components 5 varieties and 18 different genotypes of Cicer arietinum were evaluated. This study was carried out under dryland farming during 2007 in research farm of Razi university. Path analysis showed {{that in the first}} level of yield, the highest direct <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> biological yield and the highest indirect <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> seed number per plant due to biological yield. In second level of yield due to the seed number per plant double seed pod number had the highest direct effect and the highest indirect <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> hundreds seed weight due to double the seed pod number. In second level of yield due to biological yield, the highest direct <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> high plant and the highest indirect <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> high plant due to second branch number. In the third level of yield due to a hundred seed weight, the highest direct <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> pod diameter and the highest indirect <b>effect</b> <b>was</b> related <b>to</b> pod length due to pod diameter. Factor analysis showed that 5 factors explained 81. 65 percent of the variance. Cluster analysis based on ward method were arranged genotypes in 3 clusters...|$|R

25|$|The Faraday {{effect is}} caused by left and right circularly {{polarized}} waves propagating at slightly different speeds, a property known as circular birefringence. Since a linear polarization can be decomposed into the superposition of two equal-amplitude circularly polarized components of opposite handedness and different phase, {{the effect of a}} relative phase shift, induced by the Faraday <b>effect,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> rotate the orientation of a wave's linear polarization.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} subsidizes the employer-based market by an estimated $250 {{billion per year}} (about $1,612 per person covered in the employer market), by excluding health insurance premiums from employee income. This subsidy encourages people to buy more extensive coverage (which places upward pressure on average premiums), while also encouraging more young, healthy people to enroll (which places downward pressure on premium prices). CBO estimates the net <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase premiums 10-15% over an un-subsidized level.|$|E
25|$|There are two chainrings whose {{relative}} difference (say 10%) {{is about}} half the relative step on the cogset (say 20%). This {{was used in the}} mid-20th century when front derailleurs could only handle a small step between chainrings and when rear cogsets only had a small number of sprockets, e.g. chainrings 44-48 and cogset 14-17-20-24-28. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide two interlaced gear ranges without any duplication. However to step sequentially through the gear ratios requires a simultaneous front and rear shift on every other gear change. This style is not available off the shelf.|$|E

25|$|Enriched environments {{affect the}} {{expression}} of genes in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus that determine neuronal structure. At the molecular level, this occurs through increased concentrations of the neurotrophins NGF, NT-3, and changes in BDNF. This alters the activation of cholinergic neurons, 5-HT, and beta-adrenolin. Another <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase proteins such as synaptophysin and PSD-95 in synapses. Changes in Wnt signaling have also been found to mimic in adult mice the effects of environmental enrichment upon synapses in the hippocampus. Increase in neurons numbers could be linked to changes in VEGF.|$|E
25|$|The {{occupancy}} of {{the energy}} bands in a semiconductor is set by {{the position of the}} Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate reverse bias of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the band edge, lowering the occupancy of the channel. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the gate voltage necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the figure. This change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the 'body effect'.|$|E
25|$|Stained {{glass windows}} {{are created by}} cutting pieces of {{coloured}} glass to match a drawn template and setting them into place in a mesh of lead cames and supporting the whole with rigid metal bars. Details such as facial features can be painted {{on the surface of}} the glass, and stains of bright yellow applied to enliven white areas. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add an appearance of brilliance and richness to a church interior, while the media lends itself to narratives. If the lead is properly maintained, stained glass is extremely durable and many windows have been in place for centuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{characteristic}} of fair skin, red hair, and freckling {{is associated with}} high amount of pheomelanin, little amounts of eumelanin. This phenotype {{is caused by a}} loss-of-function mutation in the melanocortin 1 receptor (MC1R) gene. However, variations in the MC1R gene sequence only have considerable influence on pigmentation in populations where red hair and extremely fair skin is prevalent. The gene variation’s primary <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> promote eumelanin synthesis at the expense of pheomelanin synthesis, although this contributes to very little variation in skin reflectance between different ethnic groups. Melanocytes from light skin cells cocultured with keratinocytes give rise to a distribution pattern {{characteristic of}} light skin.|$|E
25|$|The Sidewinder is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} the drawbacks of the stacked design. It does this by reorienting the coils so that while electrically cancelling they are on opposite poles of a magnet. Thus, unlike stacked coils, output is hotter since the net <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> add rather than subtract the signal between the coils; thus, the impedance can be lower, avoiding overwinding to obtain sufficient output. There is less signal cancellation. Sonically these sit somewhere between a true P-90 and a stacked pickup. They don't chime but they aren't nasal or lifeless either. They are ideal candidates for overdriven sounds where loss of sparkle is less important than avoiding hum amplification. These type of pickups have the same appearance of P-90s.|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{atmospheric}} diffraction or bending of light occurs when light moves through fine layers of particulate dust trapped {{primarily in the}} middle layers of the troposphere. This effect differs from water based atmospheric diffraction because the dust material is opaque whereas water allows light to pass through it. This {{has the effect of}} tinting the light the color of the dust particles. This tinting can vary from red to yellow depending on geographical location. the other primary difference is that dust based diffraction acts as a magnifier instead of creating a distinct halo. This occurs because the opaque matter does not share the lensing properties of water. The <b>effect</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make an object visibly larger while being more indistinct as the dust distorts the image. This effect varies largely based on the amount and type of dust in the atmosphere.|$|E
