40|$|This paper {{acknowledges}} the recent thrust to integrate systems {{on the flight}} deck and details a usability evaluation of a prototype concept that provides integrated alerting functionality. The ANCOA (Alerting and Notification of Conditions Outside the Aircraft) concept was conceived as means for reducing error conflicts and establishing a clear prioritization among currently independent and disparate alerting systems for hazards external to the aircraft (e. g., TCAS, EGPWS). ANCOA reduces alert proliferation by creating a standardization by which all incoming information is categorized and prioritized under a common framework. By creating a consistent alerting and display philosophy to present information to the crew, we can reduce the demands on pilot attention and information processing. In this {{paper we discuss a}} couple of recent <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>awareness</b> <b>systems</b> developed by Honeywell International that make the innovative initial step to incorporate previously separate systems into a single system. We present ANCOA as a concept that can enhance systems of their type and advance their utility. We evaluated the concept’s efficacy and present the results of a usability study involving nine commercial pilots that reviewed the concept. Beginning in the mid- 1970 s when the Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) was first introduced, flight safet...|$|R

40|$|My paper {{proposes a}} new method to {{estimate}} duration models. In particular, {{it shows that}} the <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> yields moment functions that solve the following, recognized estimation problems: 1. Van den Berg notes in the forthcoming Handbook of Econometrics that we need panel data for robust inference, but lack estimation methods for censored data. The <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> provides a consistent estimator that converges at rate root N and thereby solves this estimation problem. 2. Honore (1993) argues that regressors can be endogenous {{in the sense that they}} may depend on the length of previous spells. The <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> yields the first duration estimator that is consistent for endogenous regressors; it thereby allows distinguishing between state dependence and heterogeneity. 3. Chamberlain (1985) notes that all the fixed effect estimators require multiple spells for all observations; the <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> method only needs multiple spells for some observations. This generalization dramatically increases the number of datasets that can be used for duration analysis. Moreover, the concept of the <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> can be used to estimate the baseline hazard nonparametrically while allowing for individual specific effects. The paper also derives a new semiparametric matching estimator. By demonstrating that the <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> solves recognized estimation problems I show that it is a very powerful tool for estimation. ...|$|R

40|$|Art {{materials}} {{found to}} be hazardous to one 2 ̆ 7 s health have gained attention in recent years. Because students in schools are exposed {{to a variety of}} art materials and processes, this study examined secondary level school settings in terms of teacher awareness of art materials {{found to be}} hazardous, how art materials and art facilities were used, and demographics of respondents. The sample consisted of secondary art teachers in the state of Nebraska. A survey instrument was developed; 159 surveys were mailed, with 120 usable surveys returned. ^ Art <b>hazards</b> <b>awareness</b> was determined by subject 2 ̆ 7 s responses to an awareness test on hazardous art materials. Respondents also identified what materials were used in their individual art classroom setting and how art materials and art facilities were used. ^ Analyses of variance were calculated to test for relationships between the teachers 2 ̆ 7 level of art <b>hazards</b> <b>awareness</b> and art materials and facilities use. Analyses of variance and t tests were calculated for awareness and use between males and females, credit hours in art, and years of art teaching experience. Results indicated no significant relationships existed between art <b>hazards</b> <b>awareness</b> and use between males and females. Teachers with 6 - 10 years teaching experience had a higher degree of precaution for firesafety and personal hygiene than those with either more or less experience. Teachers with 5 or less years of teaching experience practiced a higher degree of precaution than teachers who had taught over 15 years. ...|$|R

40|$|I {{surveyed}} {{the residents of}} two Yuba County neighborhoods within the 1997 flood zone. One, Arboga, was occupied during the flood; the other, Plumas Lake, was constructed after the flood. All but one Arboga respondent {{had lived in the}} area during the 1997 flood, while only one Plumas Lake respondent had. I compared attitudes, opinions, and behaviors related to <b>hazard</b> <b>awareness,</b> disaster preparedness, and causal attribution of flood hazards, and found that residents of the neighborhood inhabited during the 1997 flood demonstrated higher levels of <b>hazard</b> <b>awareness</b> (including flood history) and disaster preparedness, though general disaster preparedness steps already undertaken by Plumas Lake households would help them in a flood. Arboga residents focused on the role of levees in explaining why the 1997 flood took place, and were less optimistic about the prospect of preventing future floods. Arboga residents also showed more complete knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of agencies involved with flood hazards. Prior flood experience, as well as volunteer involvement with flood-related issues was a major factor in knowledge and preparedness...|$|R
30|$|The {{numerator}} of Eq. 1 is the <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> {{function for}} multiple {{sources of information}} presented simultaneously and the denominator is the summation of the <b>integrated</b> <b>hazard</b> functions of performance for each single source presented in isolation. If C(t)= 1, capacity is classified as unlimited, which occurs if all the UCIP assumptions are met. Deviation from one occurs if one or more assumptions of the UCIP model are violated. C(t) less than 1, referred to as limited capacity, can occur if processing each source is slower with more sources present (e.g., due to limited attentional capacity), if there is inhibition among the processes, or if processing is serial rather than parallel. C(t) greater than 1 (super-capacity) implies better performance than a UCIP model and can be due to facilitation between processes including coactive processing.|$|R

40|$|<b>Awareness</b> <b>systems</b> are a novel {{class of}} {{communication}} systems that {{enable people to}} be conscious {{of each other in}} a peripheral way. To better understand how people experience these systems over time, and how they blend in the user context, longitudinal field studies are needed. Although tangible <b>awareness</b> <b>systems</b> are considered to be more intimate and aesthetically pleasing than screen based <b>awareness</b> <b>systems,</b> they are not often evaluated in a longitudinal setting. This may be due to several factors that complicate the field evaluation of such systems, including the robustness and reliability of the prototype.

However, <b>awareness</b> <b>systems</b> allow both team members and supervisors the ability to monitor virtual team members.
