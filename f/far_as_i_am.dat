James McLaughlin, Indian agent at Standing Rock Agency, dismissed these reports, saying that [...] "The reported baptism of Sitting-Bull is erroneous. There is no immediate prospect of such ceremony so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware." ...|$|E
500|$|The expedition's {{other main}} accomplishments {{included}} the first ascent of Mount Erebus, {{and the discovery}} of the approximate location of the South Magnetic Pole, reached on 16 January 1909 by Edgeworth David, Douglas Mawson, and Alistair Mackay. Shackleton returned to the United Kingdom as a hero, and soon afterwards published his expedition account, Heart of the Antarctic. Emily Shackleton later recorded: [...] "The only comment he made to me about not reaching the Pole was 'a live donkey is better than a dead lion, isn't it?' and I said 'Yes darling, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned'".|$|E
500|$|Strong {{support in}} Montreal, and the {{response}} in Ottawa after the games were moved to the national capital left Eagleson increasingly confident in the tournament's future. The 1981 Canada Cup turned a profit of about C$1 million to be split between Hockey Canada and the National Hockey League Players Association pension fund, one third that of the 1976 tournament. Shortly after the tournament ended, Eagleson confirmed he intended to hold a third Canada Cup. [...] He noted that Canada's loss in the final {{played a role in}} his decision: [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned personally, it's probably preferable that we lost. [...] I think if we had won, I'd have said, 'To hell with it'." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{principal}} {{private secretary}} to the Prince of Wales, Sir Michael Peat, said in 2007 that the Prince [...] "...is always {{very careful to}} ensure he is not politically contentious or party political, and as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware even his most ardent critic has never suggested he is." ...|$|E
2500|$|More {{than three}} years after the crash, the British coroner cited the [...] "flagrant {{disregard}} for passenger safety" [...] by the airline and said [...] "the primary failure so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned relates to the corporate culture which prevailed both One-Two-GO Airlines and Orient Thai Airlines prior to and following the air crash." ...|$|E

2500|$|In September 2012, both Lynott's {{mother and}} widow objected to Mitt Romney's use of [...] "The Boys Are Back in Town" [...] during his {{election}} campaign. In {{an interview with}} Irish rock magazine Hot Press, Philomena Lynott said, [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage and to civil unions for gays makes him anti-gay – which {{is not something that}} Philip would have supported." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr King, {{a former}} head of {{molecular}} biology at the IAH, was quoted in The Times as saying [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned the authorities have failed to find any chink in the armoury of the establishment’s bio-security. What you are left with is human movement, {{which is not a}} matter for the institute, it’s a police matter. It’s very, very unlikely that it could be spread by accident. People do not spread the disease easily." ...|$|E
2500|$|Since the war , Jews have {{occupied}} {{the villages of}} Maramureş and Bukovina, and gained the absolute majority in the towns and cities in Bessarabia. [...] It would be absurd to expect Jews to resign themselves {{in order to become}} a minority with certain rights and very many duties—after they have tasted the honey of power and conquered as many command positions as they have. Jews are currently fighting with all forces to maintain their positions, expecting a future offensive—and, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, I understand their fight and admire their vitality, tenacity, genius.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{composed}} {{during a period}} of personal difficulty for Eliot—his marriage was failing, and both he and Vivienne were suffering from nervous disorders. The poem is often read as a representation of the disillusionment of the post-war generation. Before the poem's publication as a book in December 1922, Eliot distanced himself from its vision of despair. On 15 November 1922, he wrote to Richard Aldington, saying, [...] "As for The Waste Land, that is {{a thing of the past}} so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned and I am now feeling toward a new form and style." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gordon {{made all}} of his {{personal}} dispatches to London public (there was no Official Secrets Act at the time) in attempts to win public opinion over to his policy, writing on one dispatch: [...] "Not secret as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned". [...] At one point, Gordon suggested in a telegram to Gladstone that the notoriously corrupt Ottoman Sultan Abdul-Hamid II could be bribed into sending 3,000 Ottoman troops for the relief of Khartoum and if the British government was unwilling and/or unable to pay that amount, {{he was certain that}} either Pope Leo XIII or a group of American millionaires would be.|$|E
2500|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Dakota, the U.S. {{government}} and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew Jackson Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, [...] "So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung." [...] But the context of Myrick's comment at the time, early August 1862, is historically unclear. Another version is that Myrick was referring to the Indian women who were already combing the floor of the fort's stables for any unprocessed oats to then feed to their starving children along with a little grass.|$|E

2500|$|Stood on his head: This {{is a term}} to {{describe}} an outstanding performance by an ice hockey goaltender {{in a short period}} of time. Often when a goalie lets out a rebound, the opposition returns the shot quickly, and the goalie has to make a quick save. A goalie often falls on his side and [...] "stacks the pads" [...] and appears to nearly stand on their head. The term may have been derived after NHL President Frank Calder, alluding to the 1918 rules change that permitted goalies to leave their feet to make a save, remarked, [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, they can stand on their head(s)." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 23, 2009, The Advocate interviewed Braun {{about her}} {{portrayal}} of Reese and the Reese and Bianca storyline. [...] "From {{my point of}} view, Reese is {{not in love with}} Zach and she never has been," [...] said Braun. [...] "As far as the kiss, any doubt she may have had about her relationship with Bianca dissolved immediately after it happened. It was a moment of needing a connection. It was not about being in love with Zach. She was drunk, upset, and it was unfortunate. It was a terrible mistake. As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, Reese has always been in love with Bianca." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, the Law Commission {{proposed}} that the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 be abolished in its draft Criminal Damage Bill {{as part of an}} update of the law on criminal damage. The reasoning was that the law was no longer required for its original purposes, as warships were no longer made of flammable materials. The resulting Criminal Damage Act received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II in 1971 and the offence of arson in royal dockyards was abolished. In a speech in the House of Lords in 1998, Lord Goodhart stated that the dockyard arson offence disappeared from the list of capital crimes in 1971 [...] "without, so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware, either comment or concern." ...|$|E

2500|$|Morrison {{has stated}} that he was {{uncertain}} whether his Superman and the version featured in All Star Batman & Robin are the same due to the dramatic time {{differences between the two}} books: [...] "I don’t know if it would have worked. For me, I guess I do see it all taking place in the same world even though they seem like very different characters. Frank Miller is doing Batman {{at the beginning of his}} career and I am doing Superman at the very end of his life, in the years beyond All Star Batman. But it could be the same character as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned. That’s where they may have ended up." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Du Bois speech, McKenzie {{immediately}} went into damage control {{and sought to}} mobilize trustees, faculty, alumni and community support. McKenzie's wife Nettie asserted only two outcomes. Either her husband would be maintained as President with {{the full support of}} the trustees, or he [...] "should be given leave of absence for a year, the President to resign {{at the end of the}} period of leave." [...] McKenzie recorded the experience was [...] "about as damnable an event as could come into one's life, but it is not too late to save the institution if there be a desire to save it." [...] "It is probably a matter of little concern whether I resign or not so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> affected." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Denis O'Brien {{is often}} newsworthy, the Sunday Independent has paid {{particular}} attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media. Denis O'Brien has perceived bias in the Independent Group's coverage and in a 2003 letter to Gavin O'Reilly wrote [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> concerned, Independent News and Media {{have spent the last}} seven years trying to destroy my reputation. Some of the coverage of my affairs, both business and personal, in the Sunday Tribune, Sunday Independent, Irish Independent and Evening Herald have caused hurt and enormous damage to my reputation, not to mention the emotional distress suffered by my wife, Catherine and my family. I very much doubt whether you or your family could have survived a similar onslaught." ...|$|E
