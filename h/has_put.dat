5|$|After 2 {{years of}} college, McDougal {{moved to a}} Detroit suburb where she taught pre-kindergarten, before being persuaded {{to try out for}} a {{swimsuit}} competition. One of her professional goals has always been to open a learning center for children, but she <b>has</b> <b>put</b> those plans on hold to focus on pursuing roles in acting and modelling.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} current problems in Indonesian aviation are poor development {{and maintenance of}} air transportation infrastructure, especially in remote areas. Other significant problems include overcapacity; the massive surge of air travelers in recent years, prompted by the growth of low-cost carrier passengers, <b>has</b> <b>put</b> intense stress on the aging airport infrastructure in Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Various limb {{positions}} {{have been}} proposed for Styracosaurus and ceratopsids in general, including forelegs which were held underneath the body, or, alternatively, held in a sprawling position. The most recent work <b>has</b> <b>put</b> forward an intermediate crouched position as most likely.|$|E

5|$|As to Captain Benbow, I {{know of no}} {{difference}} between him and me, nor have we had any. He has no small obligation to me, but being called {{in some of the}} foolish printed papers ‘the famous Captain Benbow’, I suppose <b>has</b> <b>put</b> him a little out of himself, and has made him play the fool, as I guess, in some of his letters. I will not farther now particularize this business, but time will show I have not been in the wrong, unless being too kind to an ungrateful man.|$|E
5|$|Before the Dawn is beautifully done, a grand {{genealogy}} {{of modern}} humanity, rooted in fact but spiced with an appropriate measure of speculation and hypothesis. Even for a reader {{to whom the}} material is already familiar – one who, for example, has been following Nicholas Wade’s reports in the New York Times – it is well worth the trouble of reading this book for its narrative value, for the elegant way Wade <b>has</b> <b>put</b> it all together as a single compelling story. This is a brilliant book, by {{one of our best}} science journalists.|$|E
5|$|Count on Mr. Welles: he doesn't {{do things}} by halves.... Upon the screen he {{discovered}} an area {{large enough for}} his expansive whims to have free play. And the consequence {{is that he has}} made a picture of tremendous and overpowering scope, not in physical extent so much as in its rapid and graphic rotation of thoughts. Mr. Welles <b>has</b> <b>put</b> upon the screen a motion picture that really moves.|$|E

50|$|In July, Wright {{received}} a letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury indicating that CMS <b>had</b> <b>put</b> forward his name as a suitable candidate as the next Bishop of Sierra Leone. The former Bishop, John Walmsley had also been a vicar at Christ Church, Derby. Rev G.T Manley <b>had</b> <b>put</b> forward Wright's name for consideration.|$|R

5|$|Culturally, Black Sabbath have exerted a huge {{influence}} in both television and literature and have {{in many cases}} become synonymous with heavy metal. In the film Almost Famous, Lester Bangs gives the protagonist an assignment to cover the band (plot point one) with the immortal line: 'Give me 500 words on Black Sabbath'. Contemporary music and arts publication Trebuchet Magazine <b>has</b> <b>put</b> this to practice by asking all new writers to write a short piece (500 words) on Black Sabbath {{as a means of}} proving their creativity and voice on a well documented subject.|$|E
5|$|Every {{taxpayer}} {{will realize}} that any destruction of property {{will have to be}} paid for by the city, and would by so much increase the burden of taxation. In one day Pittsburgh <b>has</b> <b>put</b> upon herself a load that her taxpayers will struggle under for years. I again earnestly urge upon men of all classes in our city the necessity of sober, careful thought and the criminal folly of any precipitate action.|$|E
5|$|Ian Drake, an {{assistant}} professor of Political Science and another critic of the compact, has argued that the constitution both requires and prohibits Congressional approval of the compact. In Drake's view, only a constitutional amendment could make the compact valid. Authors Michael Brody, Jennifer Hendricks, and Bradley Turflinger have examined the compact and concluded that the NPVIC, if successfully enacted, would pass constitutional muster. Brody <b>has</b> <b>put</b> forth a unique theory that the legality of the NPVIC could potentially hinge on the notion that faithless electors are not necessarily obligated to vote for the candidate to whom they are pledged.|$|E

5|$|Principal Skinner <b>has</b> <b>put</b> Bart in detention. While dusting a desk, {{he finds}} an Aramaic inscription. Lisa uses an app to {{translate}} it which transports the pair to Hell, {{which is a}} school. Bart excels {{in all of his}} diabolical subjects (including torture, destruction, and making sure that Major League Baseball rules ensure the unending dominance of the New York Yankees) and asks his parents if he can study there permanently. For his final test, he must torture Homer; despite Bart's hesitation, Homer lets him. A disfigured Homer proudly watches Bart graduate from Hell school as valedictorian.|$|E
5|$|Since 1999 the RAAF <b>has</b> <b>put</b> its Hornets {{through a}} series of {{upgrades}} to improve their effectiveness. However, the aircraft are becoming increasingly difficult to operate and are at risk of being outclassed by the fighters and air-defence systems operated by other countries. As a result, the RAAF will begin to retire its F/A-18s in the late 2010s, and the last aircraft will leave service in the early 2020s. Under current Australian Government planning they will be replaced by 72 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Ikata <b>has</b> <b>put</b> {{much effort}} into {{expanding}} the horizons {{of its residents}} through English language education via the JET Programme, and an annual international student exchange with Red Wing. Beginning in 1995, Ikata middle school students have traveled almost yearly to Red Wing for home stays of one to two weeks, and students from Red Wing likewise come to Ikata to learn about life in rural Japan.|$|E

5|$|Some {{truck drivers}} {{have used the}} pass despite the prohibition. They are {{generally}} either unaware of the restriction and following routes plotted by their GPS devices, or aware of it and willing to risk the fine {{for the sake of}} the time and distance saved. The resulting accidents have forced the closure of the pass. CDOT <b>has</b> <b>put</b> in larger signs advising drivers of the ban and worked with GPS device manufacturers so their software notes the restriction. Aspen officials have suggested the fines be increased as well.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{economic}} activities of Gaza are small-scale industries and agriculture. However, the blockade and recurring conflicts <b>has</b> <b>put</b> the economy under severe pressure.

The city is currently administered by a 14-member municipal council.|$|E

5|$|When bees become {{intoxicated}} from ethanol consumption or poisoned {{with other}} chemicals, their balance is affected, {{and they are}} wobbly when they walk. Charles Abramson's group at Oklahoma State University <b>has</b> <b>put</b> inebriated bees on running wheels, where they exhibit locomotion difficulties. They also put honey bees in shuttle-boxes that used a stimulus to encourage the bees to move, and found that they were less mobile as they became more intoxicated.|$|E
5|$|Within the London area, traffic volumes are {{expected}} to increase considerably, leading to poor highway conditions. The province <b>has</b> <b>put</b> in place an extensive plan to widen and reconstruct the London corridor between 2006 and 2021. This included building a new interchange with Wonderland Road which opened in November 2015 to help improve access to Highway401 westbound from the city's southwest end and involved replacing the Westminster Drive overpass to allow the highway to be widened. The Westminster Drive overpass was demolished on July 5, 2014.|$|E
5|$|By morning, the UFO {{crash site}} has been sealed {{off by the}} government, who <b>has</b> <b>put</b> out a cover-story that claims a Taco Bell is being built.

Cartman and Kyle task Douchebag with {{recruiting}} the Goth kids for their respective sides, each claiming that the other has the Stick. Randy agrees to help Douchebag recruit the Goths after Douchebag infiltrates the crash site and discovers that government agents are plotting {{to blow up the}} town in order to destroy an alien goo released from the ship. The goo turns living creatures into Adolf Hitler-esque Nazi Zombies; an infected person escapes government containment, unleashing the virus on South Park.|$|E
