In IEEE 802. 11 standard, a PS-STA periodically wakes up and retrieves data buffered at the Access Point through contending with both other PS-STAs and AM-STAs for its PS-Poll’s transmission. Although AM-STAs usually have no concern with energy, their contention degrades the energy efficiency of PS-STAs, which usually have life concern, by 1) increasing the time duration for data retrieving and 2) {{increasing the number of}} PS-STAs which contend throughout the whole beacon interval but get no access opportunity.

It is argued that signal control alone is insufficient to solve growing problems of urban congestion, and that recent technological advances in Road Transport Informatics are making integrated systems more attractive. One potential area of integration is automatic debiting and signal control. Through automatic debiting for road use and parking {{it is possible to}} confront the motorist with the full marginal cost of his activity, inclusive of the environmental impact, leading to more socially efficient decision-making behaviour. Signal control could then be oriented to cost minimisation. A second area of integration is in-vehicle information and signal control. Efficient decision-making requires well-informed drivers. The systems have shared information requirements and interact with each other strongly. A third area of integration is public transport management and signal control. In <b>general,</b> <b>priority</b> is required for public transport and the emergency services on designated lanes and at junctions, without disadvantaging other road users unnecessarily.

Behavioral primitives are entities for the control of various movement criteria, e. g. primitives describing {{the behavior of the}} center of gravity, the behaviors of the hands, legs, and head, the body attitude and posture, the constrained body parts such as joint-limits and contacts, etc. By aggregating multiple primitives, we synthesize whole-body behaviors.

Constraints should always be guaranteed, while operational tasks should be accomplished without violating the acting constraints, and the posture should control the residual movement redundancy.

When approached from this angle, the work of Met. Theta. 8 can be seen to lend direct support to the more specific and explicitly causal priority claim we encounter in Met.

40|$|Issue {{management}} in market-driven software projects is constantly under time pressure. A limited set of developers must share their time between developing features {{for the next}} release and resolving reported issues. Project managers need to find the appropriate balance between a high quality product and fast time to market. We study a telecom company in Sweden developing embedded systems for a consumer market. The project managers report that developers resolve approximately 10 % of the issues reported during a project. Consequently, {{it is critical to}} properly prioritize the issues to receive the best possible return on investment, and above all to remove all bugs that might impact the market's reception of the product. We use machine learning to investigate what features of an issue report are the best predictors of changes to production code during its corresponding resolution. After removing all features jeopardizing the confidentiality of individual engineers, the issue reports are characterized by 19 features (apart from text). We extract 80, 000 issue reports, an equal mix of positive and negative examples, and train a Bayesian Network classifier [2], obtaining 73 % classification accuracy.

40|$|The EU Commission has {{proposed}} a way forward towards a Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection based on the distinction of seven soil functions and eight threats. A Technical Working Group on Research defined some 200 <b>general</b> <b>priority</b> research areas {{in the context of}} the dynamic DPSIR approach considering drivers, pressures, states, impacts and responses. Though quite valuable as a source document, this may be too generic and academic to be a starting point for new, effective soil research in different regions of the EU. A six-step storyline procedure is therefore proposed aimed at deriving effective operational procedures for a water management unit in a given region, using available soil expertise and defining new research only where needed. The procedure, that was illustrated for a Dutch case study, consists of defining: (i) water management units (wmu's) in a landscape context; (ii) land-use, area hydrology and soil functions (iii) soil threats and relevant soil qualities; (iv) drivers of land-use change and their future impact; (v) improvement of relevant soil qualities; (vi) possibilities to institutionalize soil quality improvement as part of the EU soil protection strategy. A focus on regional wmu's is likely to result in a strong commitment of local stakeholders and governmental officials, allowing a more specific DPSIR approach. But this will only work if local officials also receive legal powers to develop and enforce codified `good practices¿, to be developed in the context of communities of practice. Innovative research topics can be derived from a combined analysis of experiences within different communities of practice in different wmu's and should not be left to researchers to define...|$|E
40|$|Task {{scheduling}} {{in parallel}} processing systems {{is one of}} the most challenging industrial problems. This problem typically arises in the manufacturing and service industries. The task scheduling problem is to determine a set of task assignments to a set of parallel processors for execution so as to optimize a specified performance measure. The difficulty of the problem is that the scheduling needs to satisfy a set of requirements as well as a range of environmental constraints. The problem is known to be NP-complete. In this study, we consider a non-preemtive task scheduling problem on iden- tical and unrelated parallel processor systems. We are interested in the objective function that minimizes the maximum of the completion time of the entire set of tasks (i. e makespan) so as to ensure a good load balance on the parallel proces- sors. We consider three different task characteristics to the classical task scheduling problem that has a set of n independent tasks to be assigned to m parallel processors. The first task characteristic that we consider is an on-line scheduling with release date specifications on an identical parallel processing system with a centralized queue and no splitting structure. We focus on developing simple and efficient heuristics for this problem. Three heuristic algorithms are proposed to solve this non-deterministic problem with scheduling over time where the availability of each task is restricted by release date. Our approach uses a multi-step method in the task selection phase and a greedy search algorithm in the processor selection phase. The multi-step method is used to reduce the non-determinism in on-line scheduling by partitioning the scheduling process into several procedures. We introduce two procedures in the priority rule loop which we refer to as Cluster Insertion and Local Cluster Interchange. Computational testing on randomly generated data is conducted using Microsoft Visual C++ 6. 0 to examine the effectiveness of the proposed multi-step method against the optimal solution. Different size of problems are tested in the experiment involving 3 processors by 200 tasks up to 5 processors by 1000 tasks with five clusters ranging from 10 to 50. The computational results show that all the three heuristics performed very well with the value of the average gaps are improved as the number of the tasks in the system is increases. The average gap for all the three heuristics are less than 1. 04 % for the largest tested cases (i. e for 1000 tasks run on 5 processors). In the second problem, we address priority consideration as an added feature to the basic task characteristics of unrelated parallel processors scheduling. The priority consideration is defined by a list of ordered independent tasks with priority. A task requires to start processing after another task is finished on the same processor based on priority but may require to start earlier if processed on other machine. Our aim is to develop Mixed Integer Linear Programming models to obtain optimal solutions for three type of priority lists which are ascending order, descending order and <b>general</b> <b>priority</b> list. We validate the model using a case study taken from the literature. Then, computational testing is implemented on the <b>general</b> <b>priority</b> list using AIMMS 3. 10 package and CPLEX 12. 1 as the solver. Computational results show that the proposed MILP model is effective and produces optimal results for all tested cases. The model is very efficient as 95 % of all the instances, which are problem up to 80 tasks assigned on 5 processors, have been solved within 5 minutes of CPU time. In the final problem, we address a further problem for the task scheduling with a disruption problem that occurs on the parallel processor system. The disruption is causes by the unavailability of the processor during a certain time and it is called resource disruption. Our recovery solution for the disruption problem is a rescheduling approach. A MILP model is developed for the rescheduling model for the case of non-resumable tasks. Recovery model for the disrupted initial schedule with dummy insertion is proposed for predictive disruption management and match up schedule for post-disruption management. To evaluate the model, computational testing is performed with different sets of data. Different levels of disruptions are considered with different weights in the objective function to observe the stability of the model. The optimum initial schedule and the rescheduling model is performed using CPLEX 12. 1 solver in AIMMS 3. 10 package. In our computational results we measure the stability rate which is to observe the stability condition of the current schedule compared to the initial schedule in term of the task migration. From the results, the stability is improved when the number of tasks in the system increases within a reasonable amount of time. Another interesting observation is that our model yields small average gaps that are less than 7. 99 % within 300 seconds of the CPU time for a large data set that reach 200 tasks by 10 processors. The average gaps are considerably small for the disruption problem since the rescheduling model have to match up with the optimum initial schedule...|$|E

It aims to engage theoretically and through reference to research in progress with everyday life as a concept which brings to the foreground of enquiry the richness and variety of everyday experience and helps to approach urban life and urban development as 'peopled and gendered' processes. Everyday life is connected to places where women and men live, work, consume, relate to others, forge identities, cope with or challenge routine, habit and established codes of conduct - i. e. neighbourhoods, understood as one important urban spatiality, among many. In the context of geographical debate on space/place, the paper approaches neighbourhoods not as bounded places (although this is not absent from the urban experience), but rather as particular constellations of social relations, with local and supralocal determinants, meeting and weaving together at a particular locus. In such constellations of relations, the intersecting patterns of everyday life of different women determine individual and collective identities and contribute to develop strategies which organise the everyday both as adaptation and recurrent small decisions and as particular practices and <b>general</b> <b>priorities.</b> In turn, adaptations and challenges are determined by urban spatialities and temporalities. © 2006 The Editors of Urban Studies...|$|R
