5|$|In late 1991, Syrian {{authorities}} arrested Nayyouf's {{wife and}} young {{daughter in a}} crackdown on members of the CDF in order to pressure Nayyouf to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> up. On 10 January 1992, Nayyouf surrendered to authorities. After his arrest, Nayyouf was tortured at the Palestine Branch of Syrian Military Intelligence. Many of Nayyouf's colleagues in the CDF were also arrested, and at least 17 were tried alongside Nayyouf by the Syrian Supreme State Security Court (SSSC) in proceedings lasting from 29 February to 27 March 1992.|$|E
5|$|One {{criticism}} of the practice holds that the manager has enough to be preoccupied with during a game without playing. With specialized bullpens, extensive scouting reports, and increased media scrutiny, {{the job of a}} manager has become more complex. A player–manager needs to decide how much playing time to <b>give</b> <b>himself.</b> Don Kessinger, player–manager of the Chicago White Sox in 1979, believes he did not play himself enough. Additionally, Bill Terry felt he became isolated from his team when he became a player–manager.|$|E
5|$|When Heikkinen was released, {{one writer}} noted that Heikkinen “was {{perhaps the biggest}} {{disappointment}} among the highly ballyhooed players who came up this season.” Brooklyn’ coach Clark noted that an “All-American man doesn’t mean a thing to us” in the NFL. Clark said: “Heikkinen weighed only 183 pounds and was pretty light for our league. He reported late and didn’t <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> a fair chance to show me what he could do. I just didn’t think {{he was in the}} right physical shape and mental shape.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{refused to}} hold the reunification elections, {{on the basis that}} the State of Vietnam was not a {{signatory}} to the Geneva Accords. He then proceeded to strengthen his autocratic and nepotistic rule over the country. A constitution was written by a rubber stamp legislature which gave Diệm the power to create laws by decree and arbitrarily <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> emergency powers. Dissidents, both communist and nationalist, were jailed and executed in the thousands, and elections were routinely rigged. Opposition candidates were threatened with being charged for conspiring with the Viet Cong, which carried the death penalty, and in many areas, large numbers of ARVN troops were sent to stuff ballot boxes.|$|E
5|$|Finn's death hits Beiste hard, {{and when}} Puck {{comes into the}} locker room drunk, weeks after the funeral and saying that he is lost without Finn, Beiste tells him he needs to take charge of his life and <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> the advice and {{guidance}} he would have gotten from his best friend. The two cry over their loss. Later, the two gather at Finn's outdoor memorial at McKinley, which includes a tree that Puck had stolen as a memento and later replanted at Beiste's behest, and Puck tells the coach that he has decided to join the Air Force.|$|E
5|$|The McMahon {{government}} had consisted of 27ministers, twelve of whom comprised the Cabinet. In {{the run-up to}} the election, the Labor caucus had decided that should the party take power, all 27ministers were to be Cabinet members. Intense canvassing took place amongst ALP parliamentarians as the duumvirate did its work, and on 18 December the caucus elected the Cabinet. The results were generally acceptable to Whitlam, and within three hours, he had announced the portfolios of the Cabinet members. To <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> greater control over the Cabinet, in January 1973 Whitlam established five Cabinet committees (with the members appointed by himself, not the caucus) and took full control of the Cabinet agenda.|$|E

5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> more space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns {{at a time when}} many teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5|$|New {{state laws}} prohibiting fast food {{restaurants}} in low-income neighborhoods {{result in the}} closure of all KFC eateries in Colorado, much {{to the dismay of}} Cartman, who is addicted to the food. When Randy Marsh learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical marijuana dispensary, he attempts to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> cancer so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining {{a clean bill of health}} from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By irradiating his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself testicular cancer, making his testicles so large that he has to use a wheelbarrow to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a space hopper for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, Sharon Marsh, so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.|$|E
5|$|Sunderland opened {{negotiations}} to sign Bent in July 2009. The deal seemed delayed and through social networking website Twitter he accused club chairman Daniel Levy of disrupting his move to Sunderland, although Bent later apologised, saying he acted out of frustration. He travelled to Sunderland to {{sign for the}} club after they agreed a fee with Tottenham, and after passing a medical, Bent signed for Sunderland on 5 August for an initial fee of £10million plus potential additional payments, which later rose to £16.5million. He scored on his Sunderland debut, which was the only goal in a 1–0 victory against Bolton, and was followed with Sunderland's opening goal against Chelsea in a 3–1 defeat. He scored a brace in the 4–1 win over Hull City to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> his third and fourth goals in five matches.|$|E

5|$|Tahna orders Kira {{at gunpoint}} {{to return to}} the station, {{intending}} to collapse the wormhole with an explosive device, because then Bajor will have no motivation to invite Federation presence on Bajoran territory, which he sees as a new occupation. Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why this {{was the right thing to}} do someday.|$|E
5|$|When Brion sent a {{bill for}} the {{abandoned}} sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer complained of intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith {{sent a message to}} the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell of Goldenboy. McConnell told Spin that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1,500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> an overdose. Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips and Scott McPherson of Sense Field played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass guitar and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman {{gave the}} Mohave {{a choice between}} war and peace, and he demanded that they agree to never again harm white {{settlers}} along the wagon trail. He also declared that, as punishment, the Mohave were required to surrender as hostages a member of each clan and three warriors who had taken part in the attack. Hoffman demanded that the chief who had ordered {{the attack on the}} settlers offer himself up as a hostage. According to Chooksa homar, the chief who had ordered the attack was Homoseh quahote, who was reluctant to <b>give</b> <b>himself</b> up. Cairook offered himself in his place, along with eight others, including Tokwatha, Irataba's son Tekse thume, and Irataba's nephews Qolho qorau, and Aspamekelyeho. Other hostages were named Itsere-'itse, Ilyhanapau, and Tinyam-isalye. They were transported in the river steamer General Jessup to Fort Yuma. Many soldiers remained to begin construction on the Beale's Crossing fort, which was named Fort Mohave. Although Irataba visited the garrison several times and argued for their release, the hostages were held for more than a year. On June 21, 1859, Cairook and one other captive were killed by soldiers while attempting to escape their incarceration. Most of the other Mohave captives escaped.|$|E
