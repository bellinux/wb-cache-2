He was horrified by Gonne's marriage, at losing his muse to another man; in {{addition}} her conversion to Catholicism before marriage offended him, {{although he was}} Protestant/agnostic. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> his muse would come {{under the influence of}} the priests and do their bidding.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Manheim recovers {{long enough}} to explain {{that he was doing}} {{experiments}} involving time, gravity, and funnels to other universes, and suspects his last experiment is running out of control. Manheim explains that he is trapped between two dimensions and Data determines that the experiment must be shut down during a time fluctuation or else it will simply grow larger. Manheim provides the crew with the correct coordinates to beam down to avoid the security fields. Picard admits to Jenice that <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> about losing her again after he left her in Paris, and vows to correct Dr. Manheim's experiment.|$|E

5|$|The 2010 third edition was {{reviewed}} in Lemur News by Alex Dunkel. He praised the increased {{level of detail}} in the new edition, which adds additional information on geology, the history of lemur research, and numerous aspects of lemur biology. Efforts to conserve lemurs have faced steep challenges, Dunkel wrote, due to political and economic instability in Madagascar, and these challenges make the new edition especially important. However, <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that the increased size of the book made it less portable than its predecessors.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{suffered}} from psychotic episodes and delusions and though <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after {{a confrontation with}} a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of his own left ear. He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-RÃ©my. After he discharged himself {{and moved to the}} Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homoeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.|$|E
5|$|Bagration {{called for}} the First, Second and Third Belorussian and the First Baltic Fronts to engulf Army Group Center. Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces in the pocket, cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt {{the plans for the}} Bagration were sound, <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> {{about the possibility of a}} German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E

5|$|Bryant and Milam {{were indicted}} for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|In his {{newspaper}} Berliner Arbeiterzeitung (Berlin Workers Newspaper), Gregor Strasser was {{highly critical of}} Goebbels' failure to attract the urban vote. However, the party as a whole did much better in rural areas, attracting as much as 18 per cent {{of the vote in}} some regions. This was partly because Hitler had publicly stated just prior to the election that Point 17 of the party programme, which mandated the expropriation of land without compensation, would apply only to Jewish speculators and not private landholders. After the election, the party refocused their efforts to try to attract still more votes in the agricultural sector. In May, shortly after the election, Hitler considered appointing Goebbels as party propaganda chief. But he hesitated, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that the removal of Gregor Strasser from the post would lead to a split in the party. Goebbels considered himself well suited to the position, and began to formulate ideas about how propaganda could be used in schools and the media.|$|E
5|$|After the {{resignation}} of Lord Oaksey in 1956 Denning was offered {{a job as a}} Law Lord. After a period of contemplation (<b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that such an appointment would reduce his chances of becoming Master of the Rolls or Lord Chief Justice) he accepted, and was formally offered the job on 5 April 1957. He was appointed on 24 April 1957, as Baron Denning, of Whitchurch in the County of Southampton; for the supporters of his coat of arms he chose Lord Mansfield and Sir Edward Coke. Many members of the judiciary and the Bar approved of his appointment, but he was warned that he should move slowly to reform the court. During his time in the House of Lords he also served as Chairman of the Quarter Sessions of East Sussex. During his time in the House of Lords Denning frequently expressed dissenting opinions. Denning did not enjoy his time in the House of Lords and clashed frequently with Viscount Simonds, who was known as a conservative and orthodox judge. Despite his reputation as a fiercely individual judge, Denning dissented in only 16% of cases he heard in the House of Lords; fewer than Lord Keith, who dissented 22% of the time. On 9 May 1960, Denning was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of Sussex.|$|E

5|$|While {{economic}} policies were the original motivating {{factor in the}} growing partisan split, foreign policy also became a factor. Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI, some of Hamilton's followers began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Washington particularly feared British entrance into the war, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that sympathy for France and hatred for Britain would propel the United States into the French Revolutionary Wars, to the ruin of the American economy. In 1793, after Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars, several Democratic-Republican Societies were formed. These societies, centered {{on the middle class}} of several eastern cities, opposed Hamilton's {{economic policies}} and supported France. Conservatives came to fear these societies as populist movements that sought to re-make the class order. That same year, the British began attacking American ships that were trading with France, fanning the flames of anti-British sentiment. As Washington continued to seek peace with Great Britain, critics finally began to attack the president himself.|$|E
5|$|When he was twelve, Parsons began {{attending}} Washington Junior High School, {{where he}} performed poorlyâsomething biographer George Pendle attributed to undiagnosed dyslexiaâand was bullied for his upper-class status and perceived effeminacy. Although unpopular, he formed a strong friendship with Edward Forman, a boy {{from a poor}} working-class family who defended him from bullies and shared his interest in science fiction and rocketry, with the well-read Parsons enthralling Forman with his literary prowess. In 1928 the pairâadopting the Latin motto per aspera ad astra (through hardship to the stars)âbegan engaging in homemade gunpowder-based rocket experiments in the nearby Arroyo Seco canyon, {{as well as the}} Parsons family's back garden, which left it pockmarked with craters from explosive test failures. They incorporated commonly available fireworks such as cherry bombs into their rockets, and Parsons suggested using glue as a binding agent to increase the rocket fuel's stability. This research became more complex when they began using materials such as aluminium foil to make the gunpowder easier to cast. Parsons had also begun to investigate occultism, and performed a ritual intended to invoke the Devil into his bedroom; <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that the invocation was successful and was frightened into ceasing these activities. In 1929 he began attending John Muir High School, where he maintained an insular friendship with Forman and was a keen participant in fencing and archery. After he received poor school results, Parsons' mother sent him away to study at a private boarding school in San Diegoâthe Brown Military Academy for Boysâbut he was expelled for blowing up the toilets.|$|E
25|$|Etheredge-Ouzts also {{chose to}} keep the killer as {{anonymous}} as possible. He wanted the audience to project their fears onto the murderer, assigning a motive and background to him themselves. Adding details seemed to rob the character of menace, he felt. This approach led Etheredge-Ouzts to cut all the killer's lines from the film, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> that {{a portion of the}} audience would find whichever voice was used not frightening.|$|E

25|$|After {{arriving}} in New Orleans on December 1, Jackson instituted martial {{law in the}} city, as <b>he</b> <b>worried</b> about the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary. These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral Alexander Cochrane and later General Edward Pakenham, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, {{many of whom had}} served in the Napoleonic Wars. Jackson only had about 5,000 men.|$|E
25|$|At {{the core}} of these {{disputes}} is the role that music has had in Israel {{as a vehicle for}} creating a national ethos and for disseminating national ideology. With regard to the Ballad, its lyricist Yoram Taharlev observed that âit is in the nature of a mythological song that it created a mythâ, and noted that a similar controversy arose around another of his songs, the Six Day War song Ammunition Hill released in 1968. Ben Ezer complained that learning about the founding of Petah Tikva from the Ballad would be âlike learning about the Israeli War of Independence only from Nathan Altermanâs poem Silver Platter. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> that the events themselves might be forgotten, âleaving only the songsâ, and wondered whether, in the future, the history of Israel might become confused with the history of Israeli poetry and song.|$|E

25|$|The Hongwu Emperor was {{long-lived}} {{and survived}} his first heir, Zhu Biao, the Crown Prince. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> about his succession {{and issued a}} series of dynastic instructions for his family, the Huang Ming Zu Xun.

When the Hongwu Emperor died on 24 June 1398, Zhu Yunwen succeeded his grandfather as the Jianwen Emperor. In direct violation of the dynastic instructions, the Prince of Yan attempted to mourn his father in Nanjing, bringing a large armed guard with him. The imperial army was able to block him at Huai'an and, given that three of his sons were serving as hostages in the capital, the prince withdrew in disgrace.|$|E
25|$|Reasons for the {{cultural}} and connectivity gaps vary widely. The self-selective nature of the All-Volunteer Force is seen by some to {{have led to the}} unrepresentative nature of the armed forces One argument, put forward by a Navy Chief of Chaplains, was that the drawdown {{in the size of the}} military was exacerbating differences and making the separation between the military and civilian societies potentially even more divisive. <b>He</b> <b>worried</b> that unless an effective dialogue could be maintained between the military and civilian branches of society, especially in the area of ethical decision-making, the American military risked losing the support of society or becoming dangerously militaristic. Others argued that the increase in diversity among military personnel has actually strengthened ties between society and the military, especially those ties weakened by the results of the Vietnam War.
