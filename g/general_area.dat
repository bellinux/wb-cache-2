5|$|Based on {{analysis}} from Météo-France (MFR), a disturbance in the Indian Ocean {{intertropical convergence zone}} became evident south of the Chagos Archipelago on February6, after Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar and {{moved away from the}} region. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed it as developing a day prior in the same <b>general</b> <b>area.</b> Later on February6, a circulation developed concurrently with an area of organized convection. On February8, the system intensified into Tropical Storm Hollanda as it moved southwestward, its motion influenced by a ridge to its south. A trough turned the storm to the south-southwest, and Hollanda intensified into a tropical cyclone– the equivalence of a hurricane– on February9.|$|E

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} {{suspect that}} a further 61 individuals killed at Ovčara were buried there as well. They suspect {{one or more}} additional mass graves exist in the <b>general</b> <b>area,</b> or that the bodies originally buried at the site were moved to a secondary grave. Nevenka Nekić, the Croatian {{author of a book}} on Nicolier, claims that an additional shallow grave was excavated at Ovčara in November 1991 and that Nicolier and 60 others were buried there. According to her, they were exhumed by Croatian Serb authorities and moved to a secondary location in early 1992 because the grave was so shallow that body parts protruded through the ground surface.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{increasingly}} squalid conditions, {{the population}} inside continued to grow. The situation {{inside the building}} was described as chaotic; reports of rampant drug use, fights, rape, and filthy living conditions were widespread. At the time, as many as 100 {{were reported to have}} died in the Superdome, with most deaths resulting from heat exhaustion, but other reported incidents included an accused rapist who was beaten to death by a crowd and an apparent suicide. Despite these reports, though, the final official death toll was significantly less: six people inside (4 of natural causes, one overdose, and an apparent suicide) and a few more in the <b>general</b> <b>area</b> outside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|The <b>general</b> <b>area</b> of the {{composition}} of the early Upanishads is considered as northern India. The region is bounded on the west by the upper Indus valley, on the east by lower Ganges region, on the north by the Himalayan foothills, and on the south by the Vindhya mountain range. Scholars are reasonably sure that the early Upanishads were produced at the geographical center of ancient Brahmanism, comprising the regions of Kuru-Panchala and Kosala-Videha together with the areas immediately to the south and west of these. This region covers modern Bihar, Nepal, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, eastern Rajasthan, and northern Madhya Pradesh.|$|E

After drying the fabric was then rewound onto rollers and varnished {{over and over again}} several more times to each side and thoroughly dried each time.

5|$|Croatia is {{traditionally}} divided into numerous, often overlapping geographic regions, whose borders {{are not always}} clearly defined. The largest and most readily recognizable ones throughout the country are Central Croatia (also described as the Zagreb macro-region), Eastern Croatia (largely corresponding with Slavonia), and Mountainous Croatia (Lika and Gorski Kotar; {{to the west of}} Central Croatia). These three comprise the inland or continental part of Croatia. Coastal Croatia consists of a further two regions: Dalmatia or the southern littoral, between the <b>general</b> <b>area</b> of the city of Zadar and the southernmost tip of the country; and the northern littoral located north of Dalmatia, encompassing the Croatian Littoral and Istria. The geographical regions generally do not conform to county boundaries or other administrative divisions, and all of them encompass further, more specific, geographic regions.|$|E

5|$|In 1532, Pedro de Alvarado, {{governor}} of Guatemala, was issued with royal authorisation {{to conquer the}} <b>general</b> <b>area</b> of Higueras, {{in order to establish}} a Caribbean port for Guatemala. Less than a year after permission was given to Alvarado, then {{governor of}} Honduras and Higueras, Diego Alvítez, was given royal authorisation to pacify and colonise the Naco valley and the area around Puerto de Caballos. Soon afterwards, in 1533, Francisco de Montejo, governor of Yucatán, was granted governorship over a huge area extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Ulúa River, Naco and Puerto de Caballos, so long as neither Alvarado nor Alvítez had established themselves in those regions. At the same time, Alvardo received reconfirmation of his permission to conquer those parts of Higueras that had not been pacified by the governors of Yucatán and Honduras-Higueras. Effectively, all three governors had royal permission to conquer and settle the same general region, and could interpret the royal authorisations as they chose.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Madagascar, the cyclone produced {{high winds}} and heavy rainfall. The highest rainfall was a 24‑hour total of , {{and the highest}} wind gust was , both of which observed in Toliara. Many fishermen in the area {{were not aware of}} the storm's approach, and several of them died as a result. About five days after Cyclone Ernest struck Madagascar, Tropical Storm Felapi struck the same <b>general</b> <b>area,</b> causing additional flooding. The combined effects of Ernest and Felapi killed 39people, injured 104, and left 214people missing as of February25, 2005. Later, the death toll was finalized at 78 in the International Disaster Database. The storms damaged 5,792buildings, and there were 32,191people left homeless. The floods damaged about 4,483hectares (11,078acres) of crop fields in southern Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1955, the eastern United States {{experienced}} generally hot and dry weather, leading to drought conditions and decreased water levels. When Hurricane Connie struck, its rainfall moistened the soil and heightened creeks throughout the Mid-Atlantic and New England. Hurricane Diane struck North Carolina just five days later and affected the same <b>general</b> <b>area.</b> After floods in 1936, the United States federal government enacted plans to prevent future devastating floods, although they made no progress by the time Connie and Diane struck in 1955. Along the Delaware River in the 1930s, state legislatures in New Jersey and Pennsylvania had established a commission that worked to clean up polluted water, but the legislators and commission blocked federal help, comparing it to European socialism; this was {{in contrast to the}} federally funded Tennessee Valley Authority, which mitigated flooding along the Tennessee River.|$|E

5|$|Later on November30, the {{depression}} further intensified into a tropical cyclone {{and was given}} the name Trina by the FMS. At this time, gale-force winds were only present in one quadrant of the storm. In previous years, gale-force winds had to be present all around {{the center for the}} system to receive a name. Upon receiving its name, Trina attained its peak intensity with winds of 65km/h (40mph) along with a barometric pressure of 995mbar (hPa; 29.38inHg). Remaining nearly stationary, Trina succumbed to strong wind shear during the evening of November30. The JTWC only classified Trina as a tropical storm for 12hours before downgrading the system and issuing their final advisory early on December1. However, according to the FMS, the system retained gale-force winds through December2, by which time it was situated about 70km (45mi) northwest of Mangaia. Now significantly displaced from any convective activity, the remnants of Trina persisted in the same <b>general</b> <b>area</b> for several more days before completely dissipating.|$|E

She returned to this <b>general</b> <b>area</b> yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.|$|E
5|$|On October8, a {{weak area}} of low {{pressure}} developed within a monsoon trough over the extreme {{eastern edge of}} the Pacific basin. Environmental conditions ahead of the system were forecast to become gradually favorable for tropical cyclogenesis. Situated near Costa Rica, scattered convection accompanied the well-defined system. This low became less defined over the following days while remaining in the same <b>general</b> <b>area.</b> The National Hurricane Center (NHC) began monitoring the system for long-term cyclogenesis on October13, at which time the low was situated 150mi (240km) south of Guatemala. Organization was prolonged and slow; however, the convergence of a Kelvin wave and a Gulf of Tehuantepec gap wind event on October15 spurred a significant increase in convection.|$|E
