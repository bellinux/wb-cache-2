The storage capacity of the state-of-theart system cannot be increased without also increasing the volume and mass of the system.

40|$|An {{in-house}} fully nonlinear, nonhydrostatic {{numerical model}} is utilized for simulations of internal solitary waves (ISWs) generated by tidal flows over a Gaussian sill topography. A complete, rigorous theoretical framework is then adopted for the energetics {{analysis of these}} ISWs. The ratio of topographic amplitude to the total water depth is fixed, and the tidal excursion parameter (epsilon) and slope parameter (gamma) are varied by changing the imposed barotropic velocity and the horizontal scale of the topography. It is found that the energy <b>input,</b> <b>conversion,</b> and radiation rates all increase monotonically with epsilon. They peak when the bottom topography is critical (gamma - 1). The energy input is generated by the pressure difference across the domain. The energy conversion rate in percentage (normalized by the corresponding input rate) decreases almost linearly as epsilon increases. The larger the slope parameter, the higher the conversion percentage. The baroclinic radiation rate in percentage (normalized by the corresponding conversion rate) increases first and then decreases as e increases. It gets maximum near epsilon = 0. 15, which corresponds {{to the emergence of}} ISWs in the flow field. The larger the slope parameter, the smaller the radiation percentage. At small epsilon value when the flow field is in the linear internal tide regime, the conversion and radiation percentages all agree very well with the results in existing literature (Kang and Fringer, 2012) for the Davidson Seamount. The barotropic and baroclinic dissipation percentages behave very differently. While the barotropic one is larger for smaller c, the baroclinic one is larger for larger gamma.
