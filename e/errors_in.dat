U početnim dijelovima rada raščlanjuju se rimska vrela u kojima se ta vrsta zablude problematizira te se razgraničava <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia prema ostalim sličnim slučajevima zablude: <b>error</b> <b>in</b> corpore i <b>error</b> <b>in</b> qualitate. Zatim se u svjetlu teorija o pravnoj naravi zablude u rimskom ugovornom pravu (teorija volje, teorija nesporazuma, teorija identifikacije) pokušava odgovoriti na pitanje zbog čega je ugovor u slučaju <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia ništetan. U središnjim dijelovima rada detaljno se obrađuje temeljni znanstveni problem te pravne figure: kakvo značenje ima pojam substantia u kontekstu klasičnog pravnog uređenja zablude. Objašnjenje navedenog problema – za razliku od većine dosadašnjih pokušaja – utemeljeno je na analizi mogućih utjecaja grčkih filozofijskih učenja na dogmatsko oblikovanje <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia, poglavito logičkog učenja o kategorijama. U završnim dijelovima rada <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia uspoređuje se s drugim sličnim institutima, posebice s odgovornošću za materijalne nedostatke stvari, te se zaključno analiziraju njezin opseg primjene i pravni učinci. The paper {{analyses}} {{the doctrine}} of <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia in Roman contract law. This type of mistake {{first appeared in the}} classical period of Roman law and was acceptable only in the sphere of purchase contracts (emptio-venditio). The doctrine was more precisely defined by Ulpian in his work Libri ad Sabinum. According to research, in Roman contract law <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia referred to an error pertaining to the material composition of the object of purchase. This type of <b>error</b> occurred <b>in</b> situations where the contracting parties failed to unequivocally identify the material composition of the object of purchase by their agreement (consensus). <b>Error</b> <b>in</b> substantia could only be applied in classical Roman law in cases of objects of purchase which could be made of different materials. If this type of error occurred, it was considered that an object was sold in place of another (aliud pro alio venisse videtur), making the contract void. <b>In</b> these situations, <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia was thus equal to <b>error</b> <b>in</b> corpore, i. e. an error pertaining to the object of purchase itself. On the other hand, <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia must by no means be mistaken for <b>error</b> <b>in</b> qualitate, i. e. error pertaining to the qualities of the object, which had no effect on the validity of contract. In shaping the doctrine and distinguishing between these two types of errors, Ulpian applied philosophical criteria from the ancient teachings on categories, differentiating between essential (substantia) and non-essential (qualitas) aspects of the object of purchase. From a legal and political point of view, the institute of <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia was introduced in Roman contract law primarily due to flawed legal protection of the buyer from the responsibility of the seller relating to material flaws of the object of purchase. <b>Error</b> <b>in</b> substantia was acceptable only with severe restrictions, and only when the buyer could not be protected by any other legal means. In dieser Arbeit wird der <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia im römischen Vertragsrecht analysiert. Diese Irrtumsart ist in der klassischen Ära des römischen Rechts entstanden und war ausschließlich im Bereich von Kaufverträgen (emptio-venditio) beachtlich. Dogmatisch wurde sie insbesondere von Ulpian in seinen Libri ad Sabinum ausgestaltet. Nach den Forschungsergebnissen stellte der <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia im römischen Vertragsrecht den Irrtum bezüglich der sachlichen Beschaffenheit des Verkaufsgegenstandes dar. Diese Art von Irrtum kam zustande, wenn die Vertragsseiten in ihrer Vereinbarung (consensus) die sachliche Beschaffenheit des Verkaufsgegenstands nicht eindeutig identifizierten. Die Anwendung des <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia kam im klassischen Recht nur dann in Betracht, wenn ein Verkaufsgegenstand aus unterschiedlichen Stoffen bestehen konnte. Lag in solchen Fällen diese Art von Irrtum vor, so galt ein Gegenstand als statt eines anderen verkauft (aliud pro alio venisse videtur), weshalb der Kaufvertrag unwirksam war. In den genannten Situationen deckte sich der <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia völlig mit dem <b>error</b> <b>in</b> corpore, also dem Irrtum in Bezug auf den Verkaufsgegenstand. Andererseits ist der <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia streng vom <b>error</b> <b>in</b> qualitate zu unterscheiden, d. h. dem Irrtum bezüglich der Eigenschaften des Verkaufsgegenstandes, der die Wirksamkeit des Vertrages nicht beeinflusste. Ulpian verwendete bei der dogmatischen Ausgestaltung dieser beiden Irrtumsarten die philosophischen Kriterien der antiken Kategorienlehre, mit Hilfe derer wesentliche Aspekte des Verkaufsgegenstandes (substantia) von beiläufigen (qualitas) abgegrenzt wurden. Rechtspolitisch betrachtet, wurde die Institution des <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia vor allem wegen der unvollständigen Schutzmechanismen für den Käufer bezüglich der materiellen Haftung des Verkäufers für den Verkaufsgegenstand ins römische Vertragsrecht eingeführt. Der <b>error</b> <b>in</b> substantia war sehr beschränkt anwendbar, nämlich nur dann, wenn kein anderes Rechtsmittel für den Schutz des Käufers zur Verfügung stand...|$|R
