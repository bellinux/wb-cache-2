40|$|Now the {{mechanical}} engineering industry produces {{a great variety of}} part mix having a male and female thread. In this regard a relevant task is to choose the most effective way <b>of</b> <b>threading.</b> Introduction <b>of</b> multi-coordinate CNC machines considerably extended the use <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills, instead <b>of</b> taps, roll burnishers, dies and thread turning tools. The article reviews manufacturer’s production programs <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills (Carmex, Emuge, Jel, Sandvik, Vargus) to show that, presently, there is a significant diversity <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill designs for processing. The analysis allowed to reveal the main nomenclature and standard sizes <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills, including combined tools on their base, as well as to reveal classification signs and to develop classification <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills. Classification comprises also combined tools based on design <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mill, which allow us to reduce the nomenclature of the tools used in threading. The paper considers working schemes of the main types <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills and areas of their rational application. To analyse design data <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills two types of tools have been selected, namely the integral trailer edge thread mills with the spiral chip flutes and drill thread mills made from hard alloy. The analysis of design data was made in the closed "system of the tool", i. e. in advance assuming that there is a connection between diameter of the tapping part of the tool and diameter <b>of</b> the cut <b>thread.</b> The parameter analysis of the chosen designs allowed us to develop the sketches of tools with the specified parameters to be calculated. The paper presents graphic dependences of the total length, length of a working part, diameter of a tail part and number of tool teeth on the diameter of the working part of the tool. Approximation of the specified parameters is carried out and mathematical dependences, which can be further used to calculate and choose the starting values of design data in designing the abovementioned constructions <b>of</b> <b>thread</b> mills. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—It {{is often}} assumed that to {{maximize}} {{the performance of a}} multithreaded application, the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> created should equal the number of cores. While this may be true for systems with four or eight cores, this is not true for systems with larger number of cores. Our experiments with PARSEC programs on a 24 -core machine demonstrate this. Therefore, dynamically determining the appropriate number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> for a multithreaded application is an important unsolved problem. In this paper we develop a simple technique for dynamically determining appropriate number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> without recompiling the application or using complex compilation techniques or modifying Operating System policies. We first present a scalability study of eight programs from PARSEC conducted on a 24 core Dell PowerEdge R 905 server running OpenSolaris. 2009. 06 for numbers <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> ranging from a few threads to 128 threads. Our study shows that not only does the maximum speedup achieved by these programs vary widely (from 3. 6 x to 21. 9 x), the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> that produce maximum speedups also vary widely (from 16 to 63 threads). By understanding the overall speedup behavior of these programs we identify the critical Operating System level factors that explain why the speedups vary with the number <b>of</b> <b>threads.</b> As an application of these observations, we develop a framework called “Thread Reinforcer” that dynamically monitors program’s execution to search for the number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> that are likely to yield best speedups. Thread Reinforcer identifies optimal or near optimal number <b>of</b> <b>threads</b> for most <b>of</b> the PARSEC programs studied and as well as for SPEC OMP and PBZIP 2 programs. I...|$|R
