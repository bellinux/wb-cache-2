500|$|On December 16, 1956, American Broadcasting Company {{president}} Oliver E. Treyz announced Aubrey {{would immediately}} become the network's head of programming and talent. [...] ABC, the weakest {{of the three}} networks, was a perennial also-ran with a weak roster of affiliates and programs, something comparable to {{the early days of}} the Fox Network. Aubrey later said [...] "at that time, there was no ABC. The headquarters was an old riding stable. But I went because [...] Leonard Goldenson in effect said, 'Look, I don't know that much about TV, I'm a lawyer.' And <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have autonomy." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{have a very}} fast, short-pitched delivery...Instinctively I {{turned a}} {{defensive}} back on the ball which skidded through and hit me a sickening blow {{on the back of}} my head. I sank to the ground and as I slipped in and out of consciousness, I was dimly aware of the players gathering round my prostrate body. Indistinctly I heard my fellow batsman Bill Edrich saying: 'My God, Lindy, you've killed him!'...I was very, very angry with Ray Lindwall. And the whole of the Aussie team knew it...I would return the bouncer with interest!.|$|E
2500|$|I began again, but I had {{not played}} {{more than a}} few {{measures}} when Rubinstein said loudly, [...] "Have you begun?" [...] "Yes, Master, I certainly have." [...] "Oh," [...] said Rubinstein vaguely, [...] "I didn't notice." [...] Rubinstein did not so much instruct me. [...] Merely <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> learn from him ... If a student, by his own study and mental force, reached the desired point which the musician's wizardry had made him see, he gained reliance in his own strength, knowing he would always find that point again even though he should lose his way once or twice, as everyone with an honest aspiration is liable to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, quite freely. Mr. Moore's desk is half mine--for <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> {{keep all}} sorts of things in it--and I give you leave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope he {{will not}} be long before <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> see him. Perhaps he can call to-morrow. Would you both come and dine to-morrow?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that. If I live, and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> know his whereabouts, I cannot leave him penniless. I do feel that a great {{injustice}} has been done him." ...|$|R
2500|$|Anne Hutchinson (1591â€“1643) was the {{daughter}} of Francis Marbury, a school teacher and Anglican clergyman in England with strong Puritan leanings. She was deeply imbued with religious thought as a youngster, but as a young woman had come to mistrust the priests of the Church of England who did not seem to act according to their principles. [...] Her religious beliefs were leaning toward atheism when she claimed to hear the voice of God, and [...] "at last <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> see how I did oppose Jesus Christ... and how I did turne in upon a Covenant of works... from which time the Lord did discover to me all sorts of Ministers, and how they taught, and to know what voyce I heard". [...] From this point forward, this inner voice became the source of her guidance.|$|E
6000|$|... "I sent in my card to the manager. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> through. Ever courteous. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{through on}} my face. This manager. This genial and courteous manager.|$|E
60|$|And <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> lick out the {{saucepan}} {{in which}} the dinner had been cooked.|$|E
6000|$|... "He does what's a {{thousand}} times better--he <b>lets</b> it alone. <b>He</b> does," [...] Maggie went on, [...] "as he would do; as I see now that I was sure <b>he</b> would. <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{he likes}} that," [...] said Ayala. [...] "All {{that time we}} were {{up at the top}} of St. Peter's I was quizzing him about his speeches. <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> say just what I please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, thet's {{very strange}} now--thet's just wot I think. Mr. Footley does 'is work well, an' 'e's very reasonable. I'm {{a very old}} {{customer}} of 'is, an' <b>'e</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> 'ave things as cheap as anybody.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{there is}} {{anything}} else he wants very much, how could <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> know?' mused Gillian. 'Oh, I see! What time are you at the works?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His coming is not likely. I cannot {{understand}} that he should come. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> leave Silverbridge without seeing me,--and I {{thought that he was}} quite right." ...|$|E
6000|$|Fam. [...] The same! the same! [...] Letters four do form his name. [...] <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> loose, and cried, Halloo! [...] To {{him alone}} the praise is due. [...] 45 ...|$|E
6000|$|MISS REED: [...] "He's <b>let</b> <b>me</b> wither for {{twenty-four hours}} already! But it's nothing to me, now, how long <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> wither. I'm {{perfectly}} satisfied {{to have the}} affair remain as it is. I am in the right, and if he comes I shall refuse to see him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{go to her}} as soon as <b>he</b> will <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> I don't {{think he}} will forbid my going to her, perhaps, after a day or two; but I know <b>he</b> would not <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go on purpose to meet her." ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl {{also for}} a little lost herself. [...] "Oh you don't know what it is--the charm comes out so as one stays. Little by little it grows and grows. There are old things {{everywhere}} that are too delightful. <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> explore so--he <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> rummage and rifle. Every day I make discoveries." ...|$|R
6000|$|TRESHAM. [...] There was no {{fight at}} all. [...] <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{slaughter}} him--the boy! I'll trust [...] The body there {{to you and}} Gerard--thus! [...] Now bear him on before me.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{attacked}} me and I hit back," [...] explained Tom. [...] "It was his {{own fault}} that he fell down stairs. Had <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> alone {{there would have been}} no trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's never interfered, and he's {{always seemed}} to understand. I've not {{forgotten}} how <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go out to South Africa in the Boer War when I {{was in love with}} Val." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If Jem <b>lets</b> you go, <b>he</b> will <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> <b>He</b> shall <b>let</b> <b>me.</b> Don't {{you know}} that you are never to have me off your hands, uncle? No, no, I shall stick to you like a burr. You may go up to the tip-top of Chimborazo if you please, but you'll not shake me off.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{insists on}} my {{accepting}} God knows what in HIM,' she resumed. 'He {{wants me to}} accept HIM as--as an absolute--But {{it seems to me}} he doesn't want to GIVE anything. He doesn't want real warm intimacy--he won't have it--he rejects it. <b>He</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> think, really, and <b>he</b> won't <b>let</b> <b>me</b> FEEL--he hates feelings.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't approve on't, but {{he might}} do wuss. We all have to have our comfort somehow, so I let Lisha smoke {{as much as he}} likes, and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> gab, so it's about fair, I reckon," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Wilkins, from the suds.|$|R
60|$|As he {{was only}} a private, he {{referred}} me to the adjutant, and to the adjutant I repeated my reasons for wishing to go, and politely requested that <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> go.|$|E
60|$|I walked swiftly away, {{listening}} all the time, but hearing no unusual sound. In a {{few minutes}} I reached the gates and found Anderson waiting about outside. <b>He</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> through at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "In a {{roundabout}} way I met {{the fellow}} who had the papers. For a consideration <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> have them. If you want them you can have them---provided you will pay the price." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} would, {{if your mother}} asked him. He's very kind, though he does not look so, and <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> do what I like, pretty much, only he's afraid I might be a bother to strangers," [...] began Laurie, {{brightening}} more and more.|$|R
6000|$|... "He is {{a careful}} man," [...] Oswald said, with a smile; [...] "and {{though he is}} a good trencherman, he does not waste his money on such matters. However, <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> have a freer hand than he uses himself; and asks not, when I return, for a close account of my outgoings.|$|R
60|$|Mont. Thou art deceived; for whensoe'er I die, The Sun, my father, bears my soul on high: <b>He</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> down a beam, {{and mounted}} there, He draws it back, and pulls {{me through the}} air: I in the eastern parts, and rising sky, You in heaven's downfal, and the west must lie.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, yes. It was iniquitous. They {{corrupted}} him thoroughly, {{the poor}} old boy. Oh! why wouldn't <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> {{go back to}} him? But now I shall know how to grapple with this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{has gone}} to the Post Office. We reached home about noon, and he went at once. It was late {{yesterday}} when we reached Folkestone, and <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> stay there for the night." ...|$|E
60|$|DAISY. [Passionately.] If he {{was going}} to leave me like that why didn't <b>he</b> <b>let</b> <b>me</b> stay with my Chinese mother? Why did he bring me up like a lady? Oh, it was cruel.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold on, Hal! I {{want you}} to help me to persuade father, and if you get your temper up you'll like as not go against <b>me.</b> If <b>he</b> <b>lets</b> <b>me</b> go I'll bring you in as soon as I dare. That's a promise. I guess I know how much I'd like to have you." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jamie Lee Curtis, who was {{the main}} star of Carpenter's 1978 hit Halloween, {{appeared}} as Elizabeth. Commenting on the role and on appearing in another of Carpenter's films, she said [...] "That's what I love about John. <b>He's</b> <b>letting</b> <b>me</b> explore different aspects of myself. I'm spoiled rotten now. My next director {{is going to be}} almost a letdown." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, I {{suppose a}} man can harden his heart if <b>he</b> likes. <b>Let</b> <b>me</b> harden my heart, and forget her.|$|R
