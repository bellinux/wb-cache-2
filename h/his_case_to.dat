5|$|In 2015, the U.S. conferred the 2014 Human Rights Defender Award on Askarov. The Kyrgyz {{government}} protested {{this decision}} and formally terminated a 1993 agreement on {{cooperation between the}} U.S. and Kyrgyzstan. On 12 July 2016, the Supreme Court of Kyrgyzstan revoked the life sentence against Askarov and sent <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the Chui Oblast Court for review. He was resentenced for life on 24 January 2017.|$|E
5|$|A snap {{election}} was called, with Bruce taking <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> {{the people that}} dramatic action on industrial relations was needed. Opposition Leader Scullin forcefully attacked the government, blaming the Prime Minister for an industrial environment that was adversarial and punitive, stressing that Commonwealth arbitration had safeguarded many rights of workers and was completely workable with conciliation and proper consultation. Scullin also criticised {{the government for the}} growing debt problem and economic malaise, which for some years he had predicted would lead to a major economic crisis.|$|E
5|$|Declan McCullagh {{asserts that}} during the trial, the judge sealed the entire court file, forbade the defense from issuing subpoenas to witnesses, granted the {{prosecution}} significant latitude in making negative suggestions about Bell's character, and refused requests for a mistrial. McCullagh also asserts that he was subpoenaed by two Treasury Department agents {{to appear before the}} court, without being notified ahead of time as required by federal regulations regarding subpoenas involving the media. Following the conviction, Jim Bell renewed his attempts at firing his court-appointed lawyer, appealing <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the Supreme Court, and filing civil lawsuits against those he alleges were involved in an orchestrated conspiracy to deny him a fair trial and an unbiased, court-appointed defense counsel; his targets included two judges, at least two prosecutors, and his former probation officers and defense attorneys.|$|E

5|$|Maryland {{head coach}} Ralph Friedgen made <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> bowl {{officials}} {{by saying that}} the Terrapins had beaten four of the other five 4–4 teams and not played a game against the fifth, Miami. Three of those teams were selected ahead of Maryland: the Meineke Car Care Bowl selected the nearby North Carolina team; the Gator Bowl chose Clemson, a school with a traditionally well-traveling fanbase; and the Emerald Bowl selected Miami. After the higher-priority bowl games made their selections, the Humanitarian Bowl had the choice of either Maryland or Wake Forest, the school with the smallest enrollment in any BCS football conference. Humanitarian Bowl officials chose Maryland in light of its larger alumni base, well-traveled fans, and greater television marketing potential.|$|E
5|$|Mulder confronts Skinner and The Smoking Man, {{believing that}} he and Scully were deceived into taking the case without knowing about the contagion. Mulder is adamant that the public should know the truth about Pinck's actions. The Smoking Man {{counters}} that public knowledge of the truth would create mass panic and {{do more harm than}} good. Mulder tries to take <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> Scully, but she agrees that exposing Pinck may result in a deadly hysteria. Paul becomes the only remaining proof of the company's crimes, but he takes a hostage and is killed by the Marshals before Mulder can convince him to divulge the contents of Torrance's package. The episode ends with Skinner warning Mulder to be more wary of the situations he will find himself in.|$|E
5|$|On 28 December 1263 Henry {{left for}} France to present <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> King Louis. Montfort was {{prevented}} from attending by an accident, {{and he was}} represented by Peter de Montfort and others. Henry had already tried once before, in September, {{to appeal to the}} French king. That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying waste to royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons.|$|E

5|$|After {{being offered}} a trial with Universitatea Craiova by an agent, McBreen signed for the Romanian Divizia A club in July 2002 on a three-year contact. He made his debut in 3–1 win over Astra Ploiești on 17 August 2002, and scored {{only once in}} 13 {{appearances}} for a Craiova team that ranked seventh in the 2002–03 Divizia A table. However, the players' wages were continually paid late throughout the season and McBreen came close to a move to Norwegian Tippeligaen club Lillestrøm, only for Craiova to twice raise their asking price for him on transfer deadline day. He played more regularly the next season, making 20 appearances and scoring twice as Craiova finished fourth in the 2003–04 Divizia A table. He finally left Craiova {{during the summer of}} 2004 after the club's president Pavel Badea, a former teammate of McBreen's at the club, signed a letter releasing him from his contract. He took <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> FIFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport with the help of Professional Footballers Australia, and only received the money he was owed after the club was given a three-point deduction and was threatened with automatic relegation.|$|E
5|$|Banza soon {{decided to}} stage a coup d'état. He confided in a few {{military}} officers, who he hoped would support his attempt to gain power. One of his confidants, Jean-Claude Mandaba, contacted the president and informed him of {{the date of the}} coup, 9 April 1969. Hours before he was going to execute his bid for power, Banza was ambushed by Mandaba and taken directly to Bokassa. Bokassa nearly beat Banza to death before Mandaba suggested that Banza be put on trial for appearance's sake. On 12 April, Banza presented <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> a military tribunal, which quickly sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was reportedly taken to an open field, where he was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. Alternate circumstances of Banza's death have been reported in Time and Le Monde. In the aftermath of the failed coup, Banza's family, mistress and close associates were all arrested and either sent to jail or deported. With Banza eliminated, Bokassa spent extravagantly and surrounded himself with adulators.|$|E

The arbitration committee ruled against him on 9 August 2007, but that same day, Ajax increased their offer to €7.5million and Groningen accepted.|$|E

25|$|Witt {{continued}} {{to play a role}} in aiding Standard Oil financially. Rockefeller approached the Second National Bank for a major loan in early 1872. Amasa Stone expected the much younger Rockefeller to be deferential and suppliant, but he was not. Stone angrily opposed the loan during a bank board of directors meeting. After Rockefeller made <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> the board, Stone suggested that Payne and Witt arbitrate the dispute. The two officers voted to support Rockefeller.|$|E

25|$|This is {{a result}} of Ford v. Wainwright (1986).

Providing treatment to an individual to enable that person to become competent to be executed puts mental health professionals in an ethical dilemma.|$|E
25|$|Finding little {{interest}} or appreciation {{for his work}} in Italy, Marconi travelled to London in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at Dover and the Customs officer opened <b>his</b> <b>case</b> <b>to</b> find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted the Admiralty in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of William Preece, the Chief Electrical Engineer of the British Post Office.|$|E

Tensions died down temporarily, but arose after the publication of Secretary Long’s personal memoir, in which the former secretary of the navy credited Sampson fully and believed that Schley contributed little to the battle's outcome. Sampson died in 1902 and Schley in 1911, but the controversy left an internecine struggle within the Navy that, in some ways, tarnished the Navy’s image after what had otherwise seemed a glorious naval victory.|$|E
