Periodically, he throws a cutter early in the count to right-handed hitters and a curveball in the mid 70s. Nardi Contreras, who worked with Clippard as the Yankees' minor league pitching coordinator, indicated that Clippard's greatest success comes from his curveball and changeup.|$|E
5|$|As Police Commissioner Blamey {{defended the}} actions of the police during the 1928 Waterside Workers' Federation dispute, during which police opened fire, killing a {{striking}} worker who was also a Gallipoli veteran, and wounding several others. His treatment of the unionists was typical of <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> line anti-communist beliefs and as such his relations with left-wing governments were tense. Along with many senior army and ex-army officers, he was a leading member of the clandestine far-right-wing League of National Security. This was reportedly a response to the rise of communism in Australia. Its members stood ready to take up arms to stop a Catholic or communist revolution.|$|E
5|$|At the time, he had {{his first}} {{confrontation}} with Spanish authorities, since Betances gave last priority of medical treatment to those Spanish-born military rank and officers who were affected by the disease (they demanded preferential and immediate treatment, and he openly despised them for it). For <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> work to save many Puerto Ricans from the ravages of the cholera epidemic of 1856, Betances was commended by the city's government. However, when the central government established a Chief Surgeon post for the city, Betances (who was the acting chief surgeon) was passed over, {{in favor of a}} Spanish newcomer.|$|E

5|$|Ballard is {{a two-way}} defenseman, capable of {{contributing}} both offensively and defensively. Known for <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> hitting, specifically with hip checks, he led his club in hits {{during his first}} {{five years in the}} NHL. He is also proficient in shot-blocking. Offensively, Ballard is noted as a quick and smooth skater, making him able to start plays from the defensive zone. At the 2012 Canucks SuperSkills Competition, he won the fastest skater segment by circling the rink in 13.440 seconds. He has a reputation as a player with intensity and a competitive edge.|$|E
5|$|One man, whose {{influence}} {{more than}} any other one thing, succeeded in laying a foundation for Dartmouth's wonderful results, but whose name is seldom mentioned in that connection is Doctor Wurtenberg, who was brought up in the early Yale football school. He had the keenest sense of fundamental football and the greatest intensity of spirit in transmitting <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> earned knowledge. Four critical years he worked with us filling every one with his enthusiasm and those four years Dartmouth football gained such headway that nothing could stop its growth.|$|E
5|$|Rosas {{acquired}} a {{working knowledge of}} administering ranchlands and, beginning in 1811, took charge of his family's estancias. In 1813, he married Encarnación Ezcurra, daughter of a wealthy family from Buenos Aires. He soon afterwards sought to establish a career for himself, leaving his parent's estate. He produced salted meat and acquired landholdings in the process. As the years passed he became an estanciero (rancher) in his own right, accumulating land while establishing a successful partnership with second cousins from the politically powerful Anchorena clan. <b>His</b> <b>hard</b> work and organisational skills in deploying labour were key to his success, rather than creating new or applying nontraditional approaches to production.|$|E

5|$|Subterranean Jungle is {{the seventh}} studio album by the American punk rock band the Ramones, {{released}} by Sire Records in February 1983. The album appealed to a hardcore punk rock style rather than featuring several pop oriented pieces; {{this is because}} guitarist Johnny Ramone received more leeway with steering the overall genre with <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> rock influenced riffs. The recording sessions saw disputes between band members, mainly {{because many of the}} band members were dealing with alcohol addiction, or in bassist Dee Dee Ramone's case, cocaine.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{study has}} Bertin standing and leaning {{on a table}} in an almost Napoleonic pose. <b>His</b> <b>hard,</b> level stare is already established, but the focus seems to be on his groin rather than his face. It is obvious that Ingres struggled with the sketch; the head is on a square of attached paper which must have replaced an earlier cut-out version, and other areas have been rubbed over and heavily reworked. The next extant drawing shows Bertin seated, but the chair is missing. The last extant sketch is the closest to the eventual painting, with a chair, though his bulk has not yet been filled out.|$|E
5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently {{and listen to the}} male filmmakers. Her only role is to be an object for men to look upon. The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E

5|$|Continuing {{his earlier}} battle with Stevens, Blaine {{led the fight}} in Congress for a strong dollar. After the {{issuance}} of 150 million dollars in greenbacks—non-gold-backed currency—the {{value of the dollar}} stood at a low ebb. A bipartisan group of inflationists, led by Republican Benjamin F. Butler and Democrat George H. Pendleton, wished to preserve the status quo and allow the Treasury to continue to issue greenbacks and even to use them to pay the interest due on pre-war bonds. Blaine called this idea a repudiation of the nation’s promise to investors, which was made when the only currency was gold. Speaking several times on the matter, Blaine said that the greenbacks had only ever been an emergency measure to avoid bankruptcy during the war. Blaine and <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> money allies were successful, but the issue remained alive until 1879, when all remaining greenbacks were made redeemable in gold by the Specie Payment Resumption Act of 1875.|$|E
5|$|In Brood War, Fenix and Raynor remain {{behind as}} a rear guard when the Protoss {{evacuate}} the now Zerg-overrun Aiur through a warp gate. They hold it until attacked by United Earth Directorate forces pursuing Arcturus Mengsk, upon which they escape through the gate, disabling {{it as they}} depart. With Raynor and Mengsk, Fenix enters into an alliance with Sarah Kerrigan against the UED, even leading the Zerg forces on a raiding mission for resources on Moria. However, after the UED is routed from their position on the Dominion capital world of Korhal, Kerrigan turns on her allies. Though unfazed by Kerrigan's betrayal, Fenix is slain when Kerrigan's Zerg launch a surprise attack against his base camp on Korhal. In StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, Raynor shows that he still harbors a grudge against Kerrigan for Fenix's death after seeing her willingly become infested again after all <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> work in returning her to human form.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{had been}} a firm {{supporter}} of Kennedy in the 1961 Bay of Pigs Invasion and 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis; on taking office he stepped up covert operations against Cuba and its president, Fidel Castro. He maintained close relations with the Cuban-American exile community through his friend, Bebe Rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating Castro. These activities concerned the Soviets and Cubans, who feared Nixon might attack Cuba and break the understanding between Kennedy and Khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. In August 1970, the Soviets asked Nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> line against Castro, Nixon agreed. The process {{had not yet been}} completed when the Soviets began expanding their base at the Cuban port of Cienfuegos in October 1970. A minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the Soviets would not use Cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. The final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in November.|$|E

5|$|The {{momentum}} {{behind the}} NWOBHM also benefited already established bands, which reclaimed the spotlight with new and acclaimed releases. Ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan returned to sing heavy metal with the album Mr. Universe in 1979 {{and was on}} the forefront of the British metal scene with his band Gillan in the following years. His former Deep Purple bandmate Ritchie Blackmore also climbed the UK charts with <b>his</b> <b>hard</b> rock group Rainbow's releases Down to Earth (1979) and Difficult to Cure (1981). Black Sabbath recovered and returned to success with the albums Heaven and Hell (1980) and Mob Rules (1981), featuring the ex-Rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio. 1980 saw several other entries by hard rock and heavy metal bands in the top 10 of the British charts: MSG's first album peaked at No.8, Whitesnake's Ready an' Willing at No.6, Judas Priest's best-seller British Steel and Motörhead's Ace of Spades at No.4, while Back in Black by AC/DC reached number one.|$|E
