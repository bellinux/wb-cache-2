5000|$|When {{electronic}} equipment was built using vacuum tubes, microphonics were often a serious design problem. The charged {{elements in the}} vacuum tubes can mechanically vibrate, changing {{the distance between the}} elements, producing charge flows {{in and out of the}} tube in a manner identical to a capacitor microphone. A system sufficiently susceptible to microphonics could experience audio feedback, and make noises if jarred or bumped. Certain vacuum tubes were made with thicker internal insulating plates and more supports to minimize these effects.A special tool, called a valve <b>hammer,</b> or <b>tube</b> <b>hammer</b> was sometimes used to safely tap the device suspected of being microphonic, while it was operating, so checking if such a tap would produce objectional audio effects.|$|R

50|$|The Remington Model 10 is a pump-action shotgun {{designed}} by John Pedersen with an internal <b>hammer</b> and a <b>tube</b> magazine which loaded and ejected from a port {{in the bottom}} of the receiver.

50|$|According to Francisco Javier Durán García, New York City based {{instrument}} maker, {{the traditional}} art of güira making involves a tree stump, <b>hammer,</b> nail, metal <b>tube,</b> and wood block. The instrument is hand fashioned from sheet metal into a (roughly 13") long cylindrical tube along with repeatedly-dimpled (not fully perforated) tubular (exterior) surface.|$|R
5000|$|Winchester's Model 9422 was {{introduced}} in 1972. It was designed to capture {{the image of the}} traditional lever-actions with exposed <b>hammer,</b> straight grip, <b>tube</b> magazine and barrel bands. Unlike older Winchester lever actions it came grooved for scope mounting. It was offered in [...]22 Long Rifle and [...]22 WMR, and was priced at {{the high end of the}} [...]22 LR sporting rifle market.|$|R
500|$|... with an {{external}} <b>hammer</b> and <b>tube</b> magazine manufactured by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The Model 1897 was an {{evolution of the}} Winchester Model 1893 designed by John Browning. From 1897 until 1957, over one million of these shotguns were produced. The Model 1897 was offered in numerous barrel lengths and grades, chambered in 12 and 16 gauge, and as a solid frame or takedown. The 16-gauge guns had a standard barrel length of 28inches, while 12-gauge guns were furnished with 30-inch length barrels. Special length barrels could be ordered in lengths as short as 20inches, {{and as long as}} 36inches. Since the time the Model 1897 was first manufactured it has been used by American soldiers, police departments, and hunters.|$|R

5000|$|In total, {{approximately}} 15,000 Deringer pistols were manufactured. All {{were single}} barrel pistols with back action percussion locks, typically [...]41" [...] rifled bores, and walnut stocks. Barrel length varied from 1.5" [...] to 6", and the hardware was commonly a copper-nickel alloy known as [...] "German silver". The back action lock was a later, improved design among locks, {{which had its}} spring and mechanism located behind the hammer, where it was thereby protected from dirt, fired cap residue, and gunpowder residue unlike earlier front action locks that had their springs and mechanism located directly {{in the path of}} such residue in front of the <b>hammer,</b> under the <b>tube.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tube</b> <b>hammer</b> was {{followed}} shortly be the Bar Hammer single-shot percussion pistol. Produced {{in a wide}} variety of calibers and barrel lengths, the Model 9 introduced a bar-shaped hammer on the top of the barrel which would be less likely to catch on clothing when drawn from a coat pocket. Barrel length was typically 2-6 inches with a smooth bore, while the most common calibers were [...]30-.36. Retaining the double action, single shot, screw barrel design of the tube-hammer, the Model 9 was a success and was produced well into the Allen and Wheelock era. Though made possibly as early as 1837-1838, the bar hammer was eventually marked with an 1845 patent date.|$|R
