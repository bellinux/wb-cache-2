40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{extension}} of counter-radicalisation practice into the National Health Service (NHS). In the 2011 reformulation of the UK Prevent strategy, the NHS became a key sector for the identification and suppression of ‘radicalisation’. Optometrists, dentists, doctors and nurses have been incorporated into counter-terrorism and trained to report signs of radicalisation in patients and staff. This article explores how calculative modalities associated with big data and digital analytics have been translated into the non-digital realm. The surveillance of {{the whole of the}} population through the NHS indicates a dramatic policy shift away from linear profiling of those ‘suspect communities’ previously considered vulnerable to radicalisation. <b>Fixed</b> <b>indicators</b> of radicalisation and risk profiles no longer reduce the sample size for surveillance by distinguishing between risky and non-risky bodies. Instead, the UK government chose the NHS as a pre-eminent site for counter-terrorism because of the large amount of contact it has with the public. The UK government is developing a novel counter-terrorism policy in the NHS around large-N surveillance and inductive calculation, which demonstrates a translation of algorithmic modalities and calculative regimes. This article argues that this translation produces an autoimmune moment in British security discourse whereby the distinction between suspicious and non-suspicious bodies has collapsed. It explores the training provided to NHS staff, arguing that fixed profiles no longer guide surveillance: rather, surveillance inductively produces the terrorist profile...|$|R

40|$|Current {{initiatives}} of the UNCCD on defining minimum sets {{of indicators}} for monitoring and impact {{assessment of the}} implementation of the Convention have acknowledged that an important missing element in this process is an approved methodology of defining affected areas, emphasizing the importance of a more uniform identification methodology. Rather than discussing <b>fixed</b> <b>indicator</b> sets, this paper suggests how the UNCCD community progressively can make use of a flexible framework of analytical approaches that have been recently developed by scientific research, allowing a standardized but flexible use of indicator sets adapted to specific objectives or desertification issues relevant for implementing the Convention. Science has made progress in understanding major issues and proximate causes of dryland degradation such that indicator sets can be accordingly selected from the wealth of existing and documented indicator systems. The selection and combination should be guided according to transparent criteria given by existing indicator frameworks adapted to desertification conceptual frameworks such as the Dryland Development Paradigm (DDP). The concept of desertification issues suggested by recent research could be a pragmatic entry level for selecting area- and theme-specific sets of indicators from existing databases. Working on different dryland sub-types through a meaningful stratification is proposed to delimit and characterize affected areas beyond national levels. Such stratification could be achieved by combining existing Land Use information with additional biophysical and socio-economic data sets. This would allow indicator based monitoring and assessment in a framework of specific dryland degradation issues and their impact on key ecosystem services. JRC. DDG.

40|$|Phytoplankton play a {{key role}} in the geochemical cycles of the Earth, are {{responsible}} for 50 % of global carbon fixation, and through this, provide almost all of the energy for the entire marine trophic system. Understanding the dynamics of phytoplankton, and the species composition in relation to environmental factors is therefore of great importance. In this thesis a range of techniques to identify phytoplankton groups that use accessory pigment data obtained from high performance liquid chromatography are compared. While <b>fixed</b> <b>indicator</b> pigment:chl-a ratio approaches provide a quick and simple way of estimating phytoplankton distributions either on the basis of size-class or taxonomic group, the more sophisticated iterative approach of CHEMTAX divides the biomass into more categories and allows more flexibility to adapt to changes in indicator pigment:chl-a ratios caused by environmental variability. Combined with flow cytometric cell counts, depth-dependent trends in the intracellular concentration and composition of phytoplankton pigments can be identified. These data show an exponential decrease in the ratio of carbon-to-chlorophyll with depth, in response to decreasing light intensity. The relative as well as absolute concentrations of phytoplankton pigments are also seen to change with depth, particularly under stratified conditions, with the ratio of zeaxanthin to chlorophyll- a decreasing with increasing depth, and the ratio of chlorophyll- b to chlorophyll- a increasing. Cluster analysis is used to identify the main phytoplankton populations in the North West Atlantic, with communities of large, fucoxanthin-containing phytoplankton dominating in spring when mixing is strong, before being replaced by smaller cells upon the onset of stratification. The links between trends in phytoplankton photophysiology and abiotic conditions are also explored, with temperature being found to be the most important forcing factor. Size-class specific relationships between phytoplankton photosynthetic rates and temperature are identified, with the potential for use in remotely-sensed models of primary production.

We conducted a model-based assessment {{of the performance of}} <b>fixed</b> TL-based <b>indicators</b> vs. variable TL-based indicators for tracking the effects of fishing pressure. This assessment considered three TL-based indicators (the trophic level of the landed catch (TLc), the marine trophic index (MTI) and the trophic level of the surveyed community (TLsc)), three fishing scenarios that targeted specific model groups (the low TL scenario (LTL), the high TL scenario (HTL) and a scenario encompassing broad-scale exploitation (ALL)) and ten contrasting marine ecosystems with four types of ecosystem modelling approaches that differ in their structure and assumptions. Results showed that, overall, variable TL-based indicators have a greater capacity for detecting the effects of fishing pressure than <b>fixed</b> TL-based <b>indicators.</b> Across TL-based indicators, TLsc displayed the most consistent response to fishing whether fixed or variable species' TLs were used, as well as the highest capacity for detecting fishing effects. This result supports previous studies that promote the use of survey-based indicators over catch-based indicators to explore the impacts of fishing on the structure of marine ecosystems. Across fishing scenarios, the low trophic level fishing scenario (LTL) resulted in the lowest consistency between fixed and variable TL-based indicator responses and the lowest capacity of TL-based indicators for detecting fishing effects. Overall, our results speak to the need for caution when interpreting TL-based indicator trends, and knowledge of the broader context, such as fishing strategies and exploitation history...|$|R
