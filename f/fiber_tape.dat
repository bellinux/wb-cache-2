Study Design: Controlled laboratory study. Methods: Crescent-shaped tears were systematically created in the supraspinatus tendon of 7 cadaveric shoulders with increas-ing medial to lateral widths (0. 5, 1. 0, and 1. 5 cm). Repair of the 1. 5 -cm tear was performed on each shoulder with 3 methods in a randomized order: suture bridge, double-row repair with 2 -mm <b>fiber</b> <b>tape,</b> and <b>fiber</b> <b>tape</b> with peripheral No. 2 nonabsorbable looped sutures.

40|$|<b>Fiber</b> <b>Tape</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} to provide increased tissue cut-through resistance to prevent cuff repair failure. We hypothesize that this increased friction results in the FiberTape dragging the tendon laterally and adversely affecting tendon-footprint contact. Our aim was to compare our standard FiberTape repairs with a modified technique. In 5 cadavers, supraspinatus repairs using our standard technique was compared with a modification where the tendon was cinched down. The FiberTape tendon interface on the bursal side was marked and length of redundant FiberTape that was pulled through from the undersurface of the repair measured. The length of redundant Fiber-Tape pulled through from the medial row for each suture after cinching was on average 6. 1 mm (range, 3 to 10 mm). We also observed better approximation of cuff to footprint using our modified technique by comparing the undersurface of the repair in 2 specimens. Redundant suture material on the undersurface of medial row equates to poorer tendon to bone contact and the presence of fluid in the healing zone. Optimal contact area and pressures are necessary to maximize tendon healing. Improved tendon to bone contact can be achieved by cinching the medial row when FiberTape is used in a suture bridge technique. 5 page(s...|$|E

To further explore {{the capacity of}} the amino acid/oxalamide structural fragment as a gelation-generating motif, the dioxalamide dimethyl esters 16 Me and 19 Me, and dicarboxylic acid 26 OH/ 29 OH derivatives containing flexible methylene bridges with odd (9; n= 7) and even (6; n= 4) numbers of methylene groups were prepared. Their self-assembly motifs and gelation properties were studied by using a number of methods (FTIR, 1 HNMR spectroscopy, CD, TEM, DSC, XRPD, molecular modeling, MMFF 94, and DFT). In contrast to the previously studied chiral bis(amino acid or amino alcohol) oxalamide gelators, in which no chiral morphology was ever observed in the gels, the conformationally more flexible 16 Me, 19 Me, 26 OH, and 29 OH provide gelators that are capable of forming diverse aggregates of achiral and chiral morphologies, such as helical <b>fibers,</b> twisted <b>tapes,</b> nanotubules, straight <b>fibers,</b> and <b>tapes,</b> in some cases coexisting in the same gel sample. It is shown that the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) -determined gelation enthalpies could not be correlated with gelator and solvent clogP values. Spectroscopic results show that intermolecular hydrogen-bonding between the oxalamide units provides the major and self-assembly directing intermolecular interaction in the aggregates. Molecular modeling studies reveal that molecular flexibility of gelators due to the presence of the polymethylene bridges gives three conformations (zz, p 1, and p 2) close in energy, which could form oxalamide hydrogen-bonded layers. The aggregates of the p 1 and p 2 conformations tend to twist due to steric repulsion between neighboring iBu groups at chiral centers. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) results of 16 Me and 19 Me xerogels prove the formation of p 1 and p 2 gel aggregates, respectively. The latter results explain the formation of gel aggregates with chiral morphology and also the simultaneous presence of aggregates of diverse morphology in the same gel system. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{review of}} {{selected}} methods of strengthening of steel structures with carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) tapes and {{the analysis of}} influence of composite materials on the steel thin-walled elements are performed in this paper. The study is also focused {{to the problem of}} applying fast and effective strengthening methods of the steel structures made of thin-walled profiles. It is worth noting that the issue of strengthening the thin-walled structures is a very complex, due to inability to perform welded joints in this type of elements and the limited ability to applying mechanical fasteners. Moreover, structures made of thin-walled cross-section demonstrate a high sensitivity to imperfections and tendency to interactive buckling, which may substantially contribute to the reduction of critical load capacity. Due to the lack of commonly used and recognized modern methods of strengthening of thin-walled steel structures, authors performed the experimental studies of thin-walled sigma profiles strengthened with CFRP tapes.
