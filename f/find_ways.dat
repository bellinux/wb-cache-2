Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart and genetic source material, Mew. Reactions to Mewtwo's first anime portrayal have been divided; reviewers such as Daily Record cited it as a cliché villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{development}} in 1987, it was conceived by designer and writer Shouzou Kaga: {{he wanted to}} combine the strategic elements of Famicom Wars with the characters and story of a role-playing video game. Keisuke Terasaki acted as director and Gunpei Yokoi produced, while the music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko. The scale of the game meant that the team needed to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> around memory storage problems, and make compromises with the graphics and storyline. While initial sales and critical reception were lackluster, it later became popular, launching the Fire Emblem series. The game would later be credited with popularizing the tactical role-playing genre in general.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, the {{new film}} studio Photo Chemical Laboratories, known as P.C.L. (which later became the major studio, Toho), advertised for {{assistant}} directors. Although he had demonstrated no previous interest in film as a profession, Kurosawa submitted the required essay, which asked applicants to discuss the fundamental deficiencies of Japanese films and <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to overcome them. His half-mocking view was that if the deficiencies were fundamental, {{there was no way}} to correct them. Kurosawa's essay earned him a call to take the follow-up exams, and director Kajirō Yamamoto, who was among the examiners, took a liking to Kurosawa and insisted that the studio hire him. The 25-year-old Kurosawa joined P.C.L. in February 1936.|$|E
5|$|The {{final draft}} of Compton's November 1941 report {{made no mention}} of using plutonium, but after {{discussing}} the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He proposed a schedule to achieve a controlled nuclear chain reaction by January 1943, and to have an atomic bomb by January 1945.|$|E

In the 1960s Weinberg also pursued new missions for ORNL, such as using nuclear energy to desalinate seawater. He recruited Philip Hammond from the Los Alamos National Laboratory to further this mission and in 1970 started the first big ecology project in the United States: the National Science Foundation— Research Applied to National Needs Environmental Program.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of fresh supplies, Hurdt and Amangkurat were emboldened to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to cross the river. Forces led by Dutch {{commander}} Isaac de Saint Martin drove Trunajaya's forces from Manukan, {{on the west bank}} further south from Singkal. They tried to cross the river there, but were unsuccessful due to heavy opposing fire and the depth of the water. They made another attempt on the night of 6–7 November, but their boats were sunk and it failed too. Hurdt was frustrated by the lack of progress, and gave Amangkurat an ultimatum that the VOC would withdraw unless the king supplied pontoons for the crossing, and matches for its soldiers's matchlocks.|$|E

5|$|Despite these efforts, on 21February {{it became}} clear just how {{fundamentally}} opposed the groups were. Philip Nye, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a prescription for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in {{the unity of the}} church, the Assembly continued to try to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement {{with the rest of the}} Assembly to Parliament, and on 11December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{up through}} 2012, Valve would {{manually}} select games {{to be included}} on the Steam service, generally limiting these to games that either had a major developer supporting them, or smaller studios with proven track records for Valve's purposes. Valve have sought ways to enable more games to be offered through Steam, while pulling away from manually approving games for the service, short of validating that a game runs on the platforms the publisher had indicated. Alden Kroll, {{a member of the}} Steam development team, said that Valve knows Steam is in a near-monopoly for game sales on personal computers, and the company {{does not want to be}} in a position to determine what gets sold, and thus had tried to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to make the process of adding games to Steam outside of their control. At the same time, Valve recognized that unfettered control of games onto the service can lead to discovery problems as well as low-quality games that are put onto the service for a cash grab.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{had many}} jobs as he {{attempted}} to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to support his cricket, family and lifestyle. At various time, {{he worked as a}} teacher, a journalist and a cricket coach. For many years, he was employed as Lancashire's assistant secretary but such were his financial worries that he often had to ask for cash advances from the committee, with which he had a stormy relationship. He worked for several years as private secretary to K. S. Ranjitsinhji and he became involved in his employer's financial scandals. Many of MacLaren's later business ventures were failures, and only when his wife came into an inheritance did he and his family live in comfort. Throughout his life, MacLaren was involved in many disagreements and was never popular with teammates. However, he was a hero to the cricket writer Neville Cardus, who wrote prolifically on him. MacLaren died in 1944, aged 72.|$|E

5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac {{so that it would}} produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and is proving to be a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States.

Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule that had been the norm since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly, but he wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred James G. Blaine to John Sherman. Even so, Conkling and John A. Logan began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When the convention convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to capture the nomination.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. On 20 December 1941, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, the objective of which was to produce reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, to <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to chemically separate plutonium from the uranium, and ultimately to design and build an atomic bomb. This became the Manhattan Project. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several different but promising design concepts.|$|E
