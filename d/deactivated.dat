40|$|This {{research}} {{examines how}} media-induced consumer activation level affects consumer response to highly energetic commercials. Over six studies, including a Hulu field experiment, the authors report that consumers who are experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion (e. g., sadness induced by a movie) {{find it more}} difficult to watch highly energetic commercials compared with consumers who are not experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion. As a result, consumers experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion are less likely to watch highly energetic commercials and recall the advertiser compared with consumers who are not experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion. The authors do not observe these effects when consumers experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion watch commercials that are moderately energetic or when consumers do not experience a <b>deactivating</b> emotion. These findings suggest that when advertisers run commercials in a media context that induces a <b>deactivating</b> emotion (e. g., sadness, relaxation, contentment), they should avoid running highly energetic commercials (e. g., with upbeat, enthusiastic spokespeople). In addition, this research recommends that when advertisers are unable to determine the emotions induced by the media context, they should run commercials that are moderate in energy. The results of a metaanalysis across the present studies show that consumers experiencing a <b>deactivating</b> emotion will respond as much as 50 % more favorably to moderately energetic commercials compared with highly energetic commercials...|$|R

50|$|The substituents on {{aromatic}} rings {{affect the}} rate of this electrophilic aromatic substitution. <b>Deactivating</b> groups such as other nitro groups have an electron-withdrawing effect. Such groups <b>deactivate</b> (slow) the reaction and directs the electrophilic nitronium ion to attack the aromatic meta position. <b>Deactivating</b> meta-directing substituents include sulfonyl, cyano groups, keto, esters, and carboxylates. Nitration can be accelerated by activating groups such as amino, hydroxy and methyl groups also amides and ethers resulting in para and ortho isomers.|$|R

30|$|For a link {{utilization}} decrease update, the Spine Switch Controller updates {{the link}} utilization and checks if the timer for <b>deactivating</b> Spine switches should start. The Spine Switch Controller has one timer for <b>deactivating</b> Spine switches and a timingmap (shown in line 6 & 9 in Algorithm 4, {{which is a}} list of Leaf switch IDs) to record the Leaf switches that satisfy the requirement of <b>deactivating</b> Spine switches. Only when all Leaf switches’ IDs are in timingmap, the Spine Switch Controller starts the timer for <b>deactivating</b> Spine switches. Then the Spine Switch Controller updates the information related with the timer for activating a Spine switch and switches OFF the timer if the requirement of activating is not satisfied any more.|$|R
30|$|When the {{controllers}} are numerous, {{instead of}} writing switching rules {{that may be}} conflicting (activate and <b>deactivate</b> a controller at the same instant), one can design, using H/BZR, a switching controller. This controller will decide the actions to perform on the controllers (activate, <b>deactivate)</b> and avoid conflicts.|$|R

40|$|Participants were 54 {{clients with}} serious {{psychiatric}} disorders and 21 clinical case managers. Clients 2 ̆ 7 serious psychiatric disorders included Axis I diagnoses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This study examined how attachment {{states of mind}} of both clients and case managers influenced the effectiveness of therapeutic relationships and client functioning. Client and case manager attachment states of mind interacted in predicting the working alliance and client functioning. Specifically, clients who were more <b>deactivating</b> with respect to attachment had better alliances and functioned better with less <b>deactivating</b> case managers, whereas clients who were less <b>deactivating</b> worked better with more <b>deactivating</b> case managers. These findings highlight the importance of clinicians and clients being matched in ways that balance their interpersonal and emotional strategies.

30|$|FUT-H and FUT-L {{are used}} for {{starting}} the timer for activating or <b>deactivating</b> decision making, respectively.

Tda is the time duration used for activating a Spine switch, while Tdd is the time duration used for <b>deactivating</b> one or more Spine switches.
