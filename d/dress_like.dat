5|$|A well-educated landowning aristocrat, Edwards {{deliberately}} cultivated {{the image}} of the natural leader. Thomas Ford writes that he continued to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> an 18th-century gentleman long after such fashions had gone out of style, and that his public speaking was marked by showy eloquence. Edwards consciously positioned himself in the select class of men who dominated Kentucky and, later, Illinois politics. In 1803 in Russellville, Edwards married Elvira Lane, a relative from Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The landed {{aristocracy}} of Spanish descent {{considered the}} illiterate, mixed-race gauchos, who comprised {{the majority of}} the population, to be ungovernable and untrustworthy. The gauchos were tolerated because there was no other labor force available, but were treated with contempt by the landowners. Rosas got along well with the gauchos in his service, despite his harsh and authoritarian comportment. He was known to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> them, joke with them, take part in their horse-play, and pay them well, but he never allowed them to forget that he was their master rather than their equal. Shaped by the colonial society in which he lived, Rosas was conservative, an advocate of hierarchy and authority, like the other great landowners in the region.|$|E

25|$|Baklas are {{homosexual}} Filipino men, but {{the concept}} of bakla identity does not map cleanly to Western male homosexuality. With baklas, as with other non-Western sexual minority groups, sexual identity is very closely related to gender identity. Baklas often assume female attributes and <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> women. They also use female terms for themselves and occasionally for their body parts, and are sometimes referred to and refer to themselves as not being “real men”.|$|E
25|$|Hardalim {{typically}} <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> {{most modern}} Orthodox religious Zionists would, but place a slightly larger emphasis on appearing neat, wearing their tzitzit {{out of their}} pants, and wearing a significantly larger yarmulke. Like other religious Zionists, they usually wear colored knitted yarmulkes. In contrast to Haredim, many Hardalim do not wear only white shirts or a black outfit, and {{only a handful of}} Hardalim wear a jacket and a hat; these are usually only worn by the highest levels of rabbinic leadership of the Hardal world.|$|E

25|$|Dunyasha – a housemaid. Like Lopakhin, she {{is another}} example of social {{mobility}} in Russia at the time. A peasant who is employed as the Gayev's chambermaid, Dunyasha is an attention seeker, making big scenes and dressing as a lady to show herself off. She is in some respects representative of the aristocracy's impotence, as a lowly chambermaid would not in the past have had the freedom to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> a lady and flirt with the manservants. Although pursued romantically by Yepikhodov, she is in love with Yasha, attracted to the culture he has picked up in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Almost a {{third of}} the group died of {{hardship}} and illness during the long journey. Upon their arrival in the Holy Land, they immediately went to Jerusalem. Within days, their leader, Rabbi Yehuda he-Hasid, died. They borrowed money from local Arabs {{for the construction of a}} synagogue but soon ran out of funds and borrowed more money at very high rates of interest (disputed). In 1720, when they were unable to repay their debts, Arab creditors broke into the synagogue, set it on fire, and destroyed their homes. The Jews fled the city and over the next century, any Jew dressed in Ashkenazi garb was a target of attack. Some of the Ashkenazi Jews who remained began to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> Sephardi Jews. One known example is Rabbi Abraham Gershon of Kitov.|$|E
500|$|According to Yorke, {{the first}} verse — [...] "I'll drown my beliefs / To have your babies / I'll <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> your niece / And wash your swollen feet" [...] — {{addresses}} the [...] "difference between young and old", when people {{grow out of}} childish behaviour; the narrator is offering not {{to grow up to}} keep someone they love. The lines [...] "And true love lives / On lollipops and crisps" [...] were inspired by a story Yorke read about a child who was left alone by his parents for days and survived by eating junk food. The song features a [...] "pleading" [...] refrain: [...] "Don't leave, don't leave." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's release {{coincided with}} a change in Nico's look, when she adopted {{what has been called}} a [...] "gothic horror princess" [...] persona and [...] "switched from dyed blonde to dark henna and started wearing black, heavy fabrics and boots". As a result, in {{addition}} to being a musical prototype for the goth subculture, Nico became a visual one as well. Claire Marie Healy wrote, [...] "Nico's visual statement of these years speaks of the power that comes with creating a new persona for yourself" [...] and she described the singer as [...] "the first ever goth girl". By the early 1980s, many women began to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> Nico; nicknamed [...] "Nico-teens", they were the first goth girls, encouraging a cult following for the singer.|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said that}} the most common {{complaint}} that he received about JC's Girls was [...] "the way Heather Veitch looks... her breasts are too big and she looks too much like a stripper", a complaint to which he responded that [...] "God can use any individual to change the world". Veitch said in 2008 that Christians commonly say that JC's Girls <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> sex workers, but she {{said that the}} look is intended to help women in the sex industry identify with the group. Annie Lobert of Hookers for Jesus, a similar group that collaborates with JC's Girls, said around the same time that Christians make the same kind of comments about her and her ministry—"They say my T-shirt is too tight", said Lobert, [...] "but, hey, when in Vegas, do as Vegas does".|$|E
500|$|The {{group was}} popular among rebellious youths, who were {{attracted}} to, as Asiaweek put it, [...] "the tone of alienation and frustration for which X was revered." [...] Their music {{was described by}} Asiaweek as having [...] "an angry sound that rejected the cookie-cutter principles of Japanese society." [...] In 1998, Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained [...] "In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase. They put their life into being X fans: they <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> it, they breathe it." [...] In the documentary Global Metal, Yoshiki stated that the music industry and media hated the band and would not even interview them, [...] "but eventually we sold 20 million albums, so they had no choice." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{wedding dress}} was a Vera Wang {{original}} dress from {{a while ago}} that I actually wore on a certain occasion and had it in storage and when {{we came up with}} the concept for the video that had the element of a wedding in it, I said, ‘well, I do have my old wedding dress,’. 'It’s still worth [...] for me ’cause I can’t believe I was ever married but whatever, end of story. And I knew that we wouldn’t {{be able to get a}} fabulous <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> in two days so I just took that dress out of the storage – it has a 27-foot train and it was just all hand-beaded and stuff and so I figured we might as well get a use out of it.' ...|$|E
500|$|Like Salafists, Tabligh seek a [...] "separation {{in their}} daily life from the `impious` society that {{surrounded}} them". The only objective of Tabligh Jamaat, overtly stated in most sermons, is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. This involves a detailed orthopraxy: [...] "followers must <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> the Prophet, sleep as he did on the ground, on one's right side"; enter bathrooms leading with the left foot, but put pants on leading with the right foot; do not use a fork when eating, instead use your index finger, middle finger and thumb; men shave their upper lips, but let their beards grow; their pants or robes should be above the ankle [...] "because the prophet said letting clothes drag {{on the ground is}} a sign of arrogance".|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s Kirchherr and her art school friends were {{involved}} in the European existentialist movement whose followers were later nicknamed [...] "Exis" [...] by Lennon. In 1995 she told BBC Radio Merseyside: [...] "Our philosophy then, because we were only little kids, was wearing black clothes and going around looking moody. Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get. England was so far away, and America was out of the question. So France was the nearest. So we got all the information from France, and we tried to <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> the French existentialists... We wanted to be free, we wanted to be different, and tried to be cool, as we call it now." ...|$|E

500|$|Buffy the Vampire Slayer {{developed}} an enthusiastic fan following while it aired. Following its series finale, fans continued their appreciation in theater showings of [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] where attendees {{are encouraged to}} <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> the show's characters, sing along to the musical numbers, and otherwise interact {{in the style of}} The Rocky Horror Picture Show. Clinton McClung, a New York-based film programmer, got the idea for a sing-along from audience-participation showings of The Sound of Music in 2003. The next year, he began putting on sing-alongs to [...] "Once More, with Feeling" [...] in Boston's Coolidge Corner Theater, which became so popular that it went on the road. Audience members received props to use during key scenes, as well as directions (for example, to yell [...] "Shut up, Dawn!" [...] at Buffy's younger sister), and a live cast performed the episode alongside the screen.|$|E
500|$|Not all {{the songs}} from the album explore social issues. The songs [...] "I Wanna Be Your Lush" [...] and [...] "Too Famous" [...] use satire to criticise the {{superior}} attitudes of male musicians, while [...] "Husband" [...] disapproves [...] "gruff and pushy" [...] boyfriends. The band also clarified that they have nothing against men. As Rootes notes, [...] "Men are great! We love them! We're talking about dickhead men, not all men." [...] The band considered themselves more of a pro-girl band than a feminist band. Rootes told Select: [...] "So many girls are afraid to be girls. Apart from Courtney Love, who's really feminine and uses her sexuality and is a strong woman. I don't think women should <b>dress</b> <b>like</b> boys. That's what's great about PJ Harvey. She was boyish and now she's gone really glam. She looks amazing and she's become an icon: a real woman." ...|$|E
500|$|Glee costume {{designer}} Lou Eyrich described Rachel's costuming {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Originally, the inspiration for her look was Tracy Flick from Election—very buttoned-down, preppy, obnoxious, squeaky clean, nerdy. But she's got at least 12 costume changes each episode. That same look all the time just gets boring for the screen and for the actress to wear, so we spread it out a lot. We try to have her buttoned-up or wearing a nerdy sweater over a cute <b>dress,</b> <b>like</b> she doesn't quite get it right. Or she takes that sweater and tucks it into the skirt and pairs it with knee highs and flats. She makes it her way, which is more quirky. The popular girls {{find a way to make}} it look cool, but Rachel makes it look nerdy. But it's not old-school nerdy with thick glasses and pocket protectors. She thinks she's taking a trend and making it cool, but she wears it wrong." ...|$|E
