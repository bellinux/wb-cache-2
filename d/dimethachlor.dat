40|$|A {{method for}} the {{determination}} of micro-herbicides (metsufuron-methyl, simazine, atrazine, simetryn, dimethachior, dipropetryn, propanil) in water has been developed by solid phase extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. No special sample pretreatment was applied. It is only need to 45 min to analysis a sample. The detection limit obtained was lower than 0. 1 mug/L. This method saves much time in sample preparation than that consumed by liquid-liquid extraction (60 fold) and off-line SPE (20 fold), and {{is more effective than}} the other methods. By using this method atrazine (1. 9 mug/L) and <b>dimethachlor</b> (1. 64 mug/L) have been detected in surface water...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePesticides {{residues}} in aquatic {{ecosystems are}} an environmental concern which requires efficient analytical methods. In this study, {{we proposed a}} generic method for the quantification of 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, clomazone, diflufenican, <b>dimethachlor,</b> carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl) in three environmental matrices. Pesticides from water were extracted using a solid phase extraction system and a single solid-liquid extraction method was optimized for sediment and fish muscle, followed by a unique analysis by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Limits of quantification were below 5 ng L− 1 for water (except for fluroxypyr and iprodion) and ranged between 0. 1 ng g− 1 and 57. 7 ng g− 1 for sediments and regarding fish, were below 1 ng g− 1 for 8 molecules and were determined between 5 and 49 ng g− 1 for the 5 other compounds. This method was finally used as a new routine practice for environmental research...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePesticide {{residues}} in fish muscle are {{an environmental}} and a health safety concern which requires analytical methods presenting high sensitivity and low limits of quantification. In this study, adapted QuEChERS method, coupled to liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (Scheduled MRM- 5500 QTRAP), {{was developed to}} quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, clomazone, diflufenican, <b>dimethachlor,</b> carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl) in muscle of fish. Quantification limits were below 1 ng g− 1 except for clomazone (1. 8 ng g− 1) and quizalofop (7. 4 ng g− 1). Best recoveries were observed for perch (> 80 %) and roach (> 68 %), except for thifensulfuron-methyl. Lower recoveries had been observed for carp (6 % to 86 %). Relative standard deviation was lower than 28 % for intra-day and 29 % for inter-day analysis, respectively. This method was successfully tested on three fish species, naturally or orally exposed: roach (Rutilus rutilus), perch (Perca fluviatilis) and carp (Cyprinus carpio). Few levels were observed in fish naturally exposed, but carp and perch orally contaminated showed measurable levels in their muscles...|$|E
40|$|Different cruciferous weeds were {{drilled in}} autumn 2011 and 2012 {{in a field}} near Münster. Beside common species like hedge mustard (Sisymbrium officinale Scop.), shepherd`s purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris), pennycress (Thlaspiarvense), tall hedge mustard (Sisymbrium loeselii) and {{flixweed}} (Descurainia sophia), we tried to establish weeds that are not common on arable land in Germany until now. These were: Yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris), hoary cress (Lepidium draba) and Turkish rocket (Bunias orientalis). In autumn 2011 emergence of the sown weeds was poor. In {{the second year of}} experiment we got good emergence of the named weeds excluding hoary cress (Lepidium draba). In autumn 2011 and 2012 different herbicidecombinations were applied across the stripes. The best results were achieved with Colzor Trio (clomazone + <b>dimethachlor</b> + napropamid) which was applied in pre-emergence state, a spray sequence Butisan Gold (metazachlor + quinmerac + dimethenamid-P) applied in pre-emergence followed by Salsa (ethametsulfuronmethyl) + Trend (adjuvant) in post-emergence and Clearfield-Vantiga (metazachlor + quinmerac + imazamox) + Dash (adjuvant), also applied in post-emergence state of the weeds...|$|E
40|$|International audienceFish {{are often}} exposed to various {{molecules}} like pesticides. Some of these compounds get biomagnified within aquatic food web, inducing health hazards of consumers. However, behaviors of many pesticides are still unknown. This work aims {{to study the}} uptake {{and the elimination of}} some of them in muscle tissue of edible fish (azoxystrobin, clomazone, diflufenican, <b>dimethachlor,</b> carbendazim, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop, and thifensulfuron-methyl). Two freshwater fish species (Perca fluviatilis and Cyprinus carpio) were exposed to a mixture of these 13 pesticides, via multi-contaminated pellets, and then, eliminated. Compounds were measured in food, water and muscle tissue using multi-residues methods. Kinetics, biomagnification factors (BMFs) and half-lives (t 1 / 2) were estimated and they did not show a large difference between the species. Muscular BMFs ranged from 2 x 10 (- 6) (mesosulfuron-methyl in perch) to 1 x 10 (- 3) (isoproturon and napropamid in perch) and t 1 / 2 ranged from 0. 8 (mesosulfuronmethyl in perch) to 40. 3 d (napropamid in carp). BMFs were also modeled as a function of K-ow value. All BMF values were explained by the model, except for diflufenican which had a BMF lower than that expected by our modeling work, probably due to an efficient metabolism. Results led to the conclusion that none of these chemicals would probably be biomagnified within aquatic food webs...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResidues of {{pesticides}} in fish farming productions from barrage ponds are seldom studied {{in spite of}} increasing health questionings and environmental concerns. The {{purpose of this study}} is to establish the pesticide contamination profiles of sediments and edible fish from five ponds in Northeastern France. Multi-residues method and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis were used to quantify 13 pesticides (azoxystrobin, carbendazim, clomazone, diflufenican, <b>dimethachlor,</b> fluroxypyr, iprodion, isoproturon, mesosulfuron-methyl, metazachlor, napropamid, quizalofop and thifensulfuron-methyl). Ten sediments and 143 muscles samples were analysed, corresponding to two successive fishing campaigns (first fishing date and second fishing date (P 2), about 1 year later) on five sites (noted C- 0, C- 25, C- 45, C- 75 and C- 85 to express the increasing gradient of crop area). Isoproturon was present in all sediments samples (1. 8 - 56. 4 mu g/kg dry weight). During P 2 period, carbendazim was quantified in the fish of site C- 0 (0. 09 +/- 0. 02, 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 17 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg wet weight (ww) for roach, carp and perch, respectively). Metazachlor was only quantified in perch of the site C- 25 (0. 13 +/- 0. 02 mu g/kg ww). Concentrations of isoproturon were similar for the sites C- 45 and C- 75 with 0. 4 +/- 0. 1 and 0. 75 +/- 0. 06 mu g/kg ww for carp and perch, respectively. Contamination of fish reflected generally concentrations in surroundings. Isoproturon was the most concentrated and its main source was water for perch while carp was exposed through both water and sediments, highlighting their life strategies in pond...|$|E
40|$|A two-factorial field {{experiment}} should reveal {{the performance of}} Clearfield® oilseed rape under different cropping intensities. The experiment was conducted at the experimental station Ihinger Hof in 2014, with cropping intensity as factor 1 and herbicide strategy as factor 2, all treatments sown with variety PT 228 CL. Treatments of cropping intensities were “normal sowing” (NS; soil inversion tillage tillage, 50 seeds m- 2, 12 cm row spacing), “reduced sowing density” (DS; soil inversion tillage, 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing) and striptill (ST; 25 seeds m- 2, 25 cm row spacing). The two herbicide strategies were pre-emergence strategy (VAS; application of Colzor® Trio (30 g L- 1 Clomazone, 187. 5 g L- 1 <b>Dimethachlor,</b> 187. 5 g L- 1 Napropamide) one day after sowing and of Agil® S (100 g/L Propaquizafop) 3. 5 weeks after sowing) and Clearfield® strategy (CLS; application of Clearfield®-Vantiga® (375 g L- 1 Metazachlor, 125 g L- 1 Quinmerac, 6. 25 g L- 1 Imazamox) and Dash® E. C. (345 g L- 1 fatty acid methyl ester, 205 g L- 1 fatty alcohol alkoxylates, 46 g L- 1 oleic acid) at {{the same day as}} Agil® S). NS resulted in the highest yield (3. 9 t ha- 1) which was significantly more than obtained by ST (3. 6 t ha- 1), the least-yielding intensity. There were no significant interactions of the effects. Weed density was highest in DS/CLS and ST/CLS with 12. 8 and 13. 9 plants m- 2, respectively, and thus the two to threefold of the other treatments. The results indicate a lack of efficacy of Clearfield®-Vantiga® under the presumably higher weed pressure in DS and ST, specifically in controlling the weeds Stellaria media and volunteer cereals (in this case: Hordeum vulgare). An economic evaluation will follow...|$|E
