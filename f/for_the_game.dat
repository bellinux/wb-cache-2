It also removed elements from the Final Fantasy series, which had been placed in the original game {{as a part of the}} marketing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> before its sequels moved to be a distinct series.|$|E

In creating the painting, Moss emulated National Park Service posters from the New Deal era in both color palette and iconography. The development team went on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park for inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> where they visited a lookout tower built with the same design as its video game counterpart. Further inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> came from Vanaman and Anderson's experiences growing up in rural Wyoming.|$|E
