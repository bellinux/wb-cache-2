40|$|This work {{focuses on}} {{learning}} {{the structure of}} Markov networks. Markov networks are parametric models for compactly representing complex probability distributions. These models are composed by: a structure and numerical weights. The structure describes in-dependences that hold in the distribution. Depending on the goal of learning intended by the user, structure learning algorithms can be divided into: density estimation algorithms, focusing on learning structures for answering inference queries; and knowledge discovery algorithms, focusing on learning structures for describing <b>independences</b> qualitatively. The latter algorithms present an important limitation for describing <b>independences</b> as they use a single graph, a coarse grain representation of the structure. However, many practical distributions present a flexible type of <b>independences</b> called context-specific <b>independences,</b> which cannot be described by a single graph. This work presents an approach for overcoming this limitation by proposing an alternative representation of the structure that named canonical model; and a novel knowledge discovery algorithm called CSPC for learning canonical models by using as constraints context-specific in-dependences present in data.

40|$|Building higher-dimensional copulas is {{generally}} {{recognized as a}} difficult problem. Regular-vines using bivariate copulas provide a flexible class of high-dimensional dependency models. In large dimensions, the drawback of the model is the exponentially increasing complexity. Recognizing some of the conditional <b>independences</b> is a possibility for {{reducing the number of}} levels of the pair-copula decomposition, and hence to simplify its construction Aas et al (2009). The idea of using conditional <b>independences</b> was already performed under elliptical copula assumptions Hanea, Kurowicka and Cooke (2006), Kurowicka and Cooke (2002) {{and in the case of}} DAGs in a recent work Bauer, Czado and Klein (2011). We provide a method which uses some of the conditional <b>independences</b> encoded by the Markov network underlying the variables. We give a theorem which under some graph conditions makes possible to derive pair-copula decomposition of the probability density function associated to a Markov network. As the underlying Markov network is usually unknown, we first have to discover it from the sample data. Using our results published in Szantai and Kovacs (2008) and Kovacs and Szantai (2010 a) we will show how to derive a multidimensional copula model exploiting the information on conditional <b>independences</b> hidden in the sample data.
