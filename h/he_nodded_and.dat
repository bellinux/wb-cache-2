2500|$|... "So I {{went back}} to Hughes, and told him I'd been able to persuade Hecht to do his script; I told him Ben's terms, - $1,000 per day - and Howard didn't blink an eye. <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Okay-it's a deal. But you tell Hecht I want a real tough shoot-'em up script that'll knock the {{audience}} out of its seats, okay?' ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E
2500|$|Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for {{the first}} time at Mumbai's Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954, on Peck's {{stopover}} from a schedule at Sri Lanka after shooting for The Purple Plain. He knew of the [...] "Indian Star" [...] as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E
60|$|Seeing the {{pleasure}} in his daughter's face, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> reassuringly <b>and</b> left her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{approbation}} <b>and</b> {{reached for}} the second bottle. He drank and meditated, and drank again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> pleasantly, <b>and</b> {{was about}} to pass up the stairs when Mrs. Ricket called him back.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{walked away}} before Bateman could say another word.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{resumed his}} chair. His {{unexpected}} politeness gave her courage.|$|E
60|$|Someone {{whispered into}} the captain's ear, whereon <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> laughed savagely.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> approval, <b>and</b> remarked sententiously {{that the}} desire to possess a wife was common to all men.|$|R
60|$|To him {{the woman}} looked, praying {{him with her}} eyes. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> reluctantly <b>and</b> turned toward the door.|$|R
60|$|The {{extraordinary}} boy replied not a word; but <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> once, <b>and</b> seemed, to the clerk's imagination, to snore feebly.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> untucked {{the napkin}} {{he had already}} {{arranged}} over his waistcoat.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{winked at}} me. A wicked-looking old fellow; just the man I wanted.|$|E
60|$|When Ripple {{told what}} she was looking for, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> pointed to the gloomy sky.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don Benito," [...] whispered he, [...] "I {{am glad to}} {{see this}} usher-of-the-golden-rod of yours; the sight refutes an ugly remark once made to me by a Barbadoes planter; that when a mulatto has a regular European face, look out for him; he is a devil. But see, your steward here has {{features}} more regular than King George's of England; <b>and</b> yet there <b>he</b> <b>nods,</b> <b>and</b> bows, and smiles; a king, indeed--the king of kind hearts and polite fellows. What a pleasant voice he has, too?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean of {{your own}} relations, sir," [...] said Mary, well used to the old man's way of speech. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> {{slightly}} <b>and</b> she went on.|$|R
60|$|She {{then asked}} whether {{he was going to}} Nukuheva; <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> yes; <b>and</b> with a plaintive wail, her eyes filling with tears, she rose and left him.|$|R
60|$|Lingard {{did not see}} {{the covert}} glances of respect {{tempered}} by irony; <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> passed on.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{though she}} had scored her point {{she could not see}} that it had any {{material}} bearing after all.|$|E
60|$|Happy Jack didn't know, for {{he never}} had been near enough to see, but <b>he</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> Tommy Tit went on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, and arrant {{babblers}} at home. In few words, Babbalanja, you espouse a bad cause. Most of you mortals are peacocks; some having tails, {{and some}} not; {{those who have}} them will be sure to thrust their plumes in your face; for the rest, they will display their bald cruppers, and still screech for admiration. But when a great genius is born into Mardi, <b>he</b> <b>nods,</b> <b>and</b> is known." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> kindly <b>and</b> rejoined his friends. The Inspector {{resumed his}} seat and busied himself with relighting his cigar. He {{purposely}} did not even glance at his companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "An' we {{anchored}} {{right out}} here {{when we took}} that treasure ashore! I remember it as well if it was yesterday!" [...] <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> over <b>and</b> over again.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> Christian {{read the}} letter, leaving out {{the mention of}} Harz, and for some {{undefined}} reason the part about Sarelli.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} said nothing, but <b>he</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> {{throwing off}} his black coat, {{set to work}} vigorously rubbing down his travel-stained horse.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> {{advanced}} with her, {{leading the}} horses, {{for he had}} dismounted, to meet Mr. Dove at the opening in the fence.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> to me, <b>and</b> bared {{his white}} head gallantly to Mrs Ford.|$|R
60|$|And Porportukâ€™s eyes watered as <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> {{his head}} <b>and</b> smacked his lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mentioned, to the Sirdar, {{that you}} wanted a fortnight's leave, and told him why. <b>He</b> simply <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Let him have a month, if he wants it.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> <b>and</b> left her. The face of Perry looked unutterable {{things when}} he and Geoffrey met {{at the door of}} the cottage.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>nodded.</b> <b>And</b> {{she took}} him from room to room. His eyes looked quickly and curiously over everything, noticing things, but without criticism.|$|E
60|$|Captain Graffenreid understood: {{the sounds}} were musketry and artillery. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> tried to smile. There was {{apparently}} nothing infectious in the smile.|$|E
60|$|There was a second's pause. His {{right hand}} was half {{extended}} but his departing guest {{seemed not to}} notice the fact. <b>He</b> merely <b>nodded</b> <b>and</b> put on his hat.|$|R
60|$|Bellamy {{was indeed}} {{crossing}} the room. <b>He</b> <b>nodded</b> to Laverick <b>and</b> bowed to his companion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good for you, boy!" [...] {{said one}} of the customers, as he {{followed}} Matt out upon the sidewalk. [...] "Always stick up for your rights," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> pleasantly <b>and</b> passed on.|$|R
