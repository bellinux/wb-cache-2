5|$|Day {{continued}} {{to take on}} challenging and difficult projects. He had already printed the first English book of church music in 1560. In 1567, Matthew Parker, the Archbishop of Canterbury, commissioned Day to print a collection of writings attributed to the tenth-century Aelfric of Eynsham. For this work, Day, known for his fine and varied fonts, had the first-ever font of Anglo-Saxon type cut. The cost was borne by Parker, perhaps Day's most important patron. The font may have been designed by François Guyot, a French type-founder known to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> Day and lived in his household. Day used the same font to print Lambarde's Archaionomia (a collection of Anglo-Saxon laws) in 1568. In 1570, he printed Billingsley and Dee's English Euclid, which included folding and movable diagrams—one of the first printed books ever to do so. In the same year, he printed Ascham's Scholemaster.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 {{the sons}} of Miguel Vázquez were {{introduced}} to the wrestling world as Espanto IV and Espanto V, forming a regular tag team in and around Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The duo lost their masks to the team of Blue Fish and Mongol Chino, although the team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. is also credited with unmasking them. It is possible that Espanto IV and V agreed to lose their masks to both teams, but in different locations in Mexico. Before the internet there were examples of luchadors getting an additional payment for losing their mask on multiple occasions. The brothers <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> various Mexican promotions and toured Japan while working for the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation and Michinoku Pro. In Japan they unsuccessfully challenged the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.|$|E

25|$|Until Continental Airlines began nonstop {{flights to}} Lagos from George Bush Intercontinental Airport in November 2011, many Nigerians {{had to fly}} through Europe to travel between Texas and Nigeria. Jenalia Moreno of the Houston Chronicle said that the Nigerian {{community}} and the energy companies in Houston <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> {{a long time to}} get a flight to Nigeria from this city. In 2016 United Airlines canceled the Lagos route, citing a decline in the energy industry and inability to get currency out of Nigeria.|$|E
25|$|The equal {{participation}} in the construction, implementation, verification and countersignature of the agreements reached in the Dialogues of Havana are subject of concern of women's organizations that historically <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> peace and {{human rights in the}} country. The Red de Mujeres (1995), the Ruta Pacífica (1996), and the Iniciativa de Mujeres por la Paz (2002) are some platforms that have targeted, among other issues, to the bilateral cease of fire, demilitarization of civil life, equitable land distribution, respect for human body, justice and differential approaches.|$|E
25|$|Hastert's office concedes, {{in its own}} chronology, {{that his}} top staffers Mike Stokke (deputy chief of staff), Ted Van Der Meid (legal counsel) and a lower placed {{assistant}} named Tim Kennedy were told about the Foley emails by Rep.

25|$|Loeb's journalism résumé was {{the subject}} of {{skepticism}} in 1974, when he claimed in a front-page editorial to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> the Hearst conglomerate, as a reporter for the New York World for eight years before buying his St. Albans paper. Hearst Corporation denied he had ever been employed there, and the World had actually ceased operations eight years before Loeb said he had started work there. Toledo Blade chairman Paul Block, Jr. also denied ever seeing Loeb on the assignments he claimed to have worked.|$|E

25|$|The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 {{requires}} {{employers to}} provide job-protected unpaid leave for certain {{family and medical}} reasons. Legitimate reasons include pregnancy, childbirth, adoption, foster care placement, and care for an ill family member. However, this legislation is limited: coverage is only extended for twelve weeks and for employees who <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> at least twelve months at the same job. Short-term medical illness and routine medical checkups were not covered until the FMLA, and family members other than parents, spouses, and children are not covered. Some states have extended the definition of family on their own, and therefore extended the coverage of FMLA.|$|E
25|$|Notes in the Mitrokhin Archive {{claim that}} more than half of the Soviet Union's weapons are based on US designs, that the KGB tapped Henry Kissinger's {{telephone}} when he was US Secretary of State, and had spies in place in almost all US defense contractor facilities. In France, some 35 senior politicians were alleged to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> the KGB during the Cold War. In West Germany, the KGB was said to have infiltrated the major political parties, the judiciary, and the police. Large-scale sabotage preparations were supposedly made against the US, Canada and elsewhere in case of war, including hidden weapons caches; several have been removed or destroyed by police relying on Mitrokhin's information.|$|E
25|$|I {{am proud}} of what I did and would do it again. Jasenovac was a legal {{institution}} based on law, where all those proved to <b>have</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> {{the destruction of the}} Croatian state, and who had been dangerous for public order and safety, were interned. Considering the duration and population of the camp, the death rate was natural and normal. If we shot people, we did it {{on the basis of the}} law. There are no states in the world that don't have prisons and camps, and somebody has to perform this thankless duty. I regret that we hadn't done all that is imputed to us, for, had we done that then, today Croatia would not have had problems. There wouldn't have been people to write these lies.|$|E
