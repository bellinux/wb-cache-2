50|$|Mill finish {{refers to}} the surface texture (or finish) of metal after it exits a rolling mill, {{extrusion}} die, or drawing processes, including sheet, bar, plate, or structural shapes. This texture is usually rough and lacks lustre; it may have spots of oxidation or contamination with mill oil. Most mill finish surfaces are machined or treated with polishing, <b>industrial</b> <b>etching,</b> or some other surface finishing process before they are considered complete.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical milling or <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> is the {{subtractive}} manufacturing process of using baths of temperature-regulated etching chemicals to remove material {{to create an}} object with the desired shape. [...] It is mostly used on metals, though other materials are increasingly important. It was developed from armor-decorating and printing etching processes developed during the Renaissance as alternatives to engraving on metal. The process essentially involves bathing the cutting areas in a corrosive chemical known as an etchant, which reacts with the material {{in the area to}} be cut and causes the solid material to be dissolved; inert substances known as maskants are used to protect specific areas of the material as resists.|$|E
5000|$|Etching {{processes}} use a resist, {{though in}} these typically the whole object {{is covered in}} the resist (called the [...] "ground" [...] in some contexts), which is then selectively removed from some parts. This is the case when a resist is used to prepare the copper substrate for champlevé enamels, where parts of the field are etched (with acid or electrically) into hollows {{to be filled with}} powdered glass, which is then melted. [...] In chemical milling, as many forms of <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> are called, the resist may be referred to as the [...] "maskant", and in many contexts the process may be known as masking. A fixed resist pre-shaped with the pattern is often called a stencil, or in some contexts a frisket.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — For the {{optimization}} of plasma—etching a {{basic knowledge}} of the plasma processes involved is often required. Considering the <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> needs {{and an understanding of}} the various etching mechanisms, the efforts of plasma research can be directed to the related plasma DrOperties. Since there exist already numerous reactor types using vastly different plasmas as discussed in paragraph 1. 3, a general discussion of the plasma physics involved is not possible. As topics the formation of sheath potentials in an RF discharge and the electron energy distribution of a CF 4 plasma are more extensively discussed, since these dominate the ion fluxes. Diagnostics like mass spectroscopy, emission! absorption spectroscopy and electron density measurements lead {{to a better understanding of}} the plasma and may also serve industrial needs like e. g. end point detection. 1...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper reviews recent {{progress}} {{in the development of}} time-resolved diagnostics to probe high-density pulsed plasma sources. We focus on time-resolved measurements of radicals' densities in the afterglow of pulsed discharges to provide useful information on production and loss mechanisms of free radicals. We show that broad-band absorption spectroscopy in the ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet spectral domain and threshold ionization modulated beam mass spectrometry are powerful techniques for the determination of the time variation of the radicals' densities in pulsed plasmas. The combination of these complementary techniques allows detection of most of the reactive species present in <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> plasmas, giving insights into the physico-chemistry reactions involving these species. As an example, we discuss briefly the radicals' kinetics in the afterglow of a SiCl 4 /Cl 2 /Ar discharge...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year, Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The {{objective}} of this project has been to develop a fundamental understanding of dusty plasmas at the Laboratory. While dusty plasmas are found in space in galactic clouds, planetary rings, and cometary tails, and as contaminants in plasma enhanced fabrication of microelectronics, many of their properties are only partially understood. Our work has involved both theoretical analysis and self-consistent plasma simulations to understand basic properties of dusty plasmas related to equilibrium, stability, and transport. Such an understanding can improve the control and elimination of plasma dust in industrial applications and may be important {{in the study of}} planetary rings and comet dust tails. We have applied our techniques to the study of charging, dynamics, and coagulation of contaminants in plasma processing reactors for <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> and deposition processes and to instabilities in planetary rings and other space plasma environments. The work performed in this project has application to plasma kinetics, transport, and other classical elementary processes in plasmas as well as to plasma waves, oscillations, and instabilities...|$|E

50|$|Cleaning is the preparatory {{process of}} {{ensuring}} that the surface to be etched is free of contaminants which could negatively impact {{the quality of the}} finished part. An improperly cleaned surface could result in poor adhesion of the maskant, causing areas to be etched erroneously, or a non-uniform etch rate which could result in inaccurate final dimensions. The surface must be kept free from oils, grease, primer coatings, markings and other residue from the marking out process, scale (oxidation), and any other foreign contaminants. For most metals, this step can be performed by applying a solvent substance to the surface to be etched, washing away foreign contaminants. The material may also be immersed in alkaline cleaners or specialized de-oxidizing solutions. It is common practice in modern <b>industrial</b> chemical <b>etching</b> facilities that the workpiece never be directly handled after this process, as oils from human skin could easily contaminate the surface.|$|R
40|$|Dielectric etching plasma {{processes}} for modern interlevel dielectrics {{become more and}} more complex by the introduction of new ultra low-k dielectrics. One challenge is the minimization of sidewall damage, while etching ultra low-k porous SiCOH by fluorocarbon plasmas. The optimization of this process requires {{a deeper understanding of the}} concentration of the CF 2 radical, which acts as precursor in the polymerization of the etch sample surfaces. In an <b>industrial</b> dielectric <b>etching</b> plasma reactor, the CF 2 radical was measured in situ using a continuous wave quantum cascade laser (cw-QCL) around 1106. 2 cm(- 1). We measured Doppler-resolved ro-vibrational absorption lines and determined absolute densities using transitions in the nu(3) fundamental band of CF 2 with the aid of an improved simulation of the line strengths. We found that the CF 2 radical concentration during the etching plasma process directly correlates to the layer structure of the etched wafer. Hence, this correlation can serve as a diagnostic tool of dielectric etching plasma processes. Applying QCL based absorption spectroscopy opens up the way for advanced process monitoring and etching controlling in semiconductor manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|Broad-beam ion {{sources are}} used {{for a number of}} {{important}} <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> and deposition applications, and the use of inductively coupled plasmas has greatly increased the feasibility of using beams of reactive gases, especially of chlorine and oxygen, but also of CO, CO 2, CF 4, CHF 3, SF 6, etc. In order to gain more understanding of the factors that affect the composition of beams of these gases, we have used a Hiden energy-dispersive quadrupole mass spectrometer to analyze the flux of ions and energetic particles produced by an Oxford Instruments 15 cm rf ion source. For all of the above gases, we have analyzed the effects of changing the operating conditions on the composition of the ion beam, and the fractional production of multiply charged ions; on the plasma potential (and the consequential divergence of the ion beam) and on the spread in energy of the ion beam. We discuss how these factors influence the correct use of the ion source in etching applications with these gases. It is important that the design of the ion source should be optimized for the process gases that are used. The source was originally optimized for use on argon. We discuss the effect of the design on the source's performance with the different gases, and we consider whether design changes would be appropriate for optimum performance on different gases.

40|$|Gallium arsenide, a {{compound}} semiconductor {{commonly used in}} optoelectronic devices, is often subjected to wet etching techniques during microelectronic device manufacture. In this work, the wet chemical etching of gallium arsenide in $ rm H sb 2 O sb 2 $-$ rm NH sb 4 OH$-H$ sb 2 $O solutions was studied using a batch stirred-tank reactor. A kinetic control regime was established {{and the influence of}} each component's concentration on the intrinsic etch rate was determined. The reaction rate was found, in the presence of excess NH$ sb 4 $OH, to fit a rate equation, r = k (H$ rm sb 2 O sb 2 rbrack sp{ 0. 75 }$ at 15, 25, and 40 $ sp circ$C with an activation energy of 33. 7 kJ/mol. Using NaOH instead of NH$ sb 4 $OH resulted in greatly reduced reaction rates, and it was concluded that the presence of the ammonium ion increases the rate by forming soluble compounds with oxidized species of Ga and As. When mass transfer resistances are introduced, using a flow reactor to simulate an <b>industrial</b> <b>etching</b> apparatus, the reaction rates are considerably reduced and the rate's dependence on $ rm H sb 2 O sb 2 $ concentration is shifted closer to linear. Convective mass transfer expressions for flow past a flat plate were successfully used to predict the etch rate. The two reactors were used to etch samples masked by a circuit pattern, and the crystallography of GaAs dictated the shape of the etch profiles rather than the mass transfer limitations of the system...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} strength of silicon wafers {{is a very}} important parameter to assure the processing of the wafers throughout the whole solar cell production chain without breaking. Micro-cracks at the edges and {{on the surface of the}} wafers are well known to limit their {{mechanical strength}}. In the present work, the micro-cracks removal capability of an <b>industrial</b> standard <b>etching</b> solution and its impact on the mechanical strength of monocrystalline silicon wafers have been investigated. After 5 min etch, micro-cracks were removed or partially rounded and therefore the mechanical strength of the wafers increased by 39 % in comparison with the mechanical strength of as-cut and only cleaned wafers. Longer etching times did not increase the mechanical strength of the wafers significantly. The breaking micro-mechanism of silicon under the four-line bending test has been identified by the analysis of fracture surfaces by SEM microscopy. Micro-crack propagation is detected at fracture origins leading to the cleaving of the { 111 } and { 110 } crystallographic planes. Micro-cracks and surface irregularities where crack propagation starts, seem to show the tendency to be oriented through the { 111 } and { 100 } crystallographic planes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{dependence}} of electron density and ion flux on radiofrequency (RF) {{power has been}} measured in a 2 27 &# 8201;MHz dual-frequency capacitive discharge with silicon electrodes at 6. 7 &# 8201;Pa gas pressure. In Ar/O 2 mixtures the electron density and the ion flux vary in a very similar way (i. e. their ratio, &# 965;, is constant), in good agreement with the simple electropositive transport theory. Both 27 and 2 &# 8201;MHz RF powers {{have a significant effect}} on the plasma density and the ion flux. The effect of the 2 &# 8201;MHz power is likely a combination of enhanced plasma heating by dual-frequency excitation and ionization caused by secondary electron beams, which are known to be produced efficiently at oxidized silicon surfaces. In contrast, in Ar/C 4 F 8 /O 2 mixtures such as those used for <b>industrial</b> dielectric <b>etching,</b> &# 965; is always bigger than the theoretical electropositive value, and becomes very high when the ratio of 2 to 27 &# 8201;MHz power is high. Under these conditions the electron density is very small, whereas the ion flux remains considerable. We attribute the increased plasma transport to the presence of a significant density of F&# 8722; negative ions, combined with increased penetration of the 2 &# 8201;MHz electric field into the plasma bulk at high 2 / 27 &# 8201;MHz power ratios...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was the local {{identification}} {{and analysis of the}} physical properties of etch-induced defects in silicon subjected to conventional <b>industrial</b> dry chemical <b>etching</b> processes such as Reactive Ion Etching (RIE) and Reactive Ion Beam Etching (RIBE). As diagnostic tools the EBIC technique in a SEM and Atomic Force Microscopy have been employed using their superior properties of lateral resolution. It could be shown that the EBIC technique is a powerful tool for the investigation of the physical properties of defect, e. g. the recombination properties, even in the case when defects are located adjacent {{to the surface of the}} sample. Specimens after micropatterning can readily be studied by these techniques due to their high lateral resolution. Systematic investigations revealed that the geometrical etch profile and the profile corresponding to the damage are not identical, the lateral damage length was determined to be in the order of 300 nm to 500 nm. Investigations of the role of RIE etching parameters in defect formation revealed, that the dc selfbias voltage governs the density of the defects, the type of the defects - at least as far as their position in the bandgap is concerned - is not affected by the dc self bias.

40|$|The thesis uses {{surface science}} {{techniques}} to characterise the chemical composition and electronic properties {{of a range}} of carbon containing materials which have application in advanced semiconductor fabrication. The initial focus was on investigating the properties ofcarbon-doped oxide (CDO) which is a low dielectric constant material and a leading candidate to replace silicon dioxide (SiOz) as an interlayer dielectric (ILD) in microprocessor fabrication. The work then progresses to determine the optimum experimental conditions required to etch thin films of this material, while retaining the chemical composition, in an <b>industrial</b> fluorocarbon-based plasma <b>etching</b> (FBPE) system. This study was preceded by an investigation of how the chemical composition of a thin fluorocarbon films which forms on a surface in the plasma etcher depends on the C 4 Fs/Ar/Oz gas feed ratios and the power levels used in the processing. These studies were benchmarked by undertaking baseline studies of the plasma processing of conventional Si 02 inter layer dielectric material. The chemical composition of the fluorocarbon films and the CDO layers were analysed using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Synchrotron radiation based x-ray absorption spectroscopy GAS) and x-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) as well as resonant soft X-ray emission spectroscopy (RSXE) have been used to provide information on the valence band and conduction band state of both the CDO layers and the fluorocarbon films. The final part of the thesis consists of the measurement of the electronic structure of thin films of the organic semiconductor tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) and metal TPP. The carbon and nitrogen partial density of states for both the valence and conduction band electronic structure has been determined, as well as core level spectra.
