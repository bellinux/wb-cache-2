5|$|Aksum's {{currency}} {{served as}} a vessel of propaganda demonstrating the kingdom's wealth and promoting the national religion (first polytheistic and later Oriental Christianity). It also facilitated the Red Sea trade on which it thrived. The coinage has also proved <b>invaluable</b> in providing a reliable chronology of Aksumite kings {{due to the lack}} of extensive archaeological work in the area.|$|E
5|$|Chotiner was in {{many ways}} the most {{interesting}} personality in Nixon's political camp: aggressive, egocentric, a professional among amateurs, brilliant, overbearing, ruthless, engaging, habitually guilty of overkill, constantly enlarging his area of operation. Painted in sinister colors by the press, he was both a public relations problem for Nixon and an <b>invaluable</b> campaign strategist.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, local {{politics}} split over slavery as many had ties to Southern cotton. Despite ambivalence concerning the war, {{the number of}} military volunteers routinely exceeded quota, and the city's manufacturing proved <b>invaluable</b> to the Union. Providence thrived postwar, waves of immigrants and land annexations brought the population from 54,595 in 1865 to 175,597 by 1900.|$|E
5|$|Guizzi, Febo, 2002, Gli strumenti della musica popolare in Italia. <b>Invaluable</b> {{survey of}} popular {{instruments}} {{in use in}} Italy, ranging from percussion, wind and plucked instruments to various noise makers. Numerous drawings and plates. Wrappers. - Lucca : Alia Musica, 8. - 502 p.|$|E
5|$|However, Project Stormfury had {{positive}} results as well. Knowledge gained during flights proved <b>invaluable</b> in debunking its hypotheses. Other science {{resulted in a}} greater understanding of tropical cyclones. In addition, the Lockheed P-3's were perfectly suitable for gathering data on tropical cyclones, allowing improved forecasting of these monstrous storms. Those planes are still used by the NOAA today.|$|E
5|$|Many of the cannons {{and other}} weapons from the Mary Rose have {{provided}} <b>invaluable</b> physical evidence about 16th-century weapon technology. The surviving gunshields are almost {{all from the}} Mary Rose, and the four small cast iron hailshot pieces are the only known examples {{of this type of}} weapon.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{are useful}} in {{producing}} foods, treating waste water, creating biofuels and {{a wide range of}} chemicals and enzymes. They are <b>invaluable</b> in research as model organisms. They have been weaponised and sometimes used in warfare and bioterrorism. They are vital to agriculture through their roles in maintaining soil fertility and in decomposing organic matter.|$|E
5|$|Student from SIT {{overseas}} university (OU) programme must {{complete an}} on-campus immersion programme (spanning 3 to 12 weeks {{depending on the}} overseas university degree) at the home university – an overseas study experience that offers an <b>invaluable</b> opportunity for cultural exchanges with international students.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War brought renewed prosperity, despite {{extensive}} {{bombing of}} cities by the Luftwaffe. It saw {{the invention of}} radar by Robert Watson-Watt, which was <b>invaluable</b> in the Battle of Britain, as was the leadership at RAF Fighter Command of Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding.|$|E
5|$|The X-10 {{chemical}} separation plant also verified the Bismuth-phosphate process {{that was used}} in the full-scale separation facilities at Hanford. Finally, the reactor and {{chemical separation}} plant provided <b>invaluable</b> experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then moved on to the Hanford site.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of what {{is known}} of Caligula comes from Suetonius and Cassius Dio. Suetonius wrote his history on Caligula 80 years after his death, while Cassius Dio wrote his history over 180 years after Caligula's death. Cassius Dio's work is <b>invaluable</b> because it alone gives a loose {{chronology}} of Caligula's reign.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved <b>invaluable</b> - air and ground crews perfected their skills, and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and <b>invaluable</b> training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E
5|$|Fleming proved <b>invaluable</b> as Godfrey's {{personal}} assistant and excelled in administration. Godfrey {{was known as}} an abrasive character who made enemies within government circles. He frequently used Fleming as a liaison with other sections of the government's wartime administration, such as the Secret Intelligence Service, the Political Warfare Executive, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), the Joint Intelligence Committee and the Prime Minister's staff.|$|E
5|$|For over {{a century}} and a half, Montreal was the {{industrial}} and financial centre of Canada. This legacy has left a variety of buildings including factories, elevators, warehouses, mills, and refineries, that today provide an <b>invaluable</b> insight into the city's history, especially in the downtown area and the Old Port area. There are 50 National Historic Sites of Canada, more than any other city.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, most of {{the former}} Overhill sites were {{submerged}} by the impoundment of the Little Tennessee River in a Tennessee Valley Authority project. But, archaeologists conducted extensive excavations prior to this, during which they identified {{most of the}} Overhill towns and extracted thousands of artifacts, helping them develop volumes of <b>invaluable</b> information regarding the region's Cherokee and pre-Cherokee inhabitants. Different cultures of indigenous peoples had lived along the river for 12,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a {{favourite}} {{architect of}} Catherine's. Like Bullant, {{he became a}} more fantastical designer with time. Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France, a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine. His work is an <b>invaluable</b> record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.|$|E
5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is <b>invaluable</b> for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a heat sink for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May, with Chinese forces {{slackening}} their offensive, 3rd Ranger Company was recalled to Kimpo Airfield for parachute proficiency training, {{above the}} objections of the 3rd Infantry Division commanders who considered the company <b>invaluable.</b> The company spent several weeks in division reserve, and undertook various missions such as convoy security and guarding command posts, as well as surveillance and visiting patrols behind the front lines. In one of these rearguard actions, the Rangers evacuated a rundown village only to have {{one member of the}} unit, Corporal Dave Rauls, captured by three Chinese infiltrators.|$|E
5|$|On 18 February 1942, E.J.H. Corner, the {{assistant}} Director of Gardens in the Straits Settlement, {{with the support}} of Sir Shenton Thomas, met a group of Japanese scientists and nobles with the intention of protecting the <b>invaluable</b> collections of the Library and museum. He was later enlisted by Professor Hidezo Tanakadate to assist in re-establishing the library and museum. To increase its collection, abandoned books and journals were collected from all across the states of Malaya and deposited at the Library.|$|E
5|$|Russia saw the Black Sea {{coast and}} {{the border with}} Turkey as <b>invaluable</b> {{strategic}} attributes of Georgia. Russia had more vested interests in Abkhazia than in South Ossetia, since the Russian military presence on the Black Sea coast was seen as vital to Russian influence in the Black Sea. Before the early 2000s, South Ossetia was originally intended {{as a tool to}} retain a grip on Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Sociologist Joel Best {{wrote in}} 1993 {{that during the}} late 19th century, adults {{developed}} an increased concern {{for the welfare of}} children. Best noted that societies experienced decreasing birth rates after industrialization, with parents focusing their attention on fewer children. According to him, at that time adults began to view childhood as a sacred period of development and children as <b>invaluable,</b> adorable, guiltless beings. During the 1970s and 1980s, Best wrote, adults, saw children as potential victims and sought to eliminate perceived threats.|$|E
5|$|Sun Tzu's Art of War has {{influenced}} many notable figures. Sima Qian recounted that China's first historical emperor, Qin's Shi Huangdi, considered the book <b>invaluable</b> in ending {{the time of}} the Warring States. In the 20th century, the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang to The Art of War. The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.|$|E
5|$|Test {{data from}} the earlier Lockheed X-7 {{unmanned}} ramjet/rocket program proved <b>invaluable</b> for aerodynamic research since the XF-104 would share the general design of the X-7's wing and tail. Experience gained from the Douglas X-3 Stiletto was also used in the design phase of the XF-104. Over 400 surplus instrumented artillery rockets were launched to test various airfoils and tail designs; from which the camera film and telemetry were recovered by parachute.|$|E
5|$|The Ormulum or Orrmulum is a twelfth-century work {{of biblical}} exegesis, {{written by a}} monk named Orm (or Ormin) and {{consisting}} of just under 19,000 lines of early Middle English verse. Because of the unique phonetic orthography adopted by its author, the work preserves many details of English pronunciation existing {{at a time when}} the language was in flux after the Norman conquest of England. Consequently, it is <b>invaluable</b> to philologists and historical linguists in tracing the development of the language.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultrasound}} equipment must be of sufficiently {{high quality}} {{in order to}} give a correct image processing result, which can then provide <b>invaluable</b> information, mainly at the superficial level. It must be able to provide both color and Doppler imaging; technologies that developed alongside the development of ultrasound. The use of Doppler measurements which trace the echoes of the generated soundwaves received by the probe, enable the direction and the velocity of the blood flow, to be depicted. The overlay of color onto the Doppler information lets these images be seen more clearly.|$|E
5|$|This {{magnificent}} {{and tragic}} satire criticizes {{the prototype of}} the Latin American dictator who appeared in several places {{at the beginning of}} the century and has since reappeared, his existence being fostered by the mechanism of tyranny which, for the common man, makes every day a hell on earth. The passionate vigour with which Asturias evokes the terror and distrust which poisoned the social atmosphere of the time makes his work a challenge and an <b>invaluable</b> aesthetic gesture.|$|E
5|$|Tritons globe-girdling cruise proved <b>invaluable</b> to the United States. Politically, it {{enhanced}} the nation's prestige. From an operational viewpoint, the cruise demonstrated the great submerged endurance and sustained high-speed transit {{capabilities of the}} first generation of nuclear-powered submarines. Moreover, during the voyage, the submarine collected reams of oceanographic data. At the cruise's conclusion, Triton received the Presidential Unit Citation and Captain Beach received the Legion of Merit from President Dwight D. Eisenhower.|$|E
5|$|Unlike normal mice, {{transgenic}} poliovirus receptor (TgPVR) mice {{are susceptible}} to poliovirus injected intravenously or intramuscularly, and when injected directly into the spinal cord or the brain. Upon infection, TgPVR mice show signs of paralysis that resemble those of poliomyelitis in humans and monkeys, and the central nervous systems of paralyzed mice are histocytochemically {{similar to those of}} humans and monkeys. This mouse model of human poliovirus infection has proven to be an <b>invaluable</b> tool in understanding poliovirus biology and pathogenicity.|$|E
5|$|DuPont {{commenced}} {{construction of}} the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided <b>invaluable</b> experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who {{then moved on to}} the Hanford site. It operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an <b>invaluable</b> record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The reader is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|Henrietta Lacks (born Loretta Pleasant; August 1, 1920 – October 4, 1951) was an African American {{woman whose}} cancer cells {{are the source}} of the HeLa cell line, the first immortalized cell line {{and one of the most}} {{important}} cell lines in medical research. An immortalized cell line will reproduce indefinitely under specific conditions, and the HeLa cell line continues to be a source of <b>invaluable</b> medical data to the present day. As was then the practice, no consent was obtained to culture her cells, nor were she or her family compensated for their extraction or use.|$|E
5|$|In 1164-65 Manuel's cousin Andronikos, {{the future}} emperor, escaped from captivity in Byzantium and {{fled to the}} court of Yaroslav in Galicia. This situation, holding out the {{alarming}} prospect of Andronikos making a bid for Manuel's throne sponsored by both Galicia and Hungary, spurred the Byzantines into an unprecedented flurry of diplomacy. Manuel pardoned Andronikos and persuaded him to return to Constantinople in 1165. A mission to Kiev, then ruled by Prince Rostislav, resulted in a favourable treaty and a pledge to supply the Empire with auxiliary troops; Yaroslav of Galicia was also persuaded to renounce his Hungarian connections and return fully into the imperial fold. As late as 1200 the princes of Galicia were providing <b>invaluable</b> services against the enemies of the Empire, at that time the Cumans.|$|E
5|$|In modern times, {{water is}} seen as a common choice to drink with a meal. In the Middle Ages, however, {{concerns}} over purity, medical recommendations and its low prestige value made it less favored, and alcoholic beverages were always preferred. They were seen as more nutritious and beneficial to digestion than water, with the <b>invaluable</b> bonus of being less prone to putrefaction due to the alcohol content. Wine was consumed on a daily basis in most of France and all over the Western Mediterranean wherever grapes were cultivated. Further north it remained the preferred drink of the bourgeoisie and the nobility who could afford it, and far less common among peasants and workers. The drink of commoners in the northern parts of the continent was primarily beer or ale.|$|E
5|$|Interested {{parties on}} both sides filed amici. A group of {{conservative}} Republicans {{in both houses of}} Congress, including Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, Henry Hyde and Rick Santorum, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children both argued for affirming the conviction, pointing to the <b>invaluable</b> nature of undercover investigations in fighting child pornography, worrying that requiring reasonable suspicion beforehand could make such operations impossible. Americans for Effective Law Enforcement said there had been no entrapment and that reasonable suspicion was not required before starting investigations such as Looking Glass. The American Civil Liberties Union, its Nebraska chapter and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers weighed in on Jacobson's behalf.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's immense wealth (increased by {{the success}} of his operas) and his {{continuing}} adherence to his Jewish religion set him apart somewhat from many of his musical contemporaries. They also gave rise to rumours that his success was due to his bribing musical critics. Richard Wagner (see below) accused him of being interested only in money, not music. Meyerbeer was, however, a deeply serious musician and a sensitive personality. He philosophically resigned himself to being a victim of his own success: his extensive diaries and correspondence – which survived the turmoil of 20th-century Europe and have now been published in eight volumes – are an <b>invaluable</b> source for the history of music and theatre in the composer's time.|$|E
