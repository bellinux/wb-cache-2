40|$|Abstract: Three {{heterogeneous}} {{models of}} a channel sandbody of braided stream origin were constructed by combining reservoir {{data from the}} middle reservoir unit of the Lower Jurassic Statfjord Formation in the Snorre Field in the Norwegian Sector of the North Sea, with facies and geometry data from an exposed analogue channel sandbody in the Pennsylvanian-Permian Maroon Formation, Colorado. Permeability classes corresponding {{to those in the}} Stat-fjord Formation were distributed according to facies variation in the analogue sandbody and to the recorded vertical distribution in the Middle Statfjord sandbodies. Relative permeability and capillary pressure curves were made for <b>individual</b> <b>permeability</b> classes. Two-dimensional (yz-plane) reservoir simulation of waterflooding was carried out with injection at the down-dip end and production at the up-dip end of the models, which measured 104 m x 8. 75 m and had a structural dip of 8 °. The results were compared with simulations on two reference models, one of a homogeneous sandbody and one with the permeability zonation organized i...|$|E
40|$|Bile acids are {{secreted}} {{from the}} liver into the duodenum where they {{aid in the}} digestion and absorption of dietary lipids. Absorption of bile acids occurs through both ionic and nonionic diffusion in the jejunum and colon and through an active sodium ion-dependent carrier mechanism in the ileum. The prima, y bile acids synthesized in the liver can be converted by intestinal bacteria into secondary and tertiary bile acids. Bile acids may also be conjugated with glycine or taurine which results {{in an increase in}} the hydrophilicity and solubility of these compounds at physiological pH. The amount of passive diffusion of bile acids that occurs across the brush border membrane {{along the length of the}} entire intestine depends upon the ratio of ionized to nonionized bile acids coupled with the bile salt concentration and the <b>individual</b> <b>permeability</b> coefficients of monomers. Active transport of both conjugated and nonconjugated species of bile acids depends upon the presence of a single negative charge on the side chain. Maximal transport rates for bile acids are related to the number of hydroxyl groups present while the Michaelis-Menten constant for transport is dependent upon whether or not the bile acid is conjugated. Although active uptake of bile acids from the ileum has been considered the major route for bile salt absorption in the small intestine, the mechanism may actually be responsible for only a small proportion of the total bile acid pool absorbed from the lumen...|$|E

30|$|With {{synthetic}} {{and field}} data, the numerical density and statistical derivatives yield a clearer reservoir radial flow regime and therefore estimate formation permeability with {{higher level of}} confidence. Additionally, there was a better estimation of <b>individual</b> fluid phase <b>permeability,</b> reflecting the contribution of each phase to flow at a given point; therefore, the formation effective and phase permeabilities can be derived with confidence. Summarily, the numerical density transient analysis DTA solution is a robust approach for interpreting multiphase flow condition which is presently limited to only numerical well testing approach. The pressure–density equivalent and numerical density derivatives can derive <b>individual</b> phase <b>permeability</b> along with good visualisation of each phase derivative response which gives the true picture of the reservoir response, and this ensures that the derived permeability is right from the formation radial flow.|$|R

40|$|In {{the first}} part of this study, the {{hydrogen}} and oxygen permeabilities of Nafion were measured. The aim of the second part of this study presented here is to physically characterize the influence of the aqueous phase, the solid phase, and the intermediate phase in Nafion on the macroscopic hydrogen and oxygen permeabilities. Hereto, a resistor network model morphologically representative for Nafion based on structural investigations reported in the literature is presented in which the different phases are described by <b>individual</b> <b>permeabilities.</b> As a result of the simulations, an enlarged permeability of the solid phase in comparison to that of dry Nafion had to be assumed in order to reproduce the measured influence of temperature and relative humidity on the permeability. This increase of the permeability of the solid phase toward greater water uptake was explained by the effect of water as a plasticizer and the resulting softening of the polymeric matrix. On the basis of the identified mechanisms, approaches to reduce the gas permeability of polymer electrolyte membranes are identified and discussed...|$|R

The procedure developed here is capable of processing all the information simultaneously and this results in a fast and efficient method.

30|$|Multi-phase flow in porous {{media is}} an {{important}} issue in its applications including oil and gas production, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and gas storage techniques (Cao and Siddiqui 2011). One of the key petrophysical parameters to characterize the hydrodynamics of multiphase flow in porous media is relative permeability. Relative permeability can provide useful information for reservoir characterization, reservoir simulation, reservoir recovery calculation, and formation damage (Dake 1978; Honarpour et al. 1986; Honarpour and Mahmood 1988). Unfortunately, it still remains tough to obtain three-phase relative permeability data directly from the field, any indirect manner, or experiments.

40|$|Gap-junctional {{intercellular}} communication {{is thought to}} be essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis and growth control. Its perturbation entails toxicological implications and it has been correlated with the in vivo tumor-promoting potential of chemicals. Little is known about the mechanism(s) responsible for the tumor promoters interference with the cellular coupling. Moreover, nongenotoxic carcinogens, as well as connexins (gap-junctional protein subunits), are known to be organ-/tissue-specific; this implies that the effect of different agents should be evaluated on their specific target, that is, connexin. To investigate the role of different connexins in regulating gap-junctional gating and to compare the properties of homotypic junctional channels, we evaluated the effects of tissue-specific tumor promoters and anti-promoters on the viability and intercellular coupling (dye-transfer) of HeLa cells stably transfected with cDNAs coding for connexin(cx) 43, cx 40, cx 26 and cx 32. The results demonstrate that the transfectants possess <b>individual</b> junctional <b>permeabilities,</b> differentially affected by the chemicals, they also show different sensitivities to the cytotoxic effect of the compounds.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the influences of}} correlation length and aperture variability on the REV, the equivalent permeability of a fracture network, and the uncertainty in the equivalent permeability using a two-dimensional orthogonal bond percolation model. The percolation threshold, correlation length, effective conductivity, and coefficient of variation of the effective conductivity are investigated over statistically representative multiple realizations with Monte Carlo simulations in 2 D fracture networks that have log-normally distributed <b>individual</b> fracture <b>permeabilities.</b> We show that although the aperture variability is large, the REV and the correlation length are similar near the percolation threshold. In contrast, when the fracture density is {{much larger than the}} percolation threshold they diverge as the aperture variability increases. We characterize the effects of correlation length and aperture variability on effective conductivity with a simple function. From the coefficient of variation analysis, the correlation length can be a criterion for evaluating which conceptual model is appropriate for describing the flow system for a given fracture network when aperture variability is sufficiently small. However, discrete fracture network models are recommended for flow simulation models because of the difficulty of REV estimation and the uncertainty in equivalent hydraulic parameters when aperture variability is large.

40|$|Bedding-parallel stylolites {{typically}} {{represent the}} product of chemical compaction (overburden weight-induced pressure solution) experienced by carbonate successions during their burial history, when bedding is still horizontal. Due to their common occurrence in carbonate rocks, with lateral extents that can exceed 1 km, bedding-parallel stylolites are of special interest for the hydrocarbon industry because they may affect the regional fluid flow in the subsurface. Aimed at assessing the development and distribution of bedding-parallel stylolites in peritidal, platform limestone successions, field and laboratory {{studies were carried out}} on Cretaceous peritidal limestones originally pertaining to the Apulian Carbonate Platform realm and now exposed in three distinct Italian locations: Maiella Mountain, Gargano Promontory and Murge Plateau. Results point to a prominent role played by the geological characteristics of limestones on development and localization of bedding-parallel stylolites within peritidal limestone successions. In particular, bedding-parallel lamination and fine rock grain size, co-occurring in stromatolitic limestones, determined there laterally more extensive and closely spaced stylolites than in the associated calcilutites and calcarenites. Large fenestral pores, which are ubiquitous in stromatolitic limestones, represent rock heterogeneities able to influence the roughness of <b>individual</b> stylolites. <b>Permeability</b> laboratory experiments revealed that occurrence of bedding-parallel stylolites improves the overall rock permeability. Where preferentially localized (stromatolitic layers), such structural features may therefore represent pathways for fluid flow through low-permeability, peritidal limestone successions in the subsurface...|$|R
40|$|The Nesjavellir {{geothermal}} system in southern Iceland is very complex from both a thermal and hydrologic point of view. There are large pressure and tempera-ture gradients in the wellfield and zones with drasti-cally different pressure potentials. Thus, natural fluid flow is substantial {{in the system}} and flow patterns are complex. We have developed a twedimensional natural state model for the Nesjavellir system that matches reasonably well the observed pressure and temperature distributions. The match with field da t a has allowed determination of the energy recharge to the system and the permeability distribution. Fluids recharge the system at rate of 0. 02 kg/s/m with an enthalpy of 1460 kJ/kg. The permeability in the main reservoir is estimated to be in the range of 1. 5 to 2. 0 md, which agrees well with injection test results from <b>individual</b> wells. <b>Permeabilities</b> in shallower reservoirs are about an order of magnitude higher. Most of the main reservoir is under twephase conditions, as are shallow aquifers {{in the southern part of}} the field. The model results also suggest tha t the low temperatures in the shallow part of the northern region of the field may be due to the young age of the system; Le., the system is gradually heating up. If this is the case the estimated age of the system near the wellfield is on the order of a few thousand years...|$|R
40|$|A {{current debate}} {{surrounds}} {{the issue of}} whether prejudice-reducing interventions such as intergroup contact may reduce resistance to unequal intergroup relations among disadvantaged groups. Addressing this question, the present research investigates how positive contact with members of the advantaged group shapes action strategies to cope with disadvantage. Using survey data from a sample of Latino-Americans (N = 112), structural equation modelling revealed that friendship contact with Anglo-Whites was overall negatively associated with interest in collective action. This relation was due to both reduced identification with the disadvantaged group and positive attitudes toward the advantaged group, which predicted reduced anger about inequality. Contact was also positively associated with an individual mobility orientation, a relation which was explained through increased perceived <b>permeability.</b> <b>Individual</b> mobility orientation did not, however, predict reduced motivation for collective action.

30|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are three {{analytical}} approaches. (1) Statistical pressure derivative utilises the 2 nd differencing of pressure and time series since pressure change and subsurface flow rate are nonstationary series and then integrates the residual of its 1 st differences using simple statistical functions such as sum of square error SSE, standard deviation, moving average MA and covariance of these series to formulate the model. (2) Pressure–density equivalent algorithm for each fluid phase {{is derived from the}} fundamental pressure–density relationship and its derivatives used for diagnosing flow regimes and calculating permeability. (3) Density transient analytical DTA solution is derived with the same assumptions as (2) above, but the density derivatives for each fluid phase are used along with the semi-log density versus time plot to derive permeability for each fluid phase. (2) and (3) are solutions for multiphase flow problems when the fluid density is treated as a function of pressure with slight change in density. The first method demonstrated that for field and design data tested, a good radial stabilisation can be identified with good permeability estimation without smoothing the data. Also it showed that in cases investigated, near and far reservoir features can be diagnosed with clarity. However, the second and third methods can not only derived each <b>individual</b> phase <b>permeability,</b> the derivative response from each phase is visualised to give much clearer picture of the true reservoir response as seen in the synthetic data analysed which in return ensures that the derived permeability originates from the formation radial flow. Summarily, the three methods: statistical pressure, fluid-phase numerical density and pressure–density equivalent derivatives gave very clear radial flow stabilisations on the diagnostic plot, from which the reservoir permeability was derived.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Septic shock is {{associated}} with increased microvascular permeability. As a model for study of the pathophysiology of sepsis, endotoxin administration to humans has facilitated research into inflammation, coagulation and cardiovascular effects. The present study was undertaken to determine whether endotoxin administration to human volunteers {{can be used as}} a model to study the sepsis-associated increase in microvascular permeability. METHODS: In an open intervention study conducted in a university medical centre, 16 healthy volunteers were evaluated in the research unit of the intensive care unit. Eight were administered endotoxin intravenously (2 ng/kg Escherichia coli O 113) and eight served as control <b>individuals.</b> Microvascular <b>permeability</b> was assessed before and 5 hours after the administration of endotoxin (n = 8) or placebo (n = 8) by three different methods: transcapillary escape rate of I(125) -albumin; venous occlusion strain-gauge plethysmography to determine the filtration capacity; and bioelectrical impedance analysis to determine the extracellular and total body water. RESULTS: Administration of endotoxin resulted in the expected increases in proinflammatory cytokines, temperature, flu-like symptoms and cardiovascular changes. All changes were significantly different from those in the control group. In the endotoxin group all microvascular permeability parameters remained unchanged from baseline: transcapillary escape rate of I(125) -albumin changed from 7. 2 +/- 0. 6 to 7. 7 +/- 0. 9 %/hour; filtration capacity changed from 5. 0 +/- 0. 3 to 4. 2 +/- 0. 4 ml/min per 100 ml mmHg x 10 (- 3); and extracellular/total body water changed from 0. 42 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 40 +/- 0. 01 l/l (all differences not significant). CONCLUSION: Although experimental human endotoxaemia is frequently used as a model to study sepsis-associated pathophysiology, an endotoxin-induced increase in microvascular permeability in vivo could not be detected using three different methods. Endotoxin administration to human volunteers is not suitable as a model in which to study changes in microvascular permeability...|$|R

40|$|We have {{incorporated}} an RNA binding {{site for the}} biological amino acid tryptophan within an RNA complex with affinity for phospholipid bilayer membranes. The resulting RNA (9 : 10 Trp) creates a selective route through the bilayer for the amino acid. Binding and enhanced tryptophan permeability are nonlinear in RNA concentration, suggesting that RNA aggregation is required for both. Tryptophan permeability saturates with increased concentration, though at ~ 1000 -fold greater level than when binding a free aptamer. The RNA (9 : 10 Trp) complex, bound at a mean of two per liposome, halves the activation energy for tryptophan transport (to 46 kJ/mole), specifically increasing tryptophan entry to a maximal velocity of 0. 5 sec- 1 per liposome {{with little or no}} accompanying increase in general <b>permeability.</b> <b>Individual</b> RNAs turn over tens of thousands of times at high tryptophan concentration. Thus, a specific passive membrane transporter whose properties overlap those of single-molecule transporter proteins, can be made of RNA alone.

Other RNA activities may yield other RNA-membrane nanosystems via this route...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{factors that}} {{influence}} the spread of wildlife diseases is crucial for designing effective surveillance programs and appropriate management strategies. The potential introduction of chronic wasting disease (CWD) to Iowa is of significant management concern because it is found in free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) populations in several bordering states, including Wisconsin. To address this concern, I used a landscape genetics approach to characterize deer population genetic structure and its correlation with landscape features relevant to deer dispersal. I used female deer, the traditionally philopatric sex, because {{they are expected to}} show a stronger signal of local genetic structure than males. In {{the first part of the}} study, I used both biparentally-inherited microsatellite markers and maternally-inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequence to characterize genetic connectivity between white-tailed deer populations in Iowa and Wisconsin separated by the Mississippi River. Clustering analyses indicated that deer across the study area represented a single population. There was no significant genetic isolation by distance at the level of a county, but there was a significant pattern at the individual level out to 29 km, indicating that genetic structure exists primarily at a fine spatial scale. I found indirect evidence of significantly higher male than female dispersal across the Mississippi River. In the second part of the study, I used mtDNA to characterize population genetic structure of female white-tailed deer in the agriculturally-dominated landscape of northeastern Iowa where only 15 % of the habitat is forested. Although female deer in the region were found to be a single population, there was evidence of isolation by distance at both the county level and out to 19 km at the individual level. However, spatial genetic structure did not significantly correlate with the absolute percentage of forest cover separating <b>individuals.</b> The <b>permeability</b> of the Mississippi River to deer dispersal and the minimal spatial genetic structure that indicates dispersal rates and distances are fairly large suggest that there is considerable potential for CWD spread to Iowa and then within the state...|$|R

The cores were selected at the drill sites so as to be representative of the major lithologic variations observed within stratigraphic units of the Paintbrush Tuff, Calico Hills Tuff, Crater Flat Tuff, Lithic Ridge Tuff, and Older Tuffs. Dry and saturated bulk density, grain density, and porosity measurements were made on the core samples principally to establish that a reasonable uniformity exists in the textural and mineral character of the sample pairs. Electrical resistivity measured on sample pairs tended to be lower along the plane transverse to the vertical axis of the drill core herein referred to as the horizontal plane.

The Big Hole fault outcrops in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, central Utah. A total of 363. 2 m of oriented drill core was recovered at two sites where fault displacement is 8 and 3 - 5 m. The main fault core is a narrow zone of intensely comminuted grains that is a maximum of 30 cm thick and is composed of low-porosity amalgamated deformation bands that have slip surfaces on one or both sides. Probe permeameter measurements showed a permeability decline from greater than 2000 to less than 0. 1 md as the fault is approached. Whole-core analyses showed that fault core permeability is less than 1 md and <b>individual</b> deformation band <b>permeability</b> is about 1 md. Using these data, we calculated the bulk permeability of the fault zone.

40|$|Physical {{barriers}} {{contribute to}} habitat fragmentation, influence species distribution and ranging behaviour, and impact long-term population viability. Barrier permeability varies among species and can potentially impact the competitive balance within animal communities by differentially affecting co-occurring species. The influence of barriers on the {{spatial distribution of}} species within whole communities has nonetheless received little attention. During a 4 -year period, we studied {{the influence of a}} fence and rivers, two landscape features that potentially act as barriers on space use and ranging behaviour of lions Panthera leo, spotted hyenas Crocuta crocuta, African wild dogs Lycaon pictus and cheetahs Acinonyx jubatus in Northern Botswana. We compared the tendencies of these species to cross the barriers using data generated from GPS-radio collars fitted to a total of 35 <b>individuals.</b> Barrier <b>permeability</b> was inferred by calculating the number of times animals crossed a barrier vs. the number of times they did not cross. Finally, based on our results, we produced a map of connectivity for the broader landscape system. Permeability varied significantly between fence and rivers and among species. The fence represented an obstacle for lions (permeability = 7 · 2 %), while it was considerably more permeable for hyenas (35 · 6 %) and wild dogs and cheetahs (≥ 50 %). In contrast, the rivers and associated floodplains were relatively permeable to lions (14 · 4 %) while they represented a nearly impassable obstacle for the other species (< 2 %). The aversion of lions to cross the fence resulted in a relatively lion-free habitat patch {{on one side of the}} fence, which might provide a potential refuge for other species. For instance, the competitively inferior wild dogs used this refuge significantly more intensively than the side of the fence with a high presence of lions. We showed that the influence of a barrier on the distribution of animals could potentially result in a broad-scale modification of community structure and ecology within a guild of co-occurring species. As habitat fragmentation increases, understanding the impact of barriers on species distributions is thus essential for the implementation of landscape-scale management strategies, the development and maintenance of corridors and the enhancement of connectivity...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of multiple approaches {{to develop a}} new model to determine the porosity, permeability and the rate of desorption of 1. 5 -inch shale samples. The raw NMR signal of the sample in the coreholder is measured before methane injection and is used as base signal. During the injection of methane the raw NMR signal increases. The base signal is subtracted from the response during the methane injection. This difference is Laplace transformed to only obtain the T 2 distributions and T 1 ? T 2 correlations related to the injected methane in the shales. T 2 distribution holds information on the pore size distribution. Using cut-off values to separate the signal, different zones can be extracted. During injection and production of fluids, the rate and the total fluid filled porosity are used to calculate the permeability related to the individual pore size distributions. To test this theory, a high porosity carbonate rock from the Khuff formation is first injected with water. Thereafter shale samples from the Posidonia and Qusaiba formation are put to the test with injection of methane. In the majority of shale gas formations, {{there are two types of}} pore systems are present; kerogen-hosted organic pores(OP) and inorganic pores (IP). By fully saturating 1. 5 -inch shale cores and by continuously mea- suring the NMR signal it is possible to determine the <b>individual</b> porosity and <b>permeabilities</b> of the pore sys- tem. T 1 ? T 2 measurements are made to confirm the individual zones and the mobility of the fluid in the zones. A single exponential decay formula is defined to calculate the permeability. This formula is tested with an Eclipse simulation to validate the calculated value. Eventually a multi-exponential model is used to distinguish the high and low permeability components in shales. This high permeability component is interpreted to represent the inorganic pores and micro fractures, while low permeability component is interpreted to represent the organic pores and the desorption from pore surface. The Posidonia samples have an OP of 2. 2 - 3. 5 % and an IP of 3. 2 - 4. 2 %, while the Qusaiba have an OP of 0. 2 - 0. 3 % and an IP of 0. 45 - 0. 9 %. Therefore the Posidonia core samples show better production potential than the Qusaiba samples. Understanding the shale porosities for different storage mechanisms as well as the corresponding permeabilities is essential for developing shale reservoirs and target zone selection.
