5|$|The next {{vignette}} {{focuses on}} Princess Bubblegum (voiced by Hynden Walch) {{as she tries}} to create the perfect sandwich using bizarre science.

After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits are actually the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.|$|E

25|$|When Gallagher {{was with}} Taste, {{he used a}} single Vox AC30 with a Dallas Rangemaster treble booster plugged into the 'normal' input. Examples of this sound can be heard on the Taste albums, {{as well as the}} album Live in Europe.

25|$|In 1944, as he attacks a Hydra {{base in the}} Nazi-occupied Danish Straits, Steve Rogers recalls {{parts of}} his life that got him to this point: his mother's blessing to become a soldier; {{his first meeting with}} Bucky Barnes, who {{protected}} him from bullies as a boy; the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, when Bucky and Steve decided to enlist; Bucky training Steve to pass the physical; and the point when Bucky passed the physical but Steve failed. Johann Schmidt watches Rogers fight, and recalls <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to this point: meeting Adolf Hitler; capturing Arnim Zola to research creating super soldiers; and finding Abraham Erskine and blackmailing him into continuing his super soldier research under the employ of the Nazis. Howard Stark, via radio, assists Rogers, remembering when he was recruited by Colonel Phillips to join the Strategic Scientific Reserve, and when he helped Peggy Carter rescue Erskine from Schmidt. Dum Dum Dugan and the Howling Commandos arrive to assist Rogers, and they remember their formation—thrust together in a Hydra work camp, forming close friendships after a failed escape attempt.

25|$|Meanwhile, Wilson remembers <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{a job at}} {{the local}} {{airfield}} thanks to Frank's dad. Frank quickly became a pilot, but Wilson didn't have the money to get flight certified and as such became a mechanic and fixed planes. Regardless he was still happy in life and eventually asked Amelia to marry him, and she agreed. That evening Amelia told Lawrence, who strangely didn't say anything at all, and left to do some work in the field. When Frank found out about the wedding, he privately told Wilson to cancel it saying that Amelia would never settle for a quiet life in Bastion Falls. Wilson ignored his request, confident he would soon have his pilots license and would be able to fly her to the Big City. Suddenly the bell from the hilltop church begins to ring in the Dreamscape, and Wilson heads over there. Once he does he remembers how on the wedding day Amelia never showed up, and she was never seen again. Lawrence blamed her disappearance on Wilson, saying that this would never have happened if he hadn't asked her to marry him.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by R. W. Goodwin, an {{executive}} producer and director for the show. This was the second instance where {{a member of the}} production crew wrote an episode, the first being Mat Beck's [...] "Wetwired". [...] Goodwin was inspired to write the episode after reading An Anthropologist on Mars, a series of essays by Oliver Sacks, in particular The Landscape of Dreams featuring a man who could recall every detail of his childhood. Goodwin {{came up with the idea}} of having Fox Mulder waking up in a strange place with no idea <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there. After receiving approval from series creator Chris Carter, Goodwin spent approximately six weeks writing the episode.|$|E

500|$|... "Kill the Alligator and Run" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Jen Kamerman {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). When the animation department finished its work on the episode, it had ended up being about four minutes too long and the staff of the show was forced to make some difficult cuts. One scene that was cut saw Captain Jack lying in state at the capitol in Florida, with Kid Rock being one of the people present to pay their respects to the alligator. The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully has expressed regret for cutting this scene out because it [...] "hurts the logic" [...] later in the episode when Captain Jack crawls out of the capitol and reveals himself to everyone, without any explanation to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there.|$|E

500|$|Both {{the opening}} and {{the ending of the}} film were {{reworked}} in various ways. First it would begin with a flashback to Tony's childhood. Then like Iron Man it would begin in medias res, with Tony crashing in Tennessee before a voiceover that would lead to <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> there, until it got changed to the final version. For the climactic tanker battle, it was originally considered that Brandt would show up in the James Bond tradition of the henchman coming back for the heroes. Instead they chose to use Killian himself, and have Pepper, whom he abused earlier, cause his downfall as a way of poetic justice. The final dialogue was originally written as [...] "I am Tony Stark" [...] to be a response to the first film's ending, but eventually it changed to [...] "I am Iron Man" [...] to enhance the mythical qualities.|$|E

While some texts say that Ganesha was born with an elephant head, he acquires the head later in most stories. The most recurrent motif in these stories is that Ganesha was created by Parvati using clay to protect her and Shiva beheaded him when Ganesha came between Shiva and Parvati. Shiva then replaced Ganesha's original head with that of an elephant. [...] Details of the battle and where the replacement head came from varying from source to source. Another story says that Ganesha was created directly by Shiva's laughter. Because Shiva considered Ganesha too alluring, he gave him the head of an elephant and a protruding belly.|$|E
