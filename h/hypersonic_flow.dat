25|$|In aerodynamics, {{hypersonic}} speeds are speeds {{that are}} highly supersonic. In the 1970s, the term generally came to refer to speeds of Mach 5 (5 times the speed of sound) and above. The hypersonic regime is {{a subset of the}} supersonic regime. <b>Hypersonic</b> <b>flow</b> is characterized by high temperature flow behind a shock wave, viscous interaction, and chemical dissociation of gas.|$|E
25|$|With some exceptions, the {{knowledge}} of hypersonic aerodynamics has matured between the 1960s and the present decade. Therefore, the goals of an aerodynamicist have shifted from understanding the behavior of fluid flow to understanding how to engineer a vehicle to interact appropriately with the fluid flow. For example, while the behavior of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flow</b> is understood, building a scramjet aircraft to fly at hypersonic speeds has seen very limited success. Along with building a successful scramjet aircraft, the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems will continue to fuel new research in aerodynamics. Nevertheless, there are still important problems in basic aerodynamic theory, such as in predicting transition to turbulence, and the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations.|$|E

40|$|Reasonable {{analysis}} of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows</b> requires a thermodynamic non-equilibrium model to properly simulate strong shock waves or {{high pressure and temperature}} {{states in the}} flow field. The energy relaxation method (ERM) has been used to model such a non-equilibrium effect which is generally expressed as a hyperbolic system of equations with a stiff relaxation source term. Relaxation time that is multiplied with source terms is responsible for non-equilibrium in the system. In the present study, a numerical analysis has been carried out with varying values of relaxation time for several <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows</b> with AUSM (advection upstream splitting method) as a numerical scheme. Vibration modes of thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects are considered. The results obtained showed that, as the relaxation time reduces to zero, the solution marches toward equilibrium, while it shows non-equilibrium effects, as the relaxation time increases. The present computations predicted the experiment results of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows</b> with good accuracy.

2500|$|Flow {{velocity}} is used {{to classify}} flows according to speed regime. Subsonic flows are flow fields in which the air speed field is always below the local speed of sound.

Supersonic flows are defined to be flows in which the flow speed is greater than the speed of sound everywhere.

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the aerothermodynamics of <b>hypersonic</b> nonequilibrium <b>flows</b> over blunt nosed models and space vehicles with rarefaction effects. First, the in-house Navier-Stokes solver, UNIC-UNS code, with the slip boundary condition and finite-rate chemistry is used to simulate the <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows</b> over a blunt nosed model and the simplified European eXPErimental Re-entry Test-bed (EXPERT) model V 4. 4. Next, <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows</b> over the whole EXPERT 3 D model, which correspond to the expected descent trajectory with allowance for rarefaction and thermochemical nonequilibrium are simulated.

The code employs a state-of-the-art upwind algorithm to capture strong shock waves. The algorithm developed in this work is implicit, uses finite-volumes, and is second-order accurate in the crossflow directions. The new code is validated through application to several laminar supersonic and <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows.</b> In two dimensions, calculations were performed for supersonic laminar flow past a flat plate, <b>hypersonic</b> laminar <b>flow</b> past a 15 (DEGREES) compression corner, and <b>hypersonic</b> laminar <b>flow</b> into a converging inlet.

40|$|A {{study of}} viscous and {{inviscid}} <b>hypersonic</b> <b>flows</b> using generalized upwind methods is presented.
