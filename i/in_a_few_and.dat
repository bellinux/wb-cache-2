60|$|So overjoyed {{were the}} people at the blessed change from the tyranny of a cruel woman to the sway of a gentle prince, that it was some time before they could be quieted.

60|$|With {{all this}} in mind, I have often been tempted to put forth the paradox that any place {{is good enough to}} live a life in, while it is only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> <b>and</b> those highly favoured, that we can pass a few hours agreeably. For, if we only stay long enough we become at home in the neighbourhood. Reminiscences spring up, like flowers, about uninteresting corners. We forget to some degree the {{superior}} loveliness of other places, and fall into a tolerant and sympathetic spirit which is its own reward and justification. Looking back the other day on some recollections of my own, I was astonished to find how much I owed to such a residence; six weeks in one unpleasant country-side had done more, it seemed, to quicken and educate my sensibilities than many years in places that jumped more nearly with my inclination.|$|E
60|$|The parent, {{after having}} {{initiated}} his {{children into the}} regular transaction of business by his mode of managing their allowance-fund, may very advantageously extend {{the benefits of the}} system by engaging with them {{from time to time in}} other affairs, to be regulated in a business-like and systematic manner. For example, if one of his boys has been reserving a portion of his spending-money as a watch-fund, and has already half enough for the purchase, the father may offer to lend him the balance and take a mortgage of the watch, to stand until the boy shall have taken it up out of future savings; and he can make out a mortgage-deed expressing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> simple words the fact that the watch is pledged to him as security for the sum advanced, and is not to become the absolute property of the boy till the money for which it is pledged is paid. In the course of years, a great number of transactions in this way may take place between the father or mother and their boy, each of which will not only be a source of interest and enjoyment to both parties, but will afford the best possible means of imparting, not only to the child directly interested in them, but to the other children, a practical knowledge of financial transactions, and of forming in them the habit of conducting all their affairs in a systematic and business-like manner.|$|E
60|$|The especial want of all Greek and Roman {{buildings}} {{with which we}} are acquainted is the absence--save <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> unimportant cases--of the pyramidal form. The Egyptians knew at least the worth of the obelisk: but the Greeks and Romans hardly knew even that: their buildings are flat- topped. Their builders were contented with the earth as it was. There was a great truth involved in that; which I am the last to deny. But religions which, like the Buddhist or the Christian, nurse a noble self- discontent, are sure to adopt sooner or later an upward and aspiring form of building. It is not merely that, fancying heaven to be above earth, they point towards heaven. There is a deeper natural language in the pyramidal form of a growing tree. It symbolises growth, or the desire of growth. The Norman tower does nothing of the kind. It does not aspire to grow. Look--I mention an instance with which I am most familiar--at the Norman tower of Bury St. Edmund's. It is graceful--awful, if you will--but there is no aspiration in it. It is stately: but self-content. Its horizontal courses; circular arches; above all, its flat sky-line, seem to have risen enough: and wish to rise no higher. For it has no touch of that unrest of soul, which is expressed by the spire, and still more by the compound spire, with its pinnacles, crockets, finials, which are finials only in name; for they do not finish, and are really terminal buds, as it were, longing to open and grow upward, even as the crockets are bracts and leaves thrown off as the shoot has grown.|$|E

5000|$|In the English version {{this passage}} reads as thus: The {{sciences}} are small powers; because not eminent, and therefore, not acknowledged in any man; nor are at all, but <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> <b>and</b> in them, {{but of a}} few things. For science is of that nature, as none can understand it to be, but such as in a good measure have attained it. [...] On a later work, De Corpore (1655), also written in Latin, Hobbes expanded the same idea: The end or scope of philosophy is, that we may make use to our benefit of effects formerly seen ... for the commodity of human life ... The end of knowledge is power ... lastly, the scope of all speculation is the performing of some action, or thing to be done. In Jean Hampton, Hobbes and the social contract tradition (1988), Hampton indicates that this quote is 'after Bacon' and in a footnote, that 'Hobbes was Bacon's secretary {{as a young man}} and had philosophical discussions with him (Aubrey 1898, 331).|$|E
50|$|They are {{strongly}} built, with stouter legs {{and a slightly}} thicker bill than many other warblers, and {{range in size from}} 11 cm length and 7 g weight (African desert warbler) up to 17 cm length and 36 g weight (barred warbler). The plumage is in varying shades of grey and brown, usually darker above and paler below, with bluish or pinkish tones in several species; several also have orange-brown or rufous fringed wing feathers. The tail is square-ended in most, slightly rounded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few,</b> <b>and</b> in several species has white sides. Many of the species show some sexual dimorphism, with distinctive male and female plumages, with the males in many having black or bright grey on the heads, replaced by brown, brownish-grey or similar dusky colours in females; {{about a third of the}} species also have a conspicuous red eye ring in males. Species breeding in cool temperate regions {{are strongly}} migratory, while most of those in warmer regions are partially migratory or resident. They are active warblers usually associated with open woodland, scrub, hedges or shrubs. Their diet is largely insectivorous, though several species also eat fruit extensively, mainly small berries such as elder and ivy, particularly from late summer to late winter; one species (blackcap) also frequently takes a wide variety of human-provided foods on birdtables in winter.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} DualFS, {{a new high}} performance journaling file system that puts data and meta-data on different devices (usually, two partitions on the same disk or on different disks), and manages them in very different ways.

By avoiding a time-expensive extra copy of meta-data blocks, DualFS can achieve a good performance as compared to other journaling file systems. Indeed, we have implemented a DualFS prototype, which has been evaluated with microbenchmarks and macrobenchmarks, and {{we have found that}} DualFS greatly reduces the total I/O time taken by the file system in most cases (up to 97 %), whereas it slightly increases the total I/O time only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> limited cases...|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Small cell {{lung cancer}} (SCLC) {{is the most}} {{aggressive}} type of lung cancer. The surgical treatment is possible only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> defined occasions. The association between SCLC and a solitary fibrous tumor of pleura (SFTP) is extremely rare. CASE PRESENTATION: A 56 year-old man had a lung lesion (size 16 mm) FDG-avid (SUV 7. 9) within upper lobe of right lung. No lymph adenopathy or other distant lesion were found. The pathological results of FNAB showed the presence of malignant cells inconclusive for a definitive diagnosis. Following thoracotomy, the exploration of pleural cavity showed an unexpected lesion (size. 3 cm) originating from parietal pleura and not radiologically seen. The intraoperative diagnosis was solitary fibrous tumor of the pleura. Then, an upper right lobectomy was achieved. The histological findings of the lung tumor diagnosed to be a SCLC (p-stage: T 1 N 0 M 0). An adjuvant treatment was started. At 20 months after the procedure, no recurrence was found. CONCLUSION: Surgery as part of multimodality treatment may be indicated {{in the treatment of}} SCLC in the early stage (T 1 N 0 M 0). However, before proceeding to attend tumor resection an exploration of pleural cavity is mandatory in order to exclude any pleural involvement...|$|E
30|$|Species such as Ramalina farinacea (Figure 12) {{indicate}} {{an even higher}} degree of air quality. Until 1995, they had no possibilities of existence because of the unfavorable immission situation in Wetzlar and Giessen. Throughout the following years, they started settling in both towns, though hitherto only with a few individuals. R. farinacea is a typical representative of a rather demanding species in terms of air quality. It {{is one of the}} few fruticose lichens which have returned so far. Occasionally, one now finds representatives of the genus Usnea in both towns. They are so sensitive to air pollution that they were initially only found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> very small individuals (and therefore hard to determine). Based on the fact that these species appear every once in a while in a measuring area but disappear in the following mapping and emerge in another one, it can be concluded that the air quality in the study areas of Wetzlar and Giessen is still slightly below the possibilities of existence for R. farinacea and species of the genus Usnea. A few years ago, similar observations were made, for example, for the fruticose lichen Evernia prunastri; today, this species has firmly anchored in Central Hesse even within the towns. The further observation of ‘pioneer species’ is of particular interest as they will clearly show an improvement of the air quality.|$|E
40|$|The {{congenital}} anomaly {{in which the}} left coronary artery arises from the main pul-monary artery is infrequent, but lethal, and since it can be alleviated surgically, its rec-ognition and hemodynamic consequences are important. On the basis of 140 reported cases and our seven cases, it seems to present in one of four ways: (1) in infancy with angina-like symptoms or as cardiomyopathy, and later (2) as mitral insufficiency, (3) continuous murmur, or in adults (4) by sudden death. Visualization of the coronary arteries provides the definitive diagnosis, {{and the problem is}} the selection for this pro-cedure. The electrocardiogram, the most helpful laboratory aid, is diagnostic of infarc-tion in 80 % of the infant group; in the remainder other forms of cardiomyopathy may be confused. Although blood flows directly into the pulmonary artery in the majority of cases, it flows in the reverse direction <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> this must be determined preopera-tively. Some unanswered questions are the subject of discussion: Why the majority of infants have onset of symptoms at about 8 weeks of age, and why some survive to child-hood and adult life. The pathological findings are reviewed. Although the greatest sur-gical therapy experience has been with obliteration of the anomalous left coronary artery (ALCA) at its connection with the pulmonary artery, anastomosis between aorta and ALCA provides an additive supply for both the present and the future...|$|E

40|$|Background Seventeen {{distinct}} pollination {{systems are}} known for genera of sub-Saharan African Iridaceae and recurrent shifts in pollination system have evolved in those with ten or more species. Pollination by long-tongued anthophorine bees foraging for nectar and coincidentally acquiring pollen on some part of their bodies is the inferred ancestral pollination strategy for most genera of the large subfamilies Iridoideae and Crocoideae and may be ancestral for the latter. Derived strategies include pollination by long-proboscid flies, large butterflies, night-flying hovering and settling moths, hopliine beetles and sunbirds. Bee pollination is diverse, with active pollen collection by female bees occurring in several genera, vibratile systems <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> non-volatile oil as a reward in one species. Long-proboscid fly pollination, which is apparently restricted to southern Africa, includes four separate syndromes using different sets of flies and plant species {{in different parts of}} the subcontinent. Small numbers of species use bibionid flies, short-proboscid flies or wasps for their pollination; only about 2 % of species use multiple pollinators and can be described as generalists. Scope Using pollination observations for 375 species and based on repeated patterns of floral attractants and rewards, we infer pollination mechanisms for an additional 610 species. Matching pollination system to phylogeny or what is known about species relationships based on shared derived features, we infer repeated shifts in pollination system in some genera, as frequently as one shift for every five or six species of southern Africa...|$|E
40|$|Forty-three (43) {{schools in}} the City of Richmond were used for this study. The rooms in these schools that were {{selected}} for testing were those rooms in which complaints about air quality were made by school staff.

Air-O-Cell (AOC) samples were taken in all schools, swab samples were taken <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> in the rest biotapes were used. Samples that were taken were analyzed and interpreted at AmeriSci Laboratories, an accredited industrial hygiene laboratory. Documentation was done for the sampling methods. Statistical analysis was run on the data received. Tables of results were made, discussions done and conclusions drawn from the laboratory results. The null hypothesis for this study is that 2 ̆ 2 Total inside mold counts are not elevated above the total outside mold counts in Richmond Public Schools 2 ̆ 2 and the alternative hypothesis is that 2 ̆ 2 Total inside mold counts are elevated above the total outside mold counts in Richmond Public Schools 2 ̆ 2.

40|$|Most {{multispectral}} sensors such as Landsat 7 ETM+, ASTER, and ALI measure {{reflected energy}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>and</b> separated wavelength bands and are thereby {{referred to as}} multispectral. In contrast, hyperspectral imaging spectrometers have a sufficient amount of continuous spectral channels to resolve the spectral variability of the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface. This study focuses on uncovering the spectral complexity of Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero, White Sands. They are remnants of Lake Otero and together form {{the primary source of}} gypsum that forms the dune field of the White Sands. One of the goals {{of this study was to}} compare the information dimensionality limits of Landsat 7 ETM+, ASTER and ALI data with high spectral resolution, low signal-to-noise Hyperion data, using AVIRIS data as a high spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise standard. Information dimensionality thresholds constrain the number of evaporite mineral and textural endmembers that can be detected, mapped, or unmixed using standard image processing methods. In this case, eigen analysis of the Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) transformation and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) results were used to uncover the information dimensionality limits of all these datasets. The Pixel Purity Index (PPI), and n-D Visualization were used to identify spectrally distinct endmember classes, and along with ground truth and field spectra provide insights into the origin of the spectral variability uncovered in all of the datasets. The results confirm that AVIRIS and Hyperion data have higher information dimensionality thresholds exceeding the number of available bands of Landsat 7 ETM+, ASTER, and ALI data. AVIRIS has higher information dimensionality thresholds than Hyperion because of its 410 x increase in signal-to-noise over Hyperion. Much of the information dimensionality uncovered by AVIRIS and Hyperion datasets can be due differences in vegetation landcover, grain size variations, and moisture contents as opposed to mineral compositional variations. These endmember components uncovered at Alkali Flat and Lake Lucero include: (1) dry gypsum, (2) wet gypsum, (3) water, (4) vegetation, and (5) clastic sediment dominated by ferric iron and calcite. The spectral signatures of these endmembers at the resolution of AVIRIS, Hyperion, ALI, ASTER, and Landsat 7 ETM+ agreed with field and laboratory spectral analysis.
