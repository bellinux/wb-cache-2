Dish asserted that AutoHop would encourage its customers to sample new programming. Leslie Moonves, CBS chief executive, asked rhetorically how he is to produce CSI without the revenue stream of commercials. News Corporation refused to accept Dish advertising for the device. A <b>Forrester</b> <b>Research</b> analyst said the move demonstrated Dish's desperation to keep customers at a time when alternative programming is readily available via the Internet.|$|E
