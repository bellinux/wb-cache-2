40|$|Properdin (P), {{a highly}} basic euglobulin, was {{purified}} from human serum to molecular homogeneity {{without the use}} of zymosan. Isolated P was found to efficiently initiate activation of the alternate pathway of complement activation (C 3 activator or properdin system) and to be an essential component during its early reaction stages. The activity of isolated P did not require the presence of an activating polysaccharide. It was therefore concluded that purified P had been obtained in an activated form (P). In an isolated reaction system containing purified C 3, C 3 proactivator (C 3 PA), and C 3 proactivator convertase (C 3 PAse), P was able to mediate the activation of C 3 PAse which in turn activated C 3 PA to cleave C 3. This activation of C 3 PAse was found to depend on the presence of native C 3. These results allowed the formulation of a concept in which P is <b>envisaged</b> to <b>act</b> as a modulator of native C 3 enabling it to activate C 3 PAse. Activation of C 3 was efficiently mediated by P in the fluid phase. Efficient activation of C 5, however, required the participation of an insoluble polysaccharide (zymosan). The possibility is raised therefore that P might also {{be an integral part of}} the multimolecular C 5 convertase of the alternate pathway of complement activation...|$|R

The project was driven by Sir Sydney Hedley Waterlow, Bart., the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gravesend and Deputy Chairman of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) which had built the Chatham Main Line. The LCDR's great rival, the South Eastern Railway (SER), attempted to block the scheme by seeking parliamentary authorisation for a loop line towards Northfleet and Snodland which would take in land required by the Gravesend Railway.

The dynamics of the projected baseline debtâ€“GDP ratio are largely shaped by the provisions of the Act and underlying demographic factors during the projection horizon.

When the Act was first passed in December 1995 it was considered to be a major break through in obtaining equality and protection for disabled people. This research demonstrated how Section 1 of the Disability Discrimination Act is fundamentally flawed. The dissertation starts by considering why disabled people are socially excluded - with such examples as building design, employment issues and inaccessible transport. Using this background it looked at how the anti-discrimination law evolved and its framework developed. Moreover, the research looks at how Section 1 was developed on the medical model and how the concept of disability is gradually moving towards that of a more accessible social model. Through the use of case law it demonstrates how people with mental and physical impairment had been not gained the protection of Section 1, as previously <b>envisaged</b> when the <b>Act</b> was first passed. Furthermore, the research shows how limited the definition of disability is when considering inclusions and exclusions under the legislation. Finally, the dissertation looks at the new amendments implemented under the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, and whether they are effective in addressing the fundamental flaws of the original Act...|$|R
