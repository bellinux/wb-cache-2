5|$|In the {{following}} match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, {{due to a}} pre-match stipulation, to hit {{each other in the}} face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing water on her, but he hit Michaels as well. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she walked backstage.|$|E

25|$|She chose {{a spiritual}} director, a Jesuit, Father Pichon. At their first meeting, 28 May 1888, {{she made a}} general {{confession}} going back over all her past sins. She came away from it profoundly relieved. The priest who had himself suffered from scruples, understood her and reassured <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> months later, he left for Canada, and Thérèse would {{only be able to}} ask his advice by letter and his replies were rare.

During her time as a postulant, Thérèse had to endure some bullying from other sisters because of her lack of aptitude for handicrafts and manual work. Sister St Vincent de Paul, the finest embroiderer in the community made her feel awkward and even called her 'the big nanny goat'.
