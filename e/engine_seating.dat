It was a flat sided structure of mixed construction, with plywood covering around the nose and cabin and metal around the <b>engine.</b> <b>Seating</b> was enclosed, with access via fuselage side doors. The flat cabin top continued behind the cabin to the engine housing, where an 82 kW (110 hp) Alfa-Romeo 110-I 4-cylinder inverted air-cooled in-line engine was mounted in pusher configuration.|$|E
5000|$|Between 1933 and 1942 the GWR {{received}} 38 diesel power cars. The first stream-lined car {{used one}} AEC [...] <b>engine,</b> <b>seating</b> 69 passengers. This {{was followed by}} three cars with two engines for a cross country service between Birmingham and Cardiff, then suburban passenger cars and a parcels car. No 18 was designed to pull horse boxes and with electro-pneumatic multiple unit control, followed by twenty more to a similar design. The last four were built with only one driving compartment so as to operate in pairs with a trailer between them. [...] a GWR diesel railcar is preserved in running order at the Didcot Railway Centre, one is a static exhibit at the Museum of the Great Western Railway and one is being restored at the Kent and East Sussex Railway.|$|E
5000|$|A cargo {{version of}} the Caravan, called the Mini Ram Van, was also {{introduced}} in 1984, renamed the Caravan C/V for 1989 and discontinued after 1995. It was available either with the short- or long-wheelbase models. Unique to the Caravan C/V was the option of either having the traditional hatch door in the back or the optional swing-out bi-parting doors (with or without windows), {{similar to those of}} more traditional cargo vans. These doors were made of fiberglass and required the C/V vans to be [...] "drop shipped", as these doors were custom installed by another vendor. Also based on the Mini Ram and C/V were aftermarket conversion vans sold through official Chrysler dealers and from the conversion companies themselves.The vans were updated for 1987, receiving new headlamps, a new grille and new taillamps, with some minor interior revisions and a new optional V6 <b>engine.</b> <b>Seating</b> arrangements were now limited to seating for five standard and for seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. Deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models. Additionally, the vans were now available in a long wheelbase variant, marketed as the Grand Voyager and Grand Caravan, which allowed more cargo space behind the rear seat. The Grand Caravan was available in all trim levels, while the Grand Voyager was only available in SE and LE trims. later in 1987, for the 1988 model year, the Chrysler began exporting the minivans to Europe, where it was sold as the Chrysler Voyager. Despite the name, the European Voyager was a rebranded Dodge Caravan, with all the Caravan's trim and styling features, that was adopted to meet European safety and emissions standards. The European Voyager had all the same options and equipment as the Caravan, though the V6 engine was not available as it didn't meet European emission standards. In 1989, the Caravan and Voyager received new front and rear bumpers, as well as new top-of-the-line trims of ES and LX, respectively. Additionally, a luxury Chrysler Town & Country model was launched. Originally intended to be a 1989 model, the Chrysler Town & Country minivan was ultimately introduced as a 1990 model in the spring of 1989. The S-platform Town & Country was the first 1990 model year Chrysler minivan as the Dodge and Plymouth counterparts produced alongside the Town & Country continued under the previous model year until June 1989. Sharing the body of the long-wheelbase (LWB) Grand Voyager/Grand Caravan's Chrysler S platform, the Town & Country was externally distinguished by its chrome waterfall grille, crystal pentastar hood ornament, standard woodgrain applique, grooved lower body cladding (a stretched version of that found on the Caravan ES), and 15" [...] lace-spoke aluminum wheels. Additionally, Town & Country was only available in two exterior colors. Initially, it was available exclusively in Bright White Clearcoat; Black Clearcoat was added in June 1989, coinciding with the release of the 1990 Caravans and Voyagers. As the Chrysler Corporation's most luxurious minivan, the Town & Country came standard with nearly every feature available on Plymouth and Dodge minivans in addition to some exclusive amenities of its own. This included unique gathered leather seating surfaces and door trim panels, front and rear air conditioning, power windows, power locks, an Infinity sound system, seven-passenger seating, luggage rack, and an electronically controlled four-speed automatic transmission. Early vehicles were equipped with 3.0 L Mitsubishi 6G72 V6 engines, while those produced from June 1989 onward received an upgrade to Chrysler's in-house 3.3 L EGA V6. As all vehicles equipped with the 3.0 L engine were produced alongside 1989 Dodge and Plymouth models, the United States Environmental Protection Agency classifies such vans as 1989 models rather than 1990s, despite the VINs indicating otherwise. Total S-platform Town & Country production was 1,789 units in 1989 and 3,615 in 1990, making this model of the Town & Country as the most obscure of all the Chrysler minivans.|$|E
