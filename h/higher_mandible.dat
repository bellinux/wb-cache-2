40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the provision of dental implants can improve the oral function of subjects with severely resorbed mandibles, possibly restoring function to the level experienced by satisfied wearers of conventional complete dentures. Nevertheless, a quantitative comparison has never been made and can be drawn from the literature only with difficulty, since studies differ greatly in methodology. To make such a comparison, we measured bite force and chewing efficiency by using identical methods in subjects with overdentures, complete full dentures, and natural dentitions. Our results indicated that bite forces achieved with overdentures on dental implants were between those achieved with artificial and natural dentitions. Chewing efficiency was significantly greater than that of subjects with full dentures (low mandible), but was still lower than that of subjects with full dentures (<b>high</b> <b>mandible)</b> and overdentures on bare roots. Differences in the height of the mandible revealed significant differences in chewing efficiency between the two full-denture groups. Furthermore, subjects with a shortened dental arch exerted bite forces similar to those of subjects with a complete-natural dentition, but their chewing efficiency was limited due to the reduced occlusal area. For all groups combined, a significant correlation was found between maximum bite force and chewing efficiency. Nearly hair of the variation in chewing efficiency was explained by bite force alone...|$|R
50|$|M. ochagaviae {{is known}} to be the most common species from the Santa Maria Formation, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Named after Mário Costa Barberena.

40|$|Damselfishes show {{significant}} biodiversity in {{the coral}} reefs. To better understand such diversity, an ecomorphological approach {{was investigated in}} the trophic morphology of eight species of Pomacentridae (Chromis acares, C. margaritifer, Dascyllus aruanus, D. flavicaudus, Pomacentrus pavo, Plectroglyphidodon johnstonianus, Pl. lacrymatus and Stegastes nigricans) belonging to different trophic guilds (zooplankton, algal, coral polyp feeders and omnivores). Geometric morphometrics were used to quantify size and shape variations in four skeletal units: (1) neurocranium, (2) suspensorium and opercle, (3) mandible and (4) premaxilla. This method allowed us to reveal shape and size differences correlated to functional diversity both within and between trophic guilds. Among zooplanktivores, C. margaritifer, D. aruanus and D. flavicaudus have a high and long supraoccipital crest, short mandibles forming a small mouth and high suspensoria and opercles. These three species can {{be considered to be}} suction feeders. In the same guild, C. acares shows opposite characteristics (long and thin mandibles, lengthened neurocranium and suspensorium) and can be considered as a ram feeder. Among herbivores and corallivores, the two species of Plectroglyphidodon and S. nigricans can be considered as grazers. Differences in skeletal shape are mainly related to improving the robustness of some skeletal parts (broad hyomandibular, short and <b>high</b> <b>mandibles).</b> The shapes of P. pavo, which feeds largely on algae, strongly differ from that of the other three grazers exhibiting similar morphological characteristics to C. acares (e. g., long and shallow suspensorium, lengthened neurocranium). This highlights likely differences concerning cutting or scraping method. Finally, no strong correlations exist between size and shapes in the eight studied species. Size difference among species having a very similar shape could be viewed as a factor optimizing resource partitioning. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Foraging {{behavior}} and partitioning of foraging areas of Odonomachus bauri were investigated on Barro Colorado Island in Panama. The {{activity of the}} ants did not show any daily pattern; foragers were active day and night. The type of prey captured by O. bauri supports the idea that in higher Odontomachus and Anochetus species, the <b>high</b> speed of <b>mandible</b> closure serves more for generating power than capturing elusive prey. Polydomous nests may enable O. bauri colonies to enlarge their foraging areas...|$|R
30|$|This {{study showed}} that low bone quality, as {{assessed}} by clinical and image methods, is related with low primary stability of 6 -mm short implants placed at the posterior region of the maxilla and <b>mandible.</b> <b>Higher</b> insertion torque values were associated with better bone types and higher mean gray values in CT images. Insertion torque had a negative moderate association with bone type categorization by intra-surgical tactile evaluation and visual assessment of CT images. In addition, a positive moderate association was found between insertion torque and average mean gray values, {{as well as for}} segmental mean gray values in the axial, coronal, and sagittal ROIs.|$|R

40|$|The human mandibles {{belonging}} to Uruguayan population present some anatomic differences with those {{belonging to}} Brazilian population. This {{appears to be}} determined by racial and ethnic characteristics of each country. This study examined the morphological characteristics of 100 Uruguayan mandibles and compared them with similar number of Brazilian bones, using thirteen measurements stipulated by Humphrey et al. (1999). The significant variations in mean values were calculated by Mann-Whitney test (alpha= 5 %). Expressive discrepancies were observed between the two populations regarding some of analyzed dimensions. The Uruguayan <b>mandibles</b> showed <b>higher</b> values in almost all measurements when compared to the Brazilian ones, except for the mandibular symphysis height, which was lightly <b>higher</b> in Brazilian <b>mandibles.</b> Differences were observed in notch and ramus height, mandibular length, mandibular width, symphysis height and bicoronoid width. Several factors could be responsible for these morphological discrepancies, including functional and biomechanical adaptations of stomatognathic system, stimulated by different consistency of the diet or miscegenation...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{sediment}} samples, a small quantity of hand-collected shell, and four boxes of hand-col 1 ected bone from deposits revealed by excavations at County Hall, Beverley, East Riding of Yorkshire, were submitted for {{an evaluation of}} their bioarchaeological potential. Four of the sediment samples produced assemblages of charred plant remains, which seem to have formed through the burning of thatch. Examples {{of this kind of}} material are extremely rare. In view of the unusual nature of the plant material, further analysis of the samples from the present evaluation is recommended. The small quantity of hand-collected shell was mostly well-preserved oyster valves of only limited interpretative value. A small but very well preserved assemblage of vertebrate remains from 46 very closely dated contexts which, with one exception, were dated to the 12 th and 13 th centuries. A limited range of species was identified, revealing a predominance of caprovids which is analogous to similarly dated assemblages from Beverley.

40|$|Abstract: The {{incidence}} of mucous and ciliated cells in epithelial linings was examined among odontogenic inflammatory cysts (radicular cysts) and developmental cysts (dentigerous and primordial cysts). Mucous cells {{were found in}} 20. 8 % of all cysts examined, while ciliated cells were found in 11. 4 %; however, ciliated cells were always accompanied by mucous cells. The {{incidence of}} mucous cells in radicular cysts and dentigerous cysts and that of ciliated cells in radicular cysts was higher in the maxilla than in the mandible, while the incidence of mucous cells in primordial cysts and that of ciliated cells in dentigerous cysts and primordial cysts was <b>higher</b> in the <b>mandible</b> than in the maxilla. The present results regarding mucous cells and ciliated cells in the epithelial linings of intraosseous odontogenic cysts indicate a metaplasic origin, but the cause and biological significance of this phenomenon is not known. Mucous cells {{were present in the}} surface layer of epithelial linings, and intra-epithelial gland-like structures lined with mucous cells were observed in the hyperplastic regions of epithelial linings of several radicular and dentigerous cysts. Such gland-like structures lined by mucous cells in the thickened epithelial lining, which have not been demonstrated previously, resembled the glandular structures of “glandular odontogenic cysts”.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} frequency, anatomic location, and morphology {{of mental}} and genial spinal foramina {{in a group}} of Thai population. Materials and Methods: A total of 107 maxillofacial cone-beam computed tomography scans were collected and analyzed for frequency, anatomic location and morphology of mental and genial spinal foramina. Data were analyzed using Chi-Square test, one-way ANOVA and independent t-test. P values less than 0. 05 were accepted as statistically significant. Results: The mental foramen was located at the apex of second premolar in 46 % and between apices of premolars 35. 8 %. Round and oval mental foramina were found in 65 % and 21 % of patients, respectively. The superior and inferior genial spinal foramina were encountered in 80. 3 % and 32. 7 % of patients, respectively. The accessory mental foramen was identified in 6. 6 % of patients. The average distance from the center of mental foramen to the alveolar and basal borders of mandibular body was 11. 70 ± 2. 13 and 16. 34 ± 3. 79 mm, respectively. Conclusion: This study indicates that horizontal position of mental foramen in Thai population is remarkably variable. Cone beam computerized tomography is optimal for delineating diminutive anatomical structures in the anterior <b>mandible.</b> <b>High</b> prevalence rates of superior and inferior genial spinal foramina necessitate comprehensive CBCT screening before surgery in the interforaminal region of the mandible...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Mandibular retrognathism is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} risk factor for upper airway obstruction. Aim: This cross-sectional study intended to examine the relationship between craniofacial morphology and the pharyngeal airway space (PAS) in patients with mandibular retrognathism and mandibular prognathism, when compared to normal subjects. The study also analyzed the influence of mandibular morphology on pharyngeal length (PL). Materials and Methods: The PAS was assessed in 92 females (age 15 - 30 years) further divided into three groups - Group 1 - normal mandible (76 °≤ SNB ≤ 82 °; n = 31); Group 2 - mandibular retrognathism (SNB 82 °; n = 30). All subjects were examined by lateral cephalometry with head position standardized using an inclinometer. Craniocervical angulation, uvula length, thickness and angulation were compared among different groups. Results: The results showed no statistically significant difference in the pharyngeal airway between the three groups. Measurements of PL showed statistically significant higher values for retrognathic mandible group than normal and prognathic mandible group. Conclusion: There is no significant difference between PAS between patients with mandibular retrognathism, normal mandible and mandibular prognathism. Mandibular retrognathism patients show a significantly higher uvula angulation than patients with mandibular prognathism. Craniocervical angulation showed maximum value in retrognathic mandible group followed by normal and prognathic mandible group respectively. Mean PL for retrognathic mandible patients was significantly <b>higher</b> than prognathic <b>mandible</b> patients...|$|R
40|$|Habitual snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea in children, {{which are}} {{frequently}} associated with adenotonsillar hypertrophy, may begin {{early in life}} and in relation with orocraniofacial features. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the presence of early bone craniofacial modifications in young children with along history of habitual snoring. Twenty-six habitually snoring children (mean age 4. 6 yrs) were studied by nocturnal portable recording or diurnal polysomnography, cephalometry and orthodontic evaluation. A comparison of cephalometric findings was made between the studied group and 26 age-matched children (mean age 5. 1 yrs) with no history of snoring or respiratory problems during sleep. The cephalometric analyses showed a significant increase in craniomandibular intermaxillar, lower and upper goniac angles with a retroposition and posterior rotation of the <b>mandible</b> (<b>high</b> angle face) and a reduction in the rhinopharynx space caused by higher thickness of adenoids in habitually snoring children compared with controls. Cross-bites and labial incompetence as well as daytime symptoms and familiarity for habitual snoring were found in most of the studied group of snorers compared with controls. The results indicate that upper airway obstruction during sleep is associated with mild but significant cephalometric and craniofacial modifications in children complaining of habitual snoring. Whether this skeletal conformation is genetically determined or influenced by the early onset of habitual snoring remains to be assessed...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The primary {{dental implant}} {{stability}} {{depends on the}} location of the implant in the jaw. This study analysed the architecture and mineralization of the trabecular bone at different jaw locations and thereby identified potential prognostic factors for implant failure. It has checked the hypotheses: (1) the mandible contains more compact and less mineralized trabecular bone than the maxilla and (2) within the mandible the trabecular bone is more compact and less mineralized in the anterior region. Methods Alveolar bone specimens were produced from the cadavers of ten humans (7 males and 3 females; mean age: 73. 7 ± 12. 5 years) and scanned with a high-resolution microCT system. Volumes of interest were chosen next to the roots of molars and incisors in both the maxilla and mandible. Several morphological parameters as well as the tissue mineral density were determined. Results The alveolar bone specimens had a very high bone volume fraction (mean = 0. 31) with large differences (SD = 0. 17) between and within subjects. Yet several {{significant differences were found between}} the maxilla and the mandible. The bone volume fraction and trabecular thickness were significantly <b>higher</b> in the <b>mandible</b> than in the maxilla (p < 0. 01). But the tissue mineral density was not significantly different. Conclusions A higher primary implant stability coincides with a higher bone volume fraction and degree of anisotropy Although local differences remain more important for implantology, the results suggest that the micro-structure also affects the implant stability. The tissue mineral density seems to have no predictive value...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{elucidate}} {{the prevalence of}} ectopic eruption, impaction, and primary and secondary retention as well as agenesis of the permanent second molar (M 2) among adolescents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a sample size calculation, dental records, including radiographs, of 1543 patients (722 girls and 821 boys), from three clinics {{in the city of}} Malmoe, Sweden, were retrospectively analyzed. Series of annual records and radiographs were examined for all patients from 10 to 16 years of age and were carried out during 2004 - 2006. The prevalence of ectopic eruption, impaction, and primary and secondary retention as well as agenesis of M 2 s was registered in a standardized manner and according to preset definitions. In addition, the times of emergence of the M 2 s were recorded. RESULTS: The prevalence of ectopic eruption of M 2 was 1. 5 %, the prevalence of primary retention was 0. 6 %, and the prevalence of impaction was 0. 2 %. This means that the overall prevalence of eruption disturbances was 2. 3 %. In addition, the prevalence of agenesis was 0. 8 %. The prevalence of ectopic eruption was significantly <b>higher</b> in the <b>mandible.</b> Those patients with eruption disturbances and agenesis of M 2 showed significantly delayed eruption of their other M 2 s compared to the individuals without any eruption disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of eruption disturbances was higher than reported earlier, and, even if the disturbances do not occur frequently, it is important to develop an early diagnosis in order to start the treatment at the optimal time...|$|R
40|$|Backround: Traumatic facial {{soft tissue}} and dental {{injuries}} are hazardous in childhood. The primary {{aim of this}} study was to determine the frequency and severity of accidents resulting in peri- and intraoral injuries in different age groups. Secondary endpoints were possible gender-related differences regarding types of accidents as well as a correlation of minor facial injuries and treatment of these wounds in general anesthesia. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed (2003 - 2004) of 500 children (71 % boys / 29 % girls) treated for peri- and intraoral traumatic injuries at the department of paediatric surgery at the Charité Hospital over a timeperiod of 18 month. A case report form was used recording parameters such as age, gender, location and type of accident, type of injury and treatment. Statistical analysis was performed using chi-square test. Results: Overall accidents peaked at age 1 - 4 years (51, 6 %) mostly occurring domesticly (50, 4 %) or in traffic (21 %). Most common types of accidents were falls on even ground (29, 6 %) and trauma from impact (16, 8 %). A statistical significance was found regarding type of accident, gender and age-group. Girls age 1 - 4 years had a higher rate of accidents at home, while boys age 5 - 9 years more often had traffic and leisure time accidents. The group of 1 - 4 year old had the highest incidence of falls from a flight of stairs or out of high chairs. However 40 % of boys (1 - 4 years) fell significantly often on even ground. The 5 - 9 year olds had the highest incident of skating or bike riding accidents. The age 10 - 17 year olds had the <b>highest</b> incidence of <b>mandible</b> fractures due to physical controversies. Injuries included oral injuries (48 %), dental trauma (37 %), tongue injuries (9 %) and jaw injuries (6 %). The group of 1 - 4 year olds showed the highest incidence of intraoral soft tissue injuries. The 5 - 9 year olds had the highest rate of trauma to the incisors. The 10 - 17 year olds mostly had mandible fractures. 19 % of the children received out-patient wound treatment. 13, 6 % patients needed general anesthesia. 50 % of these were children age 1 - 4. Conclusion: In this study minor injuries in toddlers often called for a surgical treatment in general anesthesia. Establishing a national registry to collect accident-related data is advisable. This could lead to a systematic and effective prevention of accidents in children in Germany...|$|R
