5|$|Imelda Staunton voiced the Tall Flower Faces. Though {{there are}} many flowers that appear around Underland, {{only one of them}} speaks and one of them <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> {{caricature}} of Staunton. Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly {{at the beginning of the}} film.|$|E
5|$|Characteristics of {{the tail}} {{vertebrae}} {{and the presence of}} osteoderms indicate that Ampelosaurus belongs to Lithostrotia, a group of derived titanosaurians which also includes Alamosaurus and Saltasaurus. Many other paleotologists have classified Ampelosaurus as belonging to Titanosauria, Saltasauridae, and Titanosauridae. Ampelosaurus may have an uncertain classification, but it <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> titanosaur, with many features found in titanosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Gymnopils maritimus <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} species from {{other members of}} its clade, despite their close relation. All other species in the clade grow upon dead wood and have well-developed rings on their stems. The spores also differ; {{in the case of}} G.junonius and G.spectabilis (often considered synonymous), as well as G.pampeanus, they are narrower, {{and in the case of}} G.imperialis, they are wider. Of the other members of the clade, only G.junonius and G.spectabilis also grow in Europe.|$|E

5|$|These {{provisions}} {{are similar to}} those set out in section 5 of the Theft Act 1968 in relation to theft. It <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> right of property ownership to deal with property as one wishes, including its damage or destruction. However a person setting fire to his own house which is subject to a mortgage can be charged because the mortgagee will have a proprietary right or interest in the property. Property that is abandoned has no owner, and cannot be stolen; it follows that such property cannot be the subject of a charge of criminal damage.|$|E
25|$|The reddish Koschevnikov's bee (Apis koschevnikovi) from Borneo <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> {{distinct}} species; {{it probably}} {{derives from the}} first colonization of the island by cave-nesting honey bees.|$|E

25|$|Searle {{argues that}} {{philosophy}} has been trapped by a false dichotomy: that, {{on the one}} hand, the world consists of nothing but objective particles in fields of force, but that yet, on the other hand, consciousness <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> subjective first-person experience.|$|E

50|$|Through June of 2017, {{the only}} law that <b>was</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> {{reaction}} to anti-Trump protests to pass {{was one in}} Arkansas, which was then vetoed by the governor. North Dakota passed a law outlawing the wearing of masks in public forums, but {{this may have been}} more a reaction to anti-oil pipeline protests. Oklahoma's new anti-protest laws <b>were</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> reaction to this type of disruption that would undermine the state's economy.|$|R

25|$|The facade on Dworcowa street {{shed light}} on the fact that {{initially}} the tenement has been designed as two different houses, N°15 & 15a. There <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> divide between the left part bending on Neo-Renaissance style (symmetry, naked walls, flat roof) and the right one inclining on eclecticist diversity (balconies, bossage wall, cartouche decoration, mansard roof).|$|E
25|$|External {{validity}} {{pertains to}} the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. Internal validity <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> prerequisite for external validity.|$|E

25|$|The magical tale of Ambrosius Aurelianus {{and the two}} dragons found beneath Dinas Emrys. This {{origin of}} the later legend of Merlin <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> local tale that had {{attracted}} the names of Vortigern and Ambrosius to usurp the roles of earlier characters. Neither of them has any association with that remote part of Wales, but the character Vortigern is best known to us because of this tale.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introduction}} to book seven, Vitruvius goes {{to great lengths to}} present why he is qualified to write De Architectura. This is the only location in the work where Vitruvius specifically addresses his personal breadth of knowledge. Similar to a modern reference section, the author's position as one who is knowledgeable and educated is established. The topics range across many fields of expertise reflecting that in Roman times as today construction is a diverse field. Vitruvius <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> well-read man.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{measurable}} increase in discarding {{immediately following the}} introduction of the ITQ system, despite the fact that fishermen were offered 10% of the market price for fish landed outside quota. In an attempt to address this change, the New Zealand Government increased the percentage of market price paid to 50%. The balance between offering an incentive to land discarded fish and the disincentive to catch fish over or outside quota limits <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> fine one, and dependent on the financial reward or penalty attached.|$|E

25|$|P. vivax <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> less potent {{agent of}} natural {{selection}} that is P. falciparum. However, the morbidity of P. vivax is not negligible. For example, P. vivax infections induce a greater inflammatory response in the lungs than is observed in P. falciparum infections, and progressive alveolar capillary dysfunction is observed after the treatment of vivax malaria. Epidemiological studies in the Amazonian region of Brazil {{have shown that the}} number and rate of hospital admissions for P. vivax infections have recently increased while those of P. falciparum have decreased.|$|E
25|$|The {{description}} in the Bychowiec Chronicle <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> piece of Lithuanian propaganda. The chronicle was compiled {{in the first}} half of the 16th century when Lithuania and Moscow were engaged in a series of Muscovite–Lithuanian Wars. The wars were unsuccessful for Lithuania – it lost a significant portion of its territory, including the strategically important Smolensk in 1514. Therefore, the chronicle used the historical event to encourage the Lithuanians to fight. The episode with the spear was probably borrowed from Polish historiography: King Boleslaus I of Poland used his sword (Szczerbiec) to hit the Golden Gate in Kiev in 1018.|$|E
25|$|In his 2004 {{study of}} the event, {{historian}} David K. Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover's homosexuality as relying {{on the kind of}} tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected: guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip. He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible <b>is</b> <b>clearly</b> <b>a</b> homophobic fantasy. He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appeared in compromising situations.|$|E
