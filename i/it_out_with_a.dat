The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than form droplets. There are commercial products that can be used {{as an alternative to the}} saliva method, some of which are more effective and last longer.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match was}} the Doubles Final between {{the top two}} seeds Květa Peschke & Katarina Srebotnik and Liezel Huber & Lisa Raymond. Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond wrapped up a {{breakthrough}} year at the TEB BNP Paribas WTA Championships, capturing their fourth title in their last six events with a 64 64 win on Sunday over Květa Peschke and Katarina Srebotnik, losing three straight games from 64 31 but regrouping and winning three straight games of their own to finish it. They fell short on their first two match points but Huber closed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> backhand volley at Srebotnik's body.|$|E
25|$|Masks tend to fog when warm humid {{exhaled air}} {{condenses}} {{on the cold}} inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around {{the inside of the}} glass and rinse <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.|$|E

25|$|While Mary {{manages the}} children, other {{problems}} lie with their parents. Winifred {{is aware that}} she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband ("Being Mrs Banks"). George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult ("Cherry Tree Lane (reprise)"). In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party. Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lesson ("A Spoonful of Sugar").

500|$|He meets {{that girl}} the next day. Though {{the girl is}} both [...] "fascinated and repelled", the warlock persuades {{her to come to}} a dinner feast at his castle. During the feast, she tells him that she needs to know he has a heart. The warlock shows her his beating hairy heart inside a crystal casket in his dungeon. The witch begs him to put it back inside himself. After the warlock does so, she embraces him. However, being {{disconnected}} from its body for so long, his heart has developed savage tastes as it has degenerated into an animalistic state. And so he is driven to take by force a truly human heart. He tears out the witch's heart to replace his own, but finding that he cannot magic the hairy heart back out of his chest, he cuts <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dagger. Thus he and the maiden both die, with him holding both hearts in his hands.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} 10 deleted scenes where Homer {{turns on the}} radio {{listening}} to a song about a trucker who crashed his truck out on I-95, and one more {{where some of the}} truckers try to flatten Homer's truck. In order to animate Barclay's truck in [...] "Maximum Homerdrive", Scott bought a model truck, which he also based the design of Barclay's truck on. According to storyboard consultant Mike B. Anderson, the trucks in the episode were very difficult to animate, as the Simpsons animators were still working with traditional cel animation at the time and did not have access to computer tools. In a scene in The Slaughterhouse, an employee is shown killing a number of cows with a captive bolt pistol, however the death of the cows are not shown. Originally, the writers wanted to show the cows being killed, however when Scott saw the scene in the storyboards, the Simpsons staff instead decided to make the deaths [...] "indirect". During the meat eating contest, Homer becomes exhausted and sees two wine glass holding cows, who appear as [...] "wavy" [...] figures. In order to achieve the [...] "wavy" [...] effect, the Simpsons animators put a ripple glass on the cels and moved it around while shooting the scene. After the contest, Barclay dies of [...] "beef poisoning". The Fox censors were uneasy with including any mention of [...] "beef poisoning" [...] in the episode, as talk show host Oprah Winfrey had recently been sued by [...] "some Texas ranchers" [...] for defaming the beef industry. In a scene in the episode, Homer buys a jar of [...] "Stimu-Crank" [...] pills in order to stay alert while driving during the night. He swallows all the pills at once, to the clerk's dismay. Homer replies, [...] "No problem, I'll balance <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bottle of sleeping pills", and proceeds to swallow an entire jar's worth of sleeping pills. According to Scully, the censors had [...] "a lot of trouble" [...] with the scene, but it was included anyhow.|$|E

5000|$|Joe Butler (18 May 1866 - 1 January 1941) was an African American boxer who was {{the colored}} middleweight {{champion}} of the world in the Gay Nineties.

2500|$|MiQuale Lewis {{started the}} scoring {{in the game}} as he ran for a 10-yard {{touchdown}} run. On Ball State's next series, Davis completed a 40-yard touchdown pass to Lewis Johnson, whose [...] "stop-and-go" [...] move enabled him to elude two defenders. Western Michigan responded with a trick play, scoring when Tim Hiller threw a lateral to backup quarterback Drew Burdi, who turned and threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Scneider Julien, making it 14–7. The Broncos tied it {{early in the second}} quarter on a pass from Hiller to Juan Nunez, who caught the nine-yard pass over his shoulder. The Cardinals broke the tie on a 43-yard field goal from Ian McGarvey and took a 24–14 halftime lead when Davis ran for a six-yard touchdown run. Lewis' one-yard touchdown run late in the third quarter and Trey Lewis' interception return made it 38–14. Western Michigan closed to 38–22 early in the fourth when Brandon West scored on an eight-yard touchdown run. But Lewis closed <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> one-yard touchdown run with 4:31 to go, his twentieth rushing score of the season, which broke the previous record set by Mark Bornholdt in 1979. The Cardinals completed their first perfect regular season since 1949, their first undefeated season in Mid-American Conference play since 1978 and clinched a spot in the conference title game. The win gave Ball State its first Mid-American Conference West title in program history. A school record 11,088students and 23,861overall attended the game. The Cardinals moved up to #12 in the BCS and Associated Press poll and up to #13 in the USA Today coaches poll.|$|E
