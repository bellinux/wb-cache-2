5|$|In 1963, Lutosławski {{fulfilled}} {{a commission}} for the Music Biennale Zagreb, his Trois poèmes d'Henri Michaux for chorus and orchestra. It {{was the first}} work he had written for a commission from abroad, and brought him further international acclaim. It earned him a second State Prize for music (Lutosławski was not cynical about the award this time), and Lutosławski gained an agreement for the <b>international</b> <b>publication</b> of his music with Chester Music, then part of the Hansen publishing house. His String Quartet was first performed in Stockholm in 1965, followed the same year by the first performance of his orchestral song-cycle Paroles tissées. This shortened title was suggested by the poet , who had published the poems as Quatre tapisseries pour la Châtelaine de Vergi. The song cycle {{is dedicated to the}} tenor Peter Pears, who first performed it at the 1965 Aldeburgh Festival with the composer conducting. The Aldeburgh Festival was founded and organised by Benjamin Britten, with whom the composer formed a lasting friendship.|$|E

500|$|A 2001 {{survey in}} Clinical Nursing Research, an <b>international</b> <b>publication,</b> found that 62% {{of people who}} have had piercings have done so in an effort [...] "to express their individuality." [...] People also pierce to commemorate {{landmark}} events or to overcome traumatic ones. According to the assistant director of the Frankfurt University Teaching Hospital for Psychosomatic Medicine and Psychotherapy, some sexual abuse survivors choose body piercing as a means of [...] "reclaiming body parts from memories of abuse". Piercing can also be chosen for simple aesthetic value, to highlight particular areas of the body, as a navel piercing may reflect a woman's satisfaction with the shape and condition of her stomach. Some people pierce, permanently or temporarily, to enhance sexual pleasure. Genital and nipple piercings may increase sexual satisfaction. Some people participate in a form of body play known as play piercing, in which piercings may be done temporarily on the genitals or elsewhere on the body for sexual gratification.|$|E
2500|$|Until {{recently}} {{relatively few}} of Lukyanenko's works {{have been released}} outside of Russia, mostly in Baltic states, Bulgaria and Poland, countries with traditionally strong ties with Russian literature. Even fewer were commercially published in English, partly because Western publishers were apprehensive {{about the state of}} modern Russian copyright laws. However, success of the movies finally changed the situation. Night Watch, translated by Andrew Bromfield, was published in English in July 2006, Day Watch followed in January 2007, Twilight Watch was published in July 2007. [...] 2009 saw the <b>international</b> <b>publication</b> of Last Watch by Hyperion Press.|$|E
2500|$|Even as the {{physical}} reach of Zeta Psi made great bounds, so too did the principles underlying its brotherhood. By {{the turn of}} the century, the need for some more centralized structure pressed as chapter after chapter was added to the Circle and their correspondence became too much to handle so chaotically. In 1909, an <b>international</b> <b>publication</b> concerning the affairs of Zetes was first published by Brother William Comstock (Ξ '99) and distributed among the several chapters: The Circle of Zeta Psi. The periodical, which is still published to this day, contained in that first issue the exhortation which {{has come to be known}} as [...] "The Vision of Bill Comstock" [...] for its prescience and wisdom: ...|$|E

2500|$|The Cold War {{resulted}} in {{renewed interest in}} the islands from the Soviet Union, this time because of their military strategic significance. Regarded as an [...] "unsinkable aircraft carrier", {{the location of the}} German weather station was selected for the Nagurskoye aerodrome and military base. Meanwhile, from 1949 to 1952, the Arctic Institute carried out an expedition to Hooker Island in the hope of establishing a military base and aerodrome on and inside the ice cap. A major glaciological aerial expedition was carried out in 1955, with landings on the ice caps of many islands. With the advent of intercontinental ballistic missiles, the Soviet Union changed its military strategy in 1956, abolishing the strategic need for an airbase on the archipelago. This decision also allowed for the <b>international</b> <b>publication</b> of the Soviet research garnered during the preceding decade.|$|E
