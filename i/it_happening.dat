On 29 May 1918, Röth became the only World War I pilot to down five balloons without assistance; there was only one other instance of <b>it</b> <b>happening</b> at all.

The first printed reference to the hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in Mackenzie E. C. Walcott's Guide to the Coast of Kent, where he referred to a [...] "curious custom [...] used to prevail" [...] in Ramsgate. Maylam later suggested that the Ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838, for he had interviewed a number of elderly town residents {{in the early twentieth century}} and while several were aware that it had once taken place in the town, none could recall <b>it</b> <b>happening</b> in their own lifetime.|$|E

Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} <b>it</b> <b>happening</b> and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't even know how to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the limited}} fuel allowance, the cars were towed to the start line by horses. The first car, a Rolls-Royce being driven by Charles Rolls, started at 9am, and the {{following}} 41 cars were released at one minute intervals. Due to the fuel-saving nature of the event most of the drivers began the race by letting their car coast down the initial slope under its own momentum before engaging gear. Early on the first lap of the race Rolls heard a crunching noise from his gear box and the car stopped. He claimed that upon investigation he discovered that small nuts and screws had been dropped into the gearbox, which had smashed a gear. Rolls claimed that this [...] "was a common trick abroad" [...] but voiced surprise at <b>it</b> <b>happening</b> in an English race. There was further speculation of foul play when {{it was discovered that}} Arnott's Minerva had been tampered with; two spark plugs had been smashed and an air valve bent, causing his engine to overheat. Before the race Rolls and Arnott had been two of the favourites, and The Automobile magazine said that [...] "this unfortunate incident has greatly detracted from the success of the race." ...|$|E

However, Garriott suffered financial setbacks in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst, and he was forced to sell his seat to Dennis Tito.|$|E

2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and <b>it</b> <b>happening,</b> or them not ordering it and <b>it</b> <b>happening?</b> And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think we know who {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E

[...] Page then told The New York Times that he was [...] "fed up" [...] with Plant's refusal to play, stating [...] "I was told last year that Robert Plant said he is doing nothing in 2014, and what do the other two guys think? Well, he knows what the other guys think. Everyone would love to play more concerts for the band. He's just playing games, and I'm fed up with it, {{to be honest with}} you. I don't sing, so I can't do much about it", adding, [...] "I definitely want to play live. Because, you know, I've still got a twinkle in my eye. I can still play.

2500|$|In 1925, Jeacocke was {{involved}} in another incident, the details of which are vague. Surrey played Essex County Cricket Club at Leyton Cricket Ground. The rules for the time at which the lunch interval began had just been standardised, and Fender rejected a request from the Essex captain, Johnny Douglas, to keep the old time for the interval on the Leyton ground, preferring to [...] "stick to MCC rules". This possibly aggravated what followed, and during this period Fender and Douglas had a difficult relationship. After two days' play, Surrey had scored 431 and Essex had replied with 333 for seven wickets. Before {{the third and final}} day, one of the umpires informed the captains that none of Surrey's professional players had arrived in time for the start of play. Douglas refused to postpone the start, stating [...] "Strict MCC rules, Fender—the side refusing to play loses the match." [...] Fender elected to continue, and when play began, only he and Jeacocke were present and these two went out to field alone. They had driven to the ground together, while the professionals were delayed in traffic. The Essex batsmen, possibly embarrassed by their captain's stance, did not appear until Fender sent a message saying that he could claim victory in the match if they did not come out to bat. They did so, and Fender and Jeacocke bowled from opposite ends until the remainder of the team arrived. The two men bowled wide and the batsmen made no attempt to score. Later in the day, the crowd jeered Fender for refusing to declare his innings closed, unaware of what had passed earlier. Whether the press were unaware of what happened, or if they agreed to keep it quiet, the incident was not reported, although several accounts hinted that something unusual had occurred. The play which took place was not recorded by the match scorers until the full Surrey team arrived, but several players who took part remembered <b>it</b> <b>happening.</b> In later years, rumours persisted that something like it had taken place.|$|E
