Cabinets inspired by classic arcade games can also be purchased and assembled (with optional PC and MAME preinstalled).|$|R
50|$|Three-point locking is a {{locking system}} <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> <b>cabinet</b> or locker doors to enable more secure locking. Whereas in single-point locking, {{the door on}} a cabinet locks only {{at the point where}} the key is turned, halfway up the edge of the door, three-point locking enables the top and bottom of the door to be {{simultaneously}} secured. This is accomplished by attaching two long steel rods to the lock on the inside of the door, which extend vertically upwards and downwards: when the lock is turned, the rotary movement of the latch on the inside of the door translates to vertical movement in these rods, with the result that the upper rod moves upwards by an inch or so, and the lower rod moves downwards similarly. This causes the ends of the rods to move through small holes in the flanges at the top and bottom of the door, resulting from the metal of the door being turned inwards, and the rods then move a short distance into holes in the metal surrounding the door. This effectively immobilizes the top and bottom of the door, and greatly increases the security of the door-locking compared to a door with only single-point locking.|$|R

5000|$|Space-utilization. Since typical face-frames are 1+1/2 in {{wide and}} {{frameless}} side panels 3/4 in, {{access to the}} cabinet interior is 1+1/2 in wider for a typical frameless cabinet relative to a face-frame <b>cabinet.</b> A 12 <b>in</b> <b>cabinet</b> accommodates a 10 in drawer in frameless construction or a 8+1/2 in drawer in framed construction. The 1+1/2 in difference is most significant for narrower face-frame cabinets. Hence, the nomenclature [...] "full-access." [...] Custom (higher-cost) face-frame cabinets, which use one 1+1/2 in stile to frame two cabinet openings, can also accommodate wider drawers comparable to frameless cabinets. Frameless wall-oven cabinetry further saves 3 in of wall space {{as compared to the}} same wall-oven <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a face-frame <b>cabinet,</b> Many, if not most, contemporary ovens (and other cabinet-front-mounted major appliances) have been designed with the space-utilization advantage of frameless <b>cabinets</b> installation <b>in</b> mind. The oven is dimensioned, and thermally insulated, to fit within an industry-standard external width 27 or 30 <b>in</b> <b>cabinet</b> cavity, less two standard 3/4 <b>in</b> <b>cabinet</b> side-wall thicknesses while providing for a small space between the oven box and the internal <b>cabinet</b> wall. <b>In</b> ovens, the bezel is sized to fit the full external cavity width and overlay the cabinet side wall. Such an installation avoids any unused lateral space around the oven. (While, hypothetically, ovens can be <b>installed</b> similarly <b>in</b> face-frame <b>cabinets,</b> such an installation may requires cutting away all but 3/4 in of each 1+1/2 in face-frame - specifically not recommended by vendors as it may weaken the joint between side-wall and face-frame - and buttressing face-frame cabinet side walls accordingly.) ...|$|R

Typically these drivers produce only the frequency range relevant to electric guitars, which is similar to a regular woofer type driver, which is approximately 75&thinsp;Hz&thinsp;—&thinsp;5 kHz, or for electric bass speakers, down to 41&thinsp;Hz&thinsp; for regular four-string basses or down to about 30 Hz for five-string instruments.|$|R
25|$|Since {{infrared}} (IR) {{remote controls}} use light, they require {{line of sight}} to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, {{just like any other}} light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cabinet,</b> many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the phototransistor. However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.|$|R
5000|$|As an overlay system, InSync’s {{hardware}} components {{plug into}} existing traffic cabinet hardware. The system is Ethernet- and web-based, compatible with all modern controllers, cabinets and detection devices {{and does not}} require removal or upgrades of any hardware or software. Installation of the InSync system consists of <b>installing</b> <b>in</b> each <b>cabinet</b> a processor, equipment panel and method to transmit detection calls (such as cabling or detector cards). If InSync’s video detection is used, installation also includes installing cameras for each approach. If existing detection methods are preferred (InSync:Tesla), Rhythm Engineering will integrate the installed inputs with the adaptive system. Once cables are pulled from the camera locations to the traffic cabinet, installation of the cameras and in-cabinet hardware typically requires about four hours per intersection. After the hardware is installed, the initial configuration {{of the system is}} performed by Rhythm Engineering engineers. The time from an agency or contractor ordering the system to full operation is less than 90 days.|$|R

The requirement to reproduce low frequencies at high sound pressure levels means that most loudspeakers used for bass guitar amplification are designed around large diameter, heavy-duty drivers, with 10", 12" [...] and 15" [...] being most common. Less commonly, larger speakers (e.g., 18") or smaller speakers (e.g., the 8x8" [...] cabinet, which contains eight 8" [...] speakers) may be used. As a general rule, when smaller speakers are used, {{two or more of}} them are <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> a <b>cabinet</b> (e.g., 2x10", 4x10" [...] and 8x8"). For 12" [...] speakers, combo amps and cabinets are available with 1x12" [...] and 2x12"; less commonly, 4x12" [...] cabinets are seen. For 15" [...] speakers, combo amps and cabinets usually have 1x15", although 2x15" [...] and even 4x15" [...] cabinets exist. A small number of 1x18" [...] bass cabinets are sold (e.g., Trace Elliot).|$|R
5|$|By September, {{the game}} was still unfinished, and almost every Williams {{programmer}} assisted in meeting the deadline for the AMOA trade show. The evening before the trade show, the arcade cabinets were delivered for display. The developers, however, forgot to create an attract mode—an automated sequence designed to entice an audience to play—for the game, and began working on it that night. Early the next morning, the team created the final EPROM chips for the mode and <b>installed</b> them <b>in</b> <b>cabinets.</b> The chips, however, did not work and the designers made additional attempts to correct the problem. Once the attract mode was operational, Jarvis and the team returned to their homes {{to prepare for the}} show. After the show, the developers expanded the game to allow users to play indefinitely. The display model featured five levels, which the team felt was more than enough because of the game's difficulty. Most Williams employees could not progress past the third level and Jarvis's score of 60,000points seemed unbeatable to them. The developers decided it was best to be prepared for players that might exceed their expectations and added more levels that repeated.|$|R
50|$|The MKIV Bass Amp head unit, {{introduced}} in 1981, offers {{a range of}} functions. It is air cooled, features protection circuitry, and is capable of around 300/350 watts RMS safely into 2 ohms. The 2 ohm load rating is very stable (this amp actually operates at less than 2 ohms), enabling {{the use of multiple}} mix and match speaker systems to improve acoustic efficiency and sound stage options. In contrast, typical modern musical instrument amps are limited to 4 ohms speaker systems. Circuit board layout is conservative, easy to access, repair or modify. Dynamics and reliability are excellent. Its only weak point is that the preamp and power amp modules are <b>installed</b> <b>in</b> the chipboard <b>cabinet</b> with lack of electromagnetic shielding, resulting in a need to physically separate the amp head from bass pickups and speakers. That can be easily fixed by installing earthed aluminium foil or sheet inside the cabinet.|$|R

50|$|Most washer dryer combos are ventless and are {{designed}} with drying systems that work differently from the ordinary stand-alone (vented) dryer. Instead of venting moist hot air to the outside, like a conventional dryer would, the combo unit makes use of condensation similarly to condenser dryers. Hot dry(er) air enters the drum from either the front or the rear, and evaporates some of the moisture from the tumbling clothing. This warm, damp air is then drawn through a condensing chamber, and the extracted water is flushed out the drain hose to the sink or through the plumbing lines. These units are easy to <b>install</b> under <b>cabinets,</b> <b>in</b> closets or anywhere with electricity.|$|R
50|$|The {{primary role}} of the {{enclosure}} is to prevent sound waves generated by the rearward-facing surface of the diaphragm of an open speaker driver interacting with sound waves generated {{at the front of}} the speaker driver. Because the forward- and rearward-generated sounds are out of phase with each other, any interaction between the two in the listening space creates a distortion of the original signal as it was intended to be reproduced. As such, a loudspeaker cannot be used without <b>installing</b> it <b>in</b> a <b>cabinet</b> of some type, or mounting it into a wall or ceiling. Additionally, because the sound waves would travel different paths through the listening space, the sound waves in an unmounted speaker would arrive at the listener's position at slightly different times, introducing echo and reverberation effects not part of the original sound.|$|R

50|$|Blocking, {{often called}} backing or {{sometimes}} grounds, also refers to {{pieces of wood}} or other material that run between wall studs {{in order to provide}} support and attachment sites for mounted hardware or trim such as cabinets, shelving, handrails, vanity tops without a cabinet underneath, bathroom towel bars, mouldings etc. Properly installed blocking is easier to find and use for attaching wall hardware than studs alone. Once drywall, or any other material, covers the wall {{it can be difficult to}} find 2x4 studs for attachment, and the position of nails and screws must be adjusted to stud location. Thus, if blocking is installed at a uniform and predetermined height, attachment sites can be found without using a stud finder, and the blocking can be utilized anywhere along a wall at that height. This is particularly useful for <b>installing</b> upper <b>cabinets</b> <b>in</b> kitchens or bathrooms as they tend to be fairly heavy and finding appropriate studs for installation can be difficult.|$|R
