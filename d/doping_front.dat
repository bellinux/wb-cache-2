We find that the propagation is limited by the movement of ions in the electronically insulating region between the p- and n-doped regions.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} and internal structure of <b>doping</b> <b>fronts</b> in organic semiconductors are investigated theoretically using an extended drift-diffusion model for ions, electrons and holes. The model also involves the injection barriers for electrons and {{holes in the}} partially doped regions {{in the form of}} the Nernst equation, together with a strong dependence of the electron and hole mobility on concentrations. Closed expressions for the front velocities and the ion concentrations in the doped regions are obtained. The analytical theory is employed to describe the acceleration of the p- and n-fronts towards each other. The analytical results show very good agreement with the experimental data. Furthermore, it is shown that the internal structure of the <b>doping</b> <b>fronts</b> is determined by the diffusion and mobility processes. The asymptotic behavior of the concentrations and the electric field is studied analytically inside the <b>doping</b> <b>fronts.</b> The numerical solution for the front structure confirms the most important predictions of the analytical theory: a sharp head of the front in the undoped region, a smooth relaxation tail in the doped region, and a plateau at the critical point of transition from doped to undoped regions.

The heavily <b>doped</b> <b>front</b> region and the junction space charge region are potential areas of high recombination for generated and injected minority carriers. The design presented reduces junction area by spreading equidiameter dot junctions {{across the surface of}} the cell, spaced about a diffusion length or less from each other.

Variation of the filling factor of SC IVC due to the presence of contact grid is then analytically expressed via this length. It is found that in unoptimized case, when the distance between contact strips l is much longer than L, the photocurrent collection is determined by lesser, as compared to L, distance, at which the front layer potential changes from the value of Vm under contacts to the open- circuit voltage between the contacts. In this case the change of IVC filling factor due to the presence of contact grid is expressed again analytically via this new characteristic length.

Application of the low-cost structuring technologies in the processing of the high-efficiency back-contact back-junction silicon solar cells results in a drastic increase of the pitch on the rear cell side.

40|$|This work {{presents}} a study based on electro-optical numerical simulations {{of the impact}} of geometrical and doping parameters on main figures of merit of crystalline silicon back-contact back-junction solar cells. State-of-the-art physical models in combination with two-dimensional simulations performed by a TCAD tool have been adopted to carry out an extensive and detailed analysis of the influence of many fabrication parameters on performance. The studied design parameters are the <b>doping</b> level in <b>front</b> surface field (FSF), back surface field (BSF) and emitter, and the main geometrical parameters. A doping level value that allows the maximization of the efficiency for the three regions can be clearly identified. In particular, for BSF and emitter, an efficiency degradation is observed for relatively lower doping values and is ascribed to the higher contact recombination while for higher doping values the Auger recombination plays a significant role in reducing the ultimate efficiency. In FSF region the recombination due to defects at the front interface is the main limiting mechanisms for efficiency. On the basis of our analysis, a marked sensitivity of the efficiency to the gap and pitch size is caused by the series resistance increase.

40|$|Climate changes due to {{increase}} of CO 2 emission {{are becoming a}} serious issue for this planet. The so called climate crisis has been the main topic of the last United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP 21). Direct conversion of sunlight into electricity {{is one of the}} most promising technology for achieving the COP 21 agreement. Wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells account for more than 90 % of the total PV market because silicon is a non-toxic and abundant material and Si-based PV modules have demonstrated long term stability and high durability. To maintain this technology dominant also in the coming years, continuous improvement in conversion efficiency without increasing processing costs are required. In this thesis novel solutions based on opto-electrical surface engineering are presented as potential solutions {{to increase}} conversion efficiency and/or decrease the costs of wafer-based c-Si solar cells. In particular, advanced light management techniques were developed to enhance light absorption in thin c-Si absorber and to fabricate customized PV products for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications. This thesis begins with introducing, theoretical limits (Chapter 1), working principles and current status (Chapter 2) of waferbased c-Si solar cells. In Chapter 3 the losses analysis of industrial multi-crystalline silicon (mc-Si) solar cell was performed by using the ASA simulation tool. Such analysis pointed out the main opto-electrical losses for a mc-Si solar cell which were tackled in the next Chapters. In particular, Chapter 4 deals with design and fabrication of advanced light trapping scheme for minimizing optical losses of state-of-the-art c-Si solar cells. To this aim a combination of surface textures with different geometrical scales were used in order to trigger several optical effects. In particular, nano-texturing fabricated via reactive ion etching (RIE) on the front side and micro texturing based on alkaline etching on the rear side were used providing broadband light-in coupling and light scattering. Almost ideal back reflectors such as Ag or Distributed Bragg reflectors (DBR) were applied on the rear side. By using such light trapping scheme, the so-called 4 n 2 absorption enhancement limit, which has been elusive for more than 30 years was experimentally demonstrated on a broad wavelength range. The interdigitated back contact (IBC) c-Si solar cell was indicated as the most promising solar cell architecture to apply such light trapping scheme. This technology was not available within the PVMD group. Therefore, in Chapter 5 a simplified self-aligned process for fabrication high efficiency IBC c-Si solar cells was demonstrated. The process involved the combination of ion implantation and epitaxial growth of in-situ doped Si. The process flow was optimized to minimize the thermal budget and the number of lithographic steps. By using only two lithographic steps, a conversion efficiency equal to 20. 2 % on 9 cm 2 device was demonstrated. For such solar cell architecture it was shown that a lightly <b>doped</b> <b>front</b> surface field improves carrier collection. After developing a process flow for fabricating IBC c-Si solar cells, the application of the advanced light management technique to IBC was presented in Chapter 6. To this aim two major issues were tackled. The first was related to the removal of surface defects induced by the RIE process to decrease surface recombination. To achieve this goal a cost effective process was developed. The second dealt with adapting the light trapping scheme to the IBC process integration. To this aim, the decoupled front (nano-textured) and rear side (micotexturing) light trapping scheme of Chapter 4 was modified by superposing both texture scales on the front side of the wafer. This approach is called modulated surface texture (MST). The combination of the advanced light trapping and surface passivation schemes was employed in IBC c-Si solar cells. Top efficiency of 19. 8 % for MST-IBC solar cell was demonstrated. Advanced light management techniques were also applied to bifacial c-Si solar cells. The objective of this study was twofold: (i) enhancing cell efficiency by increasing the internal rear internal reflectance and (ii) providing novel solutions for BIPV applications. In particular, DBR and TiO 2 particles in the form of white paint were used as back reflectors of bifacial c-Si solar cells. The DBR enabled the possibility of fabricating rear side coloured bifacial modules, which can be attractive for BIPV applications.

40|$|A flexible, {{thin film}} Cu In,Ga Se 2 solar cell {{deposited}} on a titanium foil was {{combined with a}} TiO 2 photocatalyst layer and modified by a niobium <b>doped</b> titanium oxide <b>front</b> electrode {{to function as a}} photoelectrochemical tandem cell membrane for a direct light driven hydrogen evolution from aqueous solution. The P 680 P 700 tandem system in the plant photosynthetic unit is successfully imitated by the concerted and constructive interaction of both semiconductors. Under illumination with UV vis light, the monolithic TiO 2 Ti Cu In,Ga Se 2 CdS Nb 0. 03 Ti 0. 97 O 1. 84 tandem membranes produced up to 0. 052 amp; 956;L of hydrogen s 1 cm 2. The hydrogen formation rate is about 7250 amp; 956;mol h 1 g 1, relative to the amount of TiO 2 used. In the long term a significant cost reduction of solar hydrogen evolution will be possible within this system, due to the reduction of solar cell encapsulation costs, the absence of a grid connection between several solar cell modules, and the omission of typical solar cell module equipment, such as a converter and a bypass diode. In addition, no expensive rare metal based electrolyzer stack is necessary for hydrogen evolution. The layered structure of the membrane allows an easy substitution and variation of single components, an important criterion for further research and tests with photooxidatively active materials that were not solely limited to the solar UV light fraction, like TiO 2 is. Typical electronic and electrochemical requirements of such substitutions are discussed within this paper. Furthermore, the proposed incorporation of the TiO 2 Ti Cu In,Ga Se 2 CdS Nb 0. 03 Ti 0. 97 O 1. 84 tandem membrane into an optical Winston collector system shows that a combined light and thermal solar energy conversion into hydrogen and heat is in principle possibl...|$|R
40|$|Implementation of {{selective}} emitter that decouples {{the requirements for}} <b>front</b> <b>doping</b> and metallization leads to improve the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells. Formation of such an efficient selective emitter using a laser beam with a suitable wavelength is an attractive method. The present work focuses on the analysis of laser doping of boron using different finite sources such as borosilicate glass (BSG) deposited by PECVD, spin-on solution and BCl 3 gas source. KrF excimer laser (248 nm) {{was used for the}} selective doping. The surface dopant concentration and depth, as measured using SIMS, were controlled by variation of the laser fluence, pulse number and dopant source thickness. Depending on the type of BSG source, sheet resistance close to 20 Omega/sq was achieved at the laser fluences in the range, 2. 5 - 5 J/cm(2). The PECVD-BSG layers with a relatively higher thickness resulted in a lower sheet resistance of 20 Omega/sq with a junction of depth of similar to 1 mu m at a moderate laser fluence of 2. 5 J/cm(2). In the case of BSG deposited by spin-on source, a deeper junction of depth of similar to 2. 7 mu m with a plateau profile of 1 mu m was formed at a laser fluence of 3. 1 j/cm(2) that resulted in a lower sheet resistance of similar to 31 Omega/sq. Redistribution of the dopant with pulse repetition was observed for the BSG deposited by BCl 3 gas source. Pulse repetition at relatively lower laser fluences (>threshold energy) resulted in the best electrical results in combination with a limited laser induced damage in the silicon crystal. Also, multiple laser annealing resulted in redistribution of the dopant profiles in terms of enhanced junction depth...|$|R
