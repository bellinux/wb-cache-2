On the other hand, Momchil's legendary sister Yevrosima is described as the mother of Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him.|$|E

5000|$|He is {{a fairly}} {{ambiguous}} individual throughout the literature, but {{is described as a}} strong king and a <b>defender</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> According to Arthurian Legend, Merlin magically disguises Uther to look like his enemy Gorlois, enabling Uther to sleep with Gorlois' wife Lady Igraine.

This act of conception occurs the very night that Uther's troops dispatch Gorlois. This theme of illegitimate conception is repeated in Arthur's siring of Mordred by his own half-sister Morgause in the later prose romances.

50|$|After {{returning}} to Tennessee, Jackson {{turned down an}} offer {{to run for governor}} of his home state, but accepted John Overton's plan to have the legislature nominate him for president.

Yet Jackson's nomination garnered a welcoming response even outside of Tennessee, as many Americans appreciated Jackson's attacks on banks. <b>The</b> Panic <b>of</b> 1819 had devastated <b>the</b> fortunes <b>of</b> many, and banks and politicians seen as supportive of banks were particularly unpopular.
