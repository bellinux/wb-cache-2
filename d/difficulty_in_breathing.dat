25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (<b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> <b>breathing</b> due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, flaccid paralysis, loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E

500|$|Vascular malformations in {{the lungs}} may cause a number of problems. The lungs {{normally}} [...] "filter out" [...] bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain, where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke. HHT {{is the most common}} cause of lung AVMs: out of all people found to have lung AVMs, 70–80% are due to HHT. Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual, but may cause hemoptysis (coughing up blood) or hemothorax (blood accumulating in the chest cavity). Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli, meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen. This may lead to breathlessness. Large AVMs may lead to platypnea, <b>difficulty</b> <b>in</b> <b>breathing</b> that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning. Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen, which may be noted by cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the lips and skin), clubbing of the fingernails (often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels), and a humming noise over the affected part of the lung detectable by stethoscope.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Syndrome of <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>breathing</b> has an {{important}} position in pathology of childhood. It is manifested as in diseases of respiratory tract so in series of diseases and pathological conditions linked to other organs and systems. Patients and Methods: Patient with <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>breathing</b> develops clinical presentation of respiratory distress, which is characterized with many different clinical symptoms and signs. Acute respiratory failure with discrepancy between utility of oxygen and produces of carbon dioxide is the last point of respiratory distress, so the primary care of clinician is quickly recognition of abnormal blood gasses values. Early identification and appropriate treatment of incoming respiratory failure is essential for good prognosis and decreasing long term complications. The aim {{of this paper was}} to analyze retrospectively histories of diseases of children treated at the Department of Intensive care Pediatrics clinic in Tuzla and to establish type and frequency of diseases characterized with syndrome of difficult breathing, frequency of non-respiratory diseases in etiology of this syndrome, and to estimate correlation of clinical findings in admission with pulse oximetry and blood gases findings. Analysis was based on population of patients treated at the Department of Intensive care unit Pediatrics clinic in Tuzla with recorded, clinically manifested syndrome of difficult breathing. Patient selection was performed consecutively from January 1 st till 31 st December 2006. All selected patients were from Tuzla Canton. Source of data for this investigation was Admission protocol for Pediatric Clinics and Intensive care unit protocol and personal histories of children treated at the Intensive care unit of Pediatric Clinics January 1 st till 31 st December 2006. Method of work was retrospective study which analyzed anamnestic data, clinical and laboratory findings, therapeutical procedures and length of hospitalization at the Intensive care unit and outcome of the treatment. Results: The results of investigation demonstrated that in anlized period (from January 1 st till 31 st December 2006) in Pediatric Clinic, Tuzla a total number of 3932 children were treated, out of them 767 (19. 5 %) children were treated at the Department of Intensive care unit. Syndrome of <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>breathing</b> was recorded <b>in</b> 608 patients (79. 3 %). The biggest number of children in this group were treated for syndrome of broncho-obstruction, total of 332 children (54. 6 %). Other large group was neurological disorders: convulsions and epilepsy, total number of 125 patients (20. 6 %). Out of total number of patients 11 (1. 8 %) suffered from complete failure of breathing and required mechanical ventilation support. Out of this number 10 of them were chronic ill patients. The most common causal factor for respiratory insufficiency in strict meaning of this word and endangering respiratory arrest was epileptic attack and recidivated pneumonia. Discussion: Clinical findings, pulse oximetry and blood gases analysis were in correlation and in favor of hypoxemic type of respiratory insufficiency. Results of gas analysis for group of neurological disorders and poisoning spoke in favor of acute hypercapnic respiratory insufficiency. Clinical parameters for dyspnea were absent and finding of pulse oximetry monitored isolated for these disorders demonstrated partly unreliable...|$|R
30|$|In {{allergic}} asthma, inflammatory reactions {{occur in}} the lower airways and cause <b>difficulties</b> <b>in</b> <b>breathing.</b> Within seconds of mast-cell degranulation, fluid and mucus are secreted into the respiratory tract, and contraction of the smooth muscle surrounding the airway causes bronchial constriction. During the late-phase reaction, the Th 2 cytokines produced by mast cells and T lymphocytes together induce changes in the airways and lung parenchyma. Repetitive or persistent exposure to allergens cause chronic inflammation of the airways with a persistent infiltration of leukocytes, resulting in epithelial injury, thickening of the airway walls, increased deposition of extracellular-matrix proteins, hyperplasia of goblet cells, and mucus hypersecretion (Hamid and Tulic 2009). The inflammatory and structural changes in the airways lead to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), which is a clinical feature of bronchial asthma and is {{closely associated with the}} severity of the disease. In chronic asthma, the airways {{are in a state of}} generalized hyperresponsiveness, and environmental factors other than reexposure to specific allergens can also trigger asthmatic attacks (Leikauf 2002).|$|R
