5|$|The pilot {{qualification}} most relevant to GA is the Private Pilot Licence (PPL), which permits the holder to fly for recreational purposes without remuneration. In {{addition to the}} European-wide Joint Aviation Regulations Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL) standard, the CAA also issues UK-specific national licences. In the absence of European standards for <b>gyroplane,</b> balloon, and airship pilots, the CAA licenses these according to the original UK PPL standard. As {{a response to the}} perception that JAR pilot licensing standards are excessively bureaucratic and expensive for the purposes of recreational pilots, the National Private Pilot Licence (NPPL) was introduced in 2002. The NPPL is easier to obtain than the JAR-FCL licence, has less stringent medical requirements, is more restrictive in the privileges it grants, and is valid only for flights in British-registered aircraft flying in UK and French airspace. Although there are plans to bring glider pilot licensing within the regulatory framework of EASA, the gliding sector is currently self-regulating in this respect. The British Gliding Association is responsible for defining the standards of initial training, and certifying, via a badge system, pilots who meet those standards. Pilots working in sectors of GA that are commercial operations, such as aerial work and business aviation, are required to hold a professional pilot licence which, at a minimum, is the Commercial Pilot Licence.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} type of Canadian licence is the private pilot licenceaeroplane, which is used to fly light general {{aviation}} aircraft privately and recreationally. At the end of 2008 there were 27,138 aeroplane and 596 helicopter private pilot licences in force in Canada. The rarest licence or permit in Canada is the <b>gyroplane</b> pilot permit, with only 29 in force at the end of 2008.|$|E
25|$|Since 2009, several {{projects}} in Kurdistan, Iraq have been realized. In 2010, the first autogyro was {{handed over to}} the Kurdish Minister of Interiors, Mr. Karim Sinjari. The project for the interior ministry was to train pilots to control and monitor the approach and takeoff paths of the airports in Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dohuk to prevent terrorist encroachments.

25|$|Under license from Cierva in the 1920s and 1930s, the Pitcairn & Kellett {{companies}} made further innovations. Late-model autogyros {{patterned after}} Etienne Dormoy's Buhl A-1 Autogyro and Igor Bensen's designs feature a rear-mounted engine and propeller in a pusher configuration. The term Autogiro was a trademark of the Cierva Autogiro Company, and the term Gyrocopter {{was used by}} E. Burke Wilford who developed the Reiseler Kreiser feathering rotor equipped <b>gyroplane</b> {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century. The latter term was later adopted as a trademark by Bensen Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The rotor {{is mounted}} atop the {{vertical}} mast. The rotor system of all Bensen-type autogyros is of a two-blade teetering design. There are some disadvantages {{associated with this}} rotor design, but {{the simplicity of the}} rotor design lends itself to ease of assembly and maintenance {{and is one of the}} reasons for its popularity. Aircraft-quality birch was specified in early Bensen designs, and a wood/steel composite is used in the world speed record holding Wallis design. <b>Gyroplane</b> rotor blades are made from other materials such as aluminium and GRP-based composite blades.|$|E
25|$|The McDonnell XV-1 was an {{experimental}} compound <b>gyroplane</b> developed for a joint research program between the United States Air Force and the United States Army to explore technologies {{to develop an}} aircraft that could take off and land like a helicopter but fly at faster airspeeds, similar to a conventional airplane. The XV-1 would reach a speed of 200mph (322km/h), faster than any previous rotorcraft, but the program was terminated due to the tip-jet noise {{and complexity of the}} technology which gave only a modest gain in performance.|$|E
50|$|The Layzell Cricket is a single-seat {{autogyro}} {{produced in}} the United Kingdom for homebuilding, although it was first {{produced in the}} early 1970s fully factory-built. It was a typically minimalist design, featuring a pilot's seat semi-enclosed within a fairing, and a pusher engine and large tailfin located aft of the rotor mast. Forty-three of the original Crickets were built by Campbell Aircraft, with the type enjoying a brief revival in 2001 when it was marketed in kit form by Mike Concannon of Cricket <b>Gyroplanes,</b> before reaching production again in 2005 by Layzell <b>Gyroplanes</b> as the Mk.6.|$|R

25|$|An {{autogyro}} (from Greek αὐτός + γύρος, self-turning), {{also known}} as <b>gyroplane,</b> gyrocopter, or rotaplane, {{is a type of}} rotorcraft that uses an unpowered rotor in autorotation to develop lift, and an engine-powered propeller, similar to that of a fixed-wing aircraft, to provide thrust. While similar to a helicopter rotor in appearance, the autogyro's rotor must have air flowing through the rotor disc to generate rotation. Invented by the Spanish engineer Juan de la Cierva to create an aircraft that could fly safely at low speeds, the autogyro was first flown on 9 January 1923, at Cuatro Vientos Airfield in Madrid. De la Cierva's aircraft resembled the fixed-wing aircraft of the day, with a front-mounted engine and propeller in a tractor configuration to pull the aircraft through the air.|$|E

2500|$|The single-seat <b>Gyroplane</b> had a three-blade auto-rotating rotor fitted {{above the}} {{fuselage}} on a strutted plyon. A [...] Pobjoy Niagara radial piston engine was {{mounted on the}} fuselage nose. It had fixed tailwheel landing gear and the rear fuselage included a large dorsal fin to provide directional stability. An unusual feature was the control system which was equipped with spider-actuated cyclic and collective pitch control of the rotor blades; this mechanism, {{a variant of the}} swashplate-actuated rotor control, became a standard feature on helicopters. In 1935, the <b>Gyroplane</b> was manufactured at the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company's factory at Denham, Buckinghamshire. In autumn 1935, the <b>Gyroplane,</b> registered G-ADMV, first flew at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by V.H. Baker. On 6 February 1937, it flew at Hanworth Air Park, having been modified as the Mark 2 version. It was tested at Farnborough, and leased to the Royal Aircraft Establishment for research, but it was scrapped during the second world war. A two-seat A.R.IV and three-seat A.R.V were planned, but construction was stopped when Hafner was interned under Defence Regulation 18B.|$|E
2500|$|Though a {{much larger}} aircraft, the G.11E used the same coaxial, three blade twin rotor layout as on the <b>Gyroplane</b> Laboratoire. It was {{initially}} powered by a fan cooled [...] Potez 9E nine cylinder radial engine mounted amidships, under the concentric rotor shafts. [...] There was 6.5:1 speed reduction gearing between the engine and the rotor drive. The rotors are built around tapered tube spars, which carry ribs and are Dural clad at the leading edges and with alloy over 3-ply elsewhere. They are mounted on flapping hinges and have drag hinge dampers. The control column alters cyclic pitch via a pair of swashplates and pedals make torque corrections and control yaw by changing the relative collective pitch of the two rotors. A mechanical inertial governor limited rotor accelerations; the pilot could increase the collective pitch over that set by the governor but not below it, emergencies apart.|$|E
