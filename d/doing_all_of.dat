5|$|Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, {{game show}} host, and comedian, {{best known for}} his {{character}} Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing for years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold-out months with HBO producing a successful special about it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and for the next decade, Reubens would be completely committed to his character, <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. In 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure, directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and soon developed into a cult film. Big Top Pee-wee, 1988's sequel, was less successful than its predecessor. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children's program Pee-wee's Playhouse.|$|E

25|$|In the woods, David, Hook and Robin {{are ready}} to confront Arthur at his tent, and they brought weapons along, just in case. Robin and Hook secure the area while David goes inside the tent. As Arthur greets David cordially, David demands to know why Arthur lied and tried to burn the Crimson Crown, and tells him about they message they {{received}} from Merlin, which detailed that only Nimue could destroy that Darkness. David demands to know who Nimue is and points his gun at Arthur. Arthur, however, decides to throw the threesome off with a table, then escapes into the wood with, the three in pursuit. After Arthur trips, he sees Hook and kicks him down and draws his sword on him, but just before he can kill Hook, Emma suddenly shows up and uses the now-reunited Excalibur stop Arthur's attack, telling a stunned Arthur that the sword no longer controls anyone, before sending him flying into a tree. Hook thanks Emma, but Emma says that there's no need to. Hook apologizes for what he said on his ship, and when Emma asks if he meant his saying that he didn't love her, or refusing to accept who she now was, {{he says that he}} still did and will always love her. When Emma asks Hook what he wants, he says that he wants to help her, and asks who Nimue is. She says that Nimue doesn't matter anymore, and that it will all be over tomorrow. Hook asks why she needs the sword. Emma walks away and Hook says he knows she has reasons for doing this, and Emma tells Hook that she does, and that she’s <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> this for him, before disappearing.|$|E

In this song, the narrator {{describes}} {{a variety of}} obscure items that he purchased on the online auction site eBay. Yankovic later noted, [...] "I was going to shoot a video for eBay, but right at the same time, eBay started <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these commercials with song parodies. [...] I didn't want my parody to come off as a commercial for eBay. In retrospect, I probably should have done a video {{because it would have}} been one of my biggest hits." [...] Indeed, the song is one of Yankovic's most popular, and ranks as one of his most-downloaded tracks on digital music outlets.|$|E

To earn this rating, which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do, Adamson altered {{a shot of}} a fallen helmet {{to make clear that}} it did not contain a severed head. Adamson made {{numerous}} edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience, explaining [...] "When you sit down and you're watching it, and you see the kids' faces while making the film, you're just making an attempt, you're making it exciting, you're <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these things because you're essentially making the film for yourself.

500|$|When Adam Newman (Michael Muhney) sells {{cosmetics}} line Beauty of Nature off to {{the highest}} bidder, Jack was planning on becoming the highest bidder and winning the line, however, Genevieve's bid, made through her holding company FMN, is the highest and she becomes the owner of Beauty of Nature. Jack becomes suspicious of her money source when he finds a bank statement of hers. Cane remembers that FMN stands for [...] "Forget Me Not", the words engraved on the urn holding Samantha's ashes. Genevieve later realizes she cannot marry Jack as she was disloyal to him; she writes him a Dear John letter and plans to leave town, however, Patty steals Genevieve's wedding dress and walks down the aisle in her place with her face covered. When Jack uncovers her, an enraged Patty shoots Jack in the stomach. At the hospital, it is revealed that FMN is Genevieve's holding company, and Jack and his family reject her due to her betrayal. She finds solace in Victor Newman (Eric Braeden). Genevieve later agrees to sell Beauty of Nature to Jack if he gives their relationship another try. They agree to get married in Las Vegas, but Genevieve overhears Jack telling Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott) that he doesn't love her and he is just marrying her to get back ownership of Beauty of Nature. A heartbroken Genevieve leaves Jack before the wedding, ends up having sex with Victor and sells the cosmetics line back to him.

2500|$|A violin {{generally}} {{consists of}} a spruce top (the soundboard, {{also known as the}} top plate, table, or belly), maple ribs and back, two endblocks, a neck, a bridge, a soundpost, four strings, and various fittings, optionally including a chinrest, which may attach directly over, or to the left of, the tailpiece. A distinctive feature of a violin body is its hourglass-like shape and the arching of its top and back. The hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts, two lower bouts, and two concave C-bouts at the waist, providing clearance for the bow. The [...] "voice" [...] or sound of a violin depends on its shape, the wood it is made from, the graduation (the thickness profile) of both the top and back, the varnish that coats its outside surface and the skill of the luthier in <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these steps. The varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with age, making the fixed supply of old well-made violins built by famous luthiers much sought-after.|$|E
2500|$|Maus {{was born}} and raised in Austin, Minnesota. As a teenager, he listened mainly to Nirvana and Syd Barrett. In 1998, he began his {{undergraduate}} in music composition at the California Institute of the Arts, by which time he had formed an appreciation for experimental music, such as the work of Michael Pisaro, as well as Medieval, Renaissance and Baroque music. When he befriended and began to work alongside classmate Ariel Pink (Ariel Rosenberg), he took a greater interest in pop music. The first time he heard Rosenberg play was at a concert put up by students from the visual arts department. He recalls thinking: [...] "You know, Okay, maybe I’m not going to do experimental music anymore, because I was ... <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these performances like [...] Feldman and [...] Cage. ... I left that aside and took up pop as the best bet, largely because of my encounter there with Ariel, and the early work he was doing." [...] After they became roommates, he recorded the material from his first album using a cassette multi-track recorder and an early 1990s synthesizer soundbank. He later completed his degree in experimental music composition in 2003.|$|E

60|$|Read by {{the light}} of Shelley's {{previous}} history, his letter seems to be the cry of a tortured conscience. Until this time it was a conscience that had never felt a pang or known a smirch. It was the conscience of one who, until this time, had never done a dishonorable thing, or an ungenerous, or cruel, or treacherous thing, but was now <b>doing</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> these, and was keenly aware of it. Up to this time Shelley had been master of his nature, and it was a nature which was as beautiful and as nearly perfect as any merely human nature may be. But he was drunk now, with a debasing passion, and was not himself. There is nothing in his previous history that is in character with the Shelley of this letter. He had done boyish things, foolish things, even crazy things, but never a thing to be ashamed of. He had done things which one might laugh at, but the privilege of laughing was limited always to the thing itself; you could not laugh at the motive back of it--that was high, that was noble. His most fantastic and quixotic acts had a purpose back of them which made them fine, often great, and made the rising laugh seem profanation and quenched it; quenched it, and changed the impulse to homage.|$|E
