5|$|The {{coastal areas}} {{bordering}} the Sea of Marmara, which connects the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea, have a transitional climate between a temperate Mediterranean climate and a temperate oceanic climate with warm to hot, moderately dry summers and cool to cold, wet winters.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the habitat requirements– such as humidity, temperature, soil {{composition}} and water content– of B.nothofagi. However, as the species seems to only occur together with N.fusca, it should largely conform to their demands. The tree species prefers lowlands and hills along river valleys and usually grows on nutrient-rich, well-drained soil. The species {{is more likely to be}} found inland than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> regions.|$|E

5|$|Mycena californiensis is {{a species}} of fungus in the Mycenaceae family.

First described in 1860 by Berkeley and Curtis, the species was collected four years earlier during an exploring and surveying expedition. It was subsequently considered a doubtful species by later Mycena researchers, until a 1999 publication validated the taxon. Mycena elegantula is considered a synonym.|$|E
5|$|Prevailing winds in the {{interior}} are light to moderate northeast or southwest, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>coastal</b> area prevailing winds are determined by local area features.
