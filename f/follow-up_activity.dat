Discussions can be conducted with any class size, although it is typically more effective in smaller group settings. This environment allows for instructor guidance of the learning experience. Discussion requires the learners to think critically on the subject matter and use logic to evaluate their and others' positions. As learners are expected to discuss material constructively and intelligently, a discussion is a good <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity</b> given the unit has been sufficiently covered already. Some {{of the benefits of}} using discussion as a method of learning are that it helps students explore a diversity of perspectives, it increases intellectual agility, it shows respect for students’ voices and experiences, it develops habits of collaborative learning, it helps students develop skills of synthesis and integration (Brookfield 2005). In addition, by having the teacher actively engage with the students, it allows for them to come to class better prepared and aware of what is taking place in the classroom.|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the Solution-Focused Brief Group Counseling Program (SFBC) for low {{self-concept}} vocational high school students on the immediate and follow-up counseling effects. Sixteen 11 th grade students, whose self-total scores were below 10 percent of experimental calculation on the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale II Chinese Revision. The students participated in this study were randomly assigned by gender to either group. The treatment included six times consults and one <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity,</b> the subjects were interviewed during 2 nd, 4 th, 6 th consults and <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity.</b> The scores of the students on ‘self-concept subscale’, ’supplement subscale’, and self-total score were analyzed among before and after the experimental treatment, and after <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity.</b> The results showed the immediate and follow-up counseling effects. The students had already profoundly influenced by their self-concept. During adolescence the individual is searching for self-identity or looking for a suitable role to fulfill in society (Erikson, 1956 ）. To enter the subjective development phase, approximately ten years from the puberty, Franken (1994) described self-concept as a strong tendency to find motivation that will activate and generate behavior towards an intended target that is ideal or worthwhile. Researchers often found a revealing correlation between explainable and predictable behavior （ Shavelson, Hubner, & Stanton, 1976 ）. The students with a positive self-concept have stronge...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{significant}} {{advances have}} been made in implementation science, comparatively less {{attention has been paid to}} broader scale-up and spread of effective health programs at the regional, national, or international level. To address this gap in research, practice and policy attention, representatives from key stakeholder groups launched an initiative to identify gaps and stimulate additional interest and activity in scale-up and spread of effective health programs. We describe the background and motivation for this initiative and the content, process, and outcomes of two main phases comprising the core of the initiative: a state-of-the-art conference to develop recommendations for advancing scale-up and spread and a <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity</b> to operationalize and prioritize the recommendations. The conference was held in Washington, D. C. during July 2010 and attended by 100 representatives from research, practice, policy, public health, healthcare, and international health communities; the <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity</b> was conducted remotely the following year. Discussion Conference attendees identified and prioritized five recommendations (and corresponding sub-recommendations) for advancing scale-up and spread in health: increase awareness, facilitate information exchange, develop new methods, apply new approaches for evaluation, and expand capacity. In the <b>follow-up</b> <b>activity,</b> ‘develop new methods’ was rated as most important recommendation; expanding capacity was rated as least important, although differences were relatively minor. Summary Based on the results of these efforts, we discuss priority activities that are needed to advance research, practice and policy to accelerate the scale-up and spread of effective health programs. </p...|$|E
