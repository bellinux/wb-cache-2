The same month of this release, Chamilo registered passed 1.2M users around the world.|$|E
50|$|SpectreRF is {{an option}} to the Spectre Circuit Simulator from Cadence Design Systems. <b>It</b> <b>adds</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of {{analyses}} that are particularly useful for RF circuits to the basic capabilities of Spectre. SpectreRF was first released in 1996 and was notable for three reasons. First, it was arguably the first RF simulator {{in that it was}} the first to be designed for large bipolar and CMOS RF circuits; it used shooting methods as its base algorithm; and it pioneered the use of Krylov subspace methods. The use of shooting methods gave SpectreRF remarkable robustness and the Krylov methods gave it capacity that was roughly 100 times greater than existing simulators at the time. Previously such simulators were designed to simulate very small GaAs integrated circuits and hybrids. These simulators were based on harmonic balance and could reliably simulate circuits with tens of transistors whereas SpectreRF could simulate circuits with thousands of transistors.|$|E

Non-linear effect of the ohmic drop on the transient currents has been calculated for large voltage steps, assuming reversible behavior (negligible surface overpotential) of a redox couple O + ne = R.

40|$|We study chiral {{anomalies}} in N=(0, 1) and (0, 2) two-dimensional minimal sigma models defined on generic homogeneous spaces G/H. Such minimal theories contain only (left) chiral fermions and {{in certain}} cases are inconsistent because of "incurable" anomalies. We explicitly calculate the anomalous fermionic effective action and show how to remedy <b>it</b> by <b>adding</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of local counter-terms. In this procedure, we derive a local anomaly matching condition, which is demonstrated to be equivalent to the well-known global topological constraint on p_ 1 (G/H). More importantly, we show that these local counter-terms further modify and constrain "curable" chiral models, some of which, for example, flow to nontrivial infrared superconformal fixed point. Finally, we also observe an interesting relation between N=(0, 1) and (0, 2) two-dimensional minimal sigma models and supersymmetric gauge theories.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} evolution has been employing {{to adapt to}} environmental temperatures are poorly understood. To gain some further insight into this subject we solved the crystal structure of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) from the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima (TmTIM). The enzyme is a tetramer, assembled as a dimer of dimers, suggesting that the tetrameric wild-type phosphoglycerate kinase PGK-TIM fusion protein consists of a core of two TIM dimers covalently linked to 4 PGK units. The crystal structure of TmTIM represents the most thermostable TIM presently known in its 3 D-structure. <b>It</b> <b>adds</b> to <b>a</b> <b>series</b> of nine known TIM structures {{from a wide variety}} of organisms, spanning the range from psychrophiles to hyperthermophiles. Several properties believed to be involved in the adaptation to different temperatures were calculated and compared for all ten structures. No sequence preferences, correlated with thermal stability, were apparent from the amino acid composition or from the analysis of the loops and secondary structure elements of the ten TIMs. A common feature for both psychrophilic and T. maritima TIM is the large number of salt bridges compared with the number found in mesophilic TIMs. In the two thermophilic TIMs, the highest amount of accessible hydrophobic surface is buried during the folding and assembly process.
