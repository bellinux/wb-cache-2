The band's April 3, 1994 concert in Atlanta, Georgia at the Fox Theatre was {{broadcast}} live on the radio in the United States.

I still have some regrets about that, even though {{in the end it was}} probably better that we played the last two weeks of the tour.

[...] Chennault also {{discussed}} the significance of It Was Written during the period of its release, stating [...] "after mastering stark street corner realism on Illmatic, Nas delivered a loose concept album that was, at the time, groundbreaking in its scope, approach and execution." [...] According to rapper Young Noble, a close friend of Tupac Shakur, the song [...] "I Gave You Power" [...] served as the main inspiration for Shakur's [...] "" [...] (1996). American hip hop artist Lupe Fiasco has cited It Was Written as his favorite album and his primary source of inspiration. Fiasco has stated that he based his debut album Food & Liquor (2006) on the conceptual style and [...] "moods" [...] of It Was Written.

On 15 August 2005, Vieira signed a five-year contract, in a deal worth £13.75 million. In a later interview with the Daily Mail, Wenger explained the departure of Vieira was to serve Cesc Fàbregas' career: [...] "When Cesc Fàbregas was 18, 19, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>play</b> him in a 4–4–2 with Patrick Vieira and I saw it did not work. Then I had the decision to make about letting Patrick go, because Gilberto Silva and Vieira worked, Fàbregas and Silva worked, but I could not play Fàbregas and Vieira. But Fàbregas was 19 and if he did not play I knew he would want to go, so we risked destroying everything, all the work we had put into this player." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rogers {{possesses}} a full lyric soprano vocal range that spans 3 octaves. She {{is known for}} having an aggressive vocal delivery, incorporated with a soulful and emotive, distinct tone. Since the start of her career, Amerie has been heavily involved within the creative process of her music, receiving not only writing credits but production and instrumentation credits as well. In an interview with Myplay.com, she described her early process of recording music: [...] "I used to record songs that I wrote by using two different tape recorders and two separate tapes. I would start by recording myself on the first tape, singing the song down from top to finish. Then, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>play</b> it back, while singing the harmonies and recording them onto the second tape. I'd just keep repeating the process, {{going back and forth}} between tapes until I had a final version of the full song on one tape, with stacked harmonies, backgrounds and everything!".|$|E
2500|$|Hansen {{intended}} {{to record the}} album in late 2001, but due to the September 11 attacks, [...] "it {{took a while for}} people to line up." [...] Before working with Godrich, Beck recorded tracks with Dan [...] "The Automator" [...] Nakamura in January 2002 in preparation for the new record, but no songs from those sessions were used for Sea Change. Many songs, such as [...] "Lost Cause", were performed live prior to the album's recording. Another new song, [...] "Evil Things", was also performed and demoed but ultimately not recorded for the album, due to loss of time. Regarding the performances of more personal tracks in the days before Sea Change, Beck explained in a 2008 interview that [...] "Those were the kinds of songs <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>play</b> {{in the middle of the}} show. I'd try to throw a couple of them in. I just remember the audience kind of disregarding them, or moshing, or throwing things. Just because those were the kinds of persons that came out." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{a friend}} {{recommended}} English actress Lena Headey for the role, Friedman watched her audition tape, and {{thought she was}} [...] "a tough, tough woman". Having seen The Terminator {{when she was a}} teenager, which [...] "scared the hell out of" [...] her, Headey was aware of the iconic status of the character and in regards to Linda Hamilton's portrayal of the role in the film series, she remarked, [...] "Linda Hamilton will always be the original Sarah Connor and it's a very strong print that she's left, but hopefully people will embrace what I bring to Sarah and see it with fresh eyes". When asked about her approach to the role, Headey said [...] "I'm playing a mother who is a single parent, bringing up a teenage son, who also happens to save the world—as a byline to her life. And the way <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>play</b> that is someone who's passionate and scared and angry and a mother, all these things. So I approach that just trying to be honest within the boundaries of her". However, the choice to cast Headey was criticized by several fans and critics who argued that she bore no resemblance to the athletic, muscular woman established by Hamilton, who transformed her body into that of a muscled warrior for Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The controversy was covered by the Los Angeles Times, the Boston Herald, and The Guardian, as well as in online forums.|$|E
