25|$|In 1984, {{infectious}} salmon anemia (ISAv) {{was discovered}} in Norway in an Atlantic salmon hatchery. Eighty percent of {{the fish in the}} outbreak died. ISAv, a viral disease, is now a major threat to the viability of Atlantic salmon farming. It is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission’s fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. ISAv seriously affects salmon farms in Chile, Norway, Scotland and Canada, causing major economic losses to infected farms. As the name implies, it causes severe anemia of infected fish. Unlike mammals, the red blood cells of fish have DNA, and can become infected with viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the disease can also develop without the fish showing any external signs of illness, the fish maintain a normal appetite, and then they suddenly die. The disease can progress slowly throughout an <b>infected</b> <b>farm</b> and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100 percent. It is also a threat to the dwindling stocks of wild salmon. Management strategies include developing a vaccine and improving genetic resistance to the disease.|$|E

Using the same epidemiologic dataset (74 Israeli dairy herds tested for bovine paratuberculosis of which 57 farms were regarded to be infected, and 619 non-tested herds), the efficacy associated with {{the identification of the}} target population where control or preventive measures could be applied was evaluated by: 1) A method that applied geographical information systems (GIS), spatial statistics, network analysis (infective spatial links or ISL); and 2) A method that only partially applied spatial techniques. Based on the herd size of tested and non-tested farms, the geographical area of influence of each <b>infected</b> <b>farm</b> was estimated. Using the Euclidean distance between tested farms (distances between 2701 farm pairs), the ISL method calculated two measures of spatial connectivity: the number of links/farm and the ISL index. These measures are analogous to the number of roads connecting a city (links/farm) and the width of a road (index). The more links and/or the greater the average index (2 ̆ 2 width 2 ̆ 2), the greater the chances of an <b>infected</b> <b>farm</b> to disseminate an infection (especially to neighboring farms).

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious viral disease affecting cloven-hoofed animals. Characteris-tic clinical signs of FMD include pyrexia, salivation, and lameness, with vesicles and erosions in the mouth, on the feet, and on the teats [1 - 3]. Once FMD invades a FMD-free country, susceptible animals on <b>infected</b> <b>farms</b> and surrounding areas are often culled to eradicate the disease.

40|$|One of {{the main}} uses of an {{epidemic}} model is to predict the scale of an outbreak from the first few cases. In a homogeneous and non-spatial model there is a straightforward relationship between the basic reproductive ratio, R- 0, and the final epidemic size; however {{when there is a}} significant spatial component to disease spread and the population is heterogeneous predicting how the epidemic size varies with the initial source of infection is far more complex. Here we use a well-developed spatio-temporal model of the spread of foot-and-mouth disease, parameterised to match the 2001 UK Outbreak, to address the relationship between the scale of the epidemic {{and the nature of the}} initially <b>infected</b> <b>farm.</b> We show that there is considerable heterogeneity in both the likelihood of a epidemic and the epidemic impact (total number of farms losing livestock to either infection or control) and that these two elements are best captured by measurements at different spatial scales. The likelihood of an epidemic can be predicted from a knowledge of the reproduction ratio of the initial farm (R-i), whereas the epidemic impact conditional on an epidemic occurring is best predicted by averaging the second-generation reproduction ratio (R-i((2))) in a 58 km ring around the <b>infected</b> <b>farm.</b> Combining these two predictions provides a good assessment of both the local and larger-scale heterogeneities present in this complex system.

Map spread between farms is mainly due to animal movements. Locally, herd size and management {{are expected to}} influence infection dynamics. To provide {{a better understanding of}} Map spread between dairy cattle farms at a regional scale, we describe the first spatio-temporal model accounting simultaneously for population and infection dynamics and indirect local transmission within dairy farms, and between-farm transmission through animal trade. This model is applied to Brittany, a French region characterized by a high density of dairy cattle, based on data on animal trade, herd size and farm management (birth, death, renewal, and culling) from 2005 to 2013 for 12 857 dairy farms. In all simulated scenarios, Map infection highly persisted at the metapopulation scale. The characteristics of initially <b>infected</b> <b>farms</b> strongly impacted the regional Map spread. Network-related features of incident farms influenced their ability to contaminate disease-free farms. At the herd level, we highlighted a balanced effect of the number of animals purchased: when large, it led to a high probability of farm infection but to a low persistence. This effect was reduced when prevalence in initially <b>infected</b> <b>farms</b> increased.

40|$|After the {{foot-and-mouth disease}} (FMD) {{outbreak}} in 2001 the Dutch government implemented movement-prevention regulations {{to reduce the}} number of contacts between farms and consequently the risk of spread of highly contagious animal infections in the future. We studied the efficacy of these regulations by comparing registered cattle-movement data from 2000 to those from 2002. We also used the spatial and stochastic simulation model InterFMD to evaluate the consequences of the observed alterations in cattle-contact structure on the spread and control of a FMD epidemic. There was a significant decrease in the number of cattle movements ¿for live use¿, no difference in the number of group movements ¿for live use¿ and a distinct change in the overall contact structure. The most important structure changes were a decrease in the number of group movements from dairy farms to cattle-collection centres (¿ 44 %), and an increase in the number of group movements from dairy farms to beef farms (111 %). Our simulations demonstrated that the implemented regulations result in a concentration of the FMD-affected area and therefore in a reduction in size of the epidemics.

40|$|Abstract Background This study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} {{risk factors for}} active porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infection at farm level and to assess the probability of an <b>infected</b> <b>farm</b> being detected through passive disease surveillance in England. Data were obtained from a cross-sectional study on 147 farrow-to-finish farms conducted from April 2008 – April 2009. The risk factors for active PRRSV infection were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The surveillance system was evaluated using a stochastic scenario tree model. Results Evidence of PRRSV circulation was confirmed on 35. 1 % (95 %CI: 26. 8 - 43. 4) of farms in the cross sectional study, with {{a higher proportion of}} infected farms in areas with high pig density (more than 15000 pigs within 10 km radius from the farm). Farms {{were more likely to have}} active PRRSV infection if they used the live virus vaccine-Porcilis PRRS (OR= 7. 5, 95 %CI: 2. 5 - 22. 8), were located in high pig density areas (OR= 2. 9, 95 %CI: 1. 0 - 8. 3) or had dead pigs collected (OR= 5. 6, 95 %CI: 1. 7 - 18. 3). Farms that weaned pigs at 28 days of age or later had lower odds of being PRRSV positive compared to those weaning at 21 - 27 days (OR= 0. 2, 95 %CI: 0. 1 - 0. 7). The probability of detecting an <b>infected</b> <b>farm</b> through passive surveillance for disease was low (mode= 0. 074, 5 th and 95 th percentiles: 0. 067; 0. 083 respectively).

Conclusions Risk factors identified highlight the importance of biosecurity measures for the incursion of PRRSV infection. The results further indicate that a combined approach of surveillance for infection and disease diagnosis is needed to assist effective control and/or elimination of PRRSV from the pig population. </p...|$|E
