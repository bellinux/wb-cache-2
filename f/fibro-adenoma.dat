40|$|Data {{regarding}} {{the effects of}} progesterone and a progestagen on human normal breast epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis are presented here. In postmenopausal women, adding progesterone to percutaneously administrated oestradiol significantly reduces the proliferation induced by oestradiol. In vitro and in premenopausal women, stopping the administration of nomegestrol acetate triggers a peak of apoptosis. <b>Fibro-adenoma</b> and cancerous cells do not show this regulation of apoptosis. Progesterone seems {{to be important in}} normal breast homeostasis. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} the data {{is one of the}} most {{important}} factors influencing the performance of any classification or clustering algorithm. The attributes defining the feature space of a given data set can often be inadequate, which make it difficult to discover interesting knowledge or desired output. An electrical impedance measurement in samples of freshly excised tissue from the breast is one of the techniques to discriminate Carcinoma, <b>Fibro-adenoma,</b> Mastopathy, Glandular, Connective and Adipose (cellular transformation). In this context, the state-of-the-art software RapidMiner already provides easy to use interfaces for developing and evaluating classification and validation and Machine Learning applications. C. Y. V. Watanabe reported output at very high accuracy and prove the value of validation using SACMiner. The aim of this work is to implement a RapidMiner extension that contains the most applicable classification algorithms to enable non-experts to easily apply them. Secondly an evaluation of the implemented algorithms was carried out in an attempt to show the relative strength and weakness of the algorithms as Watanabe’s work. Simultaneously attempt was made to use evolutionary parameter optimization for selection of optimal values of model parameters for enhancement of model accuracy. Efforts were also made to identify the attributes that influences the accuracy of the result using weighting attributes. The performance of the implemented and the proposed algorithms were evaluated on real world data sets from the UCI machine learning repository...|$|E
40|$|Fibronectin {{and types}} I, III and IV {{collagens}} were localized by an indirect immunofluorescence technique in 10 <b>fibro-adenomas</b> and 27 mammary adenocarcinomas. In the benign lesions, a densification {{of a type}} III collagen meshwork was noted around galactophoric channels. In carcinomas, various patterns of connective tissue proteins distributions were observed depending upon the histological types of lesions. Connective tissue proteins are restricted to the perivascular areas in mucinous carcinomas. Type III collagen is largely distributed in the stroma of poorly differentiated tumors. In differentiated carcinomas, discontinuous linear deposits of type IV collagen or fibronectin are localized at the border of epithelial proliferations. They probably represent the remmants of epithelial basement membrane. In intra- canalar adenocarcinomas, type IV collagen and fibronectin form irregular and discontinuous depositifs. These finding indicate that extensive connective tissue remodelling is observed during neoplastic infiltration. The type of stroma and connective tissue proteins distributed in these epithelial proliferations depends primarily upon the histological type of malignant infiltrating carcinomas. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{controversy}} of {{the role}} of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in breast carcinomas has been reported in the literature. Objectives: We carried on this research to explore possible association between EBV infection and breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) in Egyptian women attending our center. Study design: This study carried out at Sohag university hospital on 84 paraffin embedded samples of breast tissue, of them 42 breast IDC as the case group and 42 breast fibroadenomas as the control group. Nested PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) done separately for all samples to identify the Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen- 1 (EBNA- 1) gene and EBV latent membrane protein- 1 (LMP- 1) respectively, in breast cancer cells and controls. Results: Specimen considered positive when both (EBNA- 1) gene and LMP- 1 were detected using PCR and IHC separately for the same sample, this was achieved by 10 / 42 (23. 81 %) of breast IDC (case group) and 6 / 42 (14. 29 %) of breast <b>fibro-adenomas</b> (control group) (P-value =  0. 4). Nodal involvement was the only parameter that demonstrated a significant statistical relationship with EBV presence in cancerous tissue with p-value =  0. 003. Conclusion: Our research could not find a significant statistical association between EBV infection and breast IDC in Egyptian women attending our center, but, there might be an association between the existence of EBV and tumor aggressiveness...|$|R
40|$|PEPTIDASES {{are widely}} {{distributed}} throughout the mammalian body and are especially rich in the small intestinal epithelium and kidney tubular epithelium. The presence of a high content of fibrous protein in connective tissue has led to considerable interest in the possible role of proteolytic enzymes in tumour invasion. Burstone (1956) and Glenner, Burstone and Meyer (1959) have shown a high activity of peptidases in the stroma {{of a number of}} primary carcinomas of several organs and more variable, but usually less, activity in the epithelium. However, only 2 cases of carcinoma of breast and 2 of " fibrocystic " disease of breast were studied. In addition Monis, Nachlas and Seligman (1959) have studied 1 carcinoma and 6 benign tumours of breast. We have found only one reference since then to aminopeptidase activity in breast lesions and that in aspirated carcinomatous cells (Elizalde and Miller, 1967). The histochemical aminopeptidase activity in normal human breast has not been previously reported. Histochemical demonstration of peptidase activity is limited to the demonstration of aminopeptidase, which is an enzyme hydrolysing a number of peptides which have a free a-amino group to a terminal amino acid. In this paper the aminopeptidase activity of normal human breast is compared with that of cystic epithelial hyperplasia, <b>fibro-adenoma</b> and carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS Breast tissue was obtained fresh from routine biopsy specimens sent for rapid diagnosis by frozen section. The age of the patients ranged from 23 to 72 years. Normal breast tissue was obtained from a portion of a radical mastectomy far removed from the main lesion. Samples were frozen immediately with a carbon dioxide ethanol mixture (- 70 ° C.) and sectioned without delay on a Slee cryostat at 5 - 7,u. Fixation and dehydration of the sections were accomplished synchronously by immersion in acetone at- 20 ° C. for 12 hours. L-leucyl-finaphthylamide or DL-alanyl-/I-naphthylamide were used as substrate for aminopeptidase, tissue sections being incubated with each of the two substrates in all cases. Incubation was carried out at 37 ° C. for 4 hours in a mixture containing: Substrate (L-leucyl- or DL-alanyl-/ 3 -naphthylamide) 4 mg. Sodium chloride 085 % 4 - 0 ml...|$|E
