5|$|On July 1, 1998, an ammonia leak and <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the Seward Fisheries plant {{caused a}} fire {{that led to the}} {{evacuation}} of Homer Spit and the ultimate destruction of the facility, which until then had been the major supplier of fish remains for Keene's feeding operation. But Keene was able to report when winter came that she had found other sources and was ready for the eagles when they returned.|$|E
5|$|Rescuers {{heading to}} the scene of the Kehoe farm fire heard the <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the school building, turned back, and headed toward the school. Parents within the rural {{community}} also began rushing to the school. The school building had turned into a war zone with 38 people killed in the initial explosion, mostly children.|$|E

5|$|Between 16:55 and 16:57, Seydlitz {{was struck}} by two heavy caliber shells from Queen Mary. The first shell {{penetrated}} {{the side of the}} ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine was a British Fort ship {{which was}} built in Canada in 1942. Owned by the American War Shipping Administration, she was leased under charter to the Ministry of War Transport under the Lend-Lease scheme and {{operated}} under {{the management of the}} Port Line. Fort Stikine only had a short career, and was destroyed in an <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> Bombay, India, in April 1944 that caused the loss of a further thirteen ships.|$|E
5|$|In 1906 a major <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> a {{colliery}} in Courrières, northern France, {{caused the}} deaths of more than 1,000 miners. The subsequent report blamed the accidental ignition of firedamp, exacerbated by coal dust in the air. Concerned that a similar disaster might happen in British collieries, the Royal Commission was formed, reporting back in 1907, 1909 and 1911. The reports led to the Coal Mines Act 1911, which came into force December that year. Among other changes {{to the health and}} safety culture, the act required that ventilation fans in all collieries be capable of reversing the air current underground; this measure was to be implemented by 1 January 1913.|$|E

5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} audience to debate whether or not she survived the hotel <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the end of the episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|The {{remaining}} two ships of the class, one operating on each side, were both {{lost in the}} Spanish Civil War. España (ex-Alfonso XIII), serving the Nationalist side, struck a mine in April 1937 and sunk, while Jaime I fighting {{as part of the}} Republican navy, suffered an internal <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> Cartagena in June 1937, being scuttled as a precautionary measure afterwards. The wreck was raised the following year before being scrapped in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The third {{scenario}} {{involved an}} <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> {{a nuclear reactor}} facility which shuts down two of three reactors. Everyone is killed in the disaster and scientists must send in an aerial robot to find the operating reactor building, enter the building (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the control panels {{to determine if a}} melt-down is imminent. The scientists are forced to maintain a 3 kilometer stand-off distance due to the extreme radiation hazard.|$|E

5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} environmental {{concern in the}} Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected data on the prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns of others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Eight of {{the attacks}} {{occurred}} in South Mumbai: at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, the Oberoi Trident, the Taj Palace & Tower, Leopold Cafe, Cama Hospital, the Nariman House Jewish community centre, the Metro Cinema, and in a lane behind the Times of India building and St. Xavier's College. There was also an <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> Mazagaon, in Mumbai's port area, and in a taxi at Vile Parle. By the early morning of 28 November, all sites except for the Taj Hotel had been secured by Mumbai Police Department and security forces. On 29 November, India's National Security Guards (NSG) conducted 'Operation Black Tornado' to flush out the remaining attackers; it culminated {{in the death of}} the last remaining attackers at the Taj Hotel and ended the attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Conant {{entered into}} a {{business}} partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices {{on account of the}} interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, there was an <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the plant. Pennock and two other workers were killed and the plant was completely destroyed. One of the contributing causes was Conant's faulty test procedures.|$|E
40|$|Some {{characteristics}} of earthquakes and air-shocks are compared among three styles ofexplosive eruption, those are, explosion and successive minor eruption at Sakurajima, and ex-plosion at Suwanosejima. The following results are obtained. 1) The maximum amplitudes of vertical component are 3 - 30 mkine in explosion earthquakesat Sakurajima, less than 13 mkine in eruption earthquakes at Suwanosejima {{and less than}} 7 mkine in BL-type earthquakes at Sakurajima. The epicentral distances are around 3 km. Theamplitudes of compressional phase of air-shocks are 0. 2 - 5 mb in <b>explosions</b> <b>at</b> Sakurajima, lessthan 2 mb in <b>explosions</b> <b>at</b> Suwanosejima and less than 0. 1 mb in successive minor eruptions atSakurajima. The infrasonic microphones are 6 km and 3. 3 km apart from the craters at Sakura-jima and Suwanosejima, respectively. 2) Comparing the three styles of eruptions in the same amplitude-range of eruption earthquakes(5 - 7 mkine), the amplitudes of air-shock by <b>explosions</b> <b>at</b> Suwanosejima are larger than those bysuccessive minor eruptions at Sakurajima, but are smaller than those by <b>explosions</b> <b>at</b> Sakuraji-ma. This result suggests that the ratio of seismic energy to infrasonic one changes with theseeruption styles. 3) The intensity of the explosions in the active period during 1988 - 1989 at Mt. Tokachi wasas large {{as that of the}} strongest <b>explosions</b> <b>at</b> Suwanosejima in 1989. However, the volume ofpyroclastic materials, the time interval of eruption and the duration of compressional phase ofair-shock at Mt. Tokachi are closer to those at Sakurajima...|$|R

5|$|In late February–early March 1878, Louis {{was still}} {{serving on the}} Sultan as it lay in the Bosphorus during the Russo-Turkish War. He was criticised for visiting his brother, Prince Alexander, who was serving with the Russian forces, but an {{investigation}} cleared both Louis and Alexander, as well as Prince Alfred, of any wrongdoing. For {{the next two years}} Louis served on HMS Agincourt and on the Royal Yacht, HMY Osborne, but in October 1879 he refused further service on the Royal Yacht, saying it was damaging his professional career, and requested half-pay until he could be given an active duty. On 17 February 1880 he, his father, and Tsar Alexander II witnessed an <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, when Stephen Chalturin unsuccessfully attempted to assassinate the Tsar with dynamite beneath the great dining room.|$|E
5|$|Mining was {{to remain}} the {{principal}} industry of Brownhills until the last pit closed in the 1950s. During the 18th and 19th centuries the area known as Coppice Side was {{the hub of the}} mining industry, and the census of 1841 showed that over 80% {{of the population of the}} area which makes up modern Brownhills lived and worked there, with up to ten pits active in the area at any one time. As in other mining areas, several men lost their lives in the Brownhills pits. Seven miners, including a boy aged 11, died in an accident in 1861, and in October 1930 an <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the Grove Colliery killed fourteen miners, ten of them from Brownhills.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 20 October 1916, a fire was {{discovered}} in the Imperatritsa Mariyas forward powder magazine while at anchor in Sevastopol, but it exploded before any efforts {{could be made to}} fight the fire. Sailors led by Engineer-Mechanic Midshipman Ignatyev, however, managed to flood the forward shell magazine before the <b>explosion</b> <b>at</b> the cost of their own lives. Their action probably prevented a catastrophic detonation {{and all of the other}} magazines were flooded as a precaution. About forty minutes after the first explosion, a second occurred in the vicinity of the torpedo compartment that destroyed the watertight integrity of the rest of the forward bulkheads. Imperatritsa Mariya began to sink by the bow and listed to starboard. She capsized a few minutes later, taking 228 sailors with her. The subsequent investigation determined that the explosion was probably the result of spontaneous combustion of the nitrocellulose-based propellant as it decomposed.|$|E
