5|$|Some jumping spiders' {{visual acuity}} exceeds {{by a factor}} of ten that of dragonflies, which have by far the best vision among insects; in fact the human eye is only about five times sharper than a jumping spider's. They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the scanning and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
5|$|Gradually, the low {{frequency}} active RC filter was supplanted by the switched-capacitor filter that operated in the discrete time domain {{rather than the}} continuous time domain. All of these filter technologies require precision components for high performance filtering, and that often requires that the filters be tuned. Adjustable components are expensive, and the labor to do the tuning can be significant. Tuning the poles and zeros of a 7th-order elliptic filter {{is not a simple}} exercise. Integrated circuits have made digital computation inexpensive, so now {{low frequency}} filtering is done with digital signal processors. Such digital filters have no problem implementing ultra-precise (and stable) values, so no tuning or adjustment is required. Digital filters also don't have to worry about stray coupling paths and shielding the individual filter sections from one another. One <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the digital signal processing may consume much more power than an equivalent LC filter. Inexpensive digital technology has largely supplanted analogue implementations of filters. However, there is still an occasional place for them in the simpler applications such as coupling where sophisticated functions of frequency are not needed.|$|E
25|$|Most hobs are single-thread hobs, but double-, and triple-thread hobs {{increase}} production rates. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> {{that they are}} not as accurate as single-thread hobs.|$|E
50|$|The Blower Bentley was born, more {{powerful}} than the 6½ Litre despite lacking the two additional cylinders. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that Blower Bentleys consumed 4 litres of fuel per minute at full speed.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> {{relatively}} low battery life, slower performance compared to devices with Intel Core processors {{and a high}} price since accessories like Surface Pen and Type Cover are not included.|$|R
50|$|A V8 {{engine in}} the {{lightweight}} vehicle meant impressive performance for a truck. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> the gruesome fuel consumption and from 1964 onwards the Snabbe was offered with a diesel engine as an alternative.|$|R
25|$|Human powered {{transport}} includes walking, bicycles, velomobiles, row boats, {{and other}} environmentally friendly {{ways of getting}} around. In addition to {{the health benefits of}} the exercise provided, they are far more environmentally friendly than most other options. The only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the speed limitations, and how far one can travel before getting exhausted.|$|E
25|$|Again, {{with every}} doubling, the <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the {{increased}} latency. As with all DDR SDRAM generations, commands are still restricted to one clock edge and command latencies {{are given in}} terms of clock cycles, which are half {{the speed of the}} usually quoted transfer rate (a CAS latency of 8 with DDR3-800 is 8/(400MHz) = 20 ns, exactly the same latency of CAS2 on PC100 SDR SDRAM).|$|E
25|$|Another <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> {{that the}} EDS system {{naturally}} creates {{a field in}} the track in front and {{to the rear of}} the lift magnets, which acts against the magnets and creates magnetic drag. This is generally only a concern at low speeds (This is one of the reasons why JR abandoned a purely repulsive system and adopted the sidewall levitation system.) At higher speeds other modes of drag dominate.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Bentley Blower" [...] was born, more {{powerful}} than the 6½ Litre despite lacking the two additional cylinders. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that Blower Bentleys consume 4 liters of fuel per minute at full speed.|$|R
50|$|The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> that textures may {{not appear}} as sharp {{if they are}} {{included}} in the edge detection, and it must be applied before rendering the HUD elements of a game, lest it affect them too.|$|R
50|$|The Smith Carbine {{was unique}} in that it broke apart in the middle for loading and it used rubber {{cartridges}} which sealed the gases in the breech. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that these cartridges were difficult to remove.|$|R
25|$|Riggers jump in to {{machines}} {{to control them}} with their mind. While jumped in {{they feel like they}} are the machine, using the vehicle or drone's sensors to replace their own. This allows the rigger to control the machine at Matrix speeds and with greater precision. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> if the machine takes damage the rigger {{will have to deal with}} dangerous levels of biofeedback. Likewise the rigger may have to engage in cybercombat with other hackers that are attempting to hijack their devices.|$|E
25|$|An {{adiabatic}} {{storage system}} does {{away with the}} intercooling during the compression process, and simply allows the gas to heat up during compression, and likewise to cool down during expansion. This is attractive, since the energy losses associated with the heat transfer are avoided, but the <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the storage vessel must be insulated against heat loss. It should also be mentioned that real compressors and turbines are not isentropic, but instead have an isentropic efficiency of around 85%, {{with the result that}} round-trip storage efficiency for adiabatic systems is also considerably less than perfect.|$|E
25|$|Event-related {{optical signal}} (EROS) is a brain-scanning {{technique}} which uses infrared light through optical fibers to measure changes in optical properties of active {{areas of the}} cerebral cortex. Whereas techniques such as diffuse optical imaging (DOT) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measure optical absorption of haemoglobin, and thus are based on blood flow, EROS {{takes advantage of the}} scattering properties of the neurons themselves, and thus provides a much more direct measure of cellular activity. EROS can pinpoint activity in the brain within millimeters (spatially) and within milliseconds (temporally). Its biggest <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> the inability to detect activity more than a few centimeters deep. EROS is a new, relatively inexpensive technique that is non-invasive to the test subject. It was developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where it is now used in the Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory of Dr. Gabriele Gratton and Dr. Monica Fabiani.|$|E
50|$|The Philadelphia Flyers {{become the}} first team to wear long pants. The idea was to create a more {{streamlined}} uniform with lighter padding, thus making the players faster. The <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> that the players hit the boards faster after being bodychecked.|$|R
50|$|Advantages are {{increased}} efficiency {{at lower}} speeds (<10 knots), better course stability and less vulnerability to debris. <b>Downsides</b> <b>are</b> reduced efficiency at higher speeds (>10 knots), course stability when sailing astern, and increase of cavitation. Ducted propellers {{are also used}} to replace rudders.|$|R
50|$|Lazy copy {{looks to}} the outside just as a deep copy, but takes {{advantage}} of the speed of a shallow copy whenever possible. The <b>downside</b> <b>are</b> rather high but constant base costs because of the counter. Also, in certain situations, circular references can cause problems.|$|R
25|$|Pelagic spawners: {{a type of}} {{broadcast}} spawners, spawn in the open sea, mostly near the surface. They are usually pelagic fish such as tuna and sardines. Some demersal fish leave the bottom to spawn pelagically, particularly coral reef fish such as parrotfish and wrasses. Pelagic spawning means water currents widely disperse the young. The eggs, embryos and larvae of pelagic spawners contain oil globules or have a high water content. As a result, they are buoyant and are widely dispersed by currents. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that mortality is high, {{because they can be}} eaten so easily by pelagic predators or they can drift into unsuitable areas. Females compensate by spawning large numbers of eggs and extending their spawning periods. Pelagic spawners that live in or around coral reefs can spawn a small number of eggs almost daily over a period of months. These fishes have complex breeding behaviours including sex changes, harems, leks and territoriality. See also: Coral reef fish.|$|E
25|$|Type III has {{relatively}} high early strength. Its typical compound composition is: 57% (C3S), 19% (C2S), 10% (C3A), 7% (C4AF), 3.0% MgO, 3.1% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 1.3% free CaO. This cement {{is similar to}} type I, but ground finer. Some manufacturers make a separate clinker with higher C3S and/or C3A content, but this is increasingly rare, and the general purpose clinker is usually used, ground to a specific surface area typically 50–80% higher. The gypsum level may also be increased a small amount. This gives the concrete using this type of cement a three-day compressive strength equal to the seven-day compressive strength of types I and II. Its seven-day compressive strength is almost equal to 28-day compressive strengths of types I and II. The only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the six-month strength of type III is the same or slightly {{less than that of}} types I and II. Therefore, the long-term strength is sacrificed. It is usually used for precast concrete manufacture, where high one-day strength allows fast turnover of molds. It may also be used in emergency construction and repairs, and construction of machine bases and gate installations.|$|E
500|$|Francis Iles, {{writing in}} The Guardian, noting the short-story format, [...] "thought {{it better than}} the novels" [...] and wrote that [...] "the first story is full of the old wild improbabilities, {{but one of the}} others has a {{positively}} Maughamish flavour." [...] Iles also thought that [...] "it seems that one must either enjoy the novels of Mr. Ian Fleming beyond reason or be unable to read them at all." [...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along. Perhaps all that mattress pounding is taking it out of poor Bond".|$|E
5000|$|A {{complete}} emulator {{provides a}} simulation of {{all aspects of}} the hardware, allowing all of it to be controlled and modified, and allowing debugging on a normal PC. The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> expense and slow operation, in some cases up to 100 times slower than the final system.|$|R
25|$|While this {{machinery}} {{would prove}} capable of outperforming the opposition, the <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> economy of operation. Fuel consumption for Baltic reached between 75 and 85 tons of coal per day, {{more than twice}} as much as the 35 to 45 tons a day for her Cunard Line competitors.|$|R
50|$|Looking at upside {{risk and}} {{downside}} risk separately provides much more useful information to investors than does only {{looking at the}} single Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) beta. The comparison of upside to <b>downside</b> risk <b>is</b> necessary because “modern portfolio theory measures risk in terms of standard deviation of asset returns, which treats {{both positive and negative}} deviations from expected returns as risk.” In other words, regular beta measures both upside and <b>downside</b> risk. This <b>is</b> a major distinction that the CAPM fails to take into account, because the model assumes that upside beta and <b>downside</b> beta <b>are</b> the same. In reality, they are seldom the same, and making the distinction between upside and <b>downside</b> risk <b>is</b> necessary and important.|$|R
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Adam B. Vary {{wrote that}} Beyoncé was [...] "at her peak — in voice, in looks, in taste in opulent wedding gowns". A Rolling Stones critic commented Beyoncé was looking {{stunning}} in a bridal suite, {{adding that the}} most disarming thing about the clip is that she sings directly to the camera. The review concludes that, [...] "the video hits all of its marks perfectly, conveying all of the nuances in the lyrics while providing a lovely, memorable visual." [...] The Washington Posts Sarah Anne Hughes wrote Beyoncé is [...] "extravagantly dressed" [...] in the video adding that the only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> {{that there is no}} dance in the tradition of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)" [...] (2008). Kara Warner of MTV News called [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] and [...] "Best Thing I Never Had", [...] "as different as night and day" [...] adding that the same thing happened with their music videos. Werner further praised Beyoncé [...] "gorgeous" [...] dress and added that it [...] "will likely land on a few style blogs soon, given its embroidered and jeweled details, not to mention the silk bows and ruching on the sides". A writer of The Huffington Post described the video as a transition to the one for [...] "Run the World". Cristina Everett of Daily News noted that the look of satisfaction and hapinness on her face make the video the best revenge for her ex-lover. Pitchfork Media's Tom Breihan noted that Beyoncé was looking [...] "makeup-commercial-flawless". He also wrote that if country singer Kellie Pickler remade the video shot-for-shot, it would never leave CMT rotation for it is [...] "a perfect CMT video".|$|E
500|$|The PC port {{was also}} well-received. Lee Buchanan of PC Gamer US praised [...] "the {{spectacular}} visuals that bring to life the most jarring collisions I've {{seen on a}} computer", and he noted that [...] " [...] damage is depicted beautifully". Like Lucas, he wrote that the player [...] "can't just mindlessly smash into other cars; this is thinking man's destruction". Although he found the game too easy [...] "even at the toughest difficulty level", he found {{this to be a}} minor issue that did not detract from the experience. He considered the game's online play to be a high point, and he finished, [...] "Destruction Derby is a blast, and a welcome change of pace from high-end driving simulations." [...] Peter Olafson of Computer Gaming World called the game [...] "a great simulation" [...] of demolition derbies, and he wrote that the wrecks are [...] "convulsive and realistic". He believed that the game [...] "has never-before-seen quality that will instantly make it a showpiece game to demonstrate to open-mouthed friends and relatives", and he considered the car damage to be [...] "especially marvelous—and unprecedented for this sort of game". However, he found that its [...] "useful life span is surprisingly short" [...] and he hoped for a track editor in its sequel. He summarised, [...] "Despite its limitations, this is a great game, but it has a lot more potential." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation remarked that while the game is a straight port of the PlayStation version, it is an impeccably accurate one. He applauded the authentic modelling of vehicle crashes, multiple modes, smoothness of gameplay, and inclusion of both network and modem options, and found the game's only <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that the camera zooms out so little that {{it can be difficult to}} see nearby cars.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Downside</b> <b>is</b> run by lay {{staff and}} the Benedictine monks of Downside Abbey. Several monks work in the school as {{teachers}} and chaplains. The school is controlled by trustees who are the Abbot [...] - or as at present, the Prior Administrator - and monks from Downside Abbey, with two external trustee monks.|$|E
50|$|A <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> an {{increase}} in the car's insurance group from 9 to 12. The exterior look was amended as the 406 featured more pronounced ribs, clear headlights, chrome trim and a new honeycomb grill. The rear lights were finished in red with a strip of the car's paint colour across the centre.|$|R
50|$|For Sussex, {{the only}} <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> the tiny crowds {{at their home}} playoff games: barely 2,000 for the four games combined, in a 4,000-seat stadium. (Minor league {{baseball}} playoff games often draw poorly, however, {{due to a lack}} of promotion.) Their regular season average attendance slid to 1,713, next-to-last, ahead of only the Nashua Pride.|$|R
5000|$|PhoneArena {{gave the}} Lumia 950 {{a score of}} 7/10, {{describing}} it as [...] "a phone ideal for the Windows fan", praising the display as well as features like Windows Hello, Continuum and Office integration. The main <b>downsides</b> <b>were</b> seen to be the design and app selection, while battery performance {{was determined to be}} average.|$|R
2500|$|Undercomplete {{dictionaries}} {{represent the}} setup {{in which the}} actual input data lies in a lower-dimensional space. This case is strongly related to dimensionality reduction and techniques like principal component analysis which require atoms [...] to be orthogonal. [...] The choice of these subspaces is crucial for efficient dimensionality reduction, {{but it is not}} trivial. [...] And dimensionality reduction based on dictionary representation can be extended to address specific tasks such as data analysis or classification. However, their main <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> limiting the choice of atoms.|$|E
2500|$|Forward stance: Suitable {{for most}} purposes, both feet are angled forward. Frequently the leading foot is angled roughly 15° to 21° and the {{trailing}} foot at 0° to 10°. A <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that a rider's balance is notably different when riding in reverse {{compared to their}} forward stance. [...] This can be compensated for by learning how to ride backwards with this stance, also known as riding [...] "switch", or by choosing another stance such as Duck, or Flat stance. As riders become more experienced, they can experiment with different [...] "stances" [...] to feel {{what is best for}} them.|$|E
2500|$|There is no flash {{produced}} so material {{savings are}} between 20 and 30% over conventional forging. The final product is a consistent [...] so air cooling {{will result in}} a part that is still easily machinable (the advantage being the lack of annealing required after forging). Tolerances are usually ±, surfaces are clean, and draft angles are 0.5 to 1°. Tool life is nearly double that of conventional forging because contact times are on the order of 0.06-second. The <b>downside</b> <b>is</b> that this process is only feasible on smaller symmetric parts and cost; the initial investment can be over $10 million, so large quantities are required to justify this process.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, <b>Downside</b> <b>was</b> {{the setting}} for a {{television}} show A Second Chance, in which a teenager from London, Ryan Bell, <b>was</b> sent to <b>Downside</b> {{to see if a}} 'difficult' student would do better in the independent sector. After excelling at Latin, biology, and on the rugby field, Bell was eventually expelled after being caught drinking.|$|R
50|$|In {{its first}} appearance, Krypton was only {{depicted}} {{at the moment}} of its destruction. Soon, beginning in the Superman comic strip, Krypton was shown to have been a planet similar to Earth, only older by eons and possessed of all the beneficial progress that implied (though the <b>downside</b> <b>was</b> the hint that Krypton exploded due mainly to old age).|$|R
50|$|While setup {{costs are}} high, once ready to produce, {{injection}} molding produces stocks {{for less than}} the cost of the cheapest wood stocks. Every stock is virtually identical in dimension, and requires no bedding, inletting, or finishing. The <b>downsides</b> <b>are</b> a lack of rigidity and thermal stability, which are side effects of the thermoplastic materials used for injection molding.|$|R
