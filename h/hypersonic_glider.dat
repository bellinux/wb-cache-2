5000|$|In 2010, the United States Air Force prototyped a PGS {{system based}} on a {{modified}} Minuteman III ICBM. In March 2011, Air Force Major General David Scott stated that the service {{had no plans to}} use a sea- or land-based ICBM system for Prompt Global Strike, as they would be expensive to develop and potentially [...] "dangerous." [...] Instead, efforts would focus on a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider.</b> However, the following day, Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force Norton Schwartz said that an ICBM-based PGS system was still an option.|$|E
5000|$|The DF-ZF is a {{dangerous}} weapon because <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> vehicles are [...] "almost impossible to intercept by conventional missile defense systems, which track incoming objects via satellite sensors and ground and sea radar." [...] According to some sources, one weakness in the Chinese DF-ZF program {{is a lack of}} high-performance computing power, which stymies design. However, Chinese supercomputers named world's top 2 fastest systems on 2016 TOP500 list and China draws equal to the U.S. in overall installations. Despite such reports, the program keeps going ahead with seven launches, all them successful, as of 2016.|$|E

50|$|The HGV is {{intended}} to be less susceptible to anti-ballistic missile countermeasures than conventional reentry vehicles (RVs). Normal RVs descend through the atmosphere on a predictable ballistic trajectory - their high speeds makes intercepting them extremely difficult. By the late 1980s, however, several countries began to develop interceptor missiles designed to destroy ballistic RVs. A <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> like the HGV could pull-up after reentering the atmosphere and approach its target in a relatively flat glide, lessening the time it can be detected, fired at, or reengaged if the initial attack failed. Gliding makes it more maneuverable and extends its range.|$|E
40|$|To {{solve the}} multiobjective {{optimization}} problem on <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> vehicle trajectory design subjected to complex constraints, this paper proposes a multiobjective trajectory optimization method that combines the boundary intersection method and pseudospectral method. The multiobjective trajectory optimization problem (MTOP) is established {{based on the}} analysis of the feature of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> vehicle trajectory. The MTOP is translated into a set of general optimization subproblems by using the boundary intersection method and pseudospectral method. The subproblems are solved by nonlinear programming algorithm. In this method, the solution that has been solved is employed as the initial guess for the next subproblem so that the time consumption of the entire multiobjective trajectory optimization problem shortens. The maximal range and minimal peak heat problem is solved by the proposed method. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain the Pareto front of the optimal trajectory, which can provide the reference for the trajectory design of <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> vehicle...|$|E
40|$|International audienceShortest {{paths in}} 3 -dimensional {{space of a}} <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> in a {{heterogeneous}} environment are considered in this paper. The environment is heterogeneous {{in the sense that}} the maximum curvature of the vehicle path varies and depends on the position of the vehicle. Path generation is based on the Dubins-like model. It assumes that initial and final states are sufficiently far from each other so that the CSC (Curve-Straight line-Curve) path is the shortest path between both states. Paths are calculated based on the optimal control theory and a geometrical approach. This method is computationally fast and easy to implement in a real time system. Moreover, paths found by this method are more realistic than existing Dubins' paths...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of ceramic matrix composites (CMC) for passive boundary layer transition {{control on the}} hypersonic ﬂight vehicle HEXAFLY-INT is investigated. CMC can be manufactured as ultrasonically absorptive ceramic: for the presented numerical investigations carbon ﬁber reinforced carbon material (C/C) {{is used for the}} passive damping of acoustic second mode instabilities. The analyses are performed with the stability code NOLOT, NOnLOcal Transition analysis, of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The boundary conditions of the NOLOT code are extended for the application of random porous surfaces and consider the acoustic properties of the C/C. In this paper a trajectory segment of interest for the application of ultrasonically absorptive ceramics on the HEXAFLY-INT <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> is investigated. For chosen ﬂight conditions and a corresponding test condition of the DLR High Enthalpy Shock Tunnel Göttingen (HEG) detailed stability analyses with NOLOT are performed: this includes the investigation of the second mode damping due to the passive porous ceramic...|$|E
40|$|The descent {{longitudinal}} trajectory control {{methodology of}} a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> {{to carry out}} a pullup maneuver is presented. A dynamic pole placement controller is implemented as the baseline controller. The baseline controller is augmented with an L 1 adaptive controller to cancel out the matched and unmatched uncertainties. The differences between the pole placement and the L 1 augmented pole placement controller are presented in terms of performance with the help of Monte Carlo simulations. The dynamic pole placement controller is shown to have robustness in the presence of time-invariant and time-varying errors in the aerodynamic coefficients, control surface, and gravimetric uncertainties. The augmented controller improves the performance of the baseline controller in the presence of these uncertainties. This is concluded with a reduction in the tracking error norm kepkL 2 and the control surface norm, which is the energy of the deviation between the reference and real control signal; Mub >MuL 1. The use of the adaptive controller, however, reduces the time delay margin of the system. The contribution of this paper lies in the application and determination of the performance of a piecewise constant L 1 adaptive augmentation setup to a nonminimum phase linear time-varying state feedback system...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{simulation}} of an adaptive longitudinal control {{system for a}} Mach 8 <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> is detailed. The vehicle is equipped with two elevons for control surfaces. It is required to perform a flight-path angle pull-up manoeuvre during the reentry phase of a parabolic trajectory. This is achieved with a normal acceleration longitudinal controller. The controller uses the pole-placement technique to calculate gains in real time. The gain calculations {{are based on a}} set of error-minimised model parameters, which are a fusion of real-time measured parameters, found using recursive least squares and stored look-up table parameters. In addition, a first order filter is used to update the look-up table parameters so that future control system gain calculations are not dependent on the presence of system excitation. It is shown that such a system can provide a small performance improvement in overshoot. One fundamental problem with implementation of the system in real time is the lag between the fused parameter estimates and when such parameters are required by the autopilot. Typically the autopilot operates at a higher frequency than the fused parameter estimates and thus corrects a disturbance due to real parameter change before suitable update information is received for gain calculation. The system is suggested as a useful diagnostic tool for experimental flights of this nature, or for real-time use on a more suitable dynamic system...|$|E
40|$|The descent {{longitudinal}} trajectory control {{methodology of}} a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> is presented. The overall desired trajectory is presented, {{followed by a}} basic analysis of the control methodology used {{to carry out a}} pull up maneuver; bringing the glider from a descent trajectory to horizontal flight. A dynamic pole placement controller is implemented to carry out this maneuver. This controller is augmented with an L 1 adaptive controller to cancel out the matched uncertainties. Only the longitudinal dynamics are considered in this analysis. The fundamental differences between only the pole placement and the L 1 augmented pole placement with the L 1 adaptive controller are presented in terms of robust stability and robust performance. When the INS/GPS module is turned on, of the altitude error, flight path angle error and angle of attack error are bounded compared to the unfiltered values. The dynamic pole placement controller is shown to have robustness in the presence of time invariant, Gaussian and time varying errors in the aerodynamic coefficients. The augmentation set up improves the performance of the baseline controller in the presence of these uncertainties. With the help of Monte Carlo Simulations the performance, robustness and stability bounds of the baseline and the L 1 adaptive augmented controller are presented and are compared to the performance of the pole placement controller. All the simulations and implementations are carried out in CADAC++ which is written in C++. The system presented is a nonminimum phase system. The uncertainties presented in this paper are matched uncertainties. The main contribution of this paper lies in the application and determining robustness and performance of a piecewise constant L 1 augmentation setup to a Linear Time Varying (LTV) System...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} made of {{aerodynamic}} performance and static stability and control at hypersonic speeds. In a {{first part of the}} study, the effect of interference lift is investigated by tests of asymmetric models having conical fuselages and arrow plan-form wings. The fuselage of the asymmetric model is located entirely beneath the wing and has a semicircular cross section. The fuselage of the symmetric model was centrally located and has a circular cross section. Results are obtained for Mach numbers from 3 to 12 in part by application of the hypersonic similarity rule. These results show a maximum effect of interference on lift-drag ratio occurring at Mach number of 5, the Mach number at which the asymmetric model was designed to exploit favorable lift interference. At this Mach number, the asymmetric model is indicated to have a lift-drag ratio 11 percent higher than the symmetric model and 15 percent higher than the asymmetric model when inverted. These differences decrease to a few percent at a Mach number of 12. In the course of this part of the study, the accuracy to the hypersonic similarity rule applied to wing-body combinations is demonstrated with experimental results. These results indicate that the rule may prove useful for determining the aerodynamic characteristics of slender configurations at Mach numbers higher than those for which test equipment is really available. In a second part of the study, the aerodynamic performance and static stability and control characteristics of a <b>hypersonic</b> <b>glider</b> are investigated in somewhat greater detail. Results for Mach numbers from 3 to 18 for performance and 0. 6 to 12 for stability and control are obtained by standard text techniques, by application of the hypersonic stability rule, and/or by use of helium as a test medium. Lift-drag ratios of about 5 for Mach numbers up to 18 are shown to be obtainable. The glider studied is shown to have acceptable longitudinal and directional stability characteristics through the range of Mach numbers studied. Some roll instability (negative effective dihedral) is found at Mach numbers near 12...|$|E
