5|$|Reinhold Werner {{was born}} on 10 May 1825, {{in the town of}} Weferlingen, Prussia in what is now Saxony-Anhalt. He served for several years in the {{merchant}} marine in the 1830s and 1840s, during which he made several voyages to the East Indies. While in the merchant marine, he was given the nickname Schweizer (Swiss), as his North German shipmates found <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> to be particularly foreign compared to their native Plattdeutsch.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the side had debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to the perception that he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E

5|$|Trevor is {{depicted}} as a sociopath in Grand Theft Auto V. He is relentless and easily kills without remorse. However, he is honest about everything and rarely shows hypocrisy, which he often points out in others. He appears to be very insecure about {{having grown up in}} Canada, and takes offence to people mocking <b>his</b> <b>accent.</b> Despite his sociopathic actions, Trevor is very emotional; he seems to care about people very close to him, and he can be truly loyal to them. These people include his mother, Ashley Butler, Patricia Madrazo, Maude, Michael De Santa and his children Tracey and Jimmy, Lamar Davis, Ron, Lester, Wade and Franklin Clinton. Nevertheless, the other characters regard Trevor as dangerously unstable; during the prologue, Michael leads Trevor into a trap where he is supposed to be shot and killed, and later implores Franklin to plead insanity if he is ever arrested with Trevor. It is implied that the knowledge and extent of Trevor's crimes, the belief that Trevor's depravity escalated without anyone to keep him in check and his silence on the matter all weigh heavily on Michael's conscience.|$|E

6000|$|... "Scelerat!" [...] he cried. [...] "You have ruined me!" [...] Rage {{and grief}} were blent in <b>his</b> <b>accents.</b> He stood before me, livid of face and with hands {{clenching}} and unclenching at his sides.|$|R
6000|$|... "At once, monseigneur," [...] {{answered}} he, but I {{caught the}} faintest tinge of surprise in <b>his</b> <b>accents,</b> for never yet had it {{fallen to the}} lot of sturdy, clumsy Gilles to assist me at my toilet.|$|R
25|$|On the surface, {{he was an}} {{ambassador}} for the company and a world traveller often providing tips and worldly advice but deliberate problems with <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> (possibly meant to be Peruvian) made him too risque for normal media. His online videos often included famous guests including Snoop Dogg, David Hasselhoff, and Lindsay Lohan.|$|E
25|$|Through his {{association}} with Dracula (in which he appeared with minimal makeup, using his natural, heavily accented voice), Lugosi found himself typecast as a horror villain in movies such as Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Raven, and Son of Frankenstein for Universal, and the independent White Zombie. <b>His</b> <b>accent,</b> while {{a part of his}} image, limited the roles he could play.|$|E
25|$|McGahey was, however, elected National Vice-President of the NUM in 1972. He {{made similar}} {{progress}} in the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), being elected to its Executive in 1971. He remained a member until the CPGB dissolved in 1991 and then joined its successor in Scotland, the Communist Party of Scotland. He was reportedly the subject of phone tapping by the UK security service MI5 whose transcribers found him difficult to understand because of <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> {{and the effects of}} alcohol consumption.|$|E
60|$|The splendid Filippo of Santafior {{had risen}} to his feet, and was waving a white, bejewelled hand in an {{imperious}} demand for silence. When at last it came he spoke, his voice silvery and <b>his</b> <b>accents</b> mincing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurts!" [...] he cried, and {{the rapture}} in <b>his</b> <b>accents</b> should have warned her. [...] "Because you resist it, because you {{fight against the}} {{commands}} of your true self. Anne!" [...] He seized her, and crushed her to him. [...] "Anne!" ...|$|R
5|$|Barrowman learned an American accent {{after school}} {{children}} picked on <b>his</b> Scottish <b>accent</b> {{when he moved}} to the United States. <b>His</b> General American <b>accent</b> is often said to hint at, or is called, Mid-Atlantic.|$|R
25|$|Despite Leonard's {{reasonable}} {{nature and}} friendly personality, he occasionally demonstrates a mean streak. These include deliberately triggering Sheldon's obsessive compulsive problems, mocking Howard and Raj whenever they slip up, and making sniping comments when Penny's commitment issues flare up. In addition, {{he is often}} shown to be quite jealous, often feeling insecure and defensive whenever Penny interacts with another guy, and on one occasion trying to frighten off a British college student she was doing a project with, because Penny commented positively on <b>his</b> <b>accent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Capone {{is one of}} {{the most}} notorious American gangsters of the 20th century and has been the major subject of {{numerous}} articles, books, and films. His personality and character have been used in fiction as a model for crime lords and criminal masterminds ever since his death. The stereotypical image of a mobster wearing a blue pinstriped suit and tilted fedora is based on photos of Capone. <b>His</b> <b>accent,</b> mannerisms, facial construction, physical stature, and parodies of his name have been used for numerous gangsters in comics, movies, music, and literature.|$|E
25|$|After university, Dyke {{followed}} {{his first wife}} to Newcastle. He had become disillusioned with newspaper journalism, and tried for {{a job as a}} junior reporter at BBC Radio Teesside. He was unsuccessful, apparently because the interviewers felt no-one would understand <b>his</b> <b>accent.</b> Dyke instead found work covering rural affairs for the Newcastle Journal. He moved back to London with Christine in 1974 to become campaign officer for the Wandsworth Community Relations Council. He hated the job and left to campaign to be elected GLC councillor for Putney. Again he was unsuccessful.|$|E

It is much more similar to General American than most other accents in Britain.|$|R
25|$|Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey: an Istari wizard {{and mentor}} to Frodo. Sean Connery was {{approached}} for the role, {{but did not}} understand the plot, while Patrick Stewart turned it down as he disliked the script. Before being cast, McKellen had to sort his schedule with 20th Century Fox as there was a two-month overlap with X-Men. He enjoyed playing Gandalf the Grey more than his transformed state in the next two films, and based <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> on Tolkien. Unlike his on-screen character, McKellen did not spend much time with the actors playing the Hobbits; instead he worked with their scale doubles.|$|E
25|$|While {{performing}} as Dracula, Juliá also played Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew. The interaction with co-star Meryl Streep was tense at first, before developing into a friendship as the production advanced. Juliá then accepted {{a role in}} a film adaptation of The Tempest, spending several months in Italy while exploring its culture. While in the country, he received the script of Nine for which he received his fourth Tony Award nomination. In preparation {{for his role in}} Betrayal, Juliá moved to London temporarily, hiring a coach to adapt <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> to the English dialect. Juliá would later adopt an English accent for most of his future films.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, Welles {{directed}} In the Land of Don Quixote, {{a series}} of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network RAI. Similar to the Around the World with Orson Welles series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network {{was not interested in}} him providing Italian narration because of <b>his</b> <b>accent,</b> and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Dane had a {{supporting}} role in musical Western Montana Moon, starring Joan Crawford and Johnny Mack Brown. He followed with another supporting role (in which he had no dialogue) in the prison drama The Big House, starring Robert Montgomery, Wallace Beery and Chester Morris. Later that year, MGM terminated Dane's contract citing his Danish accent. In his final interview in September 1933, Dane claimed that MGM wanted to renew his contract but he declined as he had suffered a nervous breakdown. Dane {{admitted that he had}} found it difficult to transition from silent to sound films due to <b>his</b> <b>accent,</b> but also said that he was exhausted from years of constant filming and was grieving {{the death of his father}} who died in September 1930.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{upbringing}} in West Texas, <b>his</b> <b>accent,</b> his vacations on his Texas ranch, and {{his penchant}} for country metaphors contribute to his folksy, American cowboy image.

500|$|Critics were {{polarized}} over Andrew Lincoln's performance. Despite citing that <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> was [...] "dodgy", Pierce lauded Lincoln's acting. [...] "his {{body language}} and expression here is totally different {{now than when}} we saw him before," [...] he opined. [...] "He's a fast learner." [...] Gilbert referred to <b>his</b> <b>accent</b> as [...] "spotty", while Goldman professed that Lincoln fit into character very well; [...] "For much of the pilot, he's {{on his own and}} exudes a lot of believable, shocked emotion, as Rick tries to process what he is seeing. Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter felt that Lincoln's performance was one of the episode's drawbacks. He wrote: [...] "One drawback in [...] is that Lincoln plays his emotion a little too close to his deputy's badge. We're told– by him– that all he wants to do is find his wife and kid. His belief that they still are alive is the emotional drive of the story, but there's not enough deep pain that seeps up to coat the dialogue Lincoln delivers." ...|$|E
