500|$|Posted to RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, Jones was put {{in charge}} of the Motor Transport Repair Section and made acting (later permanent) Officer Commanding Workshops. He was highly {{regarded}} for his technical and administrative ability but rated only [...] "average" [...] in command and dealing with personnel. In 1926 he took up flight instruction and within a year had been graded a 1A Flying Instructor. He was promoted to squadron leader on 31 March 1927 and given command of Flying Squadron at No. 1 Flying Training School (No. 1 FTS). Jones spent two years in Britain from 1928, attending the Royal Air Force Staff College, Andover, and graduating top of his class at the RAF's Central Flying School. He later recalled of this posting, [...] "The social life was new to me, as was the etiquette... I learned as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> but I have no doubt that I unwittingly committed many a social blunder." [...] As the RAAF's senior officer in the UK, Jones had expected to be invited to accompany the airship R101 on its maiden flight to India. Instead another Australian officer was nominated to make the trip, and Jones avoided the disaster which followed.|$|E
2500|$|Widman {{described}} the run {{after the game}} as follows:"The play was a revolving wedge on Chicago's left tackle. [...] Their end and tackle had been drawn in by our men, and when the ball {{was given to me}} on a delayed pass I had a clear field, except for Chicago's backs. [...] I ran as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> diagonally across the field, realizing that I was hotly pursued. [...] At last I was tackled on what I afterwards learned was about the six-yard line. [...] I was slightly dazed by the fall, but saw a goal post ahead of me and managed to crawl over the line. [...] I did not know I had made a touchdown, however, until Captain Bennett told me." ...|$|E
2500|$|George {{did some}} work {{on what would}} {{eventually}} become Down on the Farm but then [...] declared that Little Feat had disbanded. In an interview with Bill Flanagan (for the book Written in My Soul) conducted eleven days before his death, George {{made it clear that}} he felt the demise of Little Feat was due to his having allowed the band to be run democratically, with the result that Payne and, to a lesser extent, Barrere, had a presence as songwriters and in production which was disproportionate to their abilities. George was particularly scathing about Payne's attempts at jazz/fusion, citing an instance when Payne jammed with Weather Report on a TV show and dropped [...] "into one of his 'Day at the Dog Races'. I just got out of there as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> It was embarrassing". In the same interview, George stated that he planned to reunite Little Feat without Payne and Barrère.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> {{ran away}} <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> with so endearing a compliment--and tossed it back again over my shoulder: [...] "You don't mean, Susan, {{that you are}} not clever?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He rowed {{down the}} river just <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> don't know how far he went, for the bend hid him from view," [...] {{answered}} our hero. [...] "Say, Nat, {{do you think you}} know that man?" ...|$|R
5000|$|During the series, Burton's {{character}} was Chief Engineering Officer, and thus was often portrayed repairing machines or discovering new scientific phenomena. Burton commented {{how hard it}} sometimes was to straight-facedly deliver the Treknobabble used by La Forge in these scenes: [...] "Technobabble brings with it its own challenge... I’m not an engineer, I just played one on TV. The methodology that I found most successful was to really spit it out <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>could.</b> Giving the illusion that I knew what I was talking about when, in fact, I really didn’t." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor dad," [...] she murmured, [...] "of {{course he}} didn't! I know I'd {{have gone to}} the devil as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> if I'd been treated like it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So I did,' {{said the}} Leopard. I went into other spots as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> I {{went into this}} spot with you, {{and a lot of}} good it has done me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I've been {{hurrying to}} you as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> for weeks," [...] {{answered}} Chet, with a glad look in his eyes. [...] "I heard you were at our cabin, and was going there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Falling {{upon our}} knees with tearful gratitude, {{we got up}} again and ran--ran <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> we <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> suspect; for now the whole fore-part of the ship bulged through the water {{directly}} above our heads, and might lose its balance any moment. If we had only brought along our umbrellas! ...|$|R
60|$|My heart {{jumped up}} amongst my lungs. I never waited for to look further, but uncocked my gun and went sneaking {{back on my}} tiptoes <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened, but my breath come so hard I couldn't hear nothing else. I slunk along another piece further, then listened again; and so on, and so on. If I see a stump, I took it for a man; if I trod on a stick and broke it, {{it made me feel}} like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half, and the short half, too.|$|R
60|$|Well, to {{get back}} to my narrative; we kept on {{dropping}} slowly toward the surface the while we bucked the west wind, clawing away from thirty <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> we <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> was on the bridge, and as we dropped from the brilliant sunlight into the dense vapor of clouds and on down through them to the wild, dark storm strata beneath, it seemed that my spirits dropped with the falling ship, and the buoyancy of hope ran low in sympathy.|$|R
6000|$|... "A week later, I {{escaped from}} the guardhouse {{and got out of}} the country as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Twice I have been back, seeking for that fateful spot in the hills, but unable to find it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, my lady," [...] said he, ere {{she could}} speak, [...] "I heard that this good fellow was here, {{and came home}} as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> {{to see that he}} told you as few lies as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There isn't much to tell. I got the money, an' walked as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to a {{place on}} the mountain, where I laid down to rest, an' fell asleep. When I woke up the package was gone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At that moment, I either {{heard or}} fancied I {{heard a loud}} noise of pursuit, a hue and cry behind me. Zeal for your safety had made me preternaturally nervous. I looked about me hurriedly, thrust the negatives I'd {{recovered}} into my breast-pocket <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> flung the apparatus away from me with the sixth plate jammed hard in the groove, and made off {{at the top of}} my speed for the wall behind me. For there, at that critical point, it occurred to me suddenly that the sixth and last flash of the machine had come and gone just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> stood poising myself on the ledge of the window-sill; and I thought to myself--rightly as it turned out--this additional evidence would only strengthen the belief in the public mind that Mr. Callingham had been murdered by the man whom the servants saw escaping from the window.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had just}} {{realized}} how light {{it was and}} had started for home, hurrying with all my might, when I heard a little noise {{at the top of}} the hill where Prickly Porky the Porcupine lives. Of course I thought it was Prickly himself starting out for his breakfast, and I looked up with my mouth open to say hello. But I didn't say hello. No, Sir, I didn't say a word. I was too scared. There, just starting down the hill straight towards me, was the most dreadful creature that ever has been seen in the Green Forest! It didn't have any legs, and it didn't have any head, and it didn't have any tail, and it was coming straight after me so fast that I had all <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do to get out of the way!" [...] Peter's eyes grew very round and wide as he said this. [...] "I took one good look, and then I jumped. My gracious, how I did jump!" [...] he continued. [...] "Then I started for home just <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make my legs go, and here I am, and mighty glad to be here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{really never}} could any be more {{dexterous}} in rowing than my faithful servant, making the boat go <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> again <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> [...] "Well now, Friday", said I, [...] "shall we {{now go to}} your so much admired nation." [...] But instead of meeting with that cheerfulness I expected, he looked very dull and melancholy at my saying so; which indeed at first surprised me, till he made me sensible, that his concern was about the boat's being too small to go so far a voyage. Upon which I let him understand I had a much bigger; and accordingly, the next day went {{to the place where}} the first boat lay, which I had made, when all the strength I had or art <b>I</b> <b>could</b> use failed me in my attempt to get it into the water: but now it having lain in the sun two and twenty years, and no care being taken of it all that while, it became in a manner rotten. My man told me, that such a boat would do very well for the purpose, sufficient to carry enough vittle, drink, bread, for that was his manner of talking. In short, my mind being strongly fixed upon my design of going over with him to the Continent, I very plainly told him that we would both go and make a boat full as big, and more proportionable than that, wherein he might safely return to his own nation.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only got}} your {{telegram}} {{toward the end}} of the afternoon. I had been away all day. I came here as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hit it up directly I read it. We had a blow-out, and that delayed us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw you coming," [...] she said, {{a little}} shyly, [...] "and I {{was afraid that}} you would not stop, so I ran out as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> It was silly of me! You were coming in, weren't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|But I gave little heed to that. My {{principal}} {{thought at}} that moment was my personal safety; so I ran on as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{in the direction of}} our encampment, for which point, I had no doubt, my companions would also make.|$|E
60|$|Heathcliff {{had gone}} to loose the beast, and shift it to his own stall; he was passing behind it, when Hindley {{finished}} his speech by knocking him under its feet, and without stopping to examine whether his hopes were fulfilled, ran away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> was surprised to witness how coolly the child gathered himself up, and went on with his intention; exchanging saddles and all, and then sitting down on a bundle of hay to overcome the qualm which the violent blow occasioned, before he entered the house. I persuaded him easily to let me lay the blame of his bruises on the horse: he minded little what tale was told since he had what he wanted. He complained so seldom, indeed, of such stirs <b>as</b> these, that <b>I</b> really thought him not vindictive: I was deceived completely, as you will hear.|$|R
6000|$|I {{got here}} all alive {{yesterday}} at four. <b>I</b> came on <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> travel, and hardly got a mouthful to eat after I left [...] Limerick. I never saw such beastliness {{as they have}} at the stations. [...] My uncle is much better,--so much so that I shan't remain here very [...] long. I can't tell you any particular news,--except this, that [...] that old cat down at Castle Quin,--the one with the crisp-curled [...] wig,--must have the nose of a dog and the ears of a cat and the eyes [...] of a bird, and she sends word to Scroope of everything that she [...] smells and hears and sees. It makes not the slightest difference to [...] me,--nor to you I should think. Only I hate such interference. The [...] truth is old maids have nothing else to do. If I were you I wouldn't [...] be an old maid.|$|R
5000|$|Joseph {{described}} {{the scenes of}} chaos in the Battle of Nauvoo, [...] "The poor Saints had to flee, sick or well. They hastened to the river but the citizens judged it not best to let men leave when they were so much needed, but the sick, {{the women and children}} got over <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> they <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> went down to the bank of the river and found many of the Saints in distress. Some had left their goods and were destitute of food and clothing. Others had left their husbands in the battle. The cannons roared tremendously on both sides for several days." [...] At Winter Quarters in 1847, Joseph and Hannah had a child Hyrum Thomas, but he died the same year. In due course, Joseph Fielding and his family made the trek to the Salt Lake Valley. There, two further children were born: Hannah Alice in 1849, and Sarah Ann in 1851.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can walk}} {{as well as}} you can," [...] I repeated. And I tried my best to walk a few steps: but the ground slipped away backwards, quite as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> walk, so that I made no {{progress}} at all. Sylvie laughed again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{so scared}} that when the first orange hit me, I {{thought it was a}} bullet, and scrabbled into the cradle as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> It was real mean to frighten the little ones so," [...] laughed Prue, as Tilly gave a growl.|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, old man," [...] said Trixton Brent, [...] "I'm not a {{real estate}} dealer or an architect, but if I were in your place I'd take that {{carriage}} and hustle over to Jerry Shorter's as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and sign the lease." ...|$|E
6000|$|His letter {{never came}} when {{it ought to}} have come and what she went through morning after morning when the postman brought none for her the very postman himself compassionated when she ran down to the door, and yet we cannot wonder at its being {{calculated}} to blunt the feelings {{to have all the}} trouble of other people's letters and none of the pleasure and doing it oftener in the mud and mizzle than not and at a rate of wages more resembling Little Britain than Great. But at last one morning when she was too poorly to come running down-stairs he says to me with a pleased look in his face that made me next to love the man in his uniform coat though he was dripping wet [...] "I have taken you first in the street this morning Mrs. Lirriper, for here's the one for Mrs. Edson." [...] I went up to her bedroom with it <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> go, and she sat up in bed when she saw it and kissed it and tore it open and then a blank stare came upon her. [...] "It's very short!" [...] she says lifting her large eyes to my face. [...] "O Mrs. Lirriper it's very short!" [...] I says [...] "My dear Mrs. Edson no doubt that's because your husband hadn't time to write more just at that time." [...] "No doubt, no doubt," [...] says she, and puts her two hands on her face and turns round in her bed.|$|R
40|$|A {{partner of}} mine {{said he might}} come over to my pad with some broads, so I hurried over to the liquor store {{right around the corner}} to get a case of beer. As I was walking across {{the parking lot of the}} store, this guy almost ran me over. I flipped him off. The driver and his {{partners}} jumped out of the car and rat-packed me. They knocked me down, and the driver pushed my head into the dirt next to the cigarette butts. Then they went into the store. I just felt, “What a low fucking thing to do to somebody. They are just a bunch of yellow motherfuckers. ” In my mind I suddenly thought, “I’ve got to get back at these dirty motherfuckers, ” and I ran back to my pad for my rifle. I got back to the liquor store <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>could</b> and waited for them about twenty yards from the front door of the store. Finally his two partners popped out the door. I said to myself, “Fuck it, I’ll shoot all of them. ” I fired two quick, wild shots but missed them both, and they got away. I decided then that I better put the barrel to the chest of the motherfucker who I really wanted—the driver—and make sure that I didn’t miss him. I had stone hatred for him, and I righteously couldn’t wait to see the look on his face when I blew him away. As soon as he popped out of the liquor store door, I charged right up to him, rammed the barrel in his chest, and pulled the trigger. (Athens, 1997 p. 10) ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 1846, Joseph, {{his sisters}} Mary and Mercy, and their {{families}} were finally obliged to leave Nauvoo. Members of the Church had been leaving since February. Joseph sold his land for $4.50, some horses, a wagon, and some cloth. The group only just crossed the Mississippi River with its nine wagons, 21 cattle and 43 sheep, before Joseph’s land {{was taken over by}} the Nauvoo attackers, from where they fired into the city. Joseph described the scenes of chaos in the Battle of Nauvoo, [...] "The poor Saints had to flee, sick or well. They hastened to the river but the citizens judged it not best to let men leave when they were so much needed, but the sick, the women and children got over <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> they <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> went down to the bank of the river and found many of the Saints in distress. Some had left their goods and were destitute of food and clothing. Others had left their husbands in the battle. The cannons roared tremendously on both sides for several days." [...] He supported his sisters, their children and stepchildren, traveling with them to Winter Quarters, Nebraska and, in 1848, to Utah.|$|R
6000|$|... "For goodness' sake, Dick!" [...] he said, {{shaking off}} his mantle, [...] "unhook {{the back of}} my dress, and let me get rid of the thing. I used to laugh at my sisters for not running as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could.</b> Now I wonder how on earth they manage to run at all." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{walked on}} with me talking as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get the words out. I showed father a giant, bushy {{chestnut}} which was dominating {{all the trees}} around it, and told him how it retarded their growth. On the other hand, the other trees were absorbing nutrition from the ground that would have benefited the chestnut.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, this {{conversation}} {{gave me a}} clue, and without troubling more about the footprints I went on as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> to the Ring, half {{a mile or so}} away. Presently I reached it, and there--yes, there--standing by the cromlech, bareheaded, and clothed in his night-things only, stood Mr. Holly in the snow, the strangest figure, I think, that ever I beheld.|$|E
5000|$|Virginia and James Watson, were anthropologists in the Central Highlands of Papua New Guinea {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s. A local woman, Anyan, became Virginia Watson's interpreter. Anyan {{had been chosen}} by her family [...] "to go live in the {{government}} station of Kainantu {{in order to learn}} Tok Pisin and thus be able to act as a translator for her relatives and other villagers". Subsequently, Virginia Watson asked permission from Anyan to write her story, using her field notes, {{in the form of a}} book: One time when the kiap came to get us we all ran away from the village <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> we <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> was still a young girl then. <b>I</b> ran <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> and <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> and then <b>I</b> hid among some reeds in low ground. But my feet were not completely hidden and a policeman came by and saw them. He grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out to see if I was a girl or boy. When he saw I was a girl he took me to the house where they were keeping all of the people they caught. If I had been a boy I would have been shot. That time when the kiap came after us ten men and two boys were shot. This was one time in my life when I was most frightened. (pp.51-52) Later [...] "Anyan decided the benefits of the colonial administration outweighed many of her earlier fears." [...] She married and lived in Kainantu, close to medical and educational facilities.|$|R
6000|$|General Smith {{said this}} order was nonsense. But I {{told him it}} was better to obey it. The General replied, [...] "of course I must obey," [...] and said his men were embarking <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> they <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> went on up to Nashville and {{inspected}} the position taken by Nelson's troops. I did not see Buell during the day, and wrote him a note saying that I had been in Nashville since early morning and had hoped to meet him. On my return to the boat we met. His troops were still east of the river, and the steamers that had carried Nelson's division up were mostly at Clarksville to bring Smith's division. I said to General Buell my information was that the enemy was retreating <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> possible. General Buell said there was fighting going on then only ten or twelve miles away. I said: [...] "Quite probably; Nashville contained valuable stores of arms, ammunition and provisions, and the enemy is probably trying to carry away all he can. The fighting is doubtless with the rear-guard who are trying to protect the trains they are getting away with." [...] Buell spoke very positively of the danger Nashville was in of an attack from the enemy. I said, in the absence of positive information, I believed my information was correct. He responded that he [...] "knew." [...] "Well," [...] I said, [...] "I do not know; but <b>as</b> <b>I</b> came by Clarksville General Smith's troops were embarking to join you." ...|$|R
60|$|Nothing angered and mortified {{me so much}} as the queen’s dwarf; who {{being of}} the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily think he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing a {{creature}} so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger and look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness; against which <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usually in the mouths of court pages. One day, at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with something I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her majesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away <b>as</b> <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he <b>could.</b> <b>I</b> fell over head and ears, and, if I had not been a good swimmer, it might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be {{at the other end of}} the room, and the queen was in such a fright, that she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed: however, I received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipt, and as a farther punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown me: neither was he ever restored to favour; for soon after the queen bestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my very great satisfaction; for <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not tell to what extremities such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.|$|R
