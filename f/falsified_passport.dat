500|$|The {{week that}} Hauck {{was sentenced to}} prison, Cox was living in Nashville, Tennessee under the name Joseph Carter. He was dating a single mother, Amanda Gardner, who was unaware of his {{criminal}} past, and posing {{as the owner of}} a home restoration business. He told her he was from a wealthy family, and his silver 2005 Infiniti and [...] "fashionably decorated bungalow" [...] seemed to confirm this. Cox used a <b>falsified</b> <b>passport</b> to travel to Europe on a cruise of the Greek Isles with Gardner. He did not spend much time in Italy or Greece due to his intense fear of Interpol. He was reported by Gardner's 60-year-old babysitter, Patsy Taylor. She became suspicious of Cox, so she researched him online, where she discovered his true identity. Taylor was put in contact with the attorney of Rebecca Hauck by a St. Petersburg Times reporter. Hauck's family paid Taylor for Cox's address, as this information could be used to reduce Hauck's sentence. He temporarily escaped capture due to a chance series of events. Cox and Gardner's home was burglarized, and they checked into a hotel. On November 16, 2006, Cox was arrested by a half dozen Secret Service agents—who had been pursuing him for more than two years—when he and Gardner returned from the hotel. He had been building Williamson a house using his fake identity and credit history, but, fortunately for his friend, he was arrested before Williamson could give him a down payment. Hauck's sentence was later reduced from 70 to 42 months {{as a result of her}} assistance in Cox's capture.|$|E
