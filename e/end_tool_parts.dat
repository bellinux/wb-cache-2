40|$|The method {{involves}} {{using the}} <b>tool</b> <b>end</b> <b>part</b> directly as a measurement medium for an electrical voltage, current, capacitance or frequency measurement. A calibration curve is generated which reproduces {{the relationship between}} electrical measurement parameter and {{the distance between the}} <b>tool</b> <b>end</b> <b>part</b> and the object surface or object (T). The conducting surface(s) is or are electrically charged and the voltage between the conducting regions of the <b>tool</b> <b>end</b> <b>part</b> and object or object surface measured (4).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the distribution of visual attention along a handheld tool depending on functional tool practice and its position in peripersonal or extrapersonal space. We created a tool with two functional parts placed at the <b>tool’s</b> middle and <b>end.</b> Participants held the tool over a display such that functional parts were aligned with stimuli for a 50 / 50, go/no-go, target detection task. In Experiment 1, two groups with no prior tool experience performed the task either in peripersonal (near the body; tool held horizontally) or extrapersonal space (beyond arms’ reach; tool held straight). Faster response times (RTs) were found for targets at the <b>tool’s</b> <b>end</b> and for the peripersonal space group. In Experiment 2, participants used the <b>tool’s</b> middle <b>part</b> in a hockey-like game prior to the task to assess functional practice effects. Again, faster RTs were found for targets at the <b>tool’s</b> <b>end</b> and in peripersonal space. However, a <b>tool</b> <b>part</b> × space interaction suggested that mid-tool practice reduced performance differences between <b>tool</b> <b>parts</b> but only in peripersonal space. Experiment 3 confirmed the interaction effect when mid-tool practice was constrained to only extrapersonal space. Results suggest that visual attention is naturally drawn to the <b>tool’s</b> <b>end</b> but that functional tool use can redistribute attention when positioned in peripersonal space. In extrapersonal space, no change was found suggesting that the extension of peripersonal space is not uniform in regards to visual attention and that the visual attention component is perhaps dissociable from the remapping of spatial representation by tools...|$|R

40|$|A {{regional}} optimization of automatically generated machining toolpath {{for computer}} based freeform mechanical models is {{considered in the}} framework of multi-axis (three to five) machining operations. Consider a trichotomy of an arbitrary freeform shaped surface into convex, concave and saddle-like regions. Saddle-like and concave regions can be milled using a ball <b>end</b> <b>tool,</b> in a 3 - or a 5 -axis mode. A subset of the convex regions can be machined faster and with a smaller scallop, using a flat <b>end</b> <b>tool</b> that is aligned with the normal of the surface, in 5 -axis mode. A method to robustly detect and eliminate local gouging of the milling tool into the object is developed and demonstrated on an actual part. 1 Introduction The automatic generation of machining toolpath for computer based mechanical models is a challenging problem. The generation of an optimized machining toolpath is even more strenuous. Consider the evolution of the computer graphics field. Synthetically This work was supp [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Our project {{involves}} investigations on {{the failure}} of an 8000 ton heavy duty press. This press is used for forming boiler drums by U-shell pressing operation. The failure of the press had occurred due to formation of several cracks in the upper <b>tool</b> <b>part</b> of the press. Initially the detailed three dimensional model of the upper tool is developed using the popular solid modeling package, Pro/E. Later meshing of the model is done in Hypermesh {{and analysis of the}} meshed model is carried out using the analysis package Ansys 8. 0. The upper tool of the press has been analysed using After getting the stresses and strain values in the upper tool body from the analysis, the expected low cycle fatigue life of the press is predicted using the Coffin-Manson’s relations. These investigations have clearly brought out the cause of {{the failure of}} the press. The upper <b>tool</b> <b>part</b> of the press has a finite life design as regards cold correction operations, and, low cycle fatigue is the life consuming mechanism responsible for its failure. Further recommendations are made for extension of life of upper <b>tool</b> <b>part</b> of press by way of stiffening. The scope of the work is further enhanced by finding the real stress distribution and strains existing in the upper tool by Neuber’s approximation method. Thereafter the reliability of the method is discussed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Using {{algorithms}} {{from computer}} graphics, namely hidden line and surface removal, techniques {{have been constructed}} to derive the 3 -axis visible or millable set of a computer model from a given orientation or simulate and verify machining toolpaths. In this paper, an approach that reduces the accessibility problem of 5 -axis milling using a flat <b>end</b> <b>tool</b> into a 3 -axis accessibility problem is discussed. Using this approach, global detection of possible gouging into other parts, while a 5 -axis flat end mill is in use, is made feasible and collisions can be avoided. Key Words: NURBs, accessibility, 5 -axis machining. 1 Introduction Several methods are in use, when freeform computer models are realized using milling machines. Possibly the most common approach utilizes a ball <b>end</b> <b>tool</b> with three degrees of freedom, namely translation in x, y, and z [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7].
