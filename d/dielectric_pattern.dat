50|$|A frequency-selective surface (FSS) is any thin, {{repetitive}} surface (such as {{the screen}} on a microwave oven) designed to reflect, transmit or absorb electromagnetic fields {{based on the}} frequency of the field. In this sense, an FSS is a type of optical filter or metal-mesh optical filters in which the filtering is accomplished by virtue of the regular, periodic (usually metallic, but sometimes <b>dielectric)</b> <b>pattern</b> {{on the surface of the}} FSS. Though not explicitly mentioned in the name, FSS's also have properties which vary with incidence angle and polarization as well - these are unavoidable consequences of the way in which FSS's are constructed. Frequency-selective surfaces have been most commonly used in the radio frequency region of the electromagnetic spectrum and find use in applications as diverse as the aforementioned microwave oven, antenna radomes and modern metamaterials. Sometimes frequency selective surfaces are referred to simply as periodic surfaces and are a 2-dimensional analog of the new periodic volumes known as photonic crystals.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} enable higher {{conversion}} efficiencies, commercially-produced p type solar cell devices {{of the future}} will require the minimisation of front surface (emitter) recombination after other significant loss components (i. e., rear surface and bulk recombination) have been minimised. A suggested path towards enabling higher commercially-produced cell efficiencies is through the implementation of a selective-emitter structure (i. e., separated light and heavy doping on the front surface) on Passivated Emitter and Rear Cells (PERC cells). To this end, this thesis explores the potential of novel <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning,</b> selective-emitter formation and metal plating schemes with a view to their application in the fabrication of commercial selective-emitter devices. In particular, the research focussed on aerosol-jet etching (AJE) <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> as a way in which the recombination typically associated with laser structuring could be avoided, while maintaining comparable <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> resolution. The research resulted in the development of: (i) the AJE process for laser-damage-free patterning of SiO 2 and SiNx ARCs on 156 mm solar cells with demonstrated ~ 20 um opening widths; (ii) ultrasonic spray coating of polyacrylic acid (PAA) to replace spin coating and enable high-throughput, large area AJE processing; (iii) selective-emitter formation for AJE devices with one diffusion step {{through the use of a}} diffusion barrier oxide; (iv) the development of adhesion-promoting nickel galvanic displacement (NiGD) seed layers of thickness < 20 nm which significantly improve the adhesion of light-induced plating (LIP) nickel and copper contacts on chemically-etched silicon; and (v) the fabrication of selective-emitter solar cells created through the use of AJE, a diffusion barrier oxide and nickel/copper plating. Although the implementation of AJE processing for high-throughput <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> will require significant advancements in aerosol-jet printer (AJP) multi-nozzle technology before processing throughput rates can reach the same order of magnitude as current PV production levels, the adhesion-promoting NiGD seed layers may find immediate application in improving the adhesion of plated laser-structured contacts for improved solderability and module reliability. The latter will require that the higher than desirable contact resistance of NiGD-treated metal contacts, identified through this research to be due to the formation of an oxide-rich interlayer, be effectively reduced...|$|R

40|$|The highest energy {{conversion}} efficiency recorded for a single junction silicon solar cell is 25. 0 % which is almost 8 % higher than efficiencies typically achieved for current commercially-produced silicon wafer-based solar cells. One of the key requirements for producing high efficiency solar cells is fine-scale <b>patterning</b> of <b>dielectric</b> layers. Although laboratory-fabricated cells have typically used photolithography to achieve patterning dimensions less than 10 um, these approaches are too expensive to implement commercially. Consequently, new cost-effective <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> methods are required if cell efficiencies that approach those achieved in laboratories are to be commercially realised. This thesis describes a new <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> method, called direct etching, which {{has the potential to}} achieve fine-scale patterning of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride layers at low cost. The method uses a fluid deposition device, such as an inkjet printer or aerosol jet printer, to deposit a source of fluoride ions onto an acidic, water-soluble polymer layer. The hydrofluoric acid etchant is only produced locally where etching is required making the method much safer than existing patterning techniques which use immersion etching. The inkjet implementation of the direct etching method can be used to etch hole openings of diameter 35 - 50 um and grooves of width 30 - 50 um. Initial solar cells were fabricated to demonstrate the ability of the method to reliably etch grid patterns for front metal contacts. The etched grid patterns were successfully metallised using both electroless metal plating and a new light-induced metal plating technique. Furthermore, initial results using an aerosol jet printer suggest that grooves as narrow as 10 um may be etched using this new technique at current commercial wafer processing throughput rates. A final important attribute of this new method is its low-environmental footprint. In addition to consuming small amounts of readily available chemicals, the method produces small amounts of easily-managed waste. If the expected improvements in patterning resolution can be achieved, then this new <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> technology has the potential to reduce the large gap that currently exists between the efficiencies of laboratory- and commercially-produced silicon solar cells...|$|R

PL studies of InGaN QDs and the QWs show that GaN spacer regrowth as well as annealing conditions can greatly improve the luminescence from QD samples. The availability of highly uniform and ultra-high density InGaN QDs formed by this approach potentially has significant impacts on developing high-efficiency LEDs for solid-state lighting, low threshold current density-visible diode lasers, and intermediate-band nitride-based solar cells.|$|R

40|$|One way of {{reducing}} the cost of crystalline silicon solar cell fabrication is by increasing the conversion efficiency of the device. However, most high efficiency solar cell designs require more complex fabrication methods that also increase the fabrication cost. Photolithography {{is an example of}} such an indispensable but costly process. The most common use for photolithography in solar cell fabrication is for <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning.</b> In this thesis, inkjet printing is proposed as an alternative method for <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterning</b> in solar cell fabrication. There are two inkjet printing methods developed in this thesis. The indirect inkjet patterning method involves the deposition of a suitable plasticiser droplet onto an intermediate resin coating layer on top of the dielectric surface. Diethylene glycol and novolac resin are used as the plasticiser and coating layer respectively. The plasticiser changes the permeability of the affected region of the resin such that it becomes permeable to liquid dielectric etchants. When the resin layer is removed, the printed pattern is transferred to the dielectric layer. The optimised process produces round openings with diameters as small as 30 - 35 &# 956;m and continuous line patterns with width as narrow as 40 - 50 &# 956;m. The direct inkjet patterning method involves the deposition of liquid phosphorus dopant sources onto both silicon and dielectric surfaces. Two types of phosphorus sources are used: phosphoric acid and specially-formulated dopant sources. Narrow lines as wide as 15 - 20 &# 956;m are produced after appropriate surface treatments on both silicon and dielectric surfaces. Using this method, a process that simultaneously <b>pattern</b> the <b>dielectric</b> layer and diffuse the silicon underneath is developed. Various high efficiency solar cell structures such as selective emitter, localised contacts, surface texturing and edge isolation are demonstrated using the indirect inkjet patterning method. Both inkjet patterning methods are then used in the fabrication of a selective emitter solar cell. Fill factors in the range of 0. 79 - 0. 80 are shown to be achievable with both patterning methods, thus indicating the high quality metal-silicon contacts formed by these inkjet techniques...|$|R

It was found that organosilicon films from identical precursors differ in structure according to the method of deposition. For films produced from the cyclic siloxane precursor, hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane, pulsed plasma excitation reduced crosslink density over continuous excitation and produced flexible films resistant to prolonged saline soak testing. Deposition via a thermal process, HFCVD, allowed films of novel organosilicon structure to be formed from both hexamethylcyclotrisiloxane and its eight-membered analog, octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane.

40|$|Interfaces remain one of {{the major}} issues in {{limiting}} the understanding and designing polymer nanocomposites due to their complexity and pivotal role in determining the ultimate composites properties. In this study, we take multi-walled carbon nanotubes/silicone rubber nanocomposites as a representative example, and have for the first time studied the correlation between high-frequency dielectric dispersion and static/dynamic interfacial characteristics. We have found that the interface together with other meso-structural parameters (volume fraction, dispersion, agglomeration) play decisive role in formulating the <b>dielectric</b> <b>patterns.</b> The calculation of the relaxation times affords the relative importance of interfacial polarization to dipolar polarization in resultant dielectric relaxation. Dielectric measurements coupled with cyclic loading further reveals the remarkable capability of dielectric frequency dispersion in capturing the evolution of interfacial properties, such as a particular interface reconstruction process occurred to the surfactant-modified samples. All these results demonstrate that high-frequency dielectric spectroscopy is instrumental to probing both static and dynamic meso-structural characteristics, especially effective for the composites with relative weak interfaces which remains a mission impossible for many other techniques. The insights provided here based on the analyses of dielectric frequency dispersion will pave the way for optimized design and precise engineering of meso-structure in polymer nanocomposites.
