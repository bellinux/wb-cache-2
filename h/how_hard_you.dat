500|$|With some hesitation, {{both men}} {{agree to the}} match, {{creating}} a media buzz that stabs at Rocky's has-been status and Dixon's credibility. Robert later makes an effort to discourage Rocky from fighting, blaming his own personal failings on his father's celebrity shadow, but Rocky rebukes him with some profound advice; that to succeed in life, [...] "it ain't about <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> hit; it's about <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> can get hit, and keep moving forward", and that blaming others won't help him. The next day, father and son meet over Adrian's grave and reconcile; Robert has quit his job to be at Rocky's side. Rocky sets straight to training with Apollo Creed's old trainer, Duke, who quickly surmises that the slow and arthritic Rocky can only compete by building his strength and punching power as much as possible.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film two stars out of four, writing: [...] "I give the movie a {{negative}} review, and yet I don't think it's a bad movie; it's more misguided, made with great creativity, but denying {{us what we}} more or less deserve from a Batman story. No matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> try, superheroes and film noir don't go together; {{the very essence of}} noir is that there are no more heroes." [...] He compared the Penguin negatively with the Joker of the first film, writing that [...] "the Penguin is a curiously meager and depressing creature; I pitied him, but did not fear him or find him funny. The genius of Danny DeVito is all but swallowed up in the paraphernalia of the role." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum called DeVito [...] "a pale substitute for Jack Nicholson from the first film" [...] and felt that [...] "there's no suspense in Batman Returns whatsoever". Batman comic book writer/artist Matt Wagner was quoted as saying: [...] "I hated how Batman Returns made Batman little more than just another costumed creep, little better than the villains he's pursuing. Additionally, Burton is so blatantly not an action director. That aspect of both his films just sucked." [...] Ty Burr in Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B-; he wrote that [...] "Burton still hasn't figured out how to tell a coherent story: He's more interested in fashioning pretty beads than in putting them on a string.... Yet for all the wintry weirdness, there's more going on under the surface of this movie than in the original. No wonder some people felt burned by Batman Returns: Tim Burton just may have created the first blockbuster art film." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mike Langberg of Knight Ridder {{was less}} positive, writing {{in his review}} that [...] "At first glance, the CD-ROM {{provides}} a lot of raw material. There are 350 brief animations, running two or three seconds each, showing 17 characters from the show in numerous poses. The CD-ROM delivery, unfortunately, falls flat." [...] He explained that [...] "Simpsons Cartoon Studio is awkward to operate and limited in what it can accomplish, producing animated sequences that are jerky and out of sync. The CD-ROM comes with 15 cartoons created by the developers, running from 10 seconds to 55 seconds. None flow smoothly or tell funny stories. There's no reason to expect {{the rest of us}} will do any better." [...] Similarly, Nancy Malitz of The Detroit News wrote that [...] "you move the characters around and invent the scenarios, but in the end you might feel your creativity wasn't heavily challenged. The whole deal is essentially a cut-and-paste operation. You can't create characters of your own, and the kind of automatic synchronization of sounds with movement that you see in a simple product like Video Jam isn't available, so things look sort of choppy no matter <b>how</b> <b>hard</b> <b>you</b> try." ...|$|E

40|$|Robots can pose-or {{can appear}} to pose-a threat to life, property, and privacy. May a {{landowner}} legally shoot down a trespassing drone? Can she hold a trespassing autonomous car as security against damage done or further torts? Is {{the fear that}} a drone may be operated by a paparazzo or Peeping Tom sufficient grounds to disable or interfere with it? <b>How</b> <b>hard</b> may <b>you</b> shove if the office robot rolls over your foot? This Article addresses all those issues and one more. what rules and standards we could put into place to make the resolution of those questions easier and fairer to all concerned The default common-law legal rules governing each of these perceived threats are somewhat different, although reasonableness always {{plays an important role}} in defining legal rights and options. In certain cases-drone overflights, autonomous cars-national,s tate, and even local regulations may trump the common law. Because it is in most cases obvious that humans can use force to protect themselves against actual physical attack, this Article concentrates on the more interesting cases of (1) robot (and especially drone) trespass and (2) responses to perceived threats other than physical attack by robots-notably the risk that the robot (or drone) may be spying-perceptions which may not always be justified, but which sometimes may nonetheless be considered reasonable in law...|$|R

It is to one of the persons who then obeyed me that I now address myself to deliver you from your burden. They were men of many different nations and dexterities, all bound together by a formidable oath, and working to the same purposes; the trade of the association was in murder; and I who speak to you, innocent as I appear, was the chieftain of this redoubtable crew." ...|$|R
