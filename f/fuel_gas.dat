25|$|The torch is {{the tool}} that the welder holds and manipulates {{to make the}} weld. It has a {{connection}} and valve for the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> and a connection and valve for the oxygen, a handle for the welder to grasp, and a mixing chamber (set at an angle) where the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> and oxygen mix, with a tip where the flame forms. Two basic types of torches are positive pressure type and low pressure or injector type.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{oxy-fuel}} torch, {{called an}} equal-pressure torch, merely mixes the two gases. In an injector torch, high-pressure oxygen {{comes out of}} a small nozzle inside the torch head which drags the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> along with it, using the venturi effect.|$|E

25|$|Coal {{could no}} longer be {{imported}} from June 1944 and ran out three months later. Small amounts of peat were cut for <b>fuel.</b> <b>Gas</b> was restricted from 1941, both by appliances and the hours when it was available, running out completely in December 1944.|$|E
25|$|The {{threaded}} connectors on the hoses are handed to avoid accidental mis-connection: the thread on the oxygen hose is right-handed (as normal), while the <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> hose has a left-handed thread. The left-handed threads {{also have an}} identifying groove cut into their nuts.|$|E
25|$|Normal butane can be {{used for}} {{gasoline}} blending, as a <b>fuel</b> <b>gas,</b> fragrance extraction solvent, either alone or in a mixture with propane, and as a feedstock for the manufacture of ethylene and butadiene, a key ingredient of synthetic rubber. Isobutane is primarily used by refineries to enhance (increase) the octane number of motor gasoline.|$|E

25|$|The {{apparatus}} used in {{gas welding}} consists basically of an oxygen source and a <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> source (usually contained in cylinders), two pressure regulators and two flexible hoses (one for each cylinder), and a torch. This sort of torch {{can also be}} used for soldering and brazing. The cylinders are often carried in a special wheeled trolley.|$|E
25|$|Town gas is a {{flammable}} {{gaseous fuel}} {{made by the}} destructive distillation of coal. It contains a variety of calorific gases including hydrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, and other volatile hydrocarbons, together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and is used {{in a similar way}} to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> today.|$|E
25|$|National and {{international}} test codes {{are used to}} standardize the procedures and definitions used to test IGCC Power Plants. Selection of the test code to be used is an agreement between the purchaser and the manufacturer, and has some significance {{to the design of}} the plant and associated systems. In the United States, The American Society of Mechanical Engineers published the Performance Test Code for IGCC Power Generation Plants (PTC 47) in 2006 which provides procedures for the determination of quantity and quality of <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> by its flow rate, temperature, pressure, composition, heating valve, and its content of contaminants.|$|E

25|$|Interstate {{pipeline}} companies {{rely heavily}} on underground storage to perform load balancing and system supply management on their long-haul transmission lines. FERC regulations though demand that these companies open up the remainder of their capacity not used for that purpose to third parties. Twenty-five interstate companies currently operate 172 underground natural gas storage facilities. In 2005, their facilities accounted for about 43 percent of overall storage deliverability and 55 percent of working gas capacity in the US. These operators include the Columbia Gas Transmission Company, Dominion Gas Transmission Company, The National <b>Fuel</b> <b>Gas</b> Supply Company, Natural Gas Pipeline of America, Texas Gas Transmission Company, Southern Star Central Pipeline Company, TransCanada Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The {{overhead}} {{sour gas}} from the stripper contains hydrogen, methane, ethane, hydrogen sulfide, propane, and, perhaps, some butane and heavier components. That sour gas {{is sent to the}} refinery's central gas processing plant for removal of the hydrogen sulfide in the refinery's main amine gas treating unit and through a series of distillation towers for recovery of propane, butane and pentane or heavier components. The residual hydrogen, methane, ethane, and some propane is used as refinery <b>fuel</b> <b>gas.</b> The hydrogen sulfide removed and recovered by the amine gas treating unit is subsequently converted to elemental sulfur in a Claus process unit or to sulfuric acid in a wet sulfuric acid process or in the conventional Contact Process.|$|E
2500|$|The hoses are {{designed}} for use in welding and cutting metal. A double-hose or twinned design can be used, meaning that the oxygen and fuel hoses are joined together. If separate hoses are used, they should be clipped together at intervals approximately [...] apart, although that is not recommended for cutting applications, because beads of molten metal given off by the process can become lodged between the hoses where they are held together, and burn through, releasing the pressurised gas inside, which {{in the case of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>gas</b> usually ignites.|$|E
50|$|These {{fittings}} or special-service variants {{may also}} be found in hydraulic applications and alternative compressed gas applications (Oxy-acetylene welding and cutting, <b>fuel</b> <b>gases,</b> NSF C-2 food-contact, etc...), though perhaps not as frequently.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two broad}} classes of <b>fuel</b> <b>gases,</b> {{based not on}} their {{chemical}} composition, but their source {{and the way they}} are produced: those found naturally, and those manufactured from other materials.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of low cost, highly efficient, desulfurization technology with integrated sulfur recovery remains a principle barrier issue for Vision 21 integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation plants. In this plan, the U. S. Department of Energy will construct ultra-clean, modular, co-production IGCC power plants each with chemical products tailored {{to meet the}} demands of specific regional markets. The catalysts employed in these co-production modules, for example water-gas-shift and Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, are readily poisoned by hydrogen sulfide (H{sub 2 }S), a sulfur contaminant, present in the coal-derived <b>fuel</b> <b>gases.</b> To prevent poisoning of these catalysts, the removal of H{sub 2 }S down to the parts-per-billion level is necessary. Historically, research into the purification of coal-derived <b>fuel</b> <b>gases</b> has focused on dry technologies that offer the prospect of higher combined cycle efficiencies as well as improved thermal integration with co-production modules. Primarily, these concepts rely on a highly selective process separation step to remove low concentrations of H{sub 2 }S present in the <b>fuel</b> <b>gases</b> and produce a concentrated stream of sulfur bearing effluent. This effluent must then undergo further processing to be converted to its final form, usually elemental sulfur. Ultimately, desulfurization of coal-derived <b>fuel</b> <b>gases</b> may cost as much as 15 % of the total fixed capital investment (Chen et al., 1992). It is, therefore, desirable to develop new technology that can accomplish H{sub 2 }S separation and direct conversion to elemental sulfur more efficiently and with a lower initial fixed capital investment...|$|R
2500|$|In newer designs, {{cracking}} {{takes place}} using {{a very active}} zeolite-based catalyst in a short-contact time vertical or upward-sloped pipe called the [...] "riser". Pre-heated feed is sprayed into {{the base of the}} riser via feed nozzles where it contacts extremely hot fluidized catalyst at [...] The hot catalyst vaporizes the feed and catalyzes the cracking reactions that break down the high-molecular weight oil into lighter components including LPG, gasoline, and diesel. The catalyst-hydrocarbon mixture flows upward through the riser for a few seconds, and then the mixture is separated via cyclones. The catalyst-free hydrocarbons are routed to a main fractionator for separation into <b>fuel</b> <b>gas,</b> LPG, gasoline, naphtha, light cycle oils used in diesel and jet fuel, and heavy fuel oil.|$|E
2500|$|Approximately 20% of {{acetylene}} {{is supplied}} by the industrial gases industry for oxyacetylene gas welding and cutting due to the high temperature of the flame. Combustion of acetylene with oxygen produces a flame of over , releasing 11.8kJ/g. Oxyacetylene is the hottest burning common <b>fuel</b> <b>gas.</b> [...] Acetylene is the third-hottest natural chemical flame after dicyanoacetylene's [...] and cyanogen at [...] Oxy-acetylene welding was a popular welding process in previous decades. The development and advantages of arc-based welding processes have made oxy-fuel welding nearly extinct for many applications. Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly. On the other hand, oxy-acetylene welding equipment is quite versatile â€“ {{not only because the}} torch is preferred for some sorts of iron or steel welding (as in certain artistic applications), but also because it lends itself easily to brazing, braze-welding, metal heating (for annealing or tempering, bending or forming), the loosening of corroded nuts and bolts, and other applications. Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fuelled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manholes and in some aerial locations. Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible. As well, oxy-fuel cutting is still popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in many metal fabrication shops. For use in welding and cutting, the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator, since above 15 psi, if subjected to a shockwave (caused for example by a flashback), acetylene decomposes explosively into hydrogen and carbon.|$|E
