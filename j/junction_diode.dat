40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{fabrication}} and initial electrical characterization of greatly improved 3 C-SiC (beta-SiC) p-n <b>junction</b> <b>diodes.</b> These diodes, which were grown on commercially available 6 H-SiC substrates by chemical vapor deposition, demonstrate rectification to - 200 V at room temperature, representing a fourfold improvement in reported 3 C-SiC diode blocking voltage. The reverse leakage currents and saturation current densities measured on these diodes also show significant improvement compared to previously reported 3 C-SiC p-n <b>junction</b> <b>diodes.</b> When placed under sufficient forward bias, the diodes emit significantly bright green-yellow light. These results {{should lead to}} substantial advancements in 3 C-SiC transistor performance...|$|R
25|$|A p–n <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> {{is made of}} {{a crystal}} of semiconductor, usually silicon, but {{germanium}} and gallium arsenide are also used. Impurities are added to it to create a region on one side that contains negative charge carriers (electrons), called an n-type semiconductor, and a region {{on the other side}} that contains positive charge carriers (holes), called a p-type semiconductor. When the n-type and p-type materials are attached together, a momentary flow of electrons occur from the n to the p side resulting in a third region between the two where no charge carriers are present. This region is called the depletion region because there are no charge carriers (neither electrons nor holes) in it. The diode's terminals are attached to the n-type and p-type regions. The boundary between these two regions, called a p–n junction, is where the action of the diode takes place. When a sufficiently higher electrical potential is applied to the P side (the anode) than to the N side (the cathode), it allows electrons to flow through the depletion region from the N-type side to the P-type side. The junction does not allow the flow of electrons in the opposite direction when the potential is applied in reverse, creating, in a sense, an electrical check valve.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{electron}} and a hole {{are present in}} the same region, they may recombine or [...] "annihilate" [...] producing a spontaneous emission — i.e., the electron may re-occupy the energy state of the hole, emitting a photon with energy equal to the difference between the electron's original state and hole's state. (In a conventional semiconductor <b>junction</b> <b>diode,</b> the energy released from the recombination of electrons and holes is carried away as phonons, i.e., lattice vibrations, rather than as photons.) Spontaneous emission below the lasing threshold produces similar properties to an LED. Spontaneous emission is necessary to initiate laser oscillation, but it is one among several sources of inefficiency once the laser is oscillating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{difference}} between the photon-emitting semiconductor laser and a conventional phonon-emitting (non-light-emitting) semiconductor <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> lies {{in the type of}} semiconductor used, one whose physical and atomic structure confers the possibility for photon emission. These photon-emitting semiconductors are the so-called [...] "direct bandgap" [...] semiconductors. The properties of silicon and germanium, which are single-element semiconductors, have bandgaps that do not align in the way needed to allow photon emission and are not considered [...] "direct." [...] Other materials, the so-called compound semiconductors, have virtually identical crystalline structures as silicon or germanium but use alternating arrangements of two different atomic species in a checkerboard-like pattern to break the symmetry. The transition between the materials in the alternating pattern creates the critical [...] "direct bandgap" [...] property. Gallium arsenide, indium phosphide, gallium antimonide, and gallium nitride are all examples of compound semiconductor materials {{that can be used to}} create junction diodes that emit light.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and demonstrate a technology for producing optical signals on a VLSI chip using only standard silicon processing techniques. The design of the process requires shallow p+/n+ junctions to minimize the high absorption inherent in silicon for λ 3 ̆c 8 SOnm and to obtain low reversed biased voltages for avalanche break down of the p+/n+junction due to impact-ionization. The effects of doping and device geometry on the visible luminescence of reverse biased Si p+In+ <b>junction</b> <b>diodes</b> has been investigated. Each diode designed has a unique design incorporating sharp edges that promote high fields that aid the onset of break down. The p+ doping was varied while other processing parameters were held constant. All vertical <b>junction</b> <b>diodes</b> had excellent diode characteristics but no light emission was observed. Lateral <b>junction</b> <b>diodes</b> had typical reverse breakdown voltages of between 6 and 7 volts while certain devices of set geometry broke down rather sharply at 4 volts with light emission.

2500|$|There are, however, {{components}} of electrical circuits {{which do not}} obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their I–V curve) is nonlinear (or non-ohmic). [...] An example is the p-n <b>junction</b> <b>diode</b> (curve at right). [...] As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode. [...] One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of [...] "resistance" [...] is not constant {{as a function of}} applied voltage. [...] Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative. [...] The ratio V/I for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the static, or chordal, or DC, resistance, but as seen in the figure the value of total V over total I varies depending on the particular point along the nonlinear curve which is chosen. [...] This means the [...] "DC resistance" [...] V/I at some point on the curve {{is not the same as}} what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the dynamic, small-signal, or incremental resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the derivative of current with respect to voltage). [...] For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.|$|E

This construction produces two p-n junctions: a base-emitter junction and a base-collector junction, separated by a thin region of semiconductor known as the base region (two <b>junction</b> <b>diodes</b> wired together without sharing an intervening semiconducting region will not make a transistor).|$|R
