25|$|The liner {{contains}} the combustion process and introduces the various airflows (intermediate, dilution, and cooling, see Air flow paths below) into the combustion zone. The liner must be {{designed and built}} to withstand extended high temperature cycles. For that reason liners tend to be made from superalloys like Hastelloy X. Furthermore, even though high performance alloys are used, the liners must be cooled with air flow. Some combustors also make use of thermal barrier coatings. However, air cooling is still required. In general, {{there are two main}} types of liner cooling; <b>film</b> <b>cooling</b> and transpiration cooling. <b>Film</b> <b>cooling</b> works by injecting (by one of several methods) cool air from outside of the liner to just inside of the liner. This creates a thin film of cool air that protects the liner, reducing the temperature at the liner from around 1800 kelvins (K) to around 830 K, for example. The other type of liner cooling, transpiration cooling, is a more modern approach that uses a porous material for the liner. The porous liner allows a small amount of cooling air to pass through it, providing cooling benefits similar to <b>film</b> <b>cooling.</b> The two primary differences are in the resulting temperature profile of the liner and the amount of cooling air required. Transpiration cooling results in a much more even temperature profile, as the cooling air is uniformly introduced through pores. <b>Film</b> <b>cooling</b> air is generally introduced through slats or louvers, resulting in an uneven profile where it is cooler at the slat and warmer between the slats. More importantly, transpiration cooling uses much less cooling air (on the order of 10% of total airflow, rather than 20-50% for <b>film</b> <b>cooling).</b> Using less air for cooling allows more to be used for combustion, which is more and more important for high performance, high thrust engines.|$|E
2500|$|Can combustors are {{self-contained}} cylindrical combustion chambers. Each [...] "can" [...] {{has its own}} fuel injector, igniter, liner, and casing.

5000|$|This {{is similar}} to <b>film</b> <b>cooling</b> in that it creates a thin film of cooling air on the blade, but it is {{different}} in that air is [...] "leaked" [...] through a porous shell rather than injected through holes. This type of cooling is effective at high temperatures as it uniformly covers the entire blade with cool air. Transpiration-cooled blades generally consist of a rigid strut with a porous shell. Air flows through internal channels of the strut and then passes through the porous shell to cool the blade. As with <b>film</b> <b>cooling,</b> increased cooling air decreases turbine efficiency, therefore that decrease has to be balanced with improved temperature performance.|$|E

50|$|In {{the narrow}} {{trailing}} edge <b>film</b> <b>cooling</b> {{is used to}} enhance heat transfer from the blade. There is an array of pin fins on the blade surface. Heat transfer takes place from this array and through the side walls. As the coolant flows across the fins with high velocity, the flow separates and wakes are formed. Many factors contribute towards heat transfer rate among which the type of pin fin and the spacing between fins are the most significant.|$|E
50|$|<b>Film</b> <b>cooling</b> (also called thin <b>film</b> <b>cooling),</b> {{a widely}} used type, allows for higher heat {{transfer}} rates than either convection and impingement cooling. This technique consists of pumping the cooling {{air out of}} the blade through multiple small holes in the structure. A thin layer (the film) of cooling air is then created on the external surface of the blade, reducing the heat transfer from main flow, whose temperature (1300-1800 kelvins) can exceed the melting point of the blade material (1300-1400 kelvins). The air holes can be in many different blade locations, but they are most often along the leading edge. A United States Air Force program in the early 1970s funded the development of a turbine blade that was both film and convection cooled, and that method has become common in modern turbine blades.Injecting the cooler bleed into the flow reduces turbine isentropic efficiency; the compression of the cooling air (which does not contribute power to the engine) incurs an energetic penalty; and the cooling circuit adds considerable complexity to the engine. All of these factors have to be compensated by the increase in overall performance (power and efficiency) allowed by the increase in turbine temperature.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively, rockets may {{use more}} common {{construction}} {{materials such as}} aluminium, steel, nickel or copper alloys and employ cooling systems that prevent the construction material itself becoming too hot. Regenerative cooling, where the propellant is passed through tubes around the combustion chamber or nozzle, and other techniques, such as curtain cooling or <b>film</b> <b>cooling,</b> are employed to give longer nozzle and chamber life. These techniques ensure that a gaseous thermal boundary layer touching the material is kept below the temperature which would cause the material to catastrophically fail.|$|E
