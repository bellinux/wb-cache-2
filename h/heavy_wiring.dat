40|$|Al <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> bonding is {{the main}} {{interconnection}} technology for the top side of power semiconductors. However, its reliability in power cycling conditions limits the lifetime of power modules. In this paper we report {{about the development of}} a new Al-alloy (AlX) for <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> bonding. The AlX-alloy is characterized by precipitation hardening effects in the temperature range of 200 - 300 Â°C. In contrast to the conventionally used pure Al-wires this leads to an increasing strength and breaking load at higher temperatures. So the AlX-alloy enables the use of an Albased bonding wire for high temperature applications. First tests of its behavior in the <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> bonding process and the results of first reliability investigations will be presented...|$|R

5000|$|A {{compensating}} {{wire rope}} line {{is attached to}} the top and to the underside of an arbor and runs through sheaves near those for the operating line. This wire rope line follows a similar path to the operating line. The compensating line is made of two lengths of wire rope: a thick <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> rope (e.g. 1" [...] diameter), and a thin wire rope (e.g. 1/4" [...] diameter). One end of each length is attached together. The free thick end of the compensating line {{is attached to the}} underside of the arbor and the free thin end is attached to the top. As fly pipe lowers and the arbor rises, more of the thick <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> rope hangs beneath the arbor and compensates for the additional weight of the fly lines. This mechanism works well with T-track counterweight systems.|$|R

SMT, a British development, was material composed of <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> joined in three-inch squares. It was chosen over other {{surfacing material}}s because it was very lightweight, allowing sufficient quantities to be transported across the English channel on over-tasked landing craft. Easily workable, a SMT landing mat for fighters could be laid like a carpet in about one week.|$|R

This technique only works with carbonated beverages. The Hutter Stopper became standard in beer bottling in the late 1890s / early 1900s. Bail closures on bottles were invented by Henry William Putnam in 1859. These involved <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> bail attached to a bottle's neck that swung over the cork to hold it in.|$|R
5000|$|In later Oudin {{circuits}} the coils were magnetically coupled, {{forming an}} autotransformer, so the primary induces an EMF {{in the secondary}} by electromagnetic induction. Both coils were usually wound on the same coil form, the primary consisting of relatively few turns of <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> at the bottom with an adjustable tap, connected to the secondary winding, made of many turns of fine wire. [...] Oudin found this circuit produced higher voltages due to the large turns ratio of the transformer.|$|R
40|$|Ultrasonic <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> bonding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{relevant}} interconnection technologies in automotive and power electric devices. The reliability of electronic components in these fields is mainly determined by the interconnection lifetime during application and, thus by the strength and fatigue characteristics of the mechanically and thermo-mechanically loaded bonding wire materials. In the current paper, mechanical and micro structure properties of different <b>heavy</b> bonding <b>wire</b> materials including Al-, Cu- and Al-clad Cu wires are analyzed in their initial state prior to bonding. Fatigue properties were estimated in the form of the Coffin-Manson equation for the wires loaded in uniaxial cyclic testing. In addition, corresponding microstructure properties were investigated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Electron Backscattered Diffraction (EBSD). The applied approach aims at an improved understanding of basic material properties governing the general reliabi lity behavior of the wires independently from any specific application. The results obtained, enable a more detailed understanding of the material aspects governing the low cycle fatigue behavior of different <b>heavy</b> bonding <b>wires.</b> In particular, they provide an explanation for the superior life time behavior of Cu- and Al clad Cu wires compared to Al wires. In addition, the data derived support establishing improved and consistent quantitative life time models based on finite element analysis for different electronic devices...|$|R

30|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, it is {{advisable}} in frictional space closure to use lighter forces and <b>heavier</b> <b>wires</b> with a stiffness able to counteract the negative effect of elastic chain forces [6, 7] reducing the vertical and horizontal bowing effect and providing good finishing and optimal space closure. As the stiffness of a wire is inversely proportional to its length [8 â 10], {{it has been hypothesised}} that a straight lingual archwire, being shorter than the corresponding mushroom archwire, should aid the clinician in keeping bowing effect under control [11 â 13].|$|R
50|$|Wire clamps {{consist of}} a piece of <b>heavy</b> <b>wire,</b> {{typically}} steel, first bent into a tight U, then formed into a ring shape with one end overlapping the other, and finally the ends bent outwards and cut. A captive nut is attached to one end, and a captive screw to the other. When the screw is tightened, the overlapped ends of the wire are pushed apart, tightening the wire loop around the hose. For an explanation of why this design is used, see the section on sealing the connection.|$|R

25|$|All {{but very}} old games use low DC {{voltages}} {{to power the}} solenoids and electronics (or relays). Some microprocessor games use high voltages (potentially hazardous) for the score displays. Very early games used low-voltage AC power for solenoids, requiring fewer components, but AC is less efficient for powering solenoids, causing <b>heavier</b> <b>wiring</b> and slower performance. For locations that suffer from low AC wall outlet voltage, additional taps may be provided on the AC transformer in electromechanical games to permit raising the game's DC voltage levels, thus strengthening the solenoids. Microprocessor games have electronic power supplies that automatically compensate for inaccurate AC supply voltages.|$|R

40|$|Observations on the {{reliability}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>wire</b> bonds show a significant decrease of active thermal cycling lifetime with increasing wire diameter. The innovation outlined in this paper is, to shape the wire bond in the bonding region in such a way, that the thermo-mechanical load on the interface region between wire and semiconductor metallization is being reduced significantly. The efficiency of the approach is proven by finite element simulations and experiments. Moreover, the experiments indicate that the method {{can be used as}} a 'nondestructive' in-situ measurement technique, that enables to directly derive the crack growth from thermography measurements of the notches. The notches work like a magnifier for the thermography camera and eliminate the preconditioning e. g. with black coloring...|$|R
5000|$|In passive self-ligating braces, {{orthodontic}} treatment begins with very light wires [...]014 inch in size {{that are made}} of an alloy of copper, nickel, and titanium (CuNiTi) and have a non-anatomical shape because it is wider than the natural arch. Successively thicker wires are placed as the arches round out and as the teeth level. The next-larger wire is used when it may be passively placed in the brackets. The use of initial light wires and the passive placement of subsequent <b>heavier</b> <b>wires</b> made of stainless steel and/or a TMA alloy may reduce the pressure exerted on the periodontial ligaments.
