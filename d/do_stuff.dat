500|$|On December 21, 1979, Zappa's movie Baby Snakes premiered in New York. The movie's tagline was [...] "A {{movie about}} people who <b>do</b> <b>stuff</b> that is not normal". The 2hour and 40minutes movie was based on footage from concerts in New York around Halloween 1977, with a band {{featuring}} keyboardist Tommy Mars and percussionist Ed Mann (who would both return on later tours) as well as guitarist Adrian Belew. It also contained several extraordinary sequences of clay animation by Bruce Bickford who had earlier provided animation sequences to Zappa for a 1974 TV special (which became available on the 1982 video The Dub Room Special). The movie did not do well in theatrical distribution, but won the Premier Grand Prix at the First International Music Festival in Paris in 1981.|$|E

Midway through the tour, Brian Eno {{commissioned}} the band to contribute a song to The Help Album, a charity compilation organised by War Child. The Help Album was to be recorded {{over the course of}} a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded [...] "Lucky" [...] in five hours with engineer Nigel Godrich, who had assisted producer John Leckie with The Bends and produced several Radiohead B-sides. Godrich said of the Help Album session: [...] "Those things are the most inspiring, when you <b>do</b> <b>stuff</b> really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album." [...] To promote The Help Album, [...] "Lucky" [...] featured as the lead track on the Help EP, which charted at number 51 after BBC Radio 1 chose not to play it.

2500|$|GameSpot Editor Bob Colayco {{praised the}} {{gameplay}} in general, which he compared favorably with Battlefield 1942. He gave high marks to the versatility of playing modes, such as vehicle control and foot battle. He also praised the PC version for its extensive online play. Ivan Sulic of IGN praised the graphics, sound, general Star Wars setting, and online mode, but was {{very critical of}} both the AI and the single-player mode. [...] "This is a multiplayer-centric third and first-person shooter, [...] means players who opt to stick to single player will have something to do, but won't be thrilled enough to desire extended play." [...] He cited three major issues with the game's single player element: its easy difficulty, its lack of cohesion, and poor AI teammates and enemies. Of the AI, Sulic stated [...] "Everyone is an idiot. The game appears to use a sort of context sensitive AI, meaning bots in the right positions will <b>do</b> <b>stuff</b> (like use turrets and vehicles and lay down cover fire), but those not immediately engaged in combat will idly stand around helping themselves to an endless breather." ...|$|E

[...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career.
