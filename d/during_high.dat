5|$|The {{difficulties}} of definition are considerable in some cases. For example, Haswell-Smith (2004) treats Lunga {{as a single}} island, although <b>during</b> <b>high</b> tides it becomes one inhabited island and numerous uninhabited tidal islets. Another example is the smaller island of Eilean Mòr in Loch Dunvegan, which joins with nearby Eilean Dubh and Garay Island at low tides.|$|E

50|$|The {{maximum width}} of the lagoon is {{approximately}} 10 miles. In many places, however, lagoon width fluctuates considerably with the height of wind-generated tides. The lagoon is widest <b>during</b> <b>highest</b> wind tides, which produce maximum flooding of the vast tidal flats.|$|R

5|$|Additional {{problems}} were discovered when the ride {{opened to the}} public. The WindSeeker at Canada's Wonderland underwent repairs for just over a week when {{it was discovered that}} one of the 32 pairs of seats had been removed for an unstated reason. They were replaced and testing began shortly after. In another case at the same installation, riders were stuck {{at the top of the}} WindSeeker tower for 20 minutes when the swings did not come down. Since these incidents, ride operations are suspended <b>during</b> <b>high</b> winds or heavy rain.|$|E
5|$|After Lee's death, {{his wife}} Emma {{continued}} {{to operate the}} ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below {{the confluence of the}} Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee's Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River {{to reduce the risk of}} boats washing downstream <b>during</b> <b>high</b> water.|$|E
5|$|An even {{checkerboard}} plot model {{dominates the}} green landscape {{during the rainy}} season, which becomes more austere after harvest. The rice fields differ {{only in terms of}} soil type and location. Where mangroves are populous, such as in Carabane, the rice paddy fields between them must be protected from the channels of saltwater which overflow <b>during</b> <b>high</b> tide. Rice farmers must therefore build levees, dig ditches, and create ponds. The fish and shrimp which subsequently become trapped are harvested {{at the end of the}} rainy season, when the basins are emptied. The plots of land which were safeguarded from flooding are then cleared and ploughed. Several years of drainage are required to desalinate the soil.|$|E

5|$|Ballard {{left home}} {{following}} {{his sophomore year}} of high school to pursue his hockey career with the U.S. National Development Team in Ann Arbor, Michigan. During his time with the Omaha Lancers, he graduated from Millard North High School in Omaha, Nebraska.

5|$|Bismarck {{left the}} Kiel Fjord {{on the morning}} of 28 September 1940 heading east. After an uneventful voyage through rough seas, Bismarck reached Gotenhafen (now Gdynia) the next day. Here Bismarck {{conducted}} a number of sea trials in the relative safety of the Bay of Danzig (now Gdańsk Bay). By 30 November 1940, Lindemann had set a number of tests for the crew, which they passed easily. <b>During</b> <b>high</b> speed trials, Bismarck reached a top speed of , exceeding the design speed. However, one weakness quickly became apparent: without using the rudders but only the screws, Bismarck was almost impossible to steer.|$|E

5|$|Cormorant {{fishing is}} the {{representative}} tourist attraction of Gifu. Though {{it occurs in}} many places in Japan, cormorant fishing on the Nagara River dates back more than 1,300 years. This is also the largest display of cormorant fishing in all of Japan, with six fishing masters going down the river at the same time, using their birds to catch ayu sweetfish. The season lasts from May 11 to October 15 every year and occurs each night, except <b>during</b> <b>high</b> water levels and the harvest moon.|$|E
5|$|Cubzac's {{climate is}} oceanic, {{part of the}} Dfb group in the Köppen climate classification. Periodically, the river Dordogne causes flooding. Nowadays Cubzac is {{protected}} by a dam, but is still vulnerable to flooding <b>during</b> <b>high</b> tides and strong winds. Flooding occurred last in the 1999 Martin and 2010 Xynthia storms. The 1999 storm destroyed many trees from the Terrefort castle park. In 1708, a temperature extremum of -15°C caused the river and vineyards to freeze.|$|E
5|$|Dead trees pose {{a safety}} risk, {{especially}} <b>during</b> <b>high</b> winds and severe storms, and removing dead trees involves a financial burden, whereas {{the presence of}} healthy trees can clean the air, increase property values, and reduce {{the temperature of the}} built environment and thereby reduce building cooling costs. During times of drought, trees can fall into water stress, which may cause a tree to become more susceptible to disease and insect problems, and ultimately may lead to a tree's death. Irrigating trees during dry periods can reduce the risk of water stress and death. Irrigation can be accomplished by use of a garden hose, soaker hose, sprinkler, or modified five-gallon bucket.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>high</b> {{school and}} college, Shehri was deeply {{religious}} and attended Al-Seqley Mosque, which {{his family had}} built as the local mosque. Shehri also frequented government-supported religious camps in Saudi Arabia. At this time, there were strong religious feelings in Saudi Arabia, especially in the Asir region. Many {{young people in the}} region idolized Osama bin Laden, who had family ties to the area. Wail's father was a friend of Bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden. Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi, who were both hijackers on United Airlines Flight 93, came from the same area in Saudi Arabia as the Shehri family.|$|E

His magazine drawings of single cartoons, not comic strips, began to be published in Redbook, Saturday Evening Post, and Collier's—the magazine with which he had the most success. Barbera also wrote to Walt Disney for advice on getting started in the animation industry. Disney wrote back, saying he would call Barbera during an upcoming trip to New York, but the call never took place.|$|E
