One species, The <b>greater</b> <b>ani</b> C. major lays 2 or 3 eggs, while the groove-billed ani C. sulcirostris lays seven.

The electrical conductivity increases when the initiator amount is <b>greater</b> than the <b>Ani.</b> In general, high value of initiator or high temperature has a positive effect on the polymerization rate, but it reduces the degree of polymerization.

Many other species of bird also nest over marsh waters during the wet season, including the ubiquitous great kiskadee and the peculiar <b>greater</b> <b>ani,</b> which builds its communal nests in tangled vegetation over water.|$|E

40|$|The <b>greater</b> <b>ani</b> (Crotophaga major), a Neotropical cuckoo, {{exhibits}} {{an unusual}} breeding {{system in which}} several socially monogamous pairs lay eggs in a single nest and contribute care to the communal clutch. Cooperative nesting is costly—females compete for reproduction by ejecting each other's eggs—but the potential direct or indirect fitness benefits that might accrue to group members have not been identified. In this study, I used molecular genotyping to quantify patterns of genetic relatedness and individual reproductive success within social groups in a single colour-banded population. Microsatellite analysis of 122 individuals in 49 groups revealed that group members are not genetic relatives. Group size was strongly correlated with individual reproductive success: solitary pairs were extremely rare and never successful, and nests attended by two pairs {{were significantly more likely}} to be depredated than were nests attended by three pairs. Egg loss, a consequence of reproductive competition, was greater in large groups and disproportionately affected females that initiated laying. However, early-laying females compensated for egg losses by laying larger clutches, and female group members switched positions in the laying order across nesting attempts. The <b>greater</b> <b>ani,</b> therefore, appears to be one of the few species in which cooperative breeding among unrelated individuals is favoured by direct, shared benefits that outweigh the substantial costs of reproductive competition...|$|E
40|$|Studying {{long-term}} ecological studies {{allows for}} {{a better understanding of}} processes driving populations and communities, and this understanding can be used to improve conservation eorts. These studies can describe how changes in the environment have led to current states of populations and communities, and indicate if the current state or trend falls within expectations based on past dynamics. Studies of long-term datasets also help ecologists predict how populations may shift with climate, water, or land-use change and determine necessary management action to maintain sustainable populations and community interactions. Serving as a of time, 2 ̆ 2 long-term monitoring can provide insight into the in uence of predation, intra- or interspecic competition, and other interactions on system dynamics. Studies need to explicitly include these drivers and sources of autocorrelation in data (e. g., spatial autocorrelation) to obtain unbiased estimates of ecological processes for guiding management. Fortunately, new statistical analyses for ecological applications are available that help ecologists make full use of the information present in long-term studies while properly accounting for sampling error and autocorrelation. In this study, I use advanced statistical methods to analyze a long-term dataset, the Waterfowl Breeding Population and Habitat Survey, and address questions about waterfowl population and community dynamics. In Chapter 2, I use multi-state occupancy models to determine how the presence of lesser and <b>greater</b> scaup (Aythya <b>anis</b> and A. marila) has changed on their breeding grounds in North America since 1955. In Chapter 3, I use a Bayesian hierarchical model to determine the drivers of the breeding scaup population in the Northwest Territories of Canada. Lastly, in Chapter 4 I incorporate more waterfowl species into the hierarchical model from Chapter 3 to determine the drivers of the pochard duck community, along with the role of species interactions. My results indicate that the occupancy of scaup has decreased in the boreal forest of Canada and increased in the prairie parklands. Additionally, scaup in the Northwest Territories are largely in uenced by density dependence and snow cover extent. Finally, the pochard community in the Northwest Territories is regulated more by environmental drivers than intra- or interspecic interactions. These results indicate that management of the species through hunting regulations likely deserves further study, as scaup likely exhibit some sort of compensation in response to hunting...|$|R
40|$|Birds’ eggshells are {{primarily}} composed of calcite, an abundant polymorph of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3). However, the eggshells of some species are coated with spherules of vaterite, {{a rare and}} thermodynamically unstable polymorph of CaCO 3, the function of which remains unknown. Here we experimentally test the mechanical and physiological effects of the vaterite coating on eggshells of the <b>Greater</b> <b>Ani</b> Crotophaga major, a tropical cuckoo. Vaterite removal did not affect vapour conductance rates across the eggshell, indicating that the vaterite coating does not influence gas exchange during embryonic development. By contrast, nanoindentation revealed that the hardness and elasticity of vaterite {{is similar to that}} of calcite, and white light interferometry showed that the vaterite layer increased the total thickness of the shell cuticle by up to 10 %. Furthermore, calculations of contact mechanics found that when two eggs come into contact, the depth of the surface deformation caused by the contact is far less than the thickness of the vaterite coating. These results suggest the layer of vaterite spherules may act as a ‘shock absorber’ for the underlying calcite shell, protecting it from mechanical damage caused by collision with other eggs in the nest and reducing the risk of eggshell fracture during incubation...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Greater</b> <b>Ani</b> (Crotophaga major) is a neotropical cuckoo {{in which}} several females lay {{eggs in a}} single nest. Group members {{synchronize}} egg laying and compete for reproduction by ejecting early-laid eggs from the communal nest. Eggs are large (∼ 17 % of female body mass) and vary greatly in size. I assessed the effects of egg size, hatching asynchrony, and position in the laying order on the survival and growth of nestlings {{to test the hypothesis}} that females invest more resources in eggs that are likely to give rise to surviving offspring. The egg's position in the female's laying sequence {{was a significant predictor of}} egg mass, with first-laid eggs and last-laid eggs consistently smaller than those in the middle of the clutch. Females that initiated laying in the communal nest almost always lost their first-laid eggs, and these females also exhibited the most extreme variation in egg mass. Nestlings from last-laid eggs were more likely to hatch asynchronously and starve before fledging, and the mass of last-laid eggs decreased as the degree of hatching asynchrony increased. Ejection and starvation probabilities were not affected by egg mass; therefore, low survivorship of first-laid and last-laid eggs was due solely to their position in the laying order, not to their smaller size. These data suggest that individual females allocate more resources to eggs that are likely to survive to fledging and that reproductive competition among communally breeding females explains much of the variation in egg size in this species.
