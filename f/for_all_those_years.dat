After winning her role in EastEnders at the age of 16, Westbrook was a regular on the London club scene, and her cocaine usage escalated. She has commented [...] "I was always in clubs and everyone was doing coke and it was glamorous – except obviously, it wasn't at all. I was just very young, very stupid and very easily led...I think there should be someone at EastEnders to say to young people when they come in, 'Look, your life is about to change, you're going to be invited to things, and you'll be offered drugs.' Someone who can tell them what sort of people are about, and what sort of papers, and how quickly what you've worked <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> <b>years</b> can be gone."

60|$|Six years {{afterwards}} Tommy was {{a famous}} man, as I hope {{you do not need}} to be told; but you may be wondering how it came about.
