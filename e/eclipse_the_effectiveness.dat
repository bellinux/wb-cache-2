40|$|Menorrhagia, {{or heavy}} menstrual {{bleeding}} (HMB), {{is a common}} gynaecological condition. As the aim of treatment is to improve women's wellbeing {{and quality of life}} (QoL), it is necessary to have effective ways to measure this. This study investigated {{the reliability and validity of}} the menorrhagia multi-attribute scale (MMAS), a menorrhagia-specific QoL instrument. Participants (n = 431) completed the MMAS and a battery of other tests as part of the baseline assessment of <b>the</b> <b>ECLIPSE</b> (<b>Effectiveness</b> and Cost-effectiveness of Levonorgestrel-containing Intrauterine system in Primary care against Standard trEatment for menorrhagia) trial.

40|$|The words Code smells mean certain code lines {{which makes}} {{problems}} in source code. It {{also means that}} code lines in bad design shape or any code made by bad coding habits. There are a few studies found in code smells detecting field. But these studies have their own weaknesses which are detecting only particular kinds of code smells and lack of expressing what the problems are. In this paper, we newly define code smells by using specification language OCL and use these models in auto detection. To construct our new code smells model, we first transform java source into XMI document format based on JavaEAST metamodel which is expanded from JavaAST meta-model. The prepared OCL will be run through OCL component based on <b>Eclipse</b> plug-in. Finally <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>the</b> model will be verified by applying on primitive smell and derived smell in java source code...|$|R

The spectra have a {{resolution}} of 0. 35 to 0. 65 Å and cover the period 2008 to 2012 with a typical interval of 4 days during eclipse. This paper specifically covers variations in the K I 7699 Å, Na D and Mg II 4481 Å lines. Absorption started increasing in the KI 7699 Å line 3 months before <b>the</b> <b>eclipse</b> began photometrically and had not returned to pre <b>eclipse</b> levels by <b>the</b> end of the survey March 2012, 7 months after the brightness had returned to normal outside <b>eclipse</b> levels. <b>The</b> contribution of <b>the</b> <b>eclipsing</b> object to <b>the</b> KI 7699 Å line has been isolated and the data show the excess absorption increasing and decreasing {{in a series of}} steps during ingress and egress. This is interpreted as an indication of structure within <b>the</b> <b>eclipsing</b> object. <b>The</b> F star is totally obscured by <b>the</b> <b>eclipsing</b> object at <b>the</b> Na D wavelength during <b>eclipse.</b> <b>The</b> radial velocity of the F star and the mean and maximum radial velocity of <b>the</b> <b>eclipsing</b> material in front of the F star at any given time have been isolated and tracked throughout <b>the</b> <b>eclipse.</b> <b>The</b> quasi-periodic variations seen in the F star RV outside <b>eclipse</b> continued during <b>the</b> <b>eclipse.</b> It is hoped that these results can be used to constrain proposed models of the system and its components.
