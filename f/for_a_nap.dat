500|$|The {{popularity}} of Geoffrey's Historia and its other derivative works (such as Wace's Roman de Brut) is generally {{agreed to be}} an important factor in explaining the appearance of significant numbers of new Arthurian works in continental Europe during the 12th and 13th centuries, particularly in France. It was not, however, the only Arthurian influence on the developing [...] "Matter of Britain". There is clear evidence that Arthur and Arthurian tales were familiar on the Continent before Geoffrey's work became widely known (see for example, the Modena Archivolt), and [...] "Celtic" [...] names and stories not found in Geoffrey's Historia appear in the Arthurian romances. From the perspective of Arthur, perhaps the most significant effect of this great outpouring of new Arthurian story was {{on the role of the}} king himself: much of this 12th-century and later Arthurian literature centres less on Arthur himself than on characters such as Lancelot and Guinevere, Percival, Galahad, Gawain, Ywain, and Tristan and Iseult. Whereas Arthur is very much at the centre of the pre-Galfridian material and Geoffrey's Historia itself, in the romances he is rapidly sidelined. His character also alters significantly. In both the earliest materials and Geoffrey he is a great and ferocious warrior, who laughs as he personally slaughters witches and giants and takes a leading role in all military campaigns, whereas in the continental romances he becomes the roi fainéant, the [...] "do-nothing king", whose [...] "inactivity and acquiescence constituted a central flaw in his otherwise ideal society". Arthur's role in these works is frequently that of a wise, dignified, even-tempered, somewhat bland, and occasionally feeble monarch. So, he simply turns pale and silent when he learns of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere in the Mort Artu, whilst in Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, he is unable to stay awake after a feast and has to retire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> Nonetheless, as Norris J. Lacy has observed, whatever his faults and frailties may be in these Arthurian romances, [...] "his prestige is never—or almost never—compromised by his personal weaknesses... his authority and glory remain intact." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, the Prince and Ciccio {{eat their}} picnic lunch and settle down <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap.</b> Instead of sleeping, however, the Prince finds himself contemplating the recent Plebiscite, a vote {{taken on the}} {{question}} of whether Sicily should politically join with the new Italian Kingdom. The Prince remembers how he couldn't decide which way to mark his ballot. Eventually he voted [...] "yes," [...] and then recalls the celebrations which greeted the result — a unanimous vote in favor.|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, the president's {{nomination}} of Charles B. Warren to be United States Attorney General was being debated. In {{the wake of}} the Teapot Dome scandal and other scandals, Democrats and Progressive Republicans objected to the nomination because of Warren's close association with the Sugar Trust. At midday, six speakers were scheduled to address Warren's nomination. Desiring to take a break <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>nap,</b> Dawes consulted the majority and minority leaders, who assured him that no vote would be taken that afternoon. After Dawes left the Senate, however, {{all but one of the}} scheduled speakers decided against making formal remarks, and a vote was taken. When it became apparent that the vote would be tied, Republican leaders hastily called Dawes at the Willard Hotel and he immediately left. While waiting for Dawes to arrive, the only Democratic senator who had voted for Warren switched his vote. The nomination had failed by a single vote resulting in the first such rejection of a president's nominee in nearly 60 years. This incident was chronicled in a derisive poem, based on the Longfellow poem [...] "Paul Revere's Ride;" [...] it began with the line, [...] "Come gather round children and hold your applause for the afternoon ride of Charlie Dawes." [...] The choice of poem was based on Charles Dawes being descended from William Dawes, who rode with Paul Revere.|$|E

6000|$|They {{would give}} us no more [...] "hevars" [...] that night; and Rartoo fairly dragged us away to a canoe, hauled up on the lake shore; when we reluctantly embarked, and {{paddling}} over to the village, arrived there in time <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good <b>nap</b> before sunrise.|$|R
60|$|There {{was time}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> good <b>nap</b> and <b>a</b> lovely dream before a harsh voice waked her up, {{and she heard}} a bat talking as it hung near by, with its {{leathery}} wings over its eyes to shut out {{the light of the}} glow-worm still strolling about on the bank.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Easterfield {{tried very}} hard to cheer up Olive, and to make her {{entertain}} the Foxes in her usual lively way, but this was of no use; the young person was not in a good humor, and retired <b>for</b> <b>an</b> afternoon <b>nap.</b> But as this was an indulgence she very seldom allowed herself, it was not likely that she napped.|$|R

40|$|Fatigue {{has been}} {{recognised}} {{as the primary}} contributing factor in approximately 15 % of all fatal road crashes in Australia To develop effective countermeasures for managing fatigue this study investigates why drivers continue to drive when sleepy and driver perceptions and behaviours in regards to countermeasures Based on responses from 305 Australian drivers it was identified that the major reasons why these participants continued to drive when sleepy were wanting {{to get to their}} destination being close to home and time factors Participants perceptions and use of 18 fatigue countermeasures were investigated It was found that participants perceived the safest strategies including stopping and sleeping swapping drivers and stopping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>nap</b> to be the most effective countermeasures However it appeared that their knowledge of safe countermeasures did not translate into their use of these strategies For example although the drivers perceived stopping <b>for</b> <b>a</b> quick <b>nap</b> to be <b>an</b> effective countermeasure they reported more frequent use of less safe methods such as stopping to eat or drink and winding down the window This finding suggests that while practitioners should continue educating drivers they may need a greater focus on motivating drivers to implement safe fatigue countermeasure...|$|R
