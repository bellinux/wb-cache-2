5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of <b>epidural</b> blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into {{the area of the}} hole in the dura, an <b>epidural</b> blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from <b>epidural</b> blood patching.|$|E
5|$|Hematomas, also focal lesions, are {{collections}} {{of blood in}} or around the brain that can result from hemorrhage. Intracerebral hemorrhage, with bleeding in the brain tissue itself, is an intra-axial lesion. Extra-axial lesions include <b>epidural</b> hematoma, subdural hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intraventricular hemorrhage. <b>Epidural</b> hematoma involves bleeding into the area between the skull and the dura mater, the outermost of the three membranes surrounding the brain. In subdural hematoma, bleeding occurs between the dura and the arachnoid mater. Subarachnoid hemorrhage involves bleeding into {{the space between the}} arachnoid membrane and the pia mater. Intraventricular hemorrhage occurs when there is bleeding in the ventricles.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, he {{designed}} the Racz catheter, a flexible, spring-wound catheter {{with a small}} fluoroscopic probe. In 1989, he developed <b>epidural</b> lysis of adhesions, {{sometimes referred to as}} percutaneous adhesiolysis, or simply the Racz procedure. It is a minimally invasive, percutaneous intervention for treating chronic spinal pain often due to scarring after post lumbar surgery syndrome, sometimes called failed back surgery, and also low-back and radicular pain from spinal stenosis, a disease of aging. The procedure is somewhat similar to an <b>epidural</b> and is used when conventional methods have failed. The Racz procedure may employ the use of a wire-bound catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called <b>epidural</b> adhesions or fibrosis, which have formed around the nerve roots, and allows for local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area.|$|E

5|$|Some {{other studies}} have {{proposed}} that issues with the spinal venous drainage system may cause a CSF leak. According to this theory, dural holes and intracranial hypotension are symptoms caused by low pressure in the <b>epidural</b> space due to outflow to the heart through the inferior vena cava vein.|$|E
5|$|The Racz {{procedure}} {{employs a}} wire-bound or spring loaded catheter to mechanically break-up or dissolve scar tissue, also called <b>epidural</b> adhesions or fibroids, that have formed around the nerve roots, {{and allows for}} local anesthetics, saline, and steroids to be injected into the affected area. This procedure was assigned a Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid is {{produced}} by the choroid plexus in the ventricles {{of the brain and}} contained by the dura and arachnoid layers of the meninges. The brain floats in CSF, which also transports nutrients to the brain and spinal cord. As holes form in the spinal dura mater, CSF leaks out into the surrounding space. The CSF is then absorbed into the spinal <b>epidural</b> venous plexus or soft tissues around the spine. Due to the sterile conditions of the soft tissues around the spine there is no risk of meningitis.|$|E

5|$|During phylogenesis, {{cerebrospinal}} fluid is present within the neuraxis before it circulates. The CSF of Teleostei fish are {{contained within the}} ventricles of the brains, {{but not in a}} nonexistent subarachnoid space. In mammals, where a subarachnoid space is present, the CSF is present in it. Absorption of CSF is seen in amniotes and more complex species, and as species become progressively more complex, the system of absorption becomes progressively more enhanced, and the role of spinal <b>epidural</b> veins in absorption plays a progressively smaller and smaller role.|$|E
5|$|In {{two small}} studies of two {{patients}} and another with one patient suffering from recurrent CSF leaks where repeated blood patches failed to form clots and relieve symptoms, the patients received temporary but complete resolution of symptoms with an <b>epidural</b> saline infusion. The saline infusion temporarily restores the volume {{necessary for a}} patient to avoid SIH until the leak can be repaired properly. Intrathecal saline infusion is used in urgent cases such as intractable pain or decreased consciousness.|$|E
5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may be considered for those with persistent sciatic pain. <b>Epidural</b> corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people who}} develop SCSFLS feel the sudden onset of a severe and acute {{headache}}. It is a headache usually {{made worse by}} standing, typically becoming prominent throughout the day, with the pain becoming less severe when lying down. Orthostatic headaches can become chronic and disabling {{to the point of}} incapacitation. Some patients with SCSFLS will develop headaches that begin in the afternoon. This is known as second-half-of-the-day headache. This may be an initial presentation of a spontaneous CSF leak or appear after treatment such as an <b>epidural</b> patch, and likely indicates a slow CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|Prognosis differs {{depending}} on the severity and location of the lesion, and access to immediate, specialised acute management. Subarachnoid hemorrhage approximately doubles mortality. Subdural hematoma is associated with worse outcome and increased mortality, while people with <b>epidural</b> hematoma {{are expected to have}} a good outcome if they receive surgery quickly. Diffuse axonal injury may be associated with coma when severe, and poor outcome. Following the acute stage, prognosis is strongly influenced by the patient's involvement in activity that promote recovery, which for most patients requires access to a specialised, intensive rehabilitation service. The Functional Independence Measure is a way to track progress and degree of independence throughout rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|A {{spontaneous}} {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leak {{is one of}} several types of cerebrospinal fluid leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A spontaneous CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches â€” headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an <b>epidural</b> blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal <b>epidural</b> injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
5|$|Kershaw {{made his}} sixth {{straight}} opening day start in 2016 as the Dodgers won 15â€“0. It also {{marked the first}} time the Dodgers had won six straight opening day games, all of which he started. On May 12 against the New York Mets, he struck out 13 while pitching a three-hit complete game shutout. He set an MLB record with six consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts and no more than one walk and a club record with six consecutive starts with at least 10 strikeouts. He picked up his 100th strikeout on May 29, while only walking five batters within that period. That was the lowest walk total for a pitcher reaching 100 strikeouts in the modern era, beating Cliff Lee who had seven walks in the 2010 season. On June 30, 2016, Kershaw was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to back pain. He received an MRI, which revealed that there was a mild herniated disc in the back, and received an <b>epidural</b> injection to treat the pain. He was named to the 2016 All-Star team but was unable to pitch in the game due to his injury. On July 20, the Dodgers shut down Kershaw for an indefinite period of time. He continued to feel discomfort in his back after a simulated game. On August 3, Kershaw was transferred to the 60-day disabled list. He rejoined the Dodger rotation on September 9. He started 21 games in 2016, with a 12â€“4 record and 1.69 ERA. He also struck out 172 batters with only 11 walks.|$|E
