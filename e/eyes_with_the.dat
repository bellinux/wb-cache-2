5|$|The {{books are}} written in first-person narrative, {{primarily}} through Bella's <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> epilogue of the third book {{and a part of}} the fourth book being from Jacob's point of view. When asked about the structure of the novel, Meyer described her difficulty in pinpointing the premise of the novels to any specific their category: I have a hard time with that. Because if I say to someone, 'You know, it's about vampires,' then immediately they have this mental image of what the book is like. And it's so not like the other vampire books out there–Anne Rice's and the few that I've read. It isn't that kind of dark and dreary and blood-thirsty world. Then when you say, 'It's set in high school,' a lot of people immediately put it in another pool. It's easy to pigeonhole with different descriptions.|$|E
5|$|The NWA World Tag Team Championship was {{defended by}} America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm; AMW) against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray) next. Gail Kim {{accompanied}} AMW to the ring. Mid-way through the bout, Team 3D performed their signature Whassup? maneuver on Storm. Kim interfered in the bout, distracting the referee. Around this time, Devon retrieved a table {{from under the}} ring which both teams used as a weapon, however the referee did not disqualify anyone for the usage. AMW earned a near-fall after a bearhug and a lariat combination on Ray. Team 3D followed with their own near-fall on Harris, after they performed their signature Deadly Device maneuver on Storm. After this, Kim interfered trying to blow powder into Ray's eyes, only for Ray to stop her and blow it back into her and the referee's <b>eyes.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> referee blinded, Team 3D performed their signature 3D maneuver on Harris and the referee counted the pin. Team Canada then attacked 3D, knocking out Ray in the process with a hockey stick. They placed Harris on top of Ray and left the ring. After the referee regained his vision, he declared AMW the victors at 12 minutes and 41 seconds.|$|E

25|$|The {{jumping spider}} family (Salticidae) {{contains}} over 600 described genera {{and more than}} 5800 described species, making it the largest family of spiders with about 13% of all species. Jumping spiders {{have some of the}} best vision among arthropods and use it in courtship, hunting, and navigation. Although they normally move unobtrusively and fairly slowly, most species are capable of very agile jumps, notably when hunting, but sometimes in response to sudden threats or crossing long gaps. Both their book lungs and tracheal system are well-developed, and they use both systems (bimodal breathing). Jumping spiders are generally recognized by their eye pattern. All jumping spiders have four pairs of <b>eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> anterior median pair being particularly large.|$|E

During the final battle, it cuts away to a scene where Quentin Tarantino is having a meeting with Kermit, discussing ideas for how Dorothy can defeat the Wicked Witch of the West. Tarantino's ideas are deemed too expensive and too violent for a Muppet movie, so they agree for Dorothy to do a powerful kick on the witch. Cutting back to the action, Dorothy kicks the witch into her own [...] "bottled water bath" [...] which contains tap water (to which she is severely allergic). Angel Marie admitted that he filled the water bottles with tap water to restock them. This action causes the Wicked Witch of the West to melt as Johnny averts Foo-Foo's <b>eyes.</b> <b>With</b> <b>the</b> Wicked Witch of the West dead, Dorothy finds the magic eye floating in the tub unharmed and grabs it.|$|E
500|$|The teenage Victoria was a [...] "tall, dark girl, with violet <b>eyes</b> ... <b>with</b> <b>the</b> assuredness of an Empress and {{the high}} spirits of a tomboy," [...] {{according}} to one observer. Victoria had [...] "too little chin to be conventionally beautiful," [...] {{in the opinion of}} one of her biographers, but [...] "she had a good figure, deep blue eyes, and dark complexion." [...] In 1891, Victoria travelled with her mother to the funeral of Grand Duchess Alexandra Georgievna of Russia, the wife of her mother's brother Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich. There Victoria met her first cousin Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich. Although the two were deeply attracted to each other, Victoria's mother was reluctant to allow her to marry him because the Russian Orthodox faith forbids the marriage of first cousins. She was also suspicious of the morality of the Romanov men. When her teenage daughters were impressed by their handsome cousins, their mother warned them against the Russian grand dukes who did not make good husbands.|$|E

500|$|Bates {{suggested}} {{closing the}} eyes for {{minutes at a}} time to help bring about relaxation. He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by [...] "palming", or covering the closed <b>eyes</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> palms of the hands, without putting pressure on the eyeballs. If the covered eyes did not strain, he said, they would see [...] "a field so black {{that it is impossible to}} remember, imagine, or see anything blacker", since light was excluded by the palms. However, he reported that some of his patients experienced [...] "illusions of lights and colors" [...] sometimes amounting to [...] "kaleidoscopic appearances" [...] as they [...] "palmed", occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous [...] "strain" [...] and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed. This phenomenon, however, was almost certainly caused by Eigengrau or [...] "dark light". In fact, even in conditions of perfect darkness, as inside a cave, neurons at every level of the visual system produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color.|$|E
500|$|Before embarking her solo career, Roberts was one {{fifth of}} British girl band Girls Aloud. Roberts claimed {{that she found}} the {{experience}} of going solo troubling. She revealed that she struggled to cope with life {{in the public eye}} and the constant media attention. In particular, she received negative attention concerning her image. The experience led her to start to develop her debut album, which, lyrically, reflected the difficult times she experienced in Girls Aloud. On [...] "Beat of My Drum", Roberts describes herself as a [...] "baby in the corner" [...] - the song's original title. Roberts helped to write all of the tracks on Cinderella's <b>Eyes,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lyrics telling stories of things that happened in her life. [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] was co-written with Maya von Doll, Diplo and Dimitri Tikovoi. She stated that she had always wanted [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] to be something different from the music that other pop singers were presenting in the charts. Roberts stated that [...] "Beat of My Drum" [...] is [...] "a song everyone can sing and dance to". Roberts stated that she felt the song had a [...] "fun concept" [...] with a British influence.|$|E

40|$|Over 2. 4 million eye {{injuries}} occur {{each year}} in the United States as a result of trauma. Eye injuries have been investigated for years; however, the role of the extraocular muscles in relation to eye injuries has yet to be quantified. In this research, Computed Tomography quasi-static tests were conducted to investigate the effect of the presence of the extraocular muscles on the biomechanical response of the human eye in situ. Three matched pairs of human eyes were displaced in 5 mm increments using a large flat cylindrical indenter to a maximum displacement of 30 mm. The loading was similar to what is experienced during a blunt impact, which is believed to cause the most serious eye injuries. In the matched pair, one eye had the extraocular muscles intact and the other had the extraocular muscles transected. Force, pressure, and displacement measurements were collected for each test. A trend was seen where a greater amount of force was created in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> extraocular muscles intact than in <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> muscles transected, and a correlation between them was made.
