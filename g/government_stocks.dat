5|$|There {{had been}} coin {{shortages}} beginning in 1959, and the United States Bureau of the Mint expanded production {{to try to}} meet demand. The early 1960s {{was a time of}} increased use of silver both in the coinage and in industry, putting pressure on the price of silver, which was capped at just over $1.29 per ounce by government sales at that price. The silver in a dollar's worth of quarters would be worth more as bullion than as money if the price of the metal rose past $1.38 per ounce, and there was widespread hoarding of silver coins. Demand for the Kennedy half dollar as a collectable drove it from circulation after its debut in 1964. The Bureau of the Mint increased production, helping reduce the coin shortages by May 1965, but <b>government</b> <b>stocks</b> of silver were being rapidly reduced, and threatened to run out by 1968. After extensive study by the Treasury Department, President Lyndon B. Johnson in June 1965 recommended that Congress pass legislation to allow for silverless dimes and quarters, and debased silver half dollars. Although there was some opposition, mainly from legislators representing Western mining states, the bill progressed rapidly through Congress, and was enacted with Johnson's signature on July 23, 1965.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} expeditions that {{explored the}} regions that ultimately became Yellowstone National Park in 1872 caught fish {{in many of}} its waters to supply themselves with fresh provisions. It wasn't long after {{the creation of the}} park, that park officials understood the importance of angling to visitors and the importance of creating a ready resource to supply hotels and camps within the park with fresh fish. This resulted in the first <b>government</b> <b>stocking</b> of native and non-native species in 1889 and continued with a variety of successful and unsuccessful stocking efforts until 1955 when all stocking programs in the park were discontinued. Today's park trout are completely wild populations. Many of the park's waters held no fish prior to <b>government</b> <b>stocking</b> operations which introduced mainly non-native species to the rivers and lakes and redistributed native species.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to empirically examine the Reverse Causality hypothesis within the Nigerian context {{during the period}} 1980 – 2011.

The results from the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) and impulse response functions tend to further lend credence to this finding.

Such efforts should be complemented by augmenting domestic production and encouraging investment through inexpensive bank finance...|$|E
40|$|Since the {{pioneering}} work of Fisher (1930), which hypothesized that real stock price {{is independent of}} inflation, {{the need for a}} better explanation has spurred a number of alternative hypotheses, viz, the tax effect hypothesis (Feldstein, 1980), proxy hypothesis (Fama, 1981), and the reverse causality hypothesis (Geske and Roll, 1983). Empirical studies on these three hypothetical explanations using data from both developed and emerging economies have however produced mixed results, an indication that the debate about the exact relation between stocks and inflation is far from being conclusive. This paper contributes to this burgeoning literature in, at least, three important dimensions. Employing Vector Error Correction Methodology (VCEM), causality was found between inflation and <b>government</b> <b>stocks,</b> with causality running from <b>government</b> <b>stocks</b> to inflation, thus providing evidence in support of the reverse causality hypothesis. The result of the impulse response function was characterized by cyclical fluctuations. This suggests, in part, the need for a tight monetary policy which would help to reduce inflation and stock prices, as such measure would leave the individuals with less money to buy stocks or goods. Such efforts should be complemented and augmenting domestic production and encouraging investment through inexpensive bank finance. </p...|$|E
