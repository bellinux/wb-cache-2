5|$|The {{figure of}} Miriam Yeung, {{unveiled}} on November 2006, {{is the first}} in the world designed to giggle via in-built sensors. Miriam is well known for her fun-loving and bubbly personality, and Madame Tussauds want to capture that essence in <b>her</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frank, Ashley, Rhett {{and several}} other accomplices make a night raid on a shanty town after Scarlett is {{attacked}} while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of <b>her</b> <b>figure,</b> lets Rhett know that she wants no more children {{and that they will}} no longer share a bed.|$|E
5|$|Howard {{was born}} in Long Branch, Ontario in 1926, the younger of two children. Her father, Thomas Howard, a {{secondary}} school teacher, was an English immigrant. Her mother, Helen Mackintosh, who {{was born in}} Winnipeg, was of Scottish ancestry. Having decided early to become an artist, Howard studied at the Ontario College of Art in Toronto from 1948 to 1951, where she was a pupil of Will Ogilvie, who taught <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> drawing, and Jock Macdonald, who taught her painting and composition. In her final year she won the silver medal in drawing and painting.|$|E
50|$|Therefore, <b>her</b> <b>figures</b> {{are almost}} always {{slightly}} stylized and supplemental semantic metaphors, especially in portrait compositions, are often introduced.|$|R
5000|$|From 1994 to 1995 Djurberg {{received}} a Basic Art Education from the Folkuniversitetet in Göteborg. She attended the Hovedskous Art School in Göteborg from 1995 to 1997. During Djurberg’s schooling in Hovedskous she primarily focused on painting. Her painting skills are proven {{with the way}} <b>her</b> plasticine <b>figures</b> are modeled - her prowess gives <b>her</b> <b>figures</b> gestural expressionism. [...] Djurberg received her Master's degree from Malmö Art Academy in 2002.|$|R
60|$|Katharine {{read his}} sheets to an end; Ralph {{followed}} <b>her</b> <b>figures</b> {{as far as}} his mathematics would let him. They came to the end of their tasks at about the same moment, and sat for a time in silence.|$|R
5|$|San Miguel {{has stated}} that she is refraining from {{focusing}} full time on her entertainment career due to her ongoing studies, though she continues to work on <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> in preparation for modeling opportunities. On October 23, 2009, {{she was one of}} the ten finalists in the Philippine qualifying round of the Ford Models Supermodel of the World modeling contest, which was held at the SMX Convention Center in Pasay. She advanced to the top three, but the contest was won by Charlene Almarvez, who went on to win first-runner up to Karlina Caune of the Baltics in the Supermodel of the World finals held in São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In late 1944, Monroe met {{photographer}} David Conover, who {{had been}} sent by the U.S. Army Air Forces' First Motion Picture Unit (FMPU) to the factory to shoot morale-boosting pictures of female workers. Although none of her pictures were used by the FMPU, she quit working at the factory in January 1945 and began modeling for Conover and his friends. She moved out of her in-laws' home, defying them and her husband, and {{signed a contract with}} the Blue Book Model Agency in August 1945. She began to occasionally use the name Jean Norman when working, and had her curly brunette hair straightened and dyed blonde to make her more employable. <b>Her</b> <b>figure</b> was deemed more suitable for pin-up than fashion modeling, and she was featured mostly in advertisements and men's magazines. According to the agency's owner, Emmeline Snively, Monroe was one of its most ambitious and hard-working models; by early 1946, she had appeared on 33 magazine covers for publications such as Pageant, U.S. Camera, Laff, and Peek.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} other death saints in Latin America, such as San La Muerte, Santa Muerte is the only female saint of death in either of the Americas. Iconographically, Santa Muerte is a {{skeleton}} dressed in female clothes or a shroud, and carrying both a scythe and a globe. Santa Muerte is marked out as female not by <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> but by her attire and hair. The latter was introduced by Enriqueta Romero.|$|E

60|$|Hodder was silent, {{overwhelmed}} by the brutal aptness of <b>her</b> <b>figures.</b> Nor did he take the trouble of a defence, of pointing out that hers was not the whole truth. What really mattered--he saw--was what she and those like her thought. Such minds {{were not to be}} disabused by argument; and indeed he had little inclination for it then.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, Deasismont {{received}} {{requests to}} do print modeling and television work {{in addition to}} her musical career. She appeared in a mail-order catalogue for Ellos, and did promotional work for Statoil and the sport store chain Stadium. In December, she appeared as an ice princess on Lassemajas detektivbyrå, a Swedish Christmas series. The show allowed her to demonstrate <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> skating skills. She was the Swedish Spokesperson for the Junior Eurovision Song Contest that year where she gave 12 points to the winners that year (Tolmachevy Sisters with Vesenniy Jazz).|$|E
25|$|Natalie's parents {{separated}} {{early in}} her childhood and she took it badly. She lived with her mother Andrea (Cindy O'Callaghan) in Walford, {{but she had been}} closer to her father, Dave, and missed him terribly. Andrea favoured her other children, especially her older daughter Susie (Viva Duce), over Natalie. She was highly critical of Natalie and blamed her for the breakdown of her marriage (the unwanted pregnancy had ruined <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> and singing career, causing her husband to leave her). Andrea and Susie ridiculed Natalie for missing her father and wanting to keep in touch; Andrea claimed that Dave had no interest in Natalie.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} lack of anecdotal devices, the {{painting}} is unusual in other ways. Bathsheba is presented in a space that is difficult to read. The dark background is suggestive of night, while a massive column implies a large architectural structure. Behind her lies a passage of richly painted drapery composed of browns and ochers that impart a golden warmth. Around her rests a thickly painted background of white chemise; set against this her naked flesh stands out for its solid form and the sumptuous application of paint. The paint used to describe <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> is richly nuanced, its broad brushstrokes and strong highlights impart a vibrant tactile quality to the body, rendering her presence palpable.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, <b>her</b> wax <b>figure</b> was {{unveiled}} at the Musée Grévin in Paris.|$|R
60|$|She {{was in a}} {{dark blue}} costume. He looked at <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} <b>figure.</b>|$|R
50|$|Báez {{has been}} {{influenced}} by the works of European masters, but locates <b>her</b> classically derived <b>figures</b> in Caribbean settings. She references great masters and re-imagines famous female nudes with intent to both disguise the figures and reveal them. Báez's portraits continue to question the idea of the male gaze. She paints women from a female perspective or a personal sense of understanding and which still imply a strong sense of her own identity as a woman. <b>Her</b> <b>figures</b> have been considered part of the field of socially concerned figurative painting.|$|R
25|$|Episode three: Jim and Diane - Jim and Diane {{have been}} {{together}} for twenty-three years, and according to them, there has not been much time for them both looking and feeling good together. Diane was previously a size six stripper and it was that image which first attracted Jim. Diane, now a size sixteen, is a self-conscious woman who hides <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> in tracksuits. After talking and observing, Woodall and Constantine quickly find that the spark that has been lost inside this relationship can be recovered. Diane and Jim are both given a totally new and fresh look and are reunited. Diane and Jim are also treated to some pampering from hair dresser, Richard Ward.|$|E
25|$|Also {{during this}} time, Kelly's {{mother had a}} new baby, Erin, got married, and put Kelly's {{childhood}} home up for sale. Self-consciousness over <b>her</b> <b>figure,</b> along with the anxiety she began to feel, caused her to lash out emotionally, abuse diet pills, and briefly lose control over her life. The character's physical appearance is shown to {{play a part in}} her development. At various points of the series, she won the title of Spring Princess at a dance, and was voted her school's most beautiful girl. Kelly is aware of her appeal, but not to the point of conceit; instead, she is sometimes shown to be troubled by it. At one point, she entered a phase where she felt that no one took her seriously, which was heightened when Dylan gave his manuscript to Andrea for review instead of to her. During this time, she began to feel that people only liked her because she was physically attractive.|$|E
25|$|Episode two: Abdul and Liz - The {{couple in}} episode two, Abdul and Liz, {{have been married}} for eight years. During their married life, their dress sense has become almost {{identical}} and both dress in practical outdoor wear. Their clothing is so similar that they have to write on initials in order to differentiate between their own items. Liz feels that she does not have the knowledge about fashion to dress smartly and loathes clothes shopping. Abdul contacted the show originally, fearing that their clothing has a negative impact on their self-confidence and social life, but Liz however feels {{that they do not have}} a problem. For dinner parties, Abdul is keen to dress smarter, but feels obliged to dress down to match a more casual Liz. Liz has a demanding job, often coping with a sixty-hour week. Soon into Woodall and Constantine's arrival, they discover that Abdul and Liz sleep in separate beds, so as not to disturb each other. When the couple are revealed behind the silhouette screen, Woodall and Constantine see an admirable figure on Liz that has been hidden by her unflattering clothing. In the makeover, Trinny dresses Liz in a fitted trouser suit and waistcoat to accentuate <b>her</b> <b>figure.</b> To give Abdul more youth, Susannah fitts him with a tailored suit and purple shirt.|$|E
50|$|For her, {{art is a}} {{means of}} communication, with most of <b>her</b> pieces <b>figures</b> of men and women {{conveying}} attitudes and emotions through their body language and facial expressions. “I don’t write poems, I model them.” she states. She does not do self-portraits, and <b>her</b> <b>figures</b> look neither at each other (even if intertwined) or at the observer. Instead, they seem introspective. Her non-artistic work in physical fitness, and psychology and physiognomy are evident as well, as she focuses on muscle structure, stating that in the face muscles are actors which control expression. Texture is also important to her work, often a study in contrasts.|$|R
50|$|Gottlieb {{was raised}} in Beverly Hills, California. As a child, she {{suffered}} from anorexia; according to <b>her</b> memoir, Stick <b>Figure,</b> <b>her</b> illness was resolved after being threatened with force-feeding.|$|R

500|$|Similar to many fashion dolls, {{including}} Barbie, Sindy {{has been}} criticised by feminist groups who said <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> set an unrealistic standard for young girls. After Hasbro returned the brand to Pedigree Toys, Pedigree {{responded to the}} backlash against [...] "cosmetically enhanced bimbo" [...] dolls by making Sindy more wholesome and less shapely.|$|E
500|$|Perry is {{considered}} a sex symbol; GQ labelled her a [...] "full-on male fantasy", while Elle described her body [...] "as though sketched by a teenage boy". Vice described her as a [...] "'serious' popstar/woman/sex symbol". She was placed at {{number one on the}} Maxim Hot 100 in 2010 as the [...] "most beautiful woman in the world", with editor Joe Levy describing her as a [...] "triple– no quadruple– kind of hot". Men's Health readers voted her the [...] "sexiest woman of 2013". In November 2010, Perry told Harper's Bazaar that she was proud of and satisfied with <b>her</b> <b>figure.</b>|$|E
500|$|Xue Susu ( [...] ; {{also known}} as Xue Wu, Xuesu, Sunjung among other pen names) (15641650? C.E.) was a Chinese courtesan. Known {{as one of the}} [...] "Eight Great Courtesans of the Ming Dynasty", she was an {{accomplished}} painter and poet, and was noted for her skill at mounted archery. She was particularly noted for <b>her</b> <b>figure</b> paintings, which included many Buddhist subjects. Her works are held in a number of museums both in China and elsewhere. Her archery was commented upon by a number of contemporary writers, as were her masculine, martial tendencies; these were regarded as an attractive feature by the literati of the period.|$|E

50|$|Cutler's {{style is}} {{characterized}} by intricate and linear figurative drawings, <b>her</b> <b>figured</b> are often depicted with elongated noses teapot heads, and broomstick arms. Cutler's painting work features negative space frequently around her characters, showing her desire to “...get rid of the background”, which she credits for her choice to switch from painting on wood to primarily painting with gouache on paper.|$|R
500|$|Clothing {{played an}} {{important}} factor in Monroe's star image. She often wore white to emphasize her blondness, and drew attention by wearing revealing outfits that showed off <b>her</b> <b>figure.</b> Her publicity stunts often revolved around her clothing that exposed large amounts of her body or even a wardrobe malfunction, such as when one of the shoulder straps of her dress suddenly snapped during a press conference. In press stories, Monroe was portrayed as the embodiment of the American Dream, a girl who had risen from a miserable childhood to Hollywood stardom. [...] In her studio biographies, stories of her time spent in foster families and an orphanage were exaggerated and even partly fabricated.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Nomura had {{difficulty}} {{deciding whether to}} go with a miniskirt or long pants. Seeking input, he passed his sketches around Square's offices, and the majority of the staff members approved of the miniskirt design. This additionally served as a contrast to Aerith, whose [...] "Long Skirt" [...] was her trademark. The attire was explained in respect to the game as giving her freedom of movement, due to her affinity with hand-to-hand combat, and the skirt, referred to as [...] "quite short [...] giving a considerable degree of exposure," [...] was kept as a staple of her alternate costumes. The developers additionally noted that due to <b>her</b> <b>figure,</b> her otherwise plain garments took on a pleasant appearance.|$|E
500|$|In 40 years, nearly 100 million Sindy dolls {{were sold}} in Britain alone, and in 2003, Sindy was relaunched for her 40th birthday. <b>Her</b> <b>figure</b> was changed to more closely {{resemble}} the girls the doll is marketed towards. Denise Deane, the head of design and development at New Moons, the new Sindy manufacturer, said, [...] "She's lost the big breasts and very long legs, and we've completely changed her face. She's totally unrecognisable. Sindy's still very popular, but she has been neglected {{over the last few}} years, and we don't think people are identifying with that look. She's going to look like a 15-year-old, and we've designed her to wear trainers." [...] The doll was released in two versions: six-inch and full-size.|$|E
