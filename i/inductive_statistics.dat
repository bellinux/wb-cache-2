40|$|Below we will {{consider}} the relations between <b>inductive</b> logic and <b>statistics.</b> More specifically, we will show that some concepts and methods of inductive logic may be applied in the rational reconstruction of several statistical notions and procedures and that, in addition, inductive logic suggests some new methods {{which can be used}} for different kinds of statistical inference. Although there are several approaches to <b>inductive</b> logic and <b>statistics,</b> here we will focus on some versions of the Bayesian approach and, thereby, on the relations between Bayesian inductive logic and Bayesian statistics. The paper is organized as follows. The subjects of <b>inductive</b> logic and <b>statistics</b> will be shortly illustrated in Section 1, where it will be suggested that statistics {{can be seen as a}} special field of inductive logic. Two important theories developed within Bayesian inductive logic are the theory of inductive probabilities, started by Rudolf Carnap in the forties of the past century, and the theory of confirmation: the conceptual relations between such theories and statistics will be considered in Section 2. A recent version of Bayesian inductive logic, proposed by Ilkka Niiniluoto and others, has been developed by using the notion of verisimilitude, introduced in philosophy of science by Karl Popper; the key ideas of the verisimilitudinarian version of Bayesian inductive logic will be illustrated in Section 3, where it will be argued that it provides useful conceptual tools for the analysis of some important kinds of statistical inference...|$|R
40|$|There {{are strong}} {{parallels}} between <b>statistics</b> and <b>inductive</b> logic. An inductive logic {{is a system}} of inference that describes the relation between propositions on data, and propositions that extend beyond the data, such as predictions over future data, and general conclusions on data. Statistics, on the other hand, is a mathematical discipline that describes procedures for deriving results about a population from sample data. These results include decisions on rejecting or accepting a hypothesis about the population, the determination of probability assignments over such hypotheses, predictions on future samples, and so on. Both <b>inductive</b> logic and <b>statistics</b> are calculi for getting from the given data to propositions or results that transcend the data. Despite this fact, <b>inductive</b> logic and <b>statistics</b> have evolved more or less separately. This is partly because there are objections to viewing statistics, especially classical statistical procedures, as inferential. A more important reason, to my mind, is that inductive logic {{has been dominated by}} the Carnapian programme, and that statisticians have perhaps not recognised Carnapian inductive logic as...|$|R

5000|$|Descriptive {{statistics}} are statistics that quantitatively describe or summarize {{features of a}} collection of information. Descriptive {{statistics are}} distinguished from inferential statistics (or <b>inductive</b> <b>statistics),</b> in that descriptive statistics aim to summarize a sample, rather than use the data to learn about the population that the sample of data is thought to represent. This generally means that descriptive statistics, unlike inferential statistics, are not developed on the basis of probability theory. [...] Even when a data analysis draws its main conclusions using inferential statistics, descriptive statistics are generally also presented. For example, in papers reporting on human subjects, typically a table is included giving the overall sample size, sample sizes in important subgroups (e.g., for each treatment or exposure group), and demographic or clinical characteristics such as the average age, the proportion of subjects of each sex, the proportion of subjects with related comorbidities etc.|$|E

40|$|Descriptive, {{inductive}} {{and decision}} theory approaches to statistics {{are discussed in}} this paper. According to the author, the contrast between descriptive and <b>inductive</b> <b>statistics</b> is artificial since any description of the reality constitutes in fact an induction. In the words of Boldrini (1942) "every statistic, even one that seems documentary, has an investigative preoccupation and therefore, above all, an hypothesis". However, the author is doubtful also about <b>inductive</b> <b>statistics</b> conceived as a methodology of knowledge. Concerning the philosophy or pragmatism, it is worth while noticing that the interpretation due to Smith (1984) does not fit for any pragmatist in general and even less for its founders. In {{the last part of}} the paper, the functions of statistics are once more discussed from a neo-rationalistic viewpoint and a distinction between the process of analysis bringing forth to discovery and the operative process of decision is posed. The same application of probability in statistics is contested. Indeed, probability is an analytic tool we may use to explore hypotheses.

The methodological demarcation between rejection of a statistical statement, because it is “false”, or its exclusion, because it is “less probable”, lies in the fundamental premises of inferential procedures. In the first class we find the methods proposed by Fisher and Neyman and Pearson; in the second one, the Bayesian techniques.

40|$|P-values are not Error Probabilities Confusion {{surrounding}} the reporting {{and interpretation of}} results of classical statistical tests is widespread among applied researchers. The confusion {{stems from the fact}} that most of these researchers are unaware of the historical development of classical statistical testing methods, and the mathematical and philosophical principles underlying them. Moreover, researchers erroneously believe that the interpretation of such tests is prescribed by a single coherent theory of statistical inference. This is not the case: Classical statistical testing is an anonymous hybrid of the competing and frequently contradictory approaches formulated by R. A.

In particular, there is a widespread failure to appreciate the incompatibility of Fisher’s evidential p value with the Type I error rate, α, of Neyman–Pearson statistical orthodoxy.

Instead, it reflects the fundamental differences between Fisher’s ideas on significance testing and inductive inference, and Neyman–Pearson views of hypothesis testing and <b>inductive</b> behavior.

40|$|Debriefing, the {{reflective}} activity following an experiential learning exercise, {{has been identified}} as {{the most important part of}} simulation learning and is also important for learning in other activities utilized in nursing education. There is general agreement that debriefing provides learning and improves performance. However, there is little specific evidence about the phenomenon of learning acquired during debriefing, including how it occurs, how it is defined and identified, and how it is evaluated by debriefing facilitators. In addition, there are no instruments or tools specifically measuring learning acquired during debriefing. Without practical and theoretically grounded tools, simulation activities will continue to lack the element of objective assessment necessary to move evidence-based teaching practices forward. A measure of learning acquired during debriefing, independent of a specific debriefing method and across debriefing types, will aid in the design of future simulation debriefing research that is both rigorous and feasible. To inform future tool development, I conducted a qualitative descriptive study to provide initial evidence regarding the learning acquired during debriefing. Following Institutional Review Board approval, I conducted 17 semi-structured interviews of nurse educators who facilitate debriefing in pre-licensure nursing programs. The interviews were transcribed and data analysis was completed to provide answers to the research questions using simple descriptive <b>statistics,</b> <b>inductive</b> reasoning processes and content analysis to interpret and structure meaning from the interviews. Study results included the nurse educators’ verbatim definitions of learning as well as simple descriptions of how they measured the learning acquired during debriefing. Qualitative themes emerging from the interviews describe how nurse educators recognize when students are learning during debriefing; these themes also describe activities that the nurse educators used to promote student learning during debriefing. Nurse educators identified that nursing students are learning during debriefing when they express what they have learned directly, connect past and present learning, plan for future practice experiences, share with peers, experience the “Ah-ha” moment, critically review their actions, display excitement and engagement during debriefing, apply their simulation learning in subsequent clinical and simulation experiences, and display learning in formal and informal assessments. Nurse educators described many activities they used to promote learning when they facilitated debriefings. These activities included utilizing simulation preparation activities, aligning their debriefing practices with a specific debriefing method or learning theory, utilizing intentional debriefing, establishing safety, maintaining a supportive demeanor, encouraging student-led debriefing, engaging the student learner, using debriefing aids, promoting recognition of learning, facilitating to the level of the learner, attending to the debriefing environment, and providing post-debriefing activities. I will use the results of this study to inform future development of an instrument intended to measure learning acquired during debriefing.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{discusses}} {{the implementation of}} a new e-learning environment that supports non-rote learning of exploratory and <b>inductive</b> <b>statistics</b> within the pedagogical paradigm of social constructivism. The e-learning system is based on a new computational framework that allows us to create an electronic research environment where students are empowered to interact with reproducible computations from peers and the educator. The underlying technology effectively supports social interaction (communication), knowledge construction, collaboration, and scientific experimentation even if the student population is very large. In addition, the system allows us to measure important aspects of the actual learning process which are otherwise unobservable. With this new information it is possible to explore (and investigate) the effectiveness of e-based learning, the impact of software usability, and the importance of knowledge construction through various feedback and communication mechanisms. Based on a preliminary empirical analysis from two courses (with large student populations) it is shown that there are strong relationships between actual constructivist learning activities and scores on objective examinations, in which the questions assess conceptual understanding. It is also explained that non-rote learning is supported {{by the fact that the}} system allows users to reproduce results and reuse them in derived research that can be easily communicated...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: After {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), {{individuals}} are typically considered {{by the general public}} to be asexual. Handicapped women have more problems with socio-sexual adaptation, stemming from low self-confidence, low self-esteem, and the absence of spontaneity. Aims: To determine changes in the sexual lives of women after SCI. Methods: A self-constructed questionnaire was used to map sexual function after SCI. We retrospectively compared sexual function in 30 women with SCI with that in 30 without SCI who led an active sexual life. Descriptive and <b>inductive</b> <b>statistics</b> were applied using the Student paired and non-paired t-tests and the Levene test. Main Outcome Measures: The main variables were presence vs absence of sexual dysfunction in a group of women after SCI and a comparison of the incidence of sexual dysfunctions in women after SCI with that of a control group. Results: A significant difference was ascertained in women with SCI in sexual desire (P <. 001), lubrication (P <. 001), and reaching orgasm before and after injury (P =. 030). A comparison of the two groups showed {{a significant difference in the}} realization of coital sexual activity (P <. 001), erotogenous zones of the mouth (P = . 016), nipples (P =. 022), and genitals (P <. 001), and in the ability to reach orgasm (P =. 033). The negative impact of incontinence on the sexual life of women with SCI proved significant (P <. 001). Negative factors for sexual activity in women with SCI were lower sensitivity in 16 (53 %), spasms and mobility problems in 12 (40 %), lower desire in 11 (36 %), pain in 4 (13 %), and a less accommodating partner in 3 (10 %). Conclusion: Intercourse was the preferred sexual activity in women with SCI. Compared with the period before injury, there was significant lowering of sexual desire, impaired lubrication, and orgasmic ability after SCI. A comparison of the two groups showed a difference in erotogenous zones and in reaching orgasm. Sramkova T, Skrivanova K, Dolan I, et al. Women's Sex Life After Spinal Cord Injury.

40|$|Bushfire is, {{in terms}} of human lives lost, {{property}} destroyed, and damage to natural systems, by far the most urgent environmental problem in Australia. This thesis tries to answer a number of questions about bushfire behaviour, history, effects, and management, in the Wungong Catchment of Western Australia. It does so by an overtly cross-disciplinary approach, involving a mixture of the three main streams of human knowledge, namely the humanities, natural science, and social science. First, I offer a literature review of several hundred books and papers drawn from the three main streams of knowledge mentioned above. The review includes some discussion of ‘bushfire epistemology’, a currently vague and neglected matter. The concept of ‘place’ is important to humans, so I then give a straightforward geographical description of Wungong Catchment, with some mention of the history of bushfire. To describe the vegetation, I use <b>inductive</b> <b>statistics,</b> and a method developed by me from the ideas of Delaunay (1929) and Dirichlet (1850). Given that there are hundreds of plant species within the catchment, I use a landscape approach, and only sketch the main tree species, and two iconic plants, the balga and the djiridji, both of which are important to the original custodians of the catchment, the Nyoongar people. There is discussion of other people’s research into the effect of bushfire on seed banks, and the flowering intervals of some plants of the jarrah forest. To see if Western Australia is anomalous, or fits into the worldwide pattern of humans using fire as a landscape management tool, I then examine some records of bushfire in other lands, including Africa, Madagascar, India, and Europe. The thesis then looks at the history of fire in the jarrah forest of Western Australia, based on observations by early European explorers and settlers from 1826 onward, the views of various foresters, and some opinions of current Nyoongar Elders. Using a mixture of natural science, applied mathematics, and archaeology, I give the results of cleaning the stems of those ancient plants called grasstrees, or balga (Xanthorrhoea spp.). These carry the marks of former bushfires, stretching back to 1750. They confirm historical reports of frequent fire in the jarrah forest, at 2 - 4 year intervals, and a recent decline in fire frequency. This contradicts the view, held by some, that European arrival increased the frequency of fire. As support for the balga findings, I present a simple mathematical model of self-organization in bushfire mosaics. It shows how lengthy bushfire exclusion can lead to disastrous situations, in which large areas of landscape become flammable and unstable. It shows how frequent, patchy burning can maintain a stable bushfire mosaic, with mild, beneficial fires. In the next chapter, I offer mathematical suggestions on how current unstable mosaics can be restabilized, by careful reintroduction of such burning. In dry, south-western Australia, water supply is an important topic, and {{a better understanding of the}} hydrological effects of bushfire may help with both bushfire and water management. I draw upon the natural science of forest hydrology, and the effects of fire in catchments. The evidence comes not only from Australia, but also from the United States, and South Africa. Turning to social science, I introduce Professor Peter Checkland’s ‘Soft Systems Methodology’, and suggest how it could be applied in resolving complicated conflict about bushfire management. I finish in legal style, with a summing up, and a verdict on the use of bushfire as a land management tool in Wungong Catchment, and possibly in other flammable landscapes...|$|E
