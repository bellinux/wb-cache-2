5|$|George Pickingill (c. 1816 – 10 April 1909) was an English <b>farm</b> <b>labourer</b> {{who lived}} and worked in the village of Canewdon in the eastern English county of Essex. Widely {{considered}} to be a cunning man, or vocational folk magician, he reportedly employed magical means to offer cures for ailments and to locate lost property, although was also alleged to have threatened to place curses on people.|$|E
5|$|Hart {{was born}} at Taratahi, a small {{community}} near Carterton in the Wairarapa region. His father, William, was a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer</b> and the grandson of John Hart, a three-time Premier of South Australia. One of four children, he was educated firstly at Dalefield School, and then Carterton School. After finishing his formal education he worked for his uncle, an auctioneer and land broker, while also studying bookkeeping.|$|E
5|$|Born into a rural working-class family, Pickingill {{grew up in}} Hockley, Essex and was baptised {{into the}} Church of England. Working as a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer,</b> in 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman in Gravesend, Kent. The couple moved back to Essex, settled in Canewdon and had four children. Pickingill's wife died in 1887, and in later life he {{attracted}} limited press attention for his claim {{to be one of}} the oldest men in England. These claims also appeared in his obituaries, although were later shown to be incorrect.|$|E

5|$|Brooks {{was born}} on 23 February 1876 at Draycott Moor near Faringdon, {{the son of a}} <b>farm</b> <b>labourer.</b> He grew up near Windsor, Berkshire, where his father {{afterwards}} worked in the Great Park, and as a child frequently encountered members of the Royal Family. After leaving school in 1890, he worked as a boy on the estates, where one of his duties was to look after a mule given to Queen Victoria by Lord Kitchener. In 1892 he enlisted in the 3rd Dragoon Guards, and after leaving the army joined the Glamorganshire Yeomanry as a volunteer.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta {{was born}} to Kikuyu farmers in Kiambu, British East Africa. Educated at a mission school, he worked in various jobs before {{becoming}} politically engaged through the Kikuyu Central Association. In 1929, he travelled to London to lobby for Kikuyu tribal land affairs. During the 1930s he studied at Moscow's Communist University of the Toilers of the East, University College London, and the London School of Economics. In 1938 he published an anthropological study of Kikuyu life before working as a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer</b> in Sussex during the Second World War. Influenced by his friend George Padmore, he embraced anti-colonialist and Pan-African ideas, co-organising the 1945 Pan-African Congress in Manchester. In 1946, he returned to Kenya and became a school principal. In 1947 he was elected President of the Kenya African Union, through which he lobbied for independence from British colonial rule, attracting widespread indigenous support yet animosity from white settlers. In 1952, {{he was among the}} Kapenguria Six arrested and charged with masterminding the anti-colonial Mau Mau Uprising. Although protesting his innocence—a view shared by later historians—he was convicted. He remained imprisoned at Lokitaung until 1959 and then exiled in Lodwar until 1961.|$|E
5|$|Rush {{arrived in}} Sydney in 1861 {{at the age}} of 16, an {{assisted}} immigrant brought to augment Australia's mostly agricultural workforce. Rush was a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer,</b> who knew nothing of boats or boating, but within ten years of his arrival in Australia, Rush was Champion Sculler of the Clarence River, as well as a selector, cattle-raiser and butcher. His interest in the sport of rowing dominated Rush's life, and hampered his prosperity. He repeatedly travelled from his Clarence River home to compete for large money prizes on Sydney's Parramatta River, neglecting his business affairs. Rush became Champion Sculler of Australia in 1873, and defended his championship several times, not always successfully. Rush succeeded on a few occasions in having the Championship venue moved from Sydney to the Clarence River, the first to shift the focus of sculling away from the capital city. From 1874, there was talk of Rush travelling to England to compete for the World Sculling Championship, but this did not eventuate. Instead, Edward Trickett won the World Championship on the Thames in 1876. Rush and Trickett in 1877 competed on the Parramatta River for the World Championship, but Rush lost this race.|$|E

40|$|This book {{examines}} the living conditions of <b>farm</b> <b>labourers</b> in Trans Nzoia, one of Kenya's large-scale farming districts. Based {{on a study}} conducted in 1989 among large farmers and <b>farm</b> <b>labourers,</b> an overview is given of wages, provisions, the various sources of income, the inportance of social networks and the nutritional status of different groups of <b>farm</b> <b>labourers.</b> From the data presented {{it appears that the}} extent to which households depend on the large farm owners for their livelihood largely determines their economic position. But the interdependency has its costs. The more the labourers' households are tied {{to the land of the}} farm owner for both income and own food production, the more difficulties they face in satisfying even their basic need...|$|R

He left no personal papers and very {{little is known about}} his youth (so little, indeed, that reference works published during his lifetime, and shortly after his death, continued to give the year of his birth as 1887). He had little education, and worked from an early age as a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer.</b> By 1907 he had moved to Melbourne, where he worked as a fruiterer in Northcote.|$|E
25|$|James Cook {{was born}} on 7 November 1728 (N.S.) {{in the village of}} Marton in Yorkshire and baptised on 14 November (N.S.) in the parish church of St Cuthbert, where his name {{can be seen in the}} church register. He was the second of eight {{children}} of James Cook, a Scottish <b>farm</b> <b>labourer</b> from Ednam in Roxburghshire, and his locally born wife, Grace Pace, from Thornaby-on-Tees. In 1736, his family moved to Airey Holme farm at Great Ayton, where his father's employer, Thomas Skottowe, paid for him to attend the local school. In 1741, after five years' schooling, he began work for his father, who had been promoted to farm manager. For leisure, he would climb a nearby hill, Roseberry Topping, enjoying the opportunity for solitude. Cooks' Cottage, his parents' last home, which he is likely to have visited, is now in Melbourne, Australia, having been moved from England and reassembled, brick by brick, in 1934.|$|E
25|$|MacDonald {{was born}} at Gregory Place, Lossiemouth, Morayshire, Scotland, the illegitimate son of John MacDonald, a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer,</b> and Anne Ramsay, a housemaid. Registered at birth as James McDonald (sic) Ramsay, {{he was known as}} Jaimie MacDonald. Illegitimacy could be a serious {{handicap}} in 19th-century Presbyterian Scotland, but in the north and northeast farming communities, this was less of a problem; in 1868, a report of the Royal Commission on the Employment of Children, Young Persons and Women in Agriculture noted that the illegitimacy rate was around 15%, meaning that nearly every sixth person was born out of wedlock. MacDonald's mother had worked as a domestic servant at Claydale farm, near Alves, where his father was also employed. They were to have been married, but the wedding never took place, either because the couple quarrelled and chose not to marry, or because Anne's mother, Isabella Ramsay, stepped in to prevent her daughter from marrying a man she deemed unsuitable.|$|E

He stayed at the gamekeeper's cottage and spent the days walking in the estate's woods, collecting wild flowers.

Treves called this [...] "the one supreme holiday of [...] life", although in fact there were three such trips.|$|E

500|$|It is {{apparent}} from census data that Pickingill {{lived with his}} parents from 1816 until the 1830s, {{although it is not}} stated where he was living {{at the time of the}} 1841 census. In 1851, he was recorded as lodging in the household of David Clemens in Little Wakering, Essex, and describing himself as a <b>farm</b> <b>labourer</b> by profession. On 18 May 1856 he married Sarah Ann Bateman at St George's Church, an Anglican church in Gravesend, Kent. In that record, both Pickingill and Bateman described themselves as residing in Gravesend, and Pickingill declared that he was working as a labourer; no profession was listed for Bateman. Bateman was born c.1831 in Tillingham, Essex, as the daughter of Joseph Bateman and his wife Mary Ann Aggus; throughout married life, she identified as [...] "Mary Ann Pickingill" [...] and appeared as [...] "Sarah Ann Pittengale" [...] in her burial record.|$|E
