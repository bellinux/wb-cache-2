2500|$|While Legends {{is largely}} {{the same game}} as the Dreamcast original, a number of changes and {{improvements}} were made due to the new hardware of the Gamecube, leading Sega to describe it as a [...] "Director's Cut". The game partially used the original game's code, and partially uses newly written code for the Gamecube. As such, the game looks largely the same graphically, although some minor improvements, such as slightly more detailed character models and less drops in the game's frame rate, are implemented into the release. Some changes were made {{due to differences in}} hardware - with the Gamecube lacking the Dreamcast's VMU, some effects, like Cupils notifications, were moved to the television screen, while other aspects, like the [...] "Pinta Quest" [...] minigame, was removed outright. With the Gamecube being less-readily <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> internet, the Dreamcast version's downloadable content was implemented into the main game rather than being accessed through downloading. Loading times were also reduced.|$|E
2500|$|Electric violins have a {{magnetic}} or piezoelectric pickup that converts string vibration to an electric signal. A patch cable or wireless transmitter sends {{the signal to}} an amplifier of a PA system. Electric violins are usually constructed as such, but a pickup {{can be added to}} a conventional acoustic violin. An electric violin with a resonating body that produces listening-level sound independently of the electric elements can be called an electro-acoustic violin. To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, and often resemble an acoustic violin or fiddle. [...] The body may be finished in bright colors and made from alternative materials to wood. These violins may need to be hooked up to an instrument amplifier or PA system. [...] Some types come with a silent option that allows the player to use headphones that are <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> violin. The first specially built electric violins date back to 1928 and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, Benjamin Miessner, George Beauchamp, Hugo Benioff and Fredray Kislingbury. These violins can be plugged into effect units, just like an electric guitar, including distortion, wah-wah pedal and reverb. Since electric violins do not rely on string tension and resonance to amplify their sound they can have more strings. For example, five-stringed electric violins are available from several manufacturers, and a seven string electric violin (with three lower strings encompassing the cello's range) is also available. The majority of the first electric violinists were musicians playing jazz fusion (e.g., Jean-Luc Ponty) and popular music.|$|E

2500|$|Infrastructure {{work now}} began in Marshall Heights. A city survey in 1949 found that just 30 {{percent of all}} homes in Marshall Heights had access to running water and the city sewer system. City {{engineers}} estimated in May 1950 {{that it would take}} $2 million to give the 500 homes in Marshall Heights water and sewer lines, and to grade and pave every street. But with an annual infrastructure budget of just $1 million a year for the entire city, they said improvements in Marshall Heights would take time. Nevertheless, the District agreed to spend $320,000 on water and sewer mains, and paving secondary streets, in 1950 alone. Paving of main streets, and adding sidewalks, curbs, and gutters was not planned, as this was not deemed urgent. By November, 30 homes on five blocks between E. 50th and E. 51st Streets had received water and sewer mains. Another $100,000 was spent on Marshall Heights infrastructure in 1952. By the end of 1952, 134 homes in Marshall Heights had water and sewer. But only 72 homeowners had actually <b>hooked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> system. City officials said the cost of a hookup, which ran from $1,000 to $1,500, and the $135 frontage fee were simply too high for most residents to afford. The city had the option of going to court to force residents to hookup and pay the frontage fee, but officials said this was useless because residents simply didn't have the income. Spending large amounts of money on Marshall Heights deeply angered some city officials. William H. Cary, Jr., director of the D.C. Bureau of Public Health Engineering, claimed, [...] "This will never be a place the District government will be proud of." [...] But work continued, and additional street grading and water and sewer lines were laid in 1957. [...] To counteract criticism that Marshall Heights residents didn't care about their neighborhood, the Marshall Heights Civic Association engaged in a two-month-long campaign to remove trash and weeds, sweep streets, improve empty lots, and generally eliminate blight from the neighborhood. The campaign won extensive media notice. The city spent a total of $700,000 on roads and water and sewer lines by the end of 1958.|$|E

25|$|In a {{conventional}} design with a pressurized core, refuelling the system requires <b>the</b> core <b>to</b> {{shut down and}} <b>the</b> pressure vessel <b>to</b> be opened.

In modern systems, two robotic machines <b>hook</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> reactor faces and open the end caps of a pressure tube. One machine pushes in the new fuel, whereby the depleted fuel is pushed out and collected at the other end. A significant operational advantage of online refuelling is that a failed or leaking fuel bundle can {{be removed from the}} core once it has been located, thus reducing the radiation levels in the primary cooling loop.|$|R
