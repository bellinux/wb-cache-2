Discussed next are methods used after feedings are initiated to determine if the tube has remained in the desired position in the gastrointestinal tract. Some of the methods are research-based, whereas others are opinion-based. The level of accuracy of the methods discussed in the review varies widely.

One hundred sixteen patients had either weighted (61 patients) or unweighted (55 patients) 10 F silicone elastomer <b>feeding</b> tubes <b>inserted</b> nasally 85 cm. Tubes were placed with wire stylets. Tube positions were verified radiographically within 4 hr after insertions. Radiographs were repeated daily for 3 days or until duodenal intubation occurred. Successful duodenal intubations were achieved in 35 patients (57 %) with weighted feeding tubes and in 37 patients (67 %) with unweighted feeding tubes. This difference was not significant.

40|$|Background: Our aim is {{to share}} our {{experiences}} regarding patients who cannot be fed effectively through the gastrostomy tube, but were <b>inserted</b> <b>feeding</b> jejunostomy through the gastrostomy orifice using scopic fluoroscopic techniques utilised by the interventional radiology. Patients and Methods: Between January 2010 and May 2013 the patients that were inserted jejunostomy tube through the gastrostomy orifice using fluoroscopic techniques were retrospectively analysed. Data including primary indication for gastrostomy, sex, concomitant disease and the requirement for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) were all recorded. Results: There were five patients with these criteria. They all received either medical or surgical GERD therapy; nevertheless enteral feeding failed to reach an effective level, they all had vomiting and did not gain any weight. Following conversion, all the patients gained minimum 2 kg in 2 - 5 months; all the patients tolerated enteral feeding and were discharged in the early period. There were neither procedure related complications such as perforation, bleeding nor sedation related complications. Procedure took no more than 30 min as a whole. There {{was no need for}} surgical intervention. However in one patient re-intervention was required due to accidental removal of the catheter. Conclusions: In case of feeding difficulties following the gastrostomy; instead of an invasive surgical intervention; physicians should consider jejunal feeding that is advanced through the gastrostomy, which does not require any anaesthesia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Dysphagia is {{a common}} {{presentation}} in older people. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis affecting the cervical spine is an uncommon cause of dysphagia and may be overlooked. Case presentation We present {{the case of an}} 88 -year-old man with dysphagia and weight loss. Initial investigation with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was inconclusive. A diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis as a cause for dysphagia was eventually made using video fluoroscopy. This showed a bony prominence impeding swallow at the level of C 3. The patient was unfit for surgical management so a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube was <b>inserted</b> for <b>feeding.</b> Conclusion The diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis involving the cervical spine often goes unrecognised as a cause of dysphagia despite its prevalence in the elderly population. Diagnosis is made using cervical radiographs, barium swallow and computed tomography. There is a risk of perforation with endoscopy in patients who have cervical diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis. Conservative management includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications and a modified diet. Surgery may be considered in certain patients where conservative management fails. </p...|$|R

This is the question that is raised by recent legal action {{in the case of}} 13 -year old Jahi McMath, certified dead on the basis of neurological criteria but maintained in mechanical ventilation and medical/nursing care since then at the insistence of the parents who claim she is alive. In this brief discussion, the medical and legal issues are reviewed. Here the argument is advanced {{that this is not a}} case that means there should be a re-evaluation of the neurological criteria for determination of brain death. Instead, this case is to be understood as the exception that proves the rule. Case Scenario: In late 2013, then 13 -year old Jahi McMath underwent complicated throat surgery, suffered severe blood loss that lead to an anoxic-ischemic event, and was declared “brain dead ” while a patient at Children’s Hospital in Oakland California (USA). She was pronounced “dead ” on the basis of brain death (neurological) criteria valid in the State of California.
