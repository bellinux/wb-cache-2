40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{relates to}} the field of “smart textiles”. A new type of knitted strain sensing elements (knitted resistive fabric (KRF)) which can be integrated in the smart garment was developed. KRF was produced from conductive resistive, nonconductive isolating and nonconductive elastomeric yarns. <b>Elastomeric</b> <b>yarn</b> was used as the base yarn and was knitted within the whole fabric, but isolating and resistive yarns (functional yarns) were used as face yarns and knitted in specific sequence. Electrical model of KRF is proposed to describe the behavior of sensing element. The developed KRF has high sensitivity to strain deformation and can be used as local strain sensor or distributed resistive sensing field to control deformation of human body parts, joint motion, respiration etc...|$|E
40|$|Numerous studies {{around the}} world {{emphasize}} the unconditional impact of compression therapy as prevention of varicose veins, of trophic ulcers healing and other problems. Therefore, {{the development of new}} knitted materials for prevention and rehabilitation of anatomical forms and functions of the human body is an important issue as for medicians as for textile researchers. The purpose of this research work is to study the structure parameters and the properties of compression hosiery for compliance with the standard requirements and for providing the necessary therapeutic effect. The compression stockings for women have been produced on circular knitting machine «Lonati» (Italy) with a special supply for <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarn.</b> The single backed weft knitting have been chosen for stocking manufacturing. Researches of structures parameters and deformation characteristics of stretch fabric, as well as an influence of wet-heat treatments on the properties of compression hosiery have been carried out.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the research undertaken at the University of Minho aiming {{to study the}} influence of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarns</b> upon Shape Memory Alloy wires behaviour, {{in order to produce}} dynamic structures as a support to answer specific situations and applications. Several samples were produced using flexinol® NiTi wires in combination with <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarns,</b> varying the numbers of yarns (1, 2 and 4) and diameters (285, 420 and 620 dtex) in the samples. The Tensile tests were carried out being based to NP EN ISO 2062 : 1993 standards, using a H 100 KS Hounsfield Universal Testing Instrument. The results showed that force taken by the group can be increased by increasing the number of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarns,</b> or by increasing the linear density of the <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarns.</b> Also, we concluded that an increase in temperature gradient, caused changes in the settings 1 to 4 when used 285 dtex yarn, increasing the force supported...|$|R
40|$|Seamfree {{knitted garment}} {{technology}} {{is one of}} the fastest growing apparel technologies in the world. Currently, products marketed in this product category are mainly produced by a cut stitch shape method that involves knitting tubular fabric blanks without side seams relating to the size and parts of the garment to be made. The paper addresses the aspects of “body zoning” for active sportswear and performance wear, the approach to introducing stretch to achieve better garment fit; and characteristics and limitations of the finishing processes required to finish seamless garments containing <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarns.</b> Also some aspects of different fibre characteristics and suitability, fabric construction engineering and selection will be considered...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{development}} of textile-based strain sensors has been a focus of research and many investigators have studied this subject. This paper presents a new textile-based strain sensor design and shows the effect of base fabric parameters on its sensing properties. Sensing fabric {{could be used to}} measure articulations of the human body in the real environment. The strain sensing fabric was produced by using electronic flat-bed knitting technology; the base fabric was produced with <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarns</b> in an interlock arrangement and a conductive yarn was embedded in this substrate to create a series of single loop structures. Experimental results show that there is a strong relationship between base fabric parameters and sensor properties...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the sensing properties exhibited by textile-based knitted strain sensors. Knitted sensors were manufactured using flat-bed knitting technology, and electro-mechanical tests were subsequently performed on the specimens using a tensile testing machine to apply strain whilst the sensor was incorporated into a Wheatstone bridge arrangement to allow electrical monitoring. The sensing fabrics were manufactured from silver-plated nylon and elastomeric yarns. The component yarns offered similar diameters, bending characteristics and surface friction, but their production parameters differed in respect of the required yarn input tension, the number of conductive courses in the sensing structure and the <b>elastomeric</b> <b>yarn</b> extension characteristics. Experimental results showed that these manufacturing controls significantly affected the sensing properties of the knitted structures such that the gauge factor values, the working range and the linearity of the sensors varied according to the knitted structure. These results confirm that production parameters play a fundamental role in determining the physical behavior and the sensing properties of knitted sensors. It is thus possible to manipulate the sensing properties of knitted sensors and the sensor response may be engineered by varying the production parameters applied to specific designs...|$|E

Several samples were produced using Nitinol® wires in different diameters and loop types.

The results showed that The 50 μm wire showed to be too thin to this propose; moreover, The 210 μm NiTi wire showed to be hard to process on the knitting machine due to its high stiffness; The 127 μm NiTi wire showed to be the best among them, due to the process and energy absorption ratio. Finally, for both NiTi wires in different diameters studied, tuck loop showed to have the highest energy absorption capacity...|$|R

The current {{investigation}} is aimed at structure of covered yarn, which consists of polyurethane <b>elastomeric</b> multifilament core <b>yarn</b> and of two viscose multifilament yarns.
