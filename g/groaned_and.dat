5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers <b>groaned</b> <b>and</b> sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In two or three minutes the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
500|$|Historian George Herring {{argues that}} Adams {{was the most}} independent-minded of the founders. Though he aligned with the Federalists, he was {{somewhat}} a party unto himself, disagreeing with the Federalists {{as much as he}} did the Democratic-Republicans. He was often described as [...] "prickly", but his tenacity was fed by good decisions made in the face of universal opposition. Adams was often combative, which diminished presidential decorum, as Adams himself admitted in his old age: [...] " [...] I refused to suffer in silence. I sighed, sobbed, and <b>groaned,</b> <b>and</b> sometimes screeched and screamed. And I must confess to my shame and sorrow that I sometimes swore." [...] Adams' resolve to advance peace with France, rather than to continue hostilities, especially reduced his popularity. This {{played an important role in}} his reelection defeat, however he was so pleased with the outcome that he had it engraved on his tombstone. Adams spent much of his term at home in Massachusetts, ignoring the details of political patronage nursed by other office holders.|$|E
500|$|Bob Sassone of TV Squad {{admitted}} {{in his review}} that after seeing the promos for [...] "Generalissimo" [...] audibly <b>groaned,</b> <b>and</b> believed the story about a fictitious soap character resembling Baldwin's Jack would not work. He wrote {{that all of the}} [...] "over-the-top surreal subplots" [...] featured in the season would make this episode [...] "the worst one of all." [...] After watching the episode, however, Sassone said all the elements worked. Annie Barrett for Entertainment Weekly reported that the two stories, involving Liz and Drew and Jack and Elisa, respectively, were sublime. Barrett said that Baldwin's performance [...] "alone" [...] would have made the episode great. Jeremy Medina of Paste praised this episode, along with [...] "St. Valentine's Day", concluding, [...] "There's no possible way to mention every funny joke or one-liner in the past two episodes. The show is just too lightning-quick for that." [...] Writing for The Monterey County Herald Marc Cabrera noted Jack's interactions with Elisa's grandmother amongst his favorite moments of season 3. The Guardians Will Dean wrote that [...] "Generalissimo" [...] was the [...] "best episode" [...] of the series. Staci Gold of North by Northwestern wrote that this episode was majorly improved by Baldwin's [...] "hilarious imitation of a Spanish accent." [...] IGN writer Robert Canning said that Baldwin stole the show in this episode, and rated it a 9.4 out of 10.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} August 1937, the Japanese {{military}} restricted foreigners from {{crossing the}} Garden Bridge: [...] "There is much local criticism of the Japanese naval authorities who, still persist in their refusals to permit foreigners to cross the Garden Bridge." [...] After August 1937 the Waibaidu Bridge was the de facto border between the International Settlement and Japanese occupied Hongkew (now Hongkou) and Zhabei. As Mark Gayn recalls: [...] "The creek became the boundary between two worlds. To the north was the world of fear, death, and the Japanese bayonet. To the south, law was still supreme and life remained as normal {{as it could be}} with bombs exploding....Of all the bridges, the Garden Bridge alone remained open to traffic, and on its narrow roadway the two hostile worlds met and glared at each other." [...] The west end of Garden Bridge, was guarded by members of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Harold Rattenbury recalls: [...] "Japanese and Scottish sentries face one another on the Garden Bridge. To the Japanese all Chinese must remove their hats; so I took pleasure in removing mine to our Scottish sentries also." [...] Kemp Tolley indicates: [...] "A Japanese sentry stood on the Garden Bridge, over odoriferous Soochow Creek, which separated Honkew {{from the rest of the}} International Settlement. Foreigners were expected, on pain of a possible slap in the face, to bow gently from the waist when passing the sentry. Chinese coolies grunted, <b>groaned</b> <b>and</b> yei-hoed, pushing heavily loaded carts up the bridge's steep approaches. An occasional bayonet thrust into a bale or a prick in some tender part of a coolie's anatomy reminded everyone who was boss. Although Honkew was a part of the International Settlement, the Settlement taxis and rickshaws were not allowed there. One had to hire a ramshackle vehicle especially licensed â€” or walk across the bridge, bowing en route, and pick up a conveyance in Japanese [...] "territory." ...|$|E
