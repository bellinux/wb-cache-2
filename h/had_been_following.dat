5|$|Belgian {{involvement}} in World War II began when German forces invaded Belgium, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> {{a policy of}} neutrality, on 10 May 1940. After 18 days of fighting, Belgium surrendered on 28 May and was placed under German occupation. During the fighting, between 600,000 and 650,000 Belgian men (nearly 20% of the country's male population) {{had served in the}} military. Most were made prisoners of war and detained in Germany, though some were released {{before the end of the}} war. Leopold III, king and commander in chief of the army, also surrendered to the Germans on 28 May along with his army and remained a prisoner for the rest of the war. The Belgian government fled first to Bordeaux in France, and then to London in the United Kingdom where it formed an official government in exile in October 1940.|$|E
5|$|Drizzt fights off the resurrected spirit-wraith of {{his father}} in Exile, the second book in the Dark Elf Trilogy and also {{published}} in 1990. Sojourn picks up the story when Drizzt leaves the Underdark for the surface, where he meets a blind human ranger named Montolio Debrouchee. When Montolio begins teaching him {{the ways of the}} ranger, Drizzt realizes that, unknowingly, he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> those very principles his entire life. From then on Drizzt's patron goddess is Mielikki, the Faerûnian goddess of the forest and of rangers. Montolio eventually dies, and Drizzt travels the Realms in search of a new home. He eventually finds himself in Icewind Dale where he meets dwarven king Bruenor Battlehammer, and Bruenor's adopted human daughter, Catti-brie.|$|E
5|$|Flood was They Might Be Giants' first {{release on}} any major label. Elektra Records {{approached}} the band following the unexpected {{success of their}} second album, Lincoln, which was released on the independent Bar/None label. The record deal that Elektra presented was {{largely due to the}} work of Susan Drew, an A worker who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> the band since 1986. Because of her confidence, the band was given an extensive level of creative control over their projects, in addition to the ability {{to take advantage of the}} label's strategies and resources. Although They Might Be Giants recorded the album as a duo, they were joined by many guest musicians on brass and string instruments. The band also enlisted Alan Bezozi to help program some of the drums for the album.|$|E

5|$|In Kingsbury, US4 and NY149 {{head through}} an open area dotted with farms and ponds. The routes proceed southward to a {{junction}} known as Baldwin Corner, where US4 and NY149 split. While US4 heads to the southeast, NY149 continues due south, paralleling the Champlain Canal to an area known as Smith's Basin. Here, NY149 turns east and crosses both a railroad line and the canal—which NY149 <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> since joining US4 in downtown Fort Ann—to enter the town of Hartford. Here, the route winds its way eastward through a rural, mostly undeveloped area of Washington County as it intersects several county roads {{on its way to}} the hamlet of Hartford.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt was a well-publicized nature-enthusiast, {{known for}} his grand hunting expeditions. While he admired the natural world, and the animals who {{inhabited}} it, he believed that animals served a singular purpose: to satisfy human needs, especially {{in the name of}} progress. Roosevelt <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> the debate in newspaper articles and magazines with great interest, and as a result he became a friend and confidant of John Burroughs; shortly after Burroughs' first article condemning popular nature writers as sham naturalists, Roosevelt sent him a letter of support as well as an invitation to travel west in each other's company. In April 1903, Roosevelt and Burroughs explored Yellowstone National Park and its surrounding areas together.|$|E

5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett and Hunt wagon companies that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the race}} John Downie crashed into a pub in Ballasalla, but the car did not sustain {{extensive}} damage {{and he was able}} to continue the race. At Keppel Gate on the Mountain Road, Frederick Bennett, who had been unable to take part in the practice sessions and therefore did not know the course very well, approached a corner with too much speed in his Cadillac and crashed, ripping off two of the wheels. Bennett managed to stay in the vehicle and avoided serious injury. Another driver to go off the track was J. Hadley in his Wolseley, who also carried too much speed into a corner, leading him to drive off through a hedge and into a field. The Thornycroft driven by Tom Thornycroft <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> closely behind, and the two cars collided during the incident, damaging one of the Thornycroft's rear wheels. Napier in his Arrol-Johnston made the quickest circuit of the first lap in one hour, 32 minutes and 36 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Reading {{finished}} the 1973–74 season in sixth position, one place {{higher than the}} previous year. Friday underwent an operation to have tattoos removed from his fingers during the summer break, and afterwards joined a hippie commune in Cornwall, neglecting to inform Reading of this latter decision. He was absent without explanation when training started for the 1974–75 season in July 1974, arriving only {{on the day of}} a closed-doors friendly against Watford. Despite his lack of training, he far out-performed the rest of the team. He continued to play well when the League programme began the following month. By September 1974 he was attracting the interest of First Division sides Sheffield United and Arsenal. The former <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> him since the game at Barnsley back in February, when he had still been an amateur. Arsenal manager Bertie Mee personally attended Reading's 4–2 home win over Rotherham United on 12 September, but neither his team nor Sheffield United attempted to sign Friday.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1932–33 series, several authors, {{including}} {{many of the}} players involved, released books expressing various points of view about bodyline. Many {{argued that it was}} a scourge on cricket and must be stamped out, while some did not see what all the fuss was about. The series has been described as the most controversial period in Australian cricket history, and voted the most important Australian moment by a panel of Australian cricket identities. The MCC asked Harold Larwood to sign an apology to them for his bowling in Australia, making his selection for England again conditional upon it. Larwood was furious at the notion, pointing out that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>following</b> orders from his upper-class captain, and that was where any blame should lie. Larwood refused, never played for England again, and became vilified in his own country. Douglas Jardine always defended his tactics and in the book he wrote about the tour, In Quest of the Ashes, described allegations that the England bowlers directed their attack with the intention of causing physical harm as stupid and patently untruthful. The immediate effect of the law change which banned bodyline in 1935 was to make commentators and spectators sensitive to the use of short-pitched bowling; bouncers became exceedingly rare and bowlers who delivered them were practically ostracised. This attitude ended after the Second World War, and among the first teams to make extensive use of short-pitched bowling was the Australian team captained by Bradman between 1946 and 1948. Other teams soon followed.|$|E
