40|$|Abstract: Increased {{production}} from <b>gas</b> <b>lifted</b> oil wells {{can be achieved}} by use of feedback control. Without control the well system may have large oscillations in the flow rate or stabilize itself at a non-optimal production point. These non-optimal production conditions give lower production and/or poor oil/water downstream separation. The study extends the newly introduced approach for controlling <b>gas</b> <b>lifted</b> one-well systems to <b>gas</b> <b>lifted</b> two-well systems. Different control structures are considered and their performance are studied using simulations of a two-well system. The simulation results show that the different control structures {{do not have the same}} ability to stabilize the system at low downhole pressures. The structure which stabilizes the system at the lowest downhole pressure requires pressure measurement downhole in the well. Copyright c° 2002 IFA...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper treats {{stabilization}} of multiphase flow in a <b>gas</b> <b>lifted</b> oil well. Two different controllers are investigated, PI control using the estimated downhole {{pressure in the}} well, and nonlinear model based control of the total mass in the system. Both control structures rely {{on the use of}} a state estimator, and are able to stabilize the well flow with or without a downhole pressure measurement available. In both cases {{stabilization of}} <b>gas</b> <b>lifted</b> wells increases total production significantly. Copyright c° 2004 IFA...|$|R

40|$|Proper {{allocation}} {{and distribution}} of <b>lift</b> <b>gas</b> is necessary for maximizing total oil production from a field with <b>gas</b> <b>lifted</b> oil wells. When the supply of the <b>lift</b> <b>gas</b> is limited, the total available gas should be optimally distributed among the oil wells of the field such that the total production of oil from the field is maximized. This paper describes a non-linear optimization problem with constraints associated with the optimal distribution of the <b>lift</b> <b>gas.</b> A non-linear objective function is developed using a simple dynamic model of the oil field where the decision variables represent the <b>lift</b> <b>gas</b> flow rate set points of each oil well of the field. The <b>lift</b> <b>gas</b> optimization problem is solved using the emph'fmincon' solver found in MATLAB. As an alternative and for verification, hill climbing method is utilized for solving the optimization problem. Using both of these methods, {{it has been shown}} that after optimization, the total oil production is increased by about 4. For multiple oil wells sharing <b>lift</b> <b>gas</b> from a common source, a cascade control strategy along with a nonlinear steady state optimizer behaves as a self-optimizing control structure when the total supply of <b>lift</b> <b>gas</b> is assumed to be the only input disturbance present in the process. Simulation results show that repeated optimization performed after the first time optimization under the presence of the input disturbance has no effect in the total oil production...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>lift</b> {{is another}} widely used {{artificial}} lift method. As the name denotes, gas is injected in the tubing {{to reduce the}} weight of the hydrostatic column, thus reducing the back pressure and allowing the reservoir pressure to push the mixture of produce fluids and gas up to the surface. The <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> can be deployed {{in a wide range of}} well conditions (from [...] to 15,000 ft). Gas lifts can cope well with abrasive elements and sand, and the cost of workover is minimum.|$|E
50|$|This {{uses the}} {{injection}} of gas into the fluid stream which reduces the fluid density and lowers the bottom hole pressure. As the gas rises the bubbles help {{to push the}} oil ahead. The degree of the effect depends on continuous or intermittent flow of the gas. The gas can be injected at a single point below the fluid or may be supplemented by multipoint injection. An intermitter at the surface controls {{the timing of the}} gas injection. The mechanisms are either pressure or fluid operated. They may be throttling valves or casing pressure operated valve.Fluid operated valves require a rise in tubing pressure to open and drop to close.A throttling pressure valve is opened by casing pressure build up and closed by casing pressure drop.Conventional <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> valves are attached to <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> mandrels and wire line retrievable <b>gas</b> <b>lift</b> valves which are set in side pocket mandrels.|$|E

40|$|Nonequilibrium aerostatic flight conditions, {{caused by}} the {{delivery}} of a large payload, represent a significant engineering challenge to overcome {{in the design of}} large scale airships and impediments to their overall financial success. Gaseous ammonia, used as a portion of the airship’s <b>lifting</b> <b>gas,</b> i. e. “negative ballast ” and partly as a fuel or as a means to reduce NOx emissions of typical airship power plants is a relatively safe and practical way to meet the challenge of nonequilibrium aerostatic flight. Gaseous ammonia used as a secondary <b>lifting</b> <b>gas</b> can be vented quickly to restore the airship to aerostatic equilibrium.
