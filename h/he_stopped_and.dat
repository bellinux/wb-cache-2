5|$|This {{landscape}} {{gave him}} assurance. A fair field holding life. It was {{the religion of}} peace. It would die if its timid eyes were compelled to see blood.... He threw a pine cone at a jovial squirrel, and he ran with chattering fear. High in a treetop <b>he</b> <b>stopped,</b> <b>and,</b> poking his head cautiously from behind a branch, looked down {{with an air of}} trepidation. The youth felt triumphant at this exhibition. There was the law, he said. Nature had given him a sign. The squirrel, immediately upon recognizing danger, had taken to his legs without ado. He did not stand stolidly baring his furry belly to the missile, and die with an upward glance at the sympathetic heavens. On the contrary, he had fled as fast as his legs could carry him.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} they got to the beach, Kalaniʻōpuʻu's two {{youngest}} sons, who had been following their father believing they were being invited to visit the ship again with the ruler, began to climb into the boats that were waiting at the shore. Kānekapōlei shouted to them {{to get out of the}} boat and pleaded with her husband to stop. The ruler then realized that Cook and his men were not asking him to visit the ship, but forcing him. At this point <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> sat down.|$|E
25|$|Bryant drove {{three hundred}} metres down the road, to {{where a woman}} and her two {{children}} were walking. <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> fired two shots, killing the woman and the child she was carrying. The older child fled, but Bryant followed her and killed her with a single shot. He then stole a gold-coloured BMW by killing all four of its occupants. A short distance down the road he stopped beside a couple in a white Toyota and, drawing his weapon, ordered the male occupant into the boot of the BMW. After shutting the boot, he fired two shots into the windscreen of the Toyota, killing the female driver.|$|E

25|$|That {{following}} day, 14 February 1779, Cook {{marched through}} the village to retrieve the King. Cook took the King (aliʻi nui) by his own hand and led him willingly away. One of Kalaniʻōpuʻu's favorite wives, Kanekapolei and two chiefs approached the group as they were heading to boats. They pleaded with the king not to go until <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> sat where he stood. An old kahuna (priest), chanting rapidly while holding out a coconut, attempted to distract Cook and his men as a large crowd began to form at the shore. The king began to understand that Cook was his enemy. As Cook turned his back to help launch the boats, he was struck on the head by the villagers and then stabbed to death as he fell on {{his face in the}} surf. He was first struck on the head with a club by a chief named Kalaimanokahoʻowaha or Kanaʻina (namesake of Charles Kana'ina) and then stabbed by one of the king's attendants, Nuaa. The Hawaiians carried his body away towards the back of the town, still visible to the ship through their spyglass. Four marines, Corporal James Thomas, Private Theophilus Hinks, Private Thomas Fatchett and Private John Allen, were also killed and two others were wounded in the confrontation.|$|E
500|$|On the {{way back}} to the ashram, Uttanka had tied the {{earrings}} in a deerskin. While travelling, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> climbed a tree to pluck some fruit for his refreshment. He tied the deerskin to a branch, but the deerskin became untied and the earrings fell on the ground. A snake immediately got hold of the earrings and vanished into an ant-hill. In grief, Uttanka fell from the tree. For 35 days, he dug the ant-hill with a stick to get the snake out and retrieve the earrings. The earth began to shake due to the repeated strikes. At that time, Indra– riding his chariot– saw Uttanka's futile efforts. As in the Adi Parva, Indra used his Vajra to enable Uttanka to enter the beautiful Nagaloka. There, Uttanka saw a horse with the [...] "tail which had black and white hair, a copper-coloured muzzle, and eye of the same colour that seemed to flame forth in splendor". The horse told Uttanka to blow from behind, as in the Adi Parva version. The horse was the fire god Agni who was the guru of Gautama, who had offered his help to retrieve the earrings. When Uttanka followed the directive of the horse, flames and smoke emerged from every pore of the horse and choked the dwellings of the snakes. Thus choked, the serpents, headed by Vasuki came out, worshipped Uttanka and surrendered the earrings and asked that they be pardoned. When Uttanka returned to the hermitage of Gautama to give the earrings to Ahalya, he narrated the sequence of events that occurred in procuring the earrings.|$|E

Anderson collapsed while performing required physical training at the camp. [...] While running track, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> complained of fatigue.

2500|$|One {{day while}} Stuart was plowing in the field, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> {{wrote the first}} line of a sonnet: [...] "I am a farmer singing at the plow," [...] {{the first line of}} the 703 sonnets he would collect in Man with a Bull-Tongue Plow (1934). The book was {{described}} by Irish poet George William Russell (who wrote poetry under the name of AE) as the greatest work of poetry to come out of America since Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass. Stuart was named poet laureate for the Commonwelath of Kentucky in 1954, and in 1961 he received the annual award from the American Academy of Poets.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the walk}} began, Wallenda {{realized}} the wire had become slippery due to gathered dust. [...] He spat {{on his hands}} and rubbed his shoes for better grip. Shortly thereafter, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> crouched down on the wire due to wind gusts. [...] He later stopped a second time to break the bounce of the wire that his walking had induced. [...] Throughout the walk, Wallenda could be heard praying, repeatedly saying [...] "Thank you, Jesus." [...] Wallenda ran the last few steps then jumped off and kissed the ground. [...] Completing the walk in 22 minutes, 54 seconds, Wallenda became the first person to highwire walk across a Grand Canyon area gorge.|$|E

2500|$|In 2007 {{he participated}} at the European Championships which turned {{to be an}} [...] unfortunate event for him. On the [...] floor {{exercise}} he did not manage to complete his routine. After a hard landing {{to the back of}} his head on a layout Thomas salto, he twice attempted to run into his final tumbling pass. Instead of tumbling, <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> walked off the podium. That afternoon Dragulescu competed in the vault final, but missed his second vault (round-off, half-on, 2-1/2 twisting front), landing improperly and injuring his back. Romanian doctors then advised Dragulescu to immediately stop training and undergo a detailed investigation in the United States to assess the seriousness of his injury. Therefore, he missed the 2007 world championships and resumed training only several months prior to the 2008 Olympic Games.|$|E
2500|$|There were no {{surviving}} eyewitnesses to the collapse, but {{at least}} five people passed the dam within the hour prior without noticing anything unusual. The last, Ace Hopewell, a carpenter at Powerhouse , rode his motorcycle past the dam about ten minutes before midnight. He testified at the Coroner's Inquest that he had passed Powerhouse [...] without seeing anything there or at the dam that caused him concern. He went on to state that at approximately one and one-half miles (2.4km) upstream he heard above the roar of his motorcycle a rumbling much {{like the sound of}} [...] "rocks rolling on the hill." [...] <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> got off, leaving the engine idling, and smoked a cigarette while checking the hillside above him. The rumble that had caught his attention earlier had begun to fade behind him. Assuming that {{it may have been a}} landslide, as these were common in the area, and satisfied that he was in no danger, he continued on.|$|E

After he was killed many around the area were thankful for his sacrifice, especially the local police, who thought Khan deserved being given heroic status by the country. Although the bomber did kill several people, it was thought he could have done more damage by causing a high number of casualties which could have arisin if Khan didn't stop the man going towards the branch. The building was described as being [...] "poorly guarded" [...] at the time. Khan only received Rs.150,000 (£1107.68 or $1753.41 or €1300.87 as of September 2010), which was given to his siblings, as he had no parents nor a family of his own.|$|E

2500|$|Rebbe Nachman never {{claimed that}} he was the Messiah. He taught the general Hasidic concept of the tzaddik ha-dor (tzadik of the {{generation}} or era), which is the idea that in every generation, a special, saintly person is born who could potentially become the Jewish Messiah if conditions were right in the world. Otherwise, this tzaddik lives and dies the same as any other holy man. Toward the end of his life, he said, [...] "My fire will burn until the coming of Mashiach" [...] — indicating that the Messiah had not yet arrived. Breslover Hasidim do not believe Rebbe Nachman was the Messiah, but they do believe that the light of his teachings continues to illuminate the paths of Jews from many disparate backgrounds. [...] Chayey Moharan [...] states that Rabbi Nachman said [...] "All the benefits Messiah can do for Israel, I can do; the only difference is Messiah will decree and it will happen, but I -- (and <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> did not say more) [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the song, Vedder said in {{an online}} chat that it was written {{around the time of}} the Gulf War and added that [...] "it's an anti-patriotic song, actually." [...] On August 7, 2008, at a solo {{performance}} in Newark, New Jersey, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Vedder took a question from the audience requesting that he explain the meaning of [...] "Yellow Ledbetter". At first, Vedder joked, saying, [...] "Wait...you mean there's lyrics?" [...] He went on to talk about how the song took as its subject a friend of his from Seattle whose brother served in the first Gulf War. His friend received a [...] "yellow letter" [...] in the mail informing him that his brother had died in the war. Vedder and his friend then went for a walk. On this walk, the friend, whom Vedder described as [...] "alternative looking," [...] happened by a house with an American flag flying and people on the porch. <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> gestured to the flag, as if to salute it, but the people on the porch glared at him disapprovingly due to his appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the album's stripped-back closing track, [...] "You Were Good", Jim Adkins stated: [...] "A {{fair amount}} of the ideas for Damage started out as {{acoustic}} songs, like really rough acoustic songs. 'You Were Good' started out in a pretty acoustic-based world and {{when we tried to}} take it out of that world, we realized that without the acoustic guitar in there as a bed, it didn't feel the same without it being there. With 'You Were Good', we experimented around a little bit with fleshing it out and building the dynamics of it in a full band sense, {{but at the end of}} the day we all looked at each other and agreed it sounded better with just me and a guitar and the weirdo, Indian drone thing on there." [...] Guitarist and backing vocalist Tom Linton elaborated: [...] "It was just [...] with an acoustic guitar and his vocals, and there was never a point where <b>he</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> started over. He just played it from the beginning to the end live. Then I overdubbed an organ part and Alain [...] played the guitar part. That was really fun to do, and I don't think we had ever done it before, especially with vocals." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. <b>He</b> <b>stopped</b> <b>and</b> was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E
