40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effect of}} flake-cutting on {{the texture of}} {{mechanically}} deboned poultry meat patties was evaluated by texture profile analysis. Mechanically deboned poultry meat with skin (MDPM) was <b>flake-cut</b> and then mixed with salt and seasoning for 5 min; structured protein fiber (SPF) was added as either 15 or 25 % of the patty formulation. A reference or mixed sample containing 15 % SPF was prepared without flake-cutting. The Instron Universal Testing Machine was used to objectively measure the textural properties of hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness. A six-member trained panel also evaluated the same texture properties plus juiciness using a seven-point intensity scale. Objectively, <b>flake-cut</b> patties were more springy than mixed patties when SPF level was equal (15 %). <b>Flake-cut</b> patties with 25 % SPF were significantly harder and more chewy than either the flaked or mixed patties with 15 % SPF. Sensorially, both <b>flake-cut</b> patties were more springy and co-hesive than the mixed product. Positive significant correlation coefficients between objective and sensory measures of hardness, springiness, and chewiness indicated that the Instron and sensory panel were in good agreement. Those parameters {{as measured by the}} Instrom and sensory panel changed at about the same rate and in the same direction depending on effects of flake-cutting or level of SPF...|$|E
40|$|The size of <b>flake-cut</b> meat is an Important quality {{determinant}} of comminuted meat products which. potentially. depends upon {{a large number}} of factors. Temperature and whether or not the meat is pre-broken have a major Influence on the resulting particle size distribution, as does aperture size. Meat flaked at - 72 ̆ 7 C produced two to three times more flakes than at - 32 ̆ 7 C. Under some conditions the particles produced were as little as 0. 4 mm thick and characteristically were thicker at one end. High speed photography, used to visualise the cutting action. Indicated that size reduction occurs In a controlled manner providing that the meat ts neither too cold. nor too warm. Above - 1 C the meat merely deforms rather than being cut. Single. discrete particles. examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryoSEM. unexpectedly did not exhibit the usual features of cleanly-cut meat. The lack of ultrastructural detail was attributed to a smearing of sarcoplasmic fluid produced by a localised. transient rise In temperature during flaking...|$|E
