25|$|Despite {{offers from}} the bnetd {{developers}} to integrate Blizzard's CD key checking system into bnetd, Blizzard {{claims that the}} public availability of any such software package facilitates piracy, and moved to have the bnetd project shut down under provisions of the DMCA. As this case {{is one of the}} first major test cases for the DMCA, the Electronic Frontier Foundation became involved. For a while negotiations were ongoing to resolve the case without a trial. However, the negotiations failed and Blizzard won the case on all counts: the defendants were ruled to have breached both StarCraft's <b>End</b> <b>User</b> <b>License</b> <b>Agreement</b> (EULA) and the Terms of Use of Battle.net.|$|E

[...] The defendants also agreed to stop offering anonymous free trials, have users certify at install time that they are at least 18 years of age, provide an install-time link to their terms of service or <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>license</b> <b>agreement,</b> not download software that reinstalls itself after a user has removed it, and to prominently post removal instructions at their web sites.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, the Consumer Ombudsmen in Norway, Sweden and Denmark {{challenged}} Apple's iTunes <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> (EULA) {{through the}} Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bjørn Erik Thon, {{who claimed that}} Apple was violating contract and copyright laws in their countries. Thon stated that Apple's [...] "being an international company does not entitle [...] to disregard {{the laws of the}} countries in which it operates. The company's standard customer contract violates Norwegian law". An official complaint was filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council in January 2006, after which German and French consumer groups joined the Nordic-led drive to force Apple to make its iTunes online store compatible with digital music players made by rival companies. A French law allows regulators to force Apple to make its player and store compatible with rival offerings. The consumer protection regulators of Norway, Sweden, and Finland met with Apple in September 2006 in hopes of resolving the issues without litigation, but the matter was only resolved after Apple discontinued its FairPlay digital rights management (DRM) scheme.|$|E

2500|$|True EFI {{emulation}} was {{a highly}} sought after asset for the OSx86 community. Previous efforts based upon Apple's open source Darwin Project and Hackintosh gurus allowed users to use [...] on normal PCs, with patched kernels/kernel modules which simply bypassed EFI. Using the EFI patch, a Hackintosh could boot off [...] "vanilla" [...] (unmodified) [...] kernels and use vanilla kernel extensions. [...] This not only allowed the system to be compatible with future system updates, but also offered increased stability. This method also circumvents one aspect of Apple's <b>End</b> <b>User</b> <b>License</b> <b>Agreement,</b> which states that the modification of non-Open Source components of the OS is forbidden.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> (EULA) for Apple {{gives the}} {{consumer}} {{the opportunity to}} reject the license and obtain a refund. The current Microsoft Windows license lets the manufacturer determine the refund policy. With previous versions of Windows, {{it was possible to}} obtain a refund if the manufacturer failed to provide the refund by litigation in the small claims courts. On 15 February 1999, a group of Linux users in Orange County, California held a [...] "Windows Refund Day" [...] protest in an attempt to pressure Microsoft into issuing them refunds. In France, the Linuxfrench and AFUL (French speaking Libre Software Users' Association) organizations along with free software activist Roberto Di Cosmo started a [...] "Windows Detax" [...] movement, which led to a 2006 petition against [...] "racketiciels" [...] (translation: Racketware) with 39,415 signatories and the DGCCRF branch of the French government filing several complaints against bundled software. On March 24, 2014, a new international petition was launched by AFUL on the Avaaz platform, translated into several languages and supported by many organizations around the world.|$|E
2500|$|Silverlight {{supports}} H.264 video, Advanced Audio Coding, Windows Media Video (WMV), Windows Media Audio (WMA), and MPEG Layer III (MP3) media content {{across all}} supported browsers without requiring Windows Media Player, the Windows Media Player ActiveX control, or Windows Media browser plug-ins. Because Windows Media Video 9 is an {{implementation of the}} Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers (SMPTE) VC-1 standard, Silverlight also supports VC-1 video. According to the <b>end</b> <b>user</b> <b>license</b> <b>agreement</b> VC-1 and H.264 are only licensed for the [...] "personal and non-commercial use of a consumer". Silverlight {{makes it possible to}} dynamically load Extensible Markup Language (XML) content that can be manipulated through a Document Object Model (DOM) interface, a technique that is consistent with conventional Ajax techniques. Silverlight exposes a Downloader object which can be used to download content, like scripts, media assets, or other data, as may be required by the application.

50|$|Establishing {{which state}} {{will be the}} venue for {{litigation}} {{is an important part}} of any contract, and affects nearly every form of industry or commerce that transcends borders. For example, in the United States, many insurance companies choose to locate their headquarters in Iowa or Connecticut where state law is seen as favorable to their interests. This ensures that any legal action taken against the corporation will occur under friendly laws. The same phenomenon occurs in the software industry as well, with the majority of <b>End</b> <b>User</b> <b>License</b> <b>Agreements</b> including an item that establishes the laws of their home state as controlling law.|$|R

50|$|Categorizing an {{individual}} act can be complex, as some national intelligence services have provided {{scientific and technical}} intelligence to private firms based in their countries. It becomes even more complex when the information is provided to an organization partially or fully owned by that government, and that organization competes in commercial markets. Other complexities arise when the information is not actually stolen, but where the foreign intelligence service (or business) buys one copy of a high-technology product, and then reverse engineers its technology to use in its own products. <b>End</b> <b>user</b> <b>license</b> <b>agreements</b> forbidding reverse engineering are common in software, but less so in other business areas.|$|R

5000|$|Ownership {{of video}} game {{entities}} {{is a major}} issue in video game culture. On one side, players, especially who played with avatars for several years, have treated the avatars as their own property. On the other hand, publishers claim ownership of all in-game items and characters through the EULA (<b>End</b> <b>User</b> <b>License</b> <b>Agreements).</b> Terry Flew recognised this problem: [...] "Intellectual property is much better suited to conventional 'texts' that are fixed or finished, rather than ongoing collaborative creations like games". He also highlights that these issues will only worsen; as more interactive games emerging, issues of regulation, ownership, and service will only get more problematic.|$|R
50|$|Restrictions are {{sometimes}} applied in copyleft licenses {{to attempt to}} control use of the work. For example, the Hacktivismo Enhanced-Source Software <b>License</b> <b>Agreement</b> or HESSLA, produced by Hacktivismo (a group that promotes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights), is an open source license that prohibits use or modification that would violate human rights or introduce features that spy on the user into software distributed under its terms. Similarly, <b>End</b> <b>User</b> <b>License</b> <b>Agreements</b> sometimes put restrictions in place {{against the use of}} software for the production of nuclear weapons (such as in Apple's iTunes EULA) but these may be related to cryptography export controls.|$|R
