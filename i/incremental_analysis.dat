5000|$|<b>Incremental</b> <b>Analysis</b> methods {{start with}} the mesh of the flat blank and {{simulate}} the deformation of the blank inside of tools modeled to represent a proposed manufacturing process. This incremental forming is computed [...] "forward" [...] from initial shape to final, and is calculated {{over a number of}} time increments for start to finish. The time increments can be either explicitly or implicitly defined depending on the finite element software being applied. As the incremental methods include the model of the tooling and allow for the definition of boundary conditions which more fully replicate the manufacturing proposal, incremental methods are more commonly used for process validation.

5000|$|<b>Incremental</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has filled}} the role {{previously}} completed {{through the use}} of proof tools or prototype tools. Proof tools in the past were short run dies made of softer than normal material, which were used to plan and test the metal forming operations. This process was very time consuming and did not always yield beneficial results, as the soft tools were very different in their behavior than the longer running production tools. Lessons learned on the soft tools did not transfer to the hard tool designs. Simulation has for the most part displaced this old method. Simulation used as a virtual tryout is a metal forming simulation based on a specific set of input variables, sometimes nominal, best case, worst case, etc. However, any simulation {{is only as good as}} the data used to generate the predicitions. When a simulation is seen as a [...] "passing result" [...] manufacturing of the tool will often begin in earnest. But if the simulation results are based on an unrealistic set of production inputs then its value as an engineering tool is suspect.|$|E

Basically, we propose an <b>incremental</b> linear discriminant <b>analysis</b> (ILDA) in its two forms: a sequential ILDA and a Chunk ILDA. In experi-ments, we have tested ILDA using datasets with a small number of classes and small-dimensional features, as well as datasets with a large number of classes and large-dimensional features. We have compared the proposed ILDA against the traditional batch LDA in terms of discriminability, execution time and memory usage with the increasing volume of data addition. The results show that the proposed ILDA can effectively evolve a discriminant eigenspace over a fast and large data stream, and extract features with superior discriminability in classification, when compared with other methods.

40|$|The modern {{management}} of haemophilia has greatly influenced not only survival of patients, their clinical symptoms and orthopaedic outcome {{but also their}} perceived quality of life (QoL). QoL measures recently became {{an essential part of}} clinical trials being {{one of the most important}} patient-rated outcomes (PROs). Moreover, QoL assessment is essential in pharmacoeconomics. In clinical trials, not only clinical outcomes but also the so-called PROs and health-economic outcomes are included. Different types of economic evaluations may be conducted in order to describe the economic burden of a disease condition, to determine the cost of care and to assess and evaluate alternative treatments in terms of both costs and effects as well as benefits and outcomes with the aim of optimizing the use of resources. For these evaluations, the following analyses are performed: descriptive cost of illness study, <b>incremental</b> cost-effectiveness <b>analysis,</b> <b>incremental</b> cost-utility <b>analysis</b> and <b>incremental</b> cost-benefit <b>analysis.</b> By contrast, PROs are derived from direct patient reports and they allow to evaluate the impact of a disease and its treatment on patients' well-being and functioning.

40|$|Embedded {{systems are}} complex {{as a whole}} but consist of smaller {{independent}} modules interacting with each other. This structure makes embedded systems amenable to compositional design. Real-time embedded systems consist of real-time workloads having temporal deadlines. Compositional design of real-time embedded systems can be done using systems consisting of real-time components arranged in a scheduling hierarchy. Each component consists of some real-time workload and a scheduling policy for the workload. To simplify schedulability analysis for such systems, analysis can be done compositionally using interfaces that abstract the timing requirements of components. To facilitate analysis of dynam- ically changing real-time systems, the framework must support <b>incremental</b> <b>analysis.</b> In this paper, we summarize our work [19, 6] on schedulability analysis for hierarchical real-time systems.

40|$|The aim of <b>incremental</b> <b>{{analysis}}</b> is, given a program, its analysis results, and {{a series}} of changes to the program, to obtain the new analysis results as eficiently as possible and, ideally, without having to (re-) analyze fragments of code which are not affected by the changes. <b>Incremental</b> <b>analysis</b> can significantly reduce both the time and the memory requirements of analysis. The first contribution of this article is a multi-domain incremental fixed-point algorithm for a sequential Java-like language. The algorithm is multi-domain {{in the sense that it}} interleaves the (re-) analysis for multiple domains by taking into account dependencies among them. Importantly, this allows the incremental analyzer to invalidate only those analysis results previously inferred by certain dependent domains. The second contribution is an incremental resource usage analysis which, in its first phase, uses the multi-domain incremental fixed-point algorithm to carry out all global pre-analyses required to infer cost in an interleaved way. Such resource analysis is parametric on the cost metrics one wants to measure (e. g., number of executed instructions, number of objects created, etc.). Besides, we present a novel form of cost summaries which allows us to incrementally reconstruct only those components of cost functions affected by the changes. Experimental results in the costa system show that the proposed <b>incremental</b> <b>analysis</b> provides significant performance gains, ranging from a speedup of 1. 48 up to 5. 13 times faster than non-incremental analysis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. We propose {{category}} theory, {{the mathematical}} theory of structure, {{as a vehicle}} for defining ontologies in an unambiguous language with analytical and constructive features.

It allows the <b>incremental</b> <b>analysis</b> of ontologies by basing them in an interconnected hierarchy of theories, with an operation on the hierarchy that expresses the formation of complex theories from simple theories that express first principles. Another operation forms abstractions expressing the shared concepts in an array of theories.
