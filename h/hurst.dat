40|$|In this paper, we {{test the}} weak-form stock market {{efficiency}} for the Tunisian stock market (TSE). Our empirical approach {{is founded on}} {{the analysis of the}} behaviour over time of the <b>Hurst's</b> exponent. Thus, we computed the <b>Hurst's</b> exponent using a â€œrolling sampleâ€ with a time window of 4 years. The sample data covers in daily frequency the period (January, 1997 - October 2007). Since the classical R/S analysis is strongly affected by short-range dependencies both in the mean and the conditional variance of TSE daily volatility, daily stock returns were filtered using the traditional AR-GARCH(1, 1) model. Our results for <b>Hurst's</b> and filtered <b>Hurst's</b> exponents behaviour analysis show a strong evidence of long-range dependence with persistent behaviour of the TSE. However, during the last two years, the filtered <b>Hurst's</b> exponent seems to exhibit a switching regime behaviour with alternating persistent and antipersistent behaviour but where it was somewhat close to 0. 5. The nonparametric statistic approach results reveal that some TSE reforms including the launching of the Electronic quotation system on April, 1998, the fiscal regime for holdings, the security reinforcement laws, the legal protection of minority shareholder {{may play a role in}} understanding the <b>Hurst's</b> exponent behaviour over timefinancial reforms, long-range dependence; weak-form efficiency; <b>Hurst's</b> exponent; rolling sample approach. ...|$|R

5|$|A {{persistent}} thigh injury restricted Whalley's first-team involvement at {{the start}} of the following season, which also coincided with a change in management at the club, after a poor start to the season left Shrewsbury rooted to the bottom of the League One table. Whalley scored his first goal of the season against Oxford United, deep in injury time, to seal a 2–0 victory for new manager Paul <b>Hurst</b> in his first home league match in charge. After becoming a first-team regular under <b>Hurst,</b> and helping Shrewsbury avoid relegation once again in 2016–17, Whalley signed a two-year contract extension in May 2017.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hurst</b> Castle is an {{artillery}} fort established by Henry VIII on the <b>Hurst</b> Spit in Hampshire, England, between 1541 and 1544. It formed {{part of the}} King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and defended the western entrance to the Solent waterway. The early castle had a central keep and three bastions, and in 1547 was equipped with 26 guns. It was expensive to operate due to its size, but it formed {{one of the most}} powerful forts along the coast. During the English Civil War of the 1640s, <b>Hurst</b> was held by Parliament and was used briefly to detain King Charles I before his execution in 1649. It continued in use during the 18th century but fell into disrepair, the spit being frequented by smugglers.|$|E
