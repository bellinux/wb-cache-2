The last act of the directors was to pay a 7.5 per cent dividend on the shares in 1950. Having taken over responsibility for the waterway, the Transport Commission enlarged Newark Town lock in 1952, and the flood lock at Holme was removed {{to reduce the risk of}} flooding in Nottingham. More improvements followed between 1957 and 1960.

500|$|Despite this setback, {{within a}} year Evans had found a client. The Philadelphia Board of Health was {{concerned}} {{with the problem of}} dredging and cleaning the city's dockyards and removing sandbars: in 1805 Evans convinced them to contract him to develop a steam-powered dredge. The result was the Oruktor Amphibolos, or [...] "Amphibious Digger". The vessel consisted of a flat-bottomed scow with bucket chains to bring up mud and hooks to clear away sticks, stones and other obstacles. Power for the <b>dredging</b> <b>equipment</b> and propulsion was supplied by a high-pressure Evans engine. The end result was a craft nearly thirty feet long, twelve feet wide and weighing some seventeen tons. To move this ungainly hulk to the waterfront, as well to give a demonstration of his long-held beliefs in the possibility of land-based steam transportation, Evans mounted the hull on four wheels (twice, as the first set collapsed under the weight) and connected the engine to them in order to drive the Oruktor from his workshop through the Philadelphia streets {{on the way to the}} Schuylkill River on July 13, 1805. The Oruktor Amphibolos is thus believed to have been the first automobile in the United States, and the first motorized amphibious craft in the world. However, very few contemporary accounts of the craft survive, and Evans's tendency to exaggerate its success in his own annals make verification of its performance difficult. Although Evans himself claimed it proceeded successfully around Philadelphia (and circled his erstwhile rival Benjamin Latrobe's Philadelphia waterworks) before launching into the river and paddling at speed to Philadelphia harbor; the great weight of the craft make land-propulsion based on its limited engine capacity and jury-rigged power train fairly improbable over any significant distance. It is similarly unknown how well, if at all, the Oruktor functioned as a steamboat, and Evans's claims on this point vary significantly over the years. Nevertheless, it is known that the invention proved ineffective for its ostensible purpose as a dredger, and it was scrapped for parts by the Board of Health in 1808. Nevertheless, [...] Evans's ideas of steam carriages were not an impossible dream. Evans would continue to promote the idea. In 1812 he published a futuristic description of a world connected by a network of Shipping lines railroad tracks and steam locomotives, accurately describing what will happen in the future. long before any such potential could be realized: ...|$|E

40|$|Dredging is a {{critical}} part of maintaining the nation?s ports and harbors that {{play a major role in}} international trade. The design of <b>dredge</b> <b>equipment</b> requires knowledge of the forces expected on an average dredge. For a cutter suction dredge one of the largest forces is applied on the cutter head. To determine the design criteria for a given cutter suction dredge the forces on the cutter head must be known. Forces on a 33 cm (13 inch) model cutter head have been measured using a model cutter suction dredge 10. 2 cm ((4 inch)) suction and 3 inch (7. 6 cm) discharge) in the Haynes Coastal Engineering Laboratory. The experimental results are compared to the results of a previously developed theory for estimating cutterhead forces. A MATLAB program is written and used to solve the theoretical equations. The sediment used in the study had a d 50 of 0. 27 mm and an angle of internal friction of 21. 6 ?. The sediment is contained in the deep sediment pit 7. 6 m (25 ft long), 3. 7 m wide(12 ft) and 1. 5 m deep(5 ft) in the dredge/tow tank that is 45. 7 m long(150 ft), 3. 7 m wide(12 ft), and 3. 0 m deep(10 ft). The objectives of the study are to calculate the forces using existing theory and MATLAB program and compare the theoretical results to those measured in the laboratory. The effects of the depth of cut, direction of swing, and cutter rpm on the forces acting on the cutter head are evaluated. The forces on the cutterhead are determined through the use of a set of six load cells rated at 13. 3 kN (3000 lb). The load cell measurements allow direct calculation of the forces on the cutter head through the use of static equilibrium equations with the assumption of a constant swing speed. Once the forces are determined the results can be scaled to fit an actual dredge and then be applied in the determination of dredge design characteristics. The study shows the ability of the theory to determine the forces within an order or magnitude. The theoretical forces allow design of a cutter using a factor of safety.

40|$|To help {{to provide}} a desperately needed coastal {{protection}} strategy for the Mekong Delta in Vietnam this research looks into the possibilities for natural and sustainable coastal defence systems, including mangroves and active sediment management, such as a nourishment. The coastline of the Mekong Delta suffers from severe erosion and mangrove degradation. Due to relative sea level rise and climate change {{it is crucial to}} design adaptable and proactive coastal protection measures. From a literature study into ongoing erosion processes, local coastal protection problems, and mangrove habitat requirements, boundary conditions were determined. As a basic concept of a Building with Nature alternative for the Decision Support Tool, a combination of a mangrove fringe with its accompanying wave attenuating foreshore and an earth dyke were considered. Two requirements with respect to a maximum wave height in front of the mangrove fringe and earth dyke, were translated into a conceptual profile of the foreshore: a convex-up bathymetric profile. This schematised profile was adjusted for two case study areas. The numerical model SWASH was used to translate the offshore boundary conditions into near shore conditions. Annual and heavy storm conditions were modelled for both case study areas, in order to test the performance of the convex-up profile. The model results led to designs of the foreshores of the case study areas. Possible <b>dredging</b> locations, <b>equipment,</b> transport of the dredged material, and different nourishment techniques were considered. The proposed Building with Nature designs and design alternatives were compared with current coastal protection measures by a cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis. It was found that a convex-up profile improves the conditions for mangroves to develop, as this significantly decreases the hydrodynamic forces in front of the mangrove fringe and creates an additional zone above Mean Sea Level suitable for mangrove colonisation. The minimal required width for mangroves to serve as a self-sustaining coastal protection measurement is dependent on multiple factors including fringe density and local hydrology. The minimal required mangrove width was established to be 700 m for the case study site of Tam Giang Dong at the east coast and 350 m for An Minh at the west coast, where the hydraulic conditions are milder. The point at which full restoration of the convex-up profile can compete economically with a breakwater is dependent on the foreshore profile and erosion rate. For the east coast, {{in order to maintain the}} present situation, an erosion rate of 24 m/year or less was determined as the tipping point. For full restoration of the convex-up profile to be economically favourable the upper limit of the erosion rate is 20 m/year. For the west coast these points are 17 m/year and 10 m/year respectively. For the case study site of Tam Giang Dong, as well as for the case study site at the east coast, due to high erosion rates and high cliffs in front of the mangrove fringe, the proposed design is the option 'mud or sandy-mud nourishment in combination with a permeable breakwater'. In other parts of the Mekong Delta area with lower erosion rates Building with Nature alternatives without permeable breakwaters are viable as well.

40|$|The {{past five}} decades an unparalleled growth in {{societal}} demand for raw materials occurred {{which led to}} sometimes-irreversible negative impacts on the earth’s ecological system. Consequently sustainable issues are of growing importance {{in the world and}} this awareness is present among customers of IHC Merwede B. V. (IHC), their customers start to demand sustainability to be incorporated in products and services. IHC intends to anticipate to this growing future demand and to invest in building up knowledge and implementing sustainability in their products and services. An Alluvial Mining Operation (AMO) has an inevitable impact on the complex ecological (environment, landscape) and social (local communities) systems. To understand such systems and implement sustainability into practice, more knowledge is required. An extensive review of literature on sustainability currently in use by the mining industry, specific characteristics in the alluvial mining industry, and improvement opportunities for a more sustainable approach have led to a sustainable guideline for AMOs. The following main conclusions concerning the sustainable guideline were identified: Sustainable issues in the mining industry can be applied very well in AMOs. During the operation phase material handling and water management are key parameters for a sustainable AMO. The International Finance Corporation stakeholder engagement process and performance standards are very functional tools during the exploration and feasibility study phases. The framework of the International Council on Mining & Metals is globally most utilized and can be applied during all mining phases. Improvement opportunities are: A better understanding of the ecological and social system is required. Notice that relevant data collection about the system is time consuming. Initiatives such as Building With Nature will help to gain more knowledge and insight in the (eco) system; A corporate mind of sustainability for all related stakeholders, on and off-site, is essential during the whole mine life; Backcasting is a useful method to road-map community projects to maximize societal value; Land-based AMOs alternative, self-generating energy sources are very interesting opportunities; For <b>dredge</b> mining <b>equipment</b> opportunities as essential sustainable parameters are reduction and minimization of emissions, turbidity, material stewardship and improved energy efficiency; and in every country with the potential for placer mining it is recommended to establish specific SD guidelines for each specific ecosystem that occurs. Due to the continuous and concurrent reclamation method only a small amount has to be reclaimed for complete closure. The South African department of minerals and energy developed a useful guideline to estimate closure costs. For further research the Gold Sands project in Peru is chosen to verify the validity of Sustainable Development issues in AMO. The main conclusions concerning the sustainable cash flow model are: Data collection to valuate sustainable indicators that affect the cash flow is difficult. The required social related data is eventually only applicable for Peruvian mining operations. Despite the difficulties for sustainable data collection, a sustainable cash flow model has been developed successfully. The mining systems selection tool serves both integrated investment analysis and production planning. The effect of alterations in the selection tool is clearly visualized in the plotted graphs. Project’s economic viability is positive within the sustainable case and the sensitivity analysis shows that sustainability is not a key parameter that influences the viability of the project.

50|$|In 1866 the ship's {{railroad}} iron armor was salvaged, and {{the wooden}} hull was {{shattered by the}} underwater charges used to remove it. The wreck was then left alone and forgotten. In 1968 Georgia was rediscovered during a dredging operation of the Savannah River. The wreck was left untouched, although accidental impacts from <b>dredging</b> <b>equipment</b> and the anchors marking the site location may have damaged what remained. By 1992, all that was survived were portions of her forward and aft casemates and parts of her engines, including the boilers, shafts, propellers, and condensers. Several of her cannon were located nearby, along with assorted ordnance.|$|E
50|$|The deepest {{section of}} the Fehmarn Belt Trench is 35 metres and the tunnel {{sections}} will be about 10 metres high, thus the dredging barges {{will need to be}} capable of reaching depths of over 45 metres. Dredging will produce a trench some 40-50 m wide and 12-15 m deep. These parameters give a total of some 20 million cubic metres of soils to be dredged. Conventional <b>dredging</b> <b>equipment</b> can only reach to a depth of about 25 m. To excavate the middle portion of the Fehmarn trench - deeper than 25 m below the water's surface - will likely require grab dredgers and trailing suction hopper dredgers.|$|E
5000|$|Following trial {{operations}} between Wilmington and Washington, D.C. from 30 December 1882 to 13 February 1883, Albatross {{returned to}} her builder's yard for engine alterations. While steaming back to Washington, the ship experimented with her <b>dredging</b> <b>equipment,</b> and arrived at the nation's capital on 25 March 1883. She left the Potomac River on 24 April and proceeded to Woods Hole, Massachusetts, which would serve as her base for several months of operations investigating the [...] "migrations of mackerel, menhaden, and other migratory species." [...] During this period, she also made shorter dredging trips out of Woods Hole to the Gulf Stream and the tilefish grounds.|$|E
5000|$|As governor, Hinds {{strongly}} {{promoted the}} utilization of Guam as an area for key naval bases to be built upon. He advocated for construction of a base to commence quickly using improvised <b>dredging</b> <b>equipment</b> from the Panama Canal. However, various engineers and the Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks dismissed the proposal as both unorthodox and originating from the wrong office. Hinds viewed Guam as of little importance other than as a naval outpost, stating in 1915 that [...] "Except as a naval base-a place from which to sail forth to 'capture or destroy the enemy fleet'-Guam has no value to the navy and is, perhaps, of but little interest to naval officers." ...|$|E
