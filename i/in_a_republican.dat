5|$|Adams {{focused his}} {{political}} agenda on promoting virtue, which he considered essential <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> government. If republican leaders lacked virtue, he believed, liberty was endangered. His major opponent {{in this campaign}} was his former protégé John Hancock; {{the two men had}} a falling out in the Continental Congress. Adams disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> leader. When Hancock left Congress in 1777, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against thanking him for his service as president of Congress. The struggle continued in Massachusetts. Adams thought that Hancock was not acting the part of a virtuous republican leader by acting like an aristocrat and courting popularity. Adams favored James Bowdoin for governor, and was distressed when Hancock won annual landslide victories.|$|E
5|$|In 1798, {{members of}} the Protestant Dissenter {{tradition}} (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, {{with the aim of}} creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, with effect from 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In October 1777, {{after more}} than two years in Congress, President Hancock {{requested}} a leave of absence. He asked George Washington to arrange a military escort for his return to Boston. Although Washington was short on manpower, he nevertheless sent fifteen horsemen to accompany Hancock on his journey home. By this time Hancock had become estranged from Samuel Adams, who disapproved of what he viewed as Hancock's vanity and extravagance, which Adams believed were inappropriate <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> leader. When Congress voted to thank Hancock for his service, Adams and the other Massachusetts delegates voted against the resolution, as did a few delegates from other states.|$|E
50|$|This {{would be}} the last {{election}} <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> presidential nominee would win heavily populated Clark County, home to the city of Las Vegas, which beginning in 1992 would become a reliably Democratic stronghold in the state. Consequently, 1988 was also the last occasion <b>in</b> which <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> presidential candidate swept every county in Nevada, and the last time <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> carried the state by a double-digit margin.|$|R

25|$|McGreevey's {{decision}} {{to delay the}} effective date of his resignation until after September 3, 2004, avoided a special election in November to replace the governor. Doing so allowed the Democratic Party to retain control of the governorship for the rest (until January 2006) of the 4-year term. It avoided {{the prospect of a}} special election in tandem with the presidential election, which could have resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> victory and helped George W. Bush capture New Jersey's electoral votes. Bush did not win New Jersey's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election, but captured 46% of the statewide vote, compared to 40% in the 2000 race, and did win re-election.|$|E
25|$|Watson was a Democrat, and {{was first}} elected to the State House in 1884, but his {{eligibility}} was challenged due his previous residence in Philadelphia. As a result did not take his seat and waited eight years, until 1892, to seek office again. Then {{he was elected to}} the State Senate and served in the 1893/94 session and the 1895/96 session, when he was the Speaker. The 1894 elections, however, resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> State House and a Republican Governor. Regardless, the State Senate kept its Democratic majority, and when GovernorJoshua H. Marvil died, the Speaker of the State Senate succeeded him. Watson assumed the office of Governor of Delaware and served from April 8, 1895 until January 19, 1897.|$|E

25|$|In March 2008, Vitter reintroduced {{the latter}} two {{proposals}} and cosponsored ten of eleven other bills <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> package of tough immigration enforcement measures including jail time for illegal border crossing; deportation for any immigrant (legal or illegal) for a single driving while intoxicated; declaration of English as the official language (thereby terminating language assistance at voting booths and federal agencies)' additional construction of a border fence; permission for local and state police to enforce immigration laws and penalties for states who issue drivers licenses to illegals. None of these proposals passed, partially because the Democratic-controlled Senate preferred a comprehensive approach which would include a guest-worker program and a path to citizenship for the current population more akin to the package defeated by Vitter in 2007.|$|E
25|$|During the 1964 UK general {{election}} campaign, an Irish republican candidate displayed an Irish tricolour {{from the window}} of his office <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>republican</b> area of Belfast. Paisley threatened that if the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) did not remove the tricolour he would lead a march to the office and take it down himself. The Flags and Emblems Act banned the public display of any symbol, {{with the exception of the}} Union Flag, that could cause a breach of the peace. In response, armed officers arrived at the building, smashed their way inside and seized the flag. This led to severe rioting between republicans and the RUC. Thirty people, including at least 18 officers, had to be hospitalized. The 1969 Northern Ireland riots, Divis Street were the worst in Belfast since the 1930s.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{assuming}} office, Ford inherited Nixon's Cabinet.

Ford's dramatic reorganization of his Cabinet {{in the fall}} of 1975 has been referred to by political commentators as the [...] "Halloween Massacre". One of Ford's appointees, William Coleman, as Secretary of Transportation, was the second black man to serve in a presidential cabinet (after Robert C.

500|$|Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush {{of lying}} and {{comparing}} {{the governor to}} Bill Clinton, which Bush said was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> primary". An anonymous smear campaign began against McCain, delivered by push polls, faxes, e-mails, flyers, and audience plants. The smears claimed that McCain had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter was adopted from Bangladesh), that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, {{that he was a}} homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] who was either a traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days.

500|$|After Palin's memoir, , {{achieved}} best-seller status through pre-orders, Fey {{announced she}} would resume impersonating the former Governor despite having [...] "retired" [...] the act months previously.

Fey hosted SNL in May 2011 while pregnant. A new sketch was made in which parodies of Mitt Romney (Jason Sudeikis), Newt Gingrich (Bobby Moynihan), Michele Bachmann (Kristen Wiig), Palin (Fey), Donald Trump (Darrell Hammond), and Jimmy McMillan (Kenan Thompson) fought <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> Party debate between undeclared candidates, with Shepard Smith (Bill Hader) coordinating.|$|E
500|$|With {{the help}} of the Kansas City Democratic machine led by Tom Pendergast, Truman was elected in 1922 as County Court judge of Jackson County's eastern district—this was an {{administrative}} rather than judicial position, somewhat similar to county commissioners elsewhere. [...] (At the time Jackson County elected a judge from the western district (Kansas City), one from the eastern district (Jackson County outside Kansas City), and a presiding judge elected countywide.) Truman was not re-elected in 1924, losing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> wave led by President Calvin Coolidge's landslide election to a full term. Two years selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for a family man approaching middle age, and he planned a run for presiding judge in 1926.|$|E

500|$|The Achaean League {{managed to}} capture Megalopolis in 235BC, {{and by the}} end of DemetriusII's reign most of the Peloponnese except Argos was taken from the Macedonians.

DemetriusII enlisted the aid of the Illyrian king Agron to defend Acarnania against Aetolia, and in 229BC, they managed to defeat the {{combined}} navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the Battle of Paxos. Another Illyrian ruler, Longarus of the Dardanian Kingdom, invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of DemetriusII shortly before his death in 229BC.

500|$|Demetrius II's {{control of}} Greece diminished {{by the end}} of his reign, though, when he lost Megalopolis in 235 BC and most of the Peloponnese except Argos to the Achaean League.

Demetrius II's {{struggle}} to defend Acarnania against Aetolia became so desperate that he enlisted the aid of the Illyrian king Agron, whose Illyrian pirates raided the coasts of western Greece and even defeated the combined navies of the Aetolian and Achaean Leagues at the Battle of Paxos in 229 BC. Yet another Illyrian ruler Longarus of the Dardanian Kingdom invaded Macedonia and defeated an army of Demetrius II shortly before his death in 229 BC.

500|$|His first book, Adrenaline, was {{published}} under the pseudonym James Dillinger. A {{story of two}} gay fugitive lovers on the run, it presaged the satire and drug fueled violence so prominent in his later books. Here Baker began developing the themes that dominated his following works: anarchy; angry and somewhat paranoid gay men; the dark underside of Los Angeles, juxtaposed with its sunny outward image; the hypocrisy of organized religion; anonymous sex and its implications {{in the age of}} AIDS; and homophobia and the oppression of gays <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> dominated America.See Also: Levy, Dan. [...] "Up-Front or Undercover?" [...] San Francisco Chronicle, June 20, 1993; Section: Sunday Review; Pg. 9 Its plot device of underdog characters forced into flight due to circumstances beyond their control was one Baker explored in all of his subsequent work. The modest success of this novel encouraged him to devote himself to what have become his best known works, Fuel-Injected Dreams (a novel revolving around a character loosely based on record producer Phil Spector) and the 1986 release Boy Wonder. After the novel {{was published}}, he stopped screenwriting in order to solely concentrate on books. He spent the bulk of each day writing and researching, and acted out characters and scenes of his novels on videotape to perfect the dialogue.|$|E

500|$|The {{day that}} a new poll showed McCain five points ahead in the state, Bush allied himself on stage with a {{marginal}} and controversial veterans activist named J.

[...] Incensed, McCain ran ads accusing Bush of lying and comparing the governor to Bill Clinton, which Bush complained was [...] "about as low a blow as you can give <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Republican</b> primary and many Republicans thought comparing Bush's truthfulness to Bill Clinton's dishonesty was distasteful smear by McCain."

[...] These claimed most famously that he had fathered a black child out of wedlock (the McCains' dark-skinned daughter Bridget was adopted from Bangladesh; this misrepresentation {{was thought to be}} an especially effective slur in a Deep South state where race was still central), but also that his wife Cindy was a drug addict, that he was a homosexual, and that he was a [...] "Manchurian Candidate" [...] traitor or mentally unstable from his North Vietnam POW days. [...] The Bush campaign strongly denied any involvement with these attacks; Bush said he would fire anyone who ran defamatory push polls.
