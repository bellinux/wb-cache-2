The far end of the line is usually marked with a brightly coloured buoy to show divers where it is and to help other boats avoid crossing the line. If there is any significant risk of a diver drifting away from the site, the dive boat should either be ready to slip the moorings at short notice, or have a tender in the water.

40|$|Abstract We {{compared}} the Atlantic and Mediterranean beach and foredune habitats of European interest, focusing on floristic, structural and ecological features. We selected two representative sites of Atlantic (The Netherlands) and Mediterranean (Italy) coastal dunes. From a georeferenced vegetation database, samples of: (a) annual vegetation on <b>drift</b> <b>lines</b> (European Union habitat type 1210), (b) {{embryonic shifting dunes}} (2110), and (c) shifting dunes along the shoreline with Ammophila arenaria (2120), were selected. Floristic representativity and comparability of plot sizes were considered. For each habitat, the frequency and the fidelity of the species, the life form frequency spectra and Ellenberg ecological indicator values were assessed. We found a consistent floristic differentiation between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean coastal dune habitats and only a small set of shared species. The Italian and the Dutch annual vegetation of <b>drift</b> <b>lines</b> (1210) register a high structural similarity that strongly declines landwards. Floristic composition, life forms and Ellenberg indicator values show higher similarities among different foredune habitats of the same site than between homologous habitats of the Mediterranean and Atlantic coasts.

Long-term memory formation in mammalian species has been demonstrated through a variety of conditioning tasks, however, the nature of long-term memory in fish is less known.

During the training sessions, fish were reinforced for approaching an upward <b>drifting</b> <b>line</b> grating. After a rest period of 12 days, fish demonstrated a significant preference for the upward drifting grating. To determine whether this preference could also be reversed, fish were then reinforced for approaching a downward <b>drifting</b> <b>line</b> grating after a 20 -day rest period. When tested 12 days later, {{there were no significant differences}} in preference for either stimulus; however, following a second training period for the downward stimulus, there was a significant preference for the downward drifting grating.

In both cases relative abundance was higher in the open zone. Those differences were not found in crab pot samples where male S. serrata in the Moresby River were significantly more abundant in the NTR. In terms of length frequency, greater proportions of larger A. berda and male S. serrata were captured in the Moresby NTR than outside. All non-significant results exhibited low power due to high variability and low catch rates. Although circumstantial without pre-closure data, results indicate that NTRs may lead to larger average sizes and higher abundances of male S. serrata in the Moresby River.

40|$|Beach traffic can {{substantially}} {{modify the}} physical environment on sandy beaches. Vehicle impacts on beaches were quantified on North Stradbroke Island, a barrier island {{on the east coast}} of Australia where large volumes of recreational off-road vehicle (ORV) traffic are concentrated on two beaches (Flinders Beach and Main Beach). The distribution, density, and depth of vehicle ruts on these beaches were quantified during the peak holiday period around late December and early January 2005 – 06. The density of tyre tracks per meter of beach face ranged from 2. 69 to 6. 35 on Flinders Beach and from 2. 38 to 8. 06 on Main Beach, and substantial areas (54 – 61 %) of each beach were covered withy tyre tracks up to a maximum of 90 % in some areas. ORVs corrugated the sand as deep as 28 cm (mean depth: 5. 86 ± 4. 72 cm), with the deepest rutting occurring between the foredunes and the <b>drift</b> <b>line.</b> On a volume basis, vehicles disrupted 5. 8 % (Main Beach) and 9. 4 % (Flinders Beach) of the available faunal habitat matrix (top 30 cm of the sand) in a single day. Traffic density was higher on the lower shore, but ruts were significantly deeper in the soft sand of the upper shore. Thus, half of all sand displaced by vehicles on Flinders Beach originated from the upper shore, although this section represents only 36 % of beach width. Similarly, the narrow (13 % of beach width) upper shore on Main Beach contributed 55 % of the total volume of sand dislodged by ORVs. Beach traffic overlapped to a large extent with the distribution of the invertebrate infauna, and vehicles routinely disturbed the <b>drift</b> <b>line</b> and the base of the foredunes.

40|$|International audienceEfficient {{detection}} of food patches in oceanic areas by pelagic predators is often linked to large-scale physical structures (e. g. fronts, upwellings) {{that are usually}} rich and predictable. At smaller scales, however, predictability of resource becomes less clear because of the lability of smaller physical structures such as slicks and <b>drift</b> <b>lines.</b> Here, we explore how light levels and quantity of flotsam affect the occurrence of foraging Yellow-bellied sea snakes (Pelamis platurus) on slicks. Although this pelagic species was formerly hypothesised to surface randomly and drift passively to reach slicks, our results show that foraging snakes are far more abundant on slicks if light levels are high and if slicks display flotsam. The combination of both light and flotsam should enhance the contrast between a potentially favourable slick and the adjacent waters as seen from an underwater viewpoint. Although our results do not unambiguously demonstrate the ability of Pelamis platurus to visually detect surface <b>drift</b> <b>lines,</b> they clearly suggest a role of both light levels and amount of flotsam on surfacing decision. Accordingly, {{this hypothesis is supported}} by several complementary traits that are specific to this species.

The paper sets out data from the survey of foredune habitats (annual vegetation of <b>drift</b> <b>lines,</b> embryonic dunes, mediterranean white dunes, sensu Directive 92 / 43 /EEC) in the San Rossore Estate sandy coast (Northern Tuscany, Italy) strongly subjected to erosion. The surveys, in addition to updating the information collected, aim to point out the arrangement of these habitats in relation to coastal retrogradation and foredune erosion, in order to identify appropriate management tools for mitigating disturbance factors.

It colonized several small islands and islets of this archipelago, without any apparent human assistance in some locations, and crossed several large rivers and alluvial plains. As aggregations of this species on the tidal <b>drift</b> <b>line</b> are common at the Kerguelen Islands, the present work examined whether adult individuals of M. soledadinus could disperse by flotation on the sea. Different sample sizes of ground beetles (from 1 to 10) were placed on sea water at 8 °C in plastic vials. Survival (50 % lethal times) significantly increased from 2. 1 ± 0. 2 days for single beetles to 6. 5 ± 0. 3 days for groups of 10 beetles per vial, with there being no difference in the survival duration for groups of 2, 5, and 10 beetles per vial. Similar survival durations were found for beetles in vials with artificially agitated water and controls. In addition, the duration of survival was twice as high under freshwater versus sea water conditions, when groups of 10 adults were used. Finally, the survival to total submersion in freshwater was evaluated, and ranged from 3 to 4 days. This ability to survive extended periods both floating on and/or submerged beneath salt and freshwater conditions, indicates the presence of a successful dispersal mechanism, which may facilitate the dispersal range of M. soledadinus across the Kerguelen Islands, comprising over 300 islands and islets in total...|$|E

The sediment was sieved through a 1 mm mesh and the organisms collected stored in 5 % formalin. To define beach types, Dean&# 39;s parameter (0) was calculated from wave heights and periods, and fall velocity of sand particles from the swash zone. Crustaceans (mainly peracarids) were the most diverse group with 14 species, followed by polychaetes with 5 species. The talitrid amphipod Orchestoidea tuberculata, the cirolanid isopods Excirolana braziliensis and E. hirsuticauda and the anomuran decapod Emerita analoga were the most widely distributed and common species. Regression analyses between species richness, abundance and biomass of the whole macroinfauna versus sediment characteristics, beach face slopes and morphodynamic beach states showed no significant relationships. Thus, macroinfaunal community characteristics did not increase linearly from lower intermediate to higher intermediate or dissipative beach states as had been found before in Chile or in other coasts.

Few studies examine clutch fate across {{the wide range of}} environments experienced by birds; instead, most focus at the small site scale. We examine survival of model shorebird clutches as an index of true clutch survival at a regional scale (∼ 200 km), encompassing a variety of geomorphologies, predator communities, and human use regimes in southeast Queensland, Australia. Of the 132 model nests deployed and monitored with cameras, 45 (34 %) survived the experimental exposure period. Thirty-five (27 %) were lost to flooding, 32 (24 %) were depredated, nine (7 %) buried by sand, seven (5 %) destroyed by people, three (2 %) failed by unknown causes, and one (1 %) was destroyed by a dog. Clutch fate differed substantially among regions, particularly with respect to losses from flooding and predation. ‘Topographic’ exposure was the main driver of mortality of nests placed close to the <b>drift</b> <b>line</b> near the base of dunes, which were lost to waves (particularly during storms) {{and to a lesser extent}} depredation. Predators determined the fate of clutches not lost to waves, with the depredation probability largely influenced by region.

40|$|Although {{terrestrial}} {{and marine}} ecosystems are often perceived as clearly distinct, in coastal areas biological communities {{on land and}} at sea are in fact intimately linked. One way in which terrestrial and marine systems interact is through the accumulation of seagrass wrack on beaches, which {{plays an important role}} as a nutrient input in coastal dune food webs. Here we test whether accumulated beach-cast wrack also influences the structure and diversity of coastal dune plant communities. Relying on a database of 572 vegetation surveys distributed across the island of Sardinia, we used mixed-effects models to compare the vegetation cover and species richness of plant communities exposed to different amounts of Posidonia oceanica beach-cast wrack. We found that beaches which receive high amounts of P.  oceanica wrack have considerably greater vegetation cover (10 % on average) than those with fewer deposits. The positive relationship between beach-cast wrack and vegetation cover was especially strong in nearshore plant communities, becoming progressively weaker along the habitat zonation. A similar pattern was found for species richness: beaches with high levels of accumulated wrack had more diverse <b>drift</b> <b>line</b> and foredune plant communities, while habitats further away from the shoreline were unaffected. Our study is the first to present evidence suggesting that activities which reduce wrack accumulation on beaches – either through direct removal of deposits or by causing P. oceanica seabeds to decline – can have effects on both the structure and diversity of coastal dune plant communities. Effective management of Mediterranean coastal dune ecosystems will require developing clear strategies for the removal and relocation of accumulated beach-cast wrack...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{available}} knowledge on sedimentology, hydrodynamics and five major ecosystem components (microphytobenthos, vascular plants, terrestrial arthropods, zoobenthos, and avifauna) of Belgian sandy beaches. It covers {{the area from}} the foredunes to the lower foreshore, takes an ecosystem approach to beaches of this specific geographic area. Morphodynamically, Belgian beaches are (ultra-) dissipative, macrotidal, and wide. Characteristic grain sizes are 160 - 380 µm. The sand becomes coarser, beach slopes steeper and tidal range smaller towards the south-west, where beaches have also been frequently reshaped by human interference such as nourishment. Beach organisms are highly adapted to this unique environment and can reach high numbers. We show that even on a heavily populated coastline subjected to intense recreational and development pressure, beaches provide critical, yet threatened, habitats. Vascular plants growing near the <b>drift</b> <b>line,</b> on the dry beach and in the embryonic dunes are mostly short-lived and thalassochorous; the most common species include sea rocket (Cakile maritima), prickly saltwort (Salsola kali subsp. kali), and sea sandwort (Honckenya peploides). These zones are habitat to a highly diverse suite of terrestrial arthropods of halobiontic, halophilous and haloxene species; prominent members are sandhoppers (Talitrus saltator) and dipterans (flies). Microphytobenthos, mainly diatoms, is an important primary producer on Belgian beaches but is not well known. The meio- and macrobenthos of Belgian beaches contains specific assemblages such as the Scolelepis squamata-Eurydice pulchra community of the upper intertidal zone. Birds no longer nest on the beaches itself, but Belgian sandy shores continue to function as important resting and foraging areas for birds such as the sanderling Calidris alba. We identify several human pressures on the beach ecosystems arising from recreation, beach management and fisheries...|$|E
50|$|They {{breed in}} warm waters; they are {{ovoviviparous}} with a gestation period around 6 months. According to Ditmars, females bear live young in tidal pools. They move poorly on land {{due to their}} smaller belly scales that form a ventral keel. They are sometimes observed in large aggregations of thousands {{on the surface of}} the water in oceanic <b>drift</b> <b>lines,</b> which has been proposed as a strategy to catch prey. They hunt by floating {{on the surface of the}} water to attract pelagic fish that are seeking shelter; prey are captured via a backwards swimming motion and rapid lunge of the jaws. Heatwole proposed that these snakes find their prey by sensing the vibration generated by fish movement. Fish are subdued by neurotoxic venom and swallowed whole.|$|R

It does not matter if the <b>drifting</b> <b>line</b> is wrong: it matters who has the most exciting drift. Normally, the leading car usually produces a maximum angle drift, but still closes off the inside line to prevent passing. The chasing car usually drifts with less angle, but very close to the lead car. However, the chasing car does not even have to keep up. In fact, in some cases, if a car that was left behind on the straight manages produces a beautiful drift, it could win that round. A spin, under-steer, or collision, results in a disqualification and a zero score for the offending party in that battle.|$|R
40|$|Simplicial Complexes {{are used}} to model {{topology}} in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Line intersection is an essential operation to update them. We introduce a finite-resolution line intersection method, called Zero Order Intersection, {{and apply it to}} simplicial complexes. Any reliable implementation of a line intersection algorithm has to address the limitations of a discrete computational environment. If handled improperly, finite representation can cause <b>drifting</b> <b>lines</b> and similar effects in otherwise topologically consistent data. The Zero Order Intersection method is designed to avoid such inconsistencies. Its application to simplicial complexes results in the Discrete Simplicial Data Model which guarantees consistency and reliability of topological queries within a GIS.
