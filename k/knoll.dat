5|$|Around 10:00 Kemal and the 1st Battalion, 57th Infantry {{were the}} first to arrive in the area between Scrubby <b>Knoll</b> and Chunuk Bair. From the <b>knoll</b> Kemal was able to observe the landings. He ordered the {{artillery}} battery to set up on the <b>knoll,</b> and the 1st Battalion to attack Baby 700 and Mortar Ridge from the North-East, while the 2nd Battalion would simultaneously circle around and attack Baby 700 from the West. The 3rd Battalion would for the moment be held in reserve. At 10:30 Kemal informed II Corps he was attacking.|$|E
5|$|An Anglo-Saxon {{spearhead}} {{was found}} in July 1962 by D. Tamkin in a cutting through a natural <b>knoll</b> of sand on Messrs Reed's playing fields at Cobdown, Ditton. It {{is possible that the}} spearhead came from a grave {{on the top of the}} <b>knoll,</b> destroyed during the making or widening of the cutting.|$|E
5|$|Leavelle's {{design is}} based on Texan detective Jim Leavelle, as he {{appeared}} when escorting Lee Harvey Oswald when Oswald was shot by Jack Ruby. Leavelle trains the bodyguards by pretending to shoot their protectee from a grassy <b>knoll</b> on a cart. This is {{a reference to the}} grassy <b>knoll</b> at the site of President John F. Kennedy’s assassination, Dealey Plaza and a scene from the Kennedy assassination film Executive Action (1973).|$|E
50|$|Country <b>Knolls</b> is {{primarily}} the name {{belonging to the}} housing development Country <b>Knolls</b> Estates which is sometimes also referred to Country <b>Knolls</b> North or as the original Country <b>Knolls</b> to clarify the difference between it and another housing development Country <b>Knolls</b> South that was built a few miles south of Country <b>Knolls.</b> The census-designated place Country <b>Knolls</b> is within and smaller than the larger Country <b>Knolls</b> Estates.

5|$|The most {{challenging}} {{stage of the}} takeoff is carrying the speed from the inrun with sufficient height over the 'knoll', and achieving the correct trajectory down the hill. The <b>knoll</b> is the highest point of the hill itself, from which it begins to slope downwards. On modern ski flying hills the table is placed considerably far back from the <b>knoll,</b> so as to reduce the steepness of the flight curve. A skilled athlete is able to aggressively 'snap' into the transition so as to clear the <b>knoll</b> with ease, thereby allowing them to focus completely on using their specialised aerodynamic flying technique to maximise distance further down the hill. Athletes of the highest skill level can consistently compensate for any lack of inrun speed with perfect timing {{off the table and}} an excellent transition.|$|E

5|$|According to Karl James, no {{detailed}} {{orders were}} produced {{for the attack}} and deliberate planning was hastily completed {{with little or no}} co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to increase the size of the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's <b>Knoll,</b> having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the <b>knoll,</b> to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.|$|E

5|$|At 09:00 Sefik {{and his two}} battalions were {{approaching}} Kavak Tepe, and made contact with his 2nd Battalion that had conducted a fighting withdrawal, and {{an hour and a}} half later the regiment was deployed to stop the ANZACs advancing any further. Around 10:00 Kemal arrived at Scrubby <b>Knoll</b> and steadied some retreating troops, pushing them back into a defensive position. As they arrived, the 57th Infantry Regiment were given their orders and prepared to counter-attack. Scrubby <b>Knoll,</b> known to the Turks as Kemalyeri (Kemal's Place), now became the site of the Turkish headquarters for the remainder of the campaign.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Slater's <b>Knoll</b> (28 March– 6 April 1945) was {{a battle}} during the Second World War fought between Australian and Japanese forces on Bougainville Island. Part of the Bougainville campaign, the battle {{occurred}} {{as a force}} of about 3,300 Japanese from the Japanese 6th Division supported by a sizeable concentration of artillery launched a counterattack against the main Australian offensive which had been pushing south towards Buin, concentrating their attacks on Slater's <b>Knoll</b> near the Puriata River. The Australian troops belonged to the 7th Brigade, with the 25th Infantry Battalion being the most heavily engaged, although the 9th Infantry Battalion and the 61st Infantry Battalion also {{took part in the}} fighting.|$|E
5|$|A binder {{with the}} film's storyboards {{served as a}} {{reference}} for live-action filming, shots that would be filmed {{in front of a}} chroma key blue screen, and shots that would be composed using CGI. The sets were often built with the parts that would be required on screen; often they were built only up to the heights of the actors. Chroma key was extensively used for digital set extensions, backgrounds or scenes that required cinematographer David Tattersall to seek powerful lamps to light the sets and visual effects supervisor John <b>Knoll</b> to develop software that would remove the blue reflection from shiny floors. <b>Knoll,</b> who remained on set through most of the production, worked closely with Tatterstall to ensure that the shots were suitable to add effects later. The cameras were fitted with data capture models to provide technical data for the CGI artists.|$|E

5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the <b>knoll</b> and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to glide more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This has significantly reduced such precarious heights over the <b>knoll</b> {{as was the case in}} the early 1990s and prior: in that era, athletes using the parallel style would jump in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than glide, they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the <b>knoll.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{the days}} {{immediately}} after the battle, the Australians continued to carry out patrolling operations around the <b>knoll.</b> On 7 April, a patrol from the 9th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force of about 30 men and in the ensuing engagement four Japanese were killed, while a patrol from the 61st Infantry Battalion on 8 April killed another five. On 13 April, the order was given that the 7th Brigade would be gradually withdrawn and relieved by the 15th. Shortly afterwards, the 58th/59th Infantry Battalion replaced the 25th in occupation of the <b>knoll,</b> while the 24th Infantry Battalion resumed the advance along the Buin Road on 17 April, subsequently {{taking part in the}} fighting along the Hongorai River. The 9th Infantry Battalion, however, was not withdrawn immediately, and remained in the northern area until it handed over to the 57th/60th Infantry Battalion in early May. The fighting on Bougainville continued throughout April as the Japanese resisted the Australian advance and went on until July when the fighting petered out due to heavy rain and flooding.|$|E

40|$|Seamounts and <b>knolls</b> are ‘undersea mountains’, {{the former}} rising more than 1000 m from the seafloor. These {{features}} provide important habitats for aquatic predators, demersal deep-sea fish and benthic invertebrates. However most seamounts {{have not been}} surveyed and their numbers and locations are not well known. Previous efforts to locate and quantify seamounts have used relatively coarse bathymetry grids. Here we use global bathymetric data at 30 arc-sec resolution to identify seamounts and <b>knolls.</b> We identify 33, 452 seamounts and 138, 412 <b>knolls,</b> representing the largest global set of identified seamounts and <b>knolls</b> to date. We compare estimated seamount numbers, locations, and depths with validation sets of seamount data from New Zealand and Azores. This comparison indicates the method we apply finds 94 % of seamounts, but may overestimate seamount numbers along ridges and in areas where faulting and seafloor spreading creates highly complex topography. The seamounts and <b>knolls</b> identified herein are significantly geographically biased towards areas surveyed with ship-based soundings. As only 6. 5 % of the ocean floor has been surveyed with soundings {{it is likely that}} new seamounts will be uncovered as surveying improves. Seamount habitats constitute approximately 4. 7 % of the ocean floor, whilst <b>knolls</b> cover 16. 3 %. Regional distribution of these features is examined, and we find a disproportionate number of productive <b>knolls,</b> with a summit depth of < 1. 5 km, located in the Southern Ocean. Less than 2 % of seamounts are within marine protected areas and the majority of these are located within exclusive economic zones with few on the High Seas. The database of seamounts and <b>knolls</b> resulting from this study will be a useful resource for researchers and conservation planners...|$|R
