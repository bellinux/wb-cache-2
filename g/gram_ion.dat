40|$|The isotopic {{exchange}} reaction between gaseous deuterium and aqueous potassium hydrox-ide solution was investigated at various concentrations of hydroxyl ion ranging from 0. 01 to 1 <b>gram</b> <b>ion</b> per liter and at 100 °C. The reaction was confirmed to be homogeneous, with the rate {{proportional to the}} partial pressure of deuterium gas and to the concentration of hydroxyl ion. "Impurities " in the potassium hydroxide alleged to catalyze the exchange in a previous work was disproved. The hydroxyl-ion concentration of the solution after the reaction in a glass vessel was determined by means of pH meter; the pH decreased rapidly as {{the volume of the}} solution was smaller. It was concluded that the exchange reaction is catalyzed by hydroxyl-ion and that the decay of catalytic acivity of the solution is caused by the decrease in hydroxyl-ion concentration through a reaction of alkali with glass of the reaction vessel...|$|E
50|$|Cation {{exchange}} capacity should {{be thought of}} as the soil's ability to remove cations from the soil water solution and sequester those to be exchanged later as the plant roots release hydrogen ions to the solution. CEC is the amount of exchangeable hydrogen cation (H+) that will combine with 100 grams dry weight of soil and whose measure is one milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil (1 meq/100 g). Hydrogen ions have a single charge and one-thousandth of a <b>gram</b> of hydrogen <b>ions</b> per 100 <b>grams</b> dry soil gives a measure of one milliequivalent of hydrogen ion. Calcium, with an atomic weight 40 times that of hydrogen and with a valence of two, converts to (40/2) x 1 milliequivalent = 20 milliequivalents of hydrogen <b>ion</b> per 100 <b>grams</b> of dry soil or 20 meq/100 g. The modern measure of CEC is expressed as centimoles of positive charge per kilogram (cmol/kg) of oven-dry soil.|$|R
40|$|In this approach, {{polyelectrolyte}} film-coated nanofibrous silk fibroin (SF) nonwovens {{were prepared}} from the alternate deposition of positively charged polyethylenimine (PEI) and negatively charged SF using electrostatic layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembled technology. The composite membranes {{were characterized by}} scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer. The SF-PEI multilayer-assembled nanofibers (less than five layers) were fine and uniform with the fiber diameter from 400 nm to 600 nm, and had very large surface area and high porosity (more than 70 %). The amino groups of PEI were proved to be deposited onto SF nonwovens, which granted the coated nonwovens with potential applicability for copper ions adsorption. The PEI films coated SF substrate showed much higher copper ions adsorption capacity than that of ethanol treated SF nanofibers. Adding the number of PEI coated could enhance the Cu 2 + adsorption capacity significantly. The maximum milligrams per <b>gram</b> of copper <b>ions</b> adsorbed reached 59. 7 mg/g when the SF substrate was coated with 5 bilayers of SF-PEI. However, the copper ions adsorption capacity had no obvious change {{as the number of}} PEI continued to increase. These results suggest potential for PEL film-coated nanofibrous nonwovens as a new adsorbent for metal ions...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{supplemental}} Ca 2 + supply and NaCl salinity on {{the levels of}} the osmoticants; proline, glycinebetaine and activities of proline metabolism enzymes viz pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate reductase (P- 5 -CR), proline oxidase, γ-glutamyl kinase on root and shoot of salt tolerant cv. T- 44 were investigated. During germination of seeds of green gram subjected to NaCl salinity stress, proline and glycinebetaine contents in the root and shoot increased continuously. A further increase in proline and glycinebetaine concentration was observed {{with the addition of}} 5 mM CaCl 2 to 200 mM (maximum salinity stress). Calcium ions {{play an important role in}} osmoprotection. The effects of Na + and Ca 2 + are thus additive in causing accumulation of proline and glycinebetaine. Ca appears to confer greater osmoprotection to the seedling exposed to salinity. P- 5 -CR and γ-glutamyl kinase play an important role in the synthesis of proline, while another enzyme proline oxidase catalyzes the conversion of proline to glutamate, thus reducing the levels of proline. Addition of 5 mM CaCl 2 to 200 mM NaCl-stressed plants increased the proline concentration by decreasing the level of proline oxidase and increasing the levels of γ-glutamyl kinase and P- 5 -CR activities. Salinity stress, in the absence of calcium, increased proline due to decreased proline oxidase activity and increased accumulation of P- 5 -C reductase and γ-glutamyl kinase activities in both root and shoot of green <b>gram.</b> Thus, calcium <b>ions</b> increase both proline and glycinebetaine production in NaCl stressed green gram seedlings...|$|R
