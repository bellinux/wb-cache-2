25|$|Upon {{activation}} (in platelets) {{or injury}} (in erythrocytes, platelets, endothelium, and other cells), certain cells expose the phospholipid phosphatidylserine on their surface {{and act as}} catalysts to induce the coagulation cascade. Surface exposure of phosphatidylserine {{is thought to be}} brought about by the activation of scramblases. Several enzyme complexes of blood coagulation cascade such as tenase and prothrombinase are activated by the cell surface exposure of the phosphatidylserine. However, the most studied member of the scramblase family PLSCR1 was shown to be defective in translocation of phospholipids when reconstituted into proteoliposomes in vitro. Although recent studies show that PLSCR1 is neither sufficient nor necessary for the phosphatidylserine <b>externalization,</b> the involvement of PLSCR1 in blood coagulation remains elusive, raising the question of additional membrane components in the <b>externalization</b> pathway. To date, no report is available on the involvement of any other identified member of PLSCRs in blood clotting.|$|E

Boys often will experience forms of post-traumatic stress disorder, but also additional stressors of social stigma of homosexuality associated with sexual abuse for boys, and <b>externalization</b> of blame, increased anger, and desire for revenge.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the school}} {{concerned}} with ideological differences, another theory seeks clarification in <b>externalization</b> of the Spanish case; instead of pointing to unique Spanish character of Carlism, it highlights general European patterns of change. With ultramontanism gaining upper hand over more conciliatory political incarnations of Catholicism after the First Vatican Council, {{and with the}} new approach made popular in the neighboring France by Louis Veuillot, the 1888 schism {{was nothing but a}} local Spanish manifestation of the trend. Defining the nascent Integrism as religious particularism striving for hegemony, this theory enjoys rather limited popularity.|$|E
30|$|Finally, it {{was also}} {{mentioned}} as a criticism, {{that it would be}} nice to hear from Japanese individuals within the system. This particular study focused on purely the <b>externalizations</b> of foreigners acculturating within the environment, and there were not any Japanese participants. It was said that having Japanese feedback to certain <b>externalizations</b> would be beneficial in understanding the Japanese perspective. This is another area that could be brought up for future work.|$|R
30|$|Other {{students}} {{expressed a}} deeper level of reflection occurring via use of the system. When they reviewed their <b>externalizations</b> from within the context itself, they mentioned {{that they had a}} better understanding of their own thinking and actions within this context. One student mentioned that reviewing their <b>externalizations</b> on a different day—when they were in a different emotional state—provided a way to see the context in a different light and also to think about their actions and thoughts from a new perspective.|$|R
30|$|Strong contextual {{relevance}} {{was another}} area {{brought up by}} the majority of users. The users understood that the comments given, the issues externalized, and the interactions taking place were all from within the post-graduate university context and that the people behind these utterances were going through similar adjustment difficulties to those they themselves were. In addition, the users felt that “inserting their knowledge” into the area in which the issue occurred (via GPS locator information attached to the logs) was “unique” and “powerful”. Judging from user feedback, being able to read the <b>externalizations</b> of other individuals, from the exact same place in which these <b>externalizations</b> were posted, proved to be quite beneficial in understanding the issues themselves.|$|R
25|$|The {{possibility}} of psychopathy {{has been associated}} with organized crime, economic crime and war crimes. Terrorists are sometimes considered psychopathic, and comparisons may be drawn with traits such as antisocial violence, a selfish world view that precludes the welfare of others, a lack of remorse or guilt, and blame <b>externalization.</b> However, John Horgan, author of The Psychology of Terrorism, argues that such comparisons could also then be drawn more widely: for example, to soldiers in wars. Coordinated terrorist activity requires organization, loyalty and ideological fanaticism often to the extreme of sacrificing oneself for an ideological cause. Traits such as a self-centered disposition, unreliability, poor behavioral controls, and unusual behaviors may disadvantage or preclude psychopathic individuals in conducting organized terrorism.|$|E
500|$|According to Daniel Hoffman, Whitman [...] "is a poet whose {{hallmark}} is anaphora". Hoffman {{describes the}} use of the anaphoric verse as [...] "a poetry of beginnings" [...] and that Whitman's use of its repetition and similarity at the inception of each line is [...] "so necessary as the norm against which all variations and departures are measured...what follows is varied, the parallels and the ensuing words, phrases, and clauses lending the verse its delicacy, its charm, its power". Further, the device allows Whitman [...] "to vary the tempo or feeling, to build up climaxes or drop off in innuendoes" [...] Scholar Stanley Coffman analyzed Whitman's catalogue technique through the application of Ralph Waldo Emersons comment that such lists are suggestive of the metamorphosis of [...] "an imaginative and excited mind". According to Coffman, Emerson adds that because [...] "the universe is the <b>externalization</b> of the soul, and its objects symbols, manifestations of the one reality behind them, Words which name objects also carry with them the whole sense of nature and are themselves to be understood as symbols. [...] Thus a list of words (objects) will be effective in giving to the mind, under certain conditions, a heightened sense not only of reality but of the variety and abundance of its manifestations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cytowic's early cases mainly {{included}} {{individuals whose}} synesthesia was frankly projected outside the body (e.g. on a [...] "screen" [...] {{in front of}} one's face). Later research showed that such stark <b>externalization</b> occurs in a minority of synesthetes. Refining this concept, Cytowic and Eagleman differentiated between [...] "localizers" [...] and [...] "non-localizers" [...] to distinguish those synesthetes whose perceptions have a definite sense of spatial quality from those whose perceptions do not.|$|E
50|$|Socialists {{argue that}} the {{accumulation}} of capital generates waste through <b>externalizations</b> that require costly corrective regulatory measures. They {{also point out that}} this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products to be sold at a profit (such as high-pressure advertisement); thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.|$|R
30|$|As users {{continued}} {{to add to}} existing log entries and, in addition, made comments or gave advice, the system provided a way to gauge the behavioral change, knowledge level, and progress within these users. Although {{the time of the}} study was short, correlation between early logs uploaded into the system and subsequent <b>externalizations</b> provided insight into the reasoning process utilized by the participants in certain situations. To expand on this, when a user had externalized certain experiential and contextual problems into the system and has had comments from others in relation to this problem or issue, this user then commented effectively on the uploaded <b>externalizations</b> of others in similar situations. These interactions were effectively monitored via this system and provided a way to observe these students without invading personal space. Previous research demonstrates the issues associated with observations on student interactions when co-locating the same space (Rodrigo et al. 2014), and thus perhaps, a system such as this may alleviate some of these problems.|$|R
30|$|The final area {{in which}} two users {{expressed}} difficulty was {{in relation to the}} amount of time needed to input <b>externalizations</b> that were detailed and that also contained questions. The original system was designed with vocabulary building in mind, so written paragraphs etc., may have been somewhat difficult to input. Another possible reason for this {{comes from the fact that}} not all of the users were familiar with the Android operating system itself.|$|R
2500|$|Stating {{that there}} was, in effect, a unity between person and {{material}} nature, Rădulescu-Motru developed {{his own version}} of Personalism, which thought of the human being and its personality as the goal of evolution in nature– a theory he called Energetic Personalism. He recognized the influence of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's views on the relation between being and the whole, arguing that his idealist concept of <b>externalization</b> ("the belief that the world is being led by our ideal", which he deemed [...] "transitory Personalism") had been the driving force behind all modern ideologies, from Socialism and Anarchism to Liberalism (see Right Hegelians and Left Hegelians).|$|E
2500|$|In 1982, Bailey's {{influence}} {{appeared in}} pop culture, {{with the release}} of Van Morrison's album Beautiful Vision, in which he directly referred to the teachings and the Tibetan in the lyrics of the songs [...] "Dweller on the Threshold" [...] and [...] "Aryan Mist". Morrison also used the phrase [...] "world of glamour", reminiscent of Bailey's Glamour: A World Problem, in the songs [...] "Ivory Tower" [...] and [...] "Green Mansions". The song Ancient of Days from the 1984 Sense of Wonder album appears to be a reference to a Bailey concept found in such books as The <b>Externalization</b> of the Hierarchy. Alice A. Bailey and the Tibetan's Glamour: A World Problem is also directly cited in the liner notes to Morrison's album Inarticulate Speech of the Heart.|$|E
2500|$|Pollution has cost. [...] Manufacturing {{activities}} that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs {{on the whole}} society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of <b>externalization</b> is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in public safety, less of the good may be produced than {{would be the case}} if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others.|$|E

2500|$|At a Fordham lecture in 1999, Tom Wolfe {{suggested}} that a major under-acknowledged influence on McLuhan's work is the Jesuit philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin whose ideas anticipated those of McLuhan, especially {{the evolution of the}} human mind into the [...] "noosphere". In fact, McLuhan warns against outright dismissing or whole-heartedly accepting de Chardin's observations early on in his first published book The Mechanical Bride (p.32): [...] "This <b>externalization</b> of our senses creates what de Chardin calls the 'noosphere' or a technological brain for the world. Instead of tending towards a vast Alexandrian library the world has become a computer, an electronic brain, exactly as in an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and super-imposed co-existence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Researchers Caitlin Buon and Tony Buon have {{suggested}} that attempts to profile ‘the bully’ have been damaging [...] They state that the [...] "bully" [...] profile is that ‘the bully’ is always aware {{of what they are}} doing, deliberately sets out to harm their ‘victims’, targets a particular individual or type of person and has some kind of underlying personality flaw, insecurity or disorder. But this is unproven and lacks evidence. The researchers suggest referring to workplace bullying as generic harassment along with other forms of non-specific harassment and this would enable employees to use less emotionally charged language and start a dialogue about their experiences rather than being repelled by the spectre of being labelled as a pathological predator or having to define their experiences as the victims of such a person. Tony Buon and Caitlin Buon also suggest that the perception and profile of the workplace bully is not facilitating [...] interventions with the problem. They suggest that to make significant progress and achieve behaviour change over the long term then, organisations and individuals need to embrace the notion that everyone must all potentially house ‘the bully’ within them and their organisations. It exists in workplace cultures, belief systems, interactions [...] and [...] emotional competencies and cannot be transformed if <b>externalization</b> and demonization continue the problem by profiling ‘the bully’ rather than talking about behaviours and interpersonal [...] interactions.|$|E

30|$|Unlike experiences, {{embodiments}} can {{be observed}} and described, which makes them fruitful for empirical research. They are visible, perceptible and can be experienced – as an embodied expression or as a response in front of others. With theories of embodiment, subjective <b>externalizations</b> can be empirically described in their non-verbal dimensions. Subjective meaning becomes graspable for qualitative empirical research because it enters social and worldly interactions and embodies itself within these interactions. In practice, subjective meaning and social meaning intersect. This chiasm (Merleau-Ponty 1968, p. 328) promises to prove very fruitful as a basic figure of experience and the reconstruction of experience in empirical pedagogical research.|$|R
30|$|As {{reflected}} in the post-system interviews with the participants, the users found benefit in having their <b>externalizations</b> embedded within the context or environment itself. As mentioned previously, {{it is said that}} contextual knowledge acquisition and sharing are seen as important (Hwang et al. 2008, Gertler 2003), and thus, for an individual to effectively acculturate to a new environment, individual’s experiences within a particular context are more effectively shared and reflected upon within that same context. The ULL system uniquely allows knowledge to be shared and disseminated amongst all users of the system but remains attached to the context or environment itself. This is what we call the “knowledge-embedded environment”.|$|R

30|$|A few users {{experienced}} errors {{when using}} the system, which did provide a level of frustration in regards to lost comments or <b>externalizations.</b> These errors were mainly {{in relation to the}} retooling of the system itself. As not all of the original functionality from the ULL was needed, there were some menu items that were not relevant or fully functional, thus causing some issues. Once the users became accustomed to what was being used and what was not being used, the rate of error reports decreased dramatically. This is something that will be looked into in future studies, in which of course an updated interface design will be implemented.|$|R

30|$|Understanding is {{therefore}} not a process of drawing conclusions from the outside to the inside (Dilthey 2010), also not a process of decoding, but an embodied practice of responding. ‘Higher’, objective or semiotic understanding has its foundation in an elementary live-world, embodied understanding as resonance and responsivity. We are already {{live in a world}} structured by understanding (Schütz 1967), before we understand hermeneutically or semiotically. In this practice, embodied <b>externalizations</b> and embodiments incarnate as affects and responses.
