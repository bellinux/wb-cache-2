5|$|CMLL <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> {{declare the}} {{championship}} vacant four times. Each time, the reigning champion left CMLL without losing a match and the championship to whichever successor CMLL picked. Under normal circumstances, wrestlers give notice, or their contract is not renewed, and the championship transitions {{to a different}} wrestler. In the case of Cien Caras, Steel, and Héctor Garza, their departures from the company were so sudden and unexpected that no plans were in place and CMLL had to organize a tournament to determine the next champion. In Máximo Sexy's case he was fired from the company while still the champion, causing the championship to be vacated as a result.|$|E

The government <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> adopt austerity measures and is now less able to collect revenue through the sectorial funds, since company profits are down in many quarters. Industrial output declined by 2.8% between November and December 2014 and by 3.2% over the entire year.

The village is rife with rumors of witchcraft and a crowd gathers outside Rev. Parris' house.

He questions the girls' apparent ringleader, his niece Abigail Williams, whom Parris <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> adopt after her parents were brutally killed in the Pequot War.
