50|$|There are two {{traditional}} {{types of}} compression fitting, standard (British type-A/non-manipulative) and <b>flare</b> <b>fittings</b> (British type-B/manipulative). Standard fittings require no {{modifications to the}} tubing. <b>Flare</b> <b>fittings</b> require modification of the tubing with a special tool. Standard fittings are typically used for water and compressed air connections, whereas <b>flare</b> <b>fittings</b> are used for gas and high pressure lines.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flare</b> <b>fittings,</b> are metal to metal {{compression}} seals deformed with a cone nut {{and pressed}} into a flare mating.|$|R
50|$|AN <b>fittings</b> are a <b>flare</b> <b>fitting,</b> using 37° <b>flared</b> tubing {{to form a}} metal-metal seal. They {{are similar}} to other 37° <b>flared</b> <b>fittings,</b> such as JIC, which is their {{industrial}} variant. The two are interchangeable in theory, though this is typically not recommended due to the exacting specifications and demands of the aerospace industry. The differences between them relate to thread class and shape (how tight a fit the threads are), and the metals used.|$|R
50|$|<b>Flared</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{appropriate}} alternatives to solder-type joints when {{the use of}} an open flame is either not desired or impractical. Copper tube used for propane, LP, or natural gas may use <b>flared</b> brass <b>fittings</b> of single 45°-flare type, according to NFPA 54/ANSI. Z223.1 National Fuel Gas Code. The copper tube types used for water service applications commonly uses a flare to iron pipe connection when connecting to the main or the meter. Many plumbing codes, towns, and water companies require type L copper tubing or HDPE pipe in order to provide water service. All National Model Codes permit the use of <b>flare</b> <b>fitting</b> joints, however, the authority having jurisdiction (AHJ) should be consulted to determine acceptance for a specific application.|$|R
50|$|Liquid line {{fittings}} {{are mostly}} made from brass. The fittings typically adapt from a thread in a component, {{such as a}} BSP or NPT threaded hole on a tank, to an SAE <b>flare</b> <b>fitting</b> to suit the ends of pipes or hoses.|$|R

The color of the plastic signifies whether the line contains gas (grey) versus liquid (black); these specimens are both for liquid lines.|$|R
40|$|Two-part {{coupling}} system for hose lines combines both connection and filter in one <b>fitting.</b> <b>Flared</b> <b>fittings</b> make coupling {{less prone to}} leakage, and reduced number of components speeds operation. These features may make coupler useful with liquid-bulk carriers, where materials (e. g., milk, cooking oil, and liquid sugar) must be transferred quickly from vehicle to storage facility...|$|R
50|$|Most {{large cities}} today pipe solid wastes to sewage {{treatment}} plants {{in order to}} separate and partially purify the water, before emptying into streams or other bodies of water. For potable water use, galvanized iron piping was commonplace in the United States from the late 1800s until around 1960. After that period, copper piping took over, first soft copper with <b>flared</b> <b>fittings,</b> then with rigid copper tubing utilizing soldered fittings.|$|R
50|$|Where many {{connections}} {{must be made}} in a {{short period}} of time (such as plumbing of a new building), soldering is quicker and less expensive joinery than compression or <b>flare</b> <b>fittings.</b> A degree of skill is needed to make a number of reliable soldered joints quickly. If flux residue is thoroughly cleaned, soldering can produce a long-lasting connection at low cost. However, the use of an open flame for heating joints can present fire and health hazards to building occupants, and requires adequate ventilation.|$|R
50|$|Flared {{connectors}} {{should not}} be confused with compression connectors, with which they are generally not interchangeable. Lacking a compression ring, they use a tapered conical shaped connection instead. A specialized flaring tool is used to enlarge tubing into a 45º tapered bell shape matching the projecting shape of the <b>flare</b> <b>fitting.</b> The <b>flare</b> nut, which had previously been installed over the tubing, is then tightened over the fitting to force the tapered surfaces tightly together. Flare connectors are typically made of brass or plastic, but stainless steel or other materials may be used.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flare</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{a type of}} {{compression}} fitting used with metal tubing, usually soft steel, ductile (soft) copper and aluminum, though other materials are also used. Tube flaring {{is considered to be}} a type of forging operation, and is usually a cold working procedure. During assembly, a flare nut is used to secure the flared tubing's tapered end to the also tapered fitting, producing a pressure-resistant, leak-tight seal. Flared connections offer a high degree of long-term reliability and for this reason are often used in mission-critical and inaccessible locations.|$|R
50|$|JIC fittings, {{defined by}} the SAE J514 and MIL-F-18866 standards, are a type of <b>flare</b> <b>fitting</b> {{machined}} with a 37-degree flare seating surface. JIC (Joint Industry Council) fittings are widely used in fuel delivery and fluid power applications, especially where high pressure (up to 10,000 psi) is involved. The SAE J514 standard replaces the MS16142 military specification, although some tooling is still listed under MS16142. JIC fittings are dimensionally identical to AN (Army-Navy) fittings, but are produced to less exacting tolerances and are generally less costly. SAE 45-degree <b>flare</b> <b>fittings</b> are similar in appearance, but are not interchangeable, though dash sizes 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 14, and 16 share the same thread size. Some couplings may have dual machined seats for both 37-degree and 45-degree flare seats.Komatsu and JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard) <b>fittings</b> have <b>flare</b> ends similar to JIC fittings. Komatsu and JIS both use a 30-degree flare seating surface. The only difference is Komatsu uses milimeter thread sizes while JIS use a BSP (British Standard Pipe) thread. JIC fitting systems have three components that make a tubing assembly: <b>fitting,</b> <b>flare</b> nut, and sleeve. As with other flared connection systems, the seal is achieved through metal-to-metal contact between the finished surface of the fitting nose and the inside diameter of the flared tubing. The sleeve is used to evenly distribute the compressive forces of the flare nut to the flared end of the tube. Materials commonly used to fabricate JIC fittings include forged carbon steel, forged stainless steel, forged brass, machined brass, Monel and nickel-copper alloys.|$|R
50|$|Solder {{fittings}} are smooth, {{and easily}} slip onto {{the end of}} a tubing section. The joint is then heated using a torch, and solder is melted into the connection. When the solder cools, it forms a very strong bond which can last for decades. Solder-connected rigid copper is the most popular choice for water supply lines in modern buildings. In situations where many connections must be made at once (such as plumbing of a new building), solder offers much quicker and much less expensive joinery than compression or <b>flare</b> <b>fittings.</b> The term sweating is sometimes used to describe the process of soldering pipes.|$|R
5000|$|The tool used {{to flare}} tubing {{consists}} of a die that grips the tube and a mandrel that is forced into {{the end of the}} tube to form the flare by cold working. The most common <b>flare</b> <b>fitting</b> standards in use today are the 45-degree SAE style, and the 37-degree AN style, also used with the JIC system. The AN/JIC style generally has a higher pressure rating for a given size tubing. SAE and AN/JIC fittings are completely incompatible due to the different flare angle. Further, AN fittings (or those complying with subsequent standards) and JIC fittings are not interchangeable for design-controlled applications due to differing quality standards. The refrigeration and air conditioning industry usually uses 45° flare connections while hydraulic hoses are usually 37-1/2° flare connections.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, copper {{tubes are}} {{soldered}} directly into copper or brass fittings, although compression, crimp, or <b>flare</b> <b>fittings</b> are also used. Formerly, concerns with copper supply tubes included the lead {{used in the}} solder at joints (50% tin and 50% lead). Some studies have shown significant [...] "leaching" [...] of the lead into the potable water stream, particularly after long periods of low usage, followed by peak demand periods. In hard water applications, shortly after installation, {{the interior of the}} pipes will be coated with the deposited minerals that had been dissolved in the water, and therefore the vast majority of exposed lead is prevented from entering the potable water. Building codes now require lead-free solder. Building codes throughout the U.S. require the use of virtually [...] "lead-free" [...] (<0.2% lead) solder or filler metals in plumbing fittings and appliances as well.|$|R
50|$|Copper pipes are {{typically}} joined by soldering, brazing, compression <b>fittings,</b> <b>flaring,</b> or crimping.Plastic pipes may {{be joined by}} solvent welding, heat fusion, or elastomeric sealing.|$|R
50|$|Flare {{connections}} {{require that}} the end of a tubing section be spread outward in a bell shape using a flare tool. A flare nut then compresses this bell-shaped end onto a male <b>fitting.</b> <b>Flare</b> connections are a labor-intensive method of making connections, but are quite reliable over the course of many years.|$|R
50|$|Aluminium is {{sometimes}} used {{due to its}} low cost, resistance to corrosion and solvents, and its ductility. Aluminium tube is more desirable than steel for the conveyance of flammable solvents, since it cannot create sparks when manipulated. Aluminium tubing can be connected by <b>flare</b> or compression <b>fittings,</b> {{or it can be}} welded by the TIG or heliarc processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{individual}} isotopes of C, N and O {{are measured}} in the large solar particle event of August 1978. Limits are placed on mass dependent selection effects occurring in the solar <b>flare</b> by <b>fitting</b> a simple mass fractionation law to measurements of the C, N, O and Mg isotopes, to relate the SEP composition more directly to {{the composition of the}} sun. The individual isotopes are found to be consistent with solar system abundances, and the absence of any observable fractionation for C, O and Mg leads to the conclusion that solar neon is most likely neon-A with Ne- 22 /Ne- 20 equals 0. 12...|$|R
40|$|The Salt Valve and Instrumentation Test {{was done}} to provide data on {{equipment}} performance in high temperature environments similar to that expected in the next large scale application of that technology. The experiment tested three different valves: (1) a valve with the standard valve body and standard high temperature self-packing material; (2) a valve with the standard valve body and stainless steel O-rings; and (3) a magnetic valve that uses a high temperature coil and no packing material. The first valve, which was used at Solar Two, performed sufficiently throughout the test with only a small leak from the split-body, not the packing material, on the 6 th day of testing on the long-term test. The second valve, with the stainless steel O-rings, developed a small leak on the last run of the third test at the bonnet (packing material), at which point it was noted to watch if it got worse and the test continued. By the 6 th day of the long-term test, the leak was significant (up to 3 cups per day) and the test was terminated. The magnetic valve failed when exposed to a relatively low temperature of 500 F. According to the manufacturer, it was expected to survive up to temperatures of 600 F. Two different pressure transducers were tested and compared, Taylor and Dynisco. The Taylor pressure transducer was used and proven successful at Solar Two. However, {{they are no longer}} made. Therefore the experiment tested a new pressure transducer from Dynisco and compared the results to that of the Taylor. The Dynisco pressure transducer performed inaccurately from the beginning. The pressure transducer was affected by an increase in temperature when the pressure remained the same. Dynisco agreed to recalibrate the pressure transducer and/or send us a new one if the piece was faulty. However, in the process of removing the piece from the system, due to the high temperatures used, the piece had gulled with the stainless-steel piping and broke. <b>Flared</b> <b>fittings</b> versus Swagelock fittings were tested in the experiment as well. Both fittings showed no signs of any leakage when exposed to the high temperatures and corrosive environment. The existing test set-up for the Nagle Long Shafted Pump was used in this experiment and additional test hours were obtained on the pump bearings. However, only 132 hours (5 1 / 2 days) of the 5000 hours (208 days) were performed due to a salt leak, which required removal of insulation. The experiment had to be terminated prior to removal of the insulation...|$|R
40|$|We {{explore the}} spatio-temporal {{evolution}} of solar <b>flares</b> by <b>fitting</b> a radial expansion model r(t) {{that consists of}} an exponentially growing acceleration phase, followed by a deceleration phase that is parameterized by the generalized diffusion function r(t) ∝κ (t-t_ 1) ^β/ 2, which includes the logistic growth limit (β= 0), sub-diffusion (β = 0 - 1), classical diffusion (β= 1), super-diffusion (β = 1 - 2), and the linear expansion limit (β= 2). We analyze all M and X-class flares observed with GOES and AIA/SDO {{during the first two}} years of the SDO mission, amounting to 155 events. We find that most flares operate in the sub-diffusive regime (β= 0. 53 ± 0. 27), which we interpret in terms of anisotropic chain reactions of intermittent magnetic reconnection episodes in a low plasma-β corona. We find a mean propagation speed of v= 15 ± 12 km s^- 1, with maximum speeds of v_max= 80 ± 85 km s^- 1 per flare, which is substantially slower than the sonic speeds expected for thermal diffusion of flare plasmas. The diffusive characteristics established here (for the first time for solar flares) is consistent with the fractal-diffusive self-organized criticality (FD-SOC) model, which predicted diffusive transport merely based on cellular automaton simulations.

40|$|X-ray flares have {{routinely}} {{been observed}} from the supermassive black hole at our Galactic center, Sagittarius A⋆ (Sgr A⋆). The {{nature of these}} flares remains largely unclear, despite many theoretical models. In this paper, we study the statistical properties of the Sgr A⋆ X-ray <b>flares</b> by <b>fitting</b> the count rate (CR) distribution and the structure function of the light curve with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. With the 3 -million-second Chandra observations accumulated in the Sgr A⋆ X-ray Visionary Project, we construct the theoretical light curves through Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the 2 – 8 keV X-ray light curve can be decomposed into a quiescent component with a constant CR of 6 X 10 [superscript - 3] count s[superscript − 1] and a flare component with a power-law fluence distribution dN/dE ∝ E[superscript -αE] with α[subscript E] = 1. 65 ± 0. 17. The duration–fluence correlation can also be modeled as a power law T ∝ E[superscript αET] with α[subscript ET] < 0. 55 (95 % confidence). These statistical properties {{are consistent with the}} theoretical prediction of the self-organized criticality system with the spatial dimension S = 3. We suggest that the X-ray flares represent plasmoid ejections driven by magnetic reconnection (similar to solar flares) in the accretion flow onto the black hole...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{long-term}} (≈ 30 years) radio variability of 43 radio bright AGNs by exploiting the data {{base of the}} University of Michigan Radio Astronomy Observatory (UMRAO) monitoring program. We model the periodograms (temporal power spectra) of the observed lightcurves as simple power-law noise (red noise, spectral power P(f) ∝ f^-β) using Monte Carlo simulations, taking into account windowing effects (red-noise leak, aliasing). The power spectra of 39 (out of 43) sources are in good agreement with the models, yielding a range in power spectral index (β) from ≈ 1 to ≈ 3. We fit a Gaussian function to each flare in a given lightcurve to obtain the flare duration. We discover a correlation between β and the median duration of the flares. We use the derivative of a lightcurve to obtain a characteristic variability timescale which {{does not depend on}} the assumed functional form of the <b>flares,</b> incomplete <b>fitting,</b> and so on. We find that, once the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting are corrected for, the variability timescales of our sources are proportional to the accretion rate to the power of 0. 25 ± 0. 03 over five orders of magnitude in accretion rate, regardless of source type. We further find that modeling the periodograms of four of our sources requires the assumption of broken powerlaw spectra. From simulating lightcurves as superpositions of exponential flares we conclude that strong overlap of flares leads to featureless simple power-law periodograms of AGNs at radio wavelengths in most cases.

The flares range from very short (< 1 ks) to long (~ 10 [superscript 4] s) duration events {{with a range}} of shapes and amplitudes for all durations. We extract spectra for composite flares to study their mean evolution and to compare flares of different lengths.

40|$|X-ray {{and extreme}} {{ultraviolet}} (EUV, 0 - 121. 6 nm) emission from the solar corona {{has long been}} used to {{provide insight into the}} dynamics and evolution of solar flares. The EUV Variability Experiment (EVE) onboard NASA 2 ̆ 7 s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) measures the solar spectral irradiance in the EUV at a wide range of temperatures (7, 000 K to 10 MK), capturing the complete evolution of the transition region and corona during solar flares. The goal of this thesis is to use the new observations obtained by EVE to quantify how the EUV spectral irradiance varies in response to solar flares. Most observation-based research on solar flares is done by studying individual, usually large, solar flares. My work takes a different approach. From 1 May 2010 to 31 August 2011, SDO observed over 750 solar flares. I created the EVE flare catalog to examine all of these events to produce a complete picture of the EUV variability of flares. In the process, I discovered that flares can be placed into one of five EUV flare categories. The EUV irradiance signature of these categories is unique and closely related to the magnetic structure of the flare region. Confined flares are the most ubiquitous type of flare. They are non-eruptive flares and appear as the sudden brightening of a coherent bundle of coronal loops. Localized eruptive flares are small point-like flares associated with EUV surges or jets. Arcade flares are the classic CSHKP-type flare and are identified observationally by an eruption followed by arcade of flare loops in the corona and two bright ribbons of footpoint emission in the chromosphere and transition region. EUV late phase flares are characterized by two spatially and temporally separate but related reconnection events. Finally, flares that do not fit into any of the four other flare categories are called 2 ̆ 2 strange 2 ̆ 2 flares. I also used the Enthaply-Based Thermal Evolution of Loops (EBTEL) code to model the heating rate of the corona during <b>flares.</b> By <b>fitting</b> the input parameters of the model to the EVE data, I determined that the rate of energy release during reconnection strongly influences the EUV irradiance signature. Each of these EUV flare categories has a different heating rate profile, which is related to the underlying magnetic structure of the flare region...|$|R
40|$|Kepler- 96 is {{an active}} solar-type star {{harbouring}} a Super-Earth planet in close orbit. Its age of 2. 3 Gyr {{is the same as}} the Sun when there was a considerable increase of oxygen in Earth's atmosphere due to micro-organisms living under the sea. We present the analysis of superflares seen on the transit lightcurves of Kepler- 96 b. The model used here simulates the planetary transit in a <b>flaring</b> star. By <b>fitting</b> the observational data with this model, it is possible to infer the physical properties of the flares, such as their duration and the energy released. We found 3 flares within the energy range of superflares, where the biggest superflare observed was found to have an energy of 1. 81 × 10 ^ 35 ergs. The goal is to analyse the biological impact of these superflares on a hypothetical Earth in the habitable zone of Kepler- 96 assuming this planet has protection via different scenarios: an Archean and Present-day atmospheres. Also, we verify the attenuation of the flare UV radiation through an Archean ocean. The conclusion is that considering the increase in the UV flux by the strongest superflare emission, E. Coli and D. Radiodurans could survive on the surface of the planet only if there was an ozone layer present on the planet atmosphere. However, they could escape from the hazardous UV effects at a depth of 28 m and 12 m below the ocean surface, respectively. For smaller superflares contribution, D. Radiodurans could survive in the surface even in an Archean atmosphere with no ozone. Comment: 21 pages, 9 figures, under review at Astrobiolog...|$|R
