50|$|The device {{works by}} using <b>infra-red</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lamps on a fence post {{to create a}} field of light. This field of light {{reflects}} from retroreflective material on another fence post, much like that used on roads and highway signs, and bounces back to its source. This field of light is monitored by charge-coupled devices (CCDs) {{similar to the ones}} used in consumer digital cameras. These cameras are situated on both fence posts and detect shadows in the light between the posts. Once an insect is detected, a non-lethal laser is fired at it. This non-lethal laser is used to determine the size of the insect, and the frequency at which its wings are beating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This {{study shows}} that a precise eye {{tracking}} and pupillometer system, neither interfering visual field nor influenced by head movement, can be implemented by analyzing first Paikinje image of visual field which has a few reference points. If two or more reference points are sited around the center of visual field, then eye camera captures the overlapped image of reference points and pupil. Four high intensity <b>infra-red</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> (IR LEDs) are used as reference points in this study not to disturb the subject’s attention. These reference points appear as four highlighting points in the captured pupil image. The actual gazing point can be calculated by finding {{the distance between the}} center of these four reference points and pupil center and angle. Head movement causes some shift of location of pupil and reference points in the same direction and with the same amount hence does not change the relation of them. This technique can afford to make a system that has fast sampling time and high resolution without extra servo-mechanism to chase subject’s head movement.

40|$|The Large-Angle Magnetic Suspension Test Facility (LAMSTF), a laboratory-scale {{research}} project {{to demonstrate the}} magnetic suspension of objects over wide ranges of attitudes, has been developed. This system represents a scaled model of a planned Large-Gap Magnetic Suspension System (LGMSS). The LAMSTF system consists of a planar array of five copper electromagnets which actively suspend a small cylindrical permanent magnet. The cylinder is a rigid body and can be controlled to move in five independent degrees of freedom. Five position variables are sensed indirectly by using <b>infra-red</b> <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> and light-receiving phototransistors. The motion of the suspended cylinder is in general nonlinear and hence only the linear, time-invariant perturbed motion about an equilibrium state is considered. One of the main challenges in this project is {{the control of the}} suspended element over a wide range of orientations. An accurate dynamic model plans an essential role in controller design. The analytical model of the LAMSTF system includes highly unstable real poles (about 10 Hz) and low-frequency flexible modes (about 0. 16 Hz). Projection filters are proposed to identify the state space model from closed-loop test data in time domain. A canonical transformation matrix is also derived to transform the identified state space model into the physical coordinate. The LAMSTF system is stabilized by using a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) feedback controller. The rate information is obtained by calculating the back difference of the sensed position signals. The reference inputs contain five uncorrelated random signals. This control input and the system reponse are recorded as input/output data to identify the system directly from the projection filters. The sampling time is 4 ms and the model is fairly accurate in predicting the step responses for different controllers while the analytical model has a deficiency in the pitch axis...|$|R
40|$|In {{the paper}} a pulse oximetry model is {{developed}} using an approach which combines both {{theoretical and empirical}} modelling. The optical properties of whole blood are measured {{as a function of}} cuvette depth by transmission spectrophotometry using red (660 nm) and <b>infra-red</b> (950 nm) <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diodes</b> as light sources. Twersky's theoretical model gives the best fit to the experimental data. A simple theoretical model which takes into account the nonlinear relationship between optical density and cuvette depth is then used to obtain an expression for the R:IR ratio, which relates the measurement of transmission at the two wavelengths. The R:IR ratio is found to be more or less independent of cuvette depth (SD = 0. 14 at 100 per cent SaO 2). To validate the predictions of the theoretical model, the results of a previous experiment in which the relationship between SaO 2 and the R:IR ratio was recorded using a flexible cuvette are used. The experimental values are found to lie within one standard deviation from the theoretical curve relating SaO 2 and the R:IR ratio. It is argued that a reasonably accurate model for pulse oximetry which is based on whole blood and not haemoglobin solutions has been developed...|$|R

In order {{to solve this problem}} we propose a thermal management system for <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting with a heat exchanger module integrated with the building’s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system to move the lighting’s waste heat outdoors. An experiment was carried out to investigate the thermal effects in a test chamber and the heat exchange rate between the heat sink and the duct air. The heat generated by the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting was calculated as 78. 1 % of <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) input power and the heat exchange rate of the lighting heat exchange module was estimated to be between 86. 5 % and 98. 1 % according to the <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) input power and the flow rate of air passing the heat sink. As a result, the average <b>light-emitting</b> <b>diode</b> (LED) lighting heat contribution rate for internal heat gain was determined as 0. 05; this value was used to calculate the heating and cooling energy demand of the office building through an energy simulation program.
