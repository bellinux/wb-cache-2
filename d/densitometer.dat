50|$|A <b>densitometer</b> is {{a device}} that {{measures}} the degree of darkness (the optical density) of a photographic or semitransparent material or of a reflecting surface. The <b>densitometer</b> is basically a light source aimed at a photoelectric cell. It determines the density of a sample placed between the light source and the photoelectric cell from differences in the readings. Modern densitometers have the same components, but also have electronic integrated circuitry for better reading.|$|E

50|$|Since {{density is}} usually {{measured}} by the decrease {{in the amount of}} light which shines through a transparent film, it is also called absorptiometry, the measure of light absorption through the medium.

40|$|Abstract Background Dual energy x-ray {{absorptiometry}} (DXA) {{is widely}} used for body composition measurements in normal-weight and overweight/obese individuals. The limitations of bone <b>densitometers</b> have been frequently addressed. However, the possible errors in assessing body composition in overweight individuals due to incorrect positioning or limitations of DXA to accurately assess both bone mineral density and body composition in obese individuals have not received much attention and {{are the focus of}} this report. Discussion We discuss proper ways of measuring overweight individuals and point to some studies where that might not have been the case. It appears that currently, the most prudent approach to assess body composition of large individuals who cannot fit under the scanning area would be to estimate regional fat, namely the regions of thigh and/or abdomen. Additionally, using two-half body scans, although time consuming, may provide a relatively accurate measurement of total body fat, however, more studies using this technique are needed to validate it. Summary Researchers using bone <b>densitometers</b> for body composition measurements need to have an understanding of its limitations in overweight individuals and address them appropriately when interpreting their results. Studies on accuracy and precision in measurements of both bone and soft tissue composition in overweight individuals using available <b>densitometers</b> are needed. </p...|$|R

A common value for dot gain is around 23% in the 40% tone for a 150 lpi screen and coated paper.

50|$|The petal {{encasement}} of {{the spacecraft}} was opened, antennas were erected, and radio transmissions to Earth began four minutes after the landing. On December 25 and December 26, 1966, the spacecraft television system transmitted panoramas of the nearby lunar landscape at different Sun angles. Each panorama required approximately 100 minutes to transmit. The spacecraft was equipped with a mechanical soil-measuring penetrometer, a dynamograph, and a radiation <b>densitometer</b> for obtaining data on the mechanical and physical properties and the cosmic ray reflectivity of the lunar surface.

40|$|Introduction Short-term {{precision}} {{is often}} quoted {{and used as}} the most important performance parameter of a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanner; however, long-term precision has a more profound impact on patient monitoring. Long-term precision refers to the combination of in-vivo precision errors and long-term equipment stability. Methods To monitor long-term equipment stability, a phantom was designed with four inserts ranging in bone-mineral density from 0. 5 to 3. 3 g/cm 2. This phantom was used to monitor the equipment stability of four modern fan-beam <b>densitometers,</b> two each from Hologic and GE/Lunar, over a 4 -year period. Manufacturer-recommended quality assurance (QA) procedures were performed, and the scanners stayed within manufacturer-specified tolerances throughout the study. Results and conclusion During the 4 -year period, the Hologic scanners were observed to cause clinically insignificant BMD shifts (maximum of 0. 34 %), whereas the GE/Lunar scanners revealed BMD shifts that were clinically significant (1. 5 % and 2. 1 %). As a result, using least-significant-change (LSC) calculations based only on short-term in-vivo precision studies for monitoring patients is not valid for the two GE/Lunar <b>densitometers</b> due to the poorer long-term stability they exhibited...|$|R
