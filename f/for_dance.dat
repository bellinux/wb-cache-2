5|$|Street Dance Kemp Europe (SDK Europe) is a {{competition}} and dance convention founded in 2004 in Jedovnice, Czech Republic. There is a hip-hop crew battle and solo battles for house, krumping, locking, hip-hop male, and hip-hop female dancers. SDK Europe begins {{every year in}} the summer and lasts seven days. Daytime hours are reserved primarily <b>for</b> <b>dance</b> workshops and classes taught by an international pool of instructors; competitive events are held at night. All of the classes, workshops, and competitive events are held outside and—although hotels or cottages are an option—many participants stay in tents and camp outside on the SDK event grounds.|$|E

50|$|Several {{notation}} {{systems are}} used only <b>for</b> specific <b>dance</b> forms. Examples of such systems include Shorthand <b>Dance</b> Notation <b>for</b> <b>dances</b> from Israel, Morris <b>Dance</b> Notation <b>for</b> Morris <b>dance,</b> and Beauchamp-Feuillet notation <b>for</b> Baroque <b>dance.</b> Many dance notation systems {{are specifically designed}} <b>for</b> European <b>dance</b> and, as a result, cannot effectively describe dances from other cultures. Examples of such non-European dances include the polycentric dances of many African cultures, where movement of the body through space {{is less important than}} form-changing movements of the body. Attempts have been made by dance ethnologists to develop notation systems <b>for</b> such <b>dances.</b>|$|R
5|$|During this period, Copeland {{received}} {{far more}} personal {{attention from the}} Bradley family than her mother could give each of her six children. Raised in a lapsed Christian household, when Copeland lived with the Bradley family, she attended their synagogue and celebrated Shabbat with them, enjoying their family's closeness. In addition to Bradley's intensive ballet training, her husband, a modern-dance teacher, served as Copeland's pas-de-deux instructor and partner. The summer before her fifteenth birthday, Bradley began to homeschool Copeland for 10th grade to free up more time <b>for</b> <b>dance.</b> At fifteen years old, Copeland won {{first place in the}} Los Angeles Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Chandler Pavilion in March 1998. Copeland said {{it was the first time}} she ever battled nervousness. The winners received scholarships between $500 and $2500. Copeland's victory in the 10th annual contest among gifted high school students in Southern California secured her recognition by the Los Angeles Times as the best young dancer in the Greater Los Angeles Area.|$|E
5|$|In 1932, Como left Canonsburg, {{moving about}} 100 miles away to Meadville, Pennsylvania, where his uncle had a barber {{shop in the}} Hotel Conneaut. Around 80 miles from Cleveland, it was a popular stop on the {{itinerary}} <b>for</b> <b>dance</b> bands who worked {{up and down the}} Ohio Valley. Como, Roselle, and their friends had gone to nearby Cleveland; their good times took them to the Silver Slipper Ballroom where Freddy Carlone and his orchestra were playing. Carlone invited anyone who thought he might have talent to come up and sing with his band. Young Como was terrified, but his friends urged him and pushed him onto the stage. Carlone was so impressed with Como's performance that he immediately offered him a job.|$|E
