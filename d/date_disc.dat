50|$|Hundred Year Hall is a two-CD live album by the Grateful Dead. It was {{the first}} album to be {{released}} after Jerry Garcia's death, {{and one of the}} first releases in a continuing rush of live albums from the band's vault. It contains about two thirds of the April 26 concert at the Jahrhunderthalle in Frankfurt, West Germany, during the Dead's Spring 1972 tour of Europe (a tour originally represented by the Europe '72 album, released in 1972; though that release contained no tracks from the Frankfurt <b>date).</b> <b>Disc</b> one includes a number of songs from the first set, followed by the last part of the second set. Disc two includes the first part of the second set.|$|E
40|$|Disrupted in {{schizophrenia}} 1 (DISC 1) {{is one of}} {{the most}} convincing genetic risk factors for major mental illness identified to <b>date.</b> <b>DISC</b> 1 interacts directly with phosphodiesterase 4 B (PDE 4 B), an independently identified risk factor for schizophrenia. DISC 1 -PDE 4 B complexes are therefore likely to be involved in molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric illness. PDE 4 B hydrolyses cAMP and DISC 1 may regulate cAMP signalling through modulating PDE 4 B activity. There is evidence that expression of both genes is altered in some psychiatric patients. Moreover, DISC 1 missense mutations that give rise to phenotypes related to schizophrenia and depression in mice are located within binding sites for PDE 4 B. These mutations reduce the association between DISC 1 and PDE 4 B, and one results in reduced brain PDE 4 B activity. Altered DISC 1 -PDE 4 B interaction may thus underlie the symptoms of some cases of schizophrenia and depression. Factors likely to influence this interaction include expression levels, binding site affinities and the DISC 1 and PDE 4 isoforms involved. DISC 1 and PDE 4 isoforms are targeted to specific subcellular locations which may contribute to the compartmentalization of cAMP signalling. Dysregulated cAMP signalling in specific cellular compartments may therefore be a predisposing factor for major mental illness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction To <b>date,</b> lumbar <b>disc</b> {{herniation}} has {{not been}} reported in the context of cystic fibrosis even though back pain and musculoskeletal problems are very common in patients with cystic fibrosis. Case presentation We report on three patients with cystic fibrosis who experienced lumbar disc herniation {{in the course of their}} disease at ages 19 to 21 years (a 22 -year-old Caucasian man, a 23 -year-old Caucasian man, and a 21 -year-old Caucasian woman). Our third patient eventually died because of her deteriorated pulmonary situation, which was influenced by the lumbar disc herniation as it was not possible for her to perform pulmonary drainage techniques properly because of the pain. Conclusions Lumbar disc herniation can lead to a vicious cycle for patients with cystic fibrosis as it may promote pulmonary infections. This report highlights the need to investigate patients correctly. </p...|$|R

40|$|Received date; {{accepted}} <b>date</b> Transitional <b>discs</b> are {{a special}} type of protoplanetary discs where planet formation {{is thought to}} be taking place. These objects feature characteristic inner cavities and/or gaps of a few tens of AUs in the sub-millimetre images of the disc. This signature suggests a localised depletion of matter in the disc that could be caused by planet formation processes. However, recent observations have revealed differences in the structures imaged at different wavelengths in some of these discs. In this paper, we aim to explain these observational differences using self-consistent physical 2 -D hydrodynamical and dust evolution models of such objects, assuming their morphology is indeed generated by the presence of a planet. We use these models to derive the distribution of gas and dust in a theoretical planet-hosting disc, for various planet masses and orbital separations. We then simulate observations of the emitted and scattered light from these models with VLT/SPHERE ZIMPOL, Subaru/HiCIAO, VLT/VISIR and ALMA. We do this by first computing the full resolution images of the models at different wavelengths, and then simulating the observations accounting for the characteristics of each particular instrument. The presence of the planet generates pressure bumps in the gas distribution of the disc whose characteristics strongly depend on the planet mass and position. These bumps cause large grains to accumulate while small grains are allowed into inner regions. This spatial differentiation of the grain sizes explains the differences i...|$|R
