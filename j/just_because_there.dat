Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{title for}} the album was When All Is Said and Done More Is Said Than Done, {{suggested}} by Fazzi. The group liked it, however, Fazzi said it was [...] "way too long to fit on a side of a CD". According to Lazzara, the album was given the title New Again because [...] "that's what it feels like. We are in a totally different band, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> has been this new life breathed into the band {{with the addition of}} Matt." [...] The album was written in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Here, Rubano said the group [...] "stuck out on the street because we were so loud". For the album, the band embraced the concept that [...] "it's up to us to decide what Taking Back Sunday sounds like. We always want to be redefining what that means, and there's stuff on this record I think in the past we would have stayed away from", according to Rubano. Fazzi said the group wanted to [...] "put a new foot forward ... to show people that we're expanding the music". He noted that the song structures and chord patterns were [...] "just a bit stronger and smarter".|$|E
500|$|During {{the sixth}} season, {{there was talk}} about {{creating}} a new series based on the Green Arrow/Oliver Queen character. Hartley refused {{to talk about the}} possibility of a spin-off during the filming of the sixth season out of respect for his role on Smallville. The actor felt he should respect what Smallville had accomplished in five seasons, and not [...] "steal the spotlight" [...] by thinking he was better than he was <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> was [...] "talk" [...] of a spin-off after only two appearances on the show. According to Hartley, [...] "talking" [...] was as far as the spin-off ever got. According to Gough, the Green Arrow spin-off would have introduced the idea of Oliver acting in more of a [...] "Professor X" [...] role, where he takes in people with superpowers who have no place to go and trains them. The series would have used characters that would be more easily cleared by the film division at Warner Bros. As DeKnight clarified, the series would have featured the introduction of new characters—some from the Teen Titans and others from the DC Comics Universe—as well as going into more depth for the background story of its primary characters, like Bart, Victor, and Arthur. As with the other potential series, this one never came to fruition.|$|E

So any translationally invariant Ising model is rotationally invariant at long distances, in coordinates that make Zij = δij.

2500|$|... {{consists}} of eight tracks divided {{in half by}} thirty-six seconds of silence which, in concept, replicates the separation of two sides of a gramophone record. The {{first half of the}} album is [...] "light and optimistic" [...] musically, with a heavier emphasis on the use of keyboards than guitar, and the sampling of Jónsi's voice. The second half is more melancholic, playing with the emotions of the listener, as described by Jónsi. None of the tracks on ( [...] ) have titles; band guitarist and keyboardist Kjartan Sveinsson said of this choice, [...] "we didn't want to put titles on the record <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> are supposed to be titles on the record." [...] The songs are listed as [...] "Untitled #1", [...] "Untitled #2", etc., although each track has an unofficial name used by the band.|$|E
2500|$|Pop punk {{bands that}} achieve minimal {{mainstream}} success {{have seen a}} return to grassroots form, [...] "the micro-operation style that yielded the results that caught the mainstream’s attention in the first place." [...] New Found Glory has continued to tour on the Warped Tour, and had their own Pop Punks Not Dead Tour, a reworking of an [...] "old, defiant punk rock battle cry." [...] Chad Gilbert, the band's guitarist, wrote in an op-ed for Alternative Press entitled [...] "Why Pop-Punk's Not Dead—And Why It Still Matters Today": [...] "This isn't a dead genre, and <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> isn't a song on the radio to clarify that shouldn't matter. ... Pop-punk means something {{to a lot of}} people and to me, having success as a band in our genre is about longevity, touring a lot and staying true to your fans. It's about us putting our lives on a plate for our fans to take what they want and not jeopardizing our integrity for any reason." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sutter {{explained}} {{the writing process}} and obstacles for the show on his vlog: [...] "It's sort of fun of jumping into completely different world, completely different time, completely different vernacular, it's a toughest thing for me {{right now with the}} pilot is the story is all broken on my board here but you know trying to find different rhythms of speech and vernacular". Sutter held his fans hostage who were eagerly waiting for his new project. [...] "I'm not writing it on period speech <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there's</b> no actual recording of what that vernacular sounded like with intonation and everything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Why {{do these}} fragile worlds captivate us so?Is {{it because they}} jab at our {{assumptions}} that the modern city is entirely secure? Is it because we feel too safe <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there's</b> concrete beneath our feet—even though concrete can wobble like rubber as it did during July's Chino Hills temblor?Long before these philosophical considerations arise, Priest's story is fascinating for a basic, practical reason: How, indeed, does one move a city? Much {{of the first half}} of the book is devoted to describing this extraordinary process, something suggestive of the building of the Pyramids or the laying of the Transcontinental Railroad.|$|R
5000|$|El-P {{has stated}} that [...] "I think that I’m trying to create an idea or {{illustrate}} a thought pattern, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there’s</b> darkness that I see and think about, it doesn’t mean I’ve given into it. I think the record is ultimately about not giving into it. For the most part I’m struggling with that darkness throughout the record. When I say it’s about wanting to live, I <b>just</b> say that <b>because</b> that’s how I feel. When you get hit with death, sometimes as horrible as it is, {{one of the things}} that can come out of it is a reaffirmation of how much you don’t want to go, and I think that’s what happened with me." ...|$|R

50|$|Foyle {{is the son}} of a policeman. A World War I {{veteran who}} fought at Passchendaele, he once told his son that the three years he spent enlisted were the worst of his life and reluctantly {{admitted}} to having killed enemy soldiers. Foyle requests a transfer to the War Office several times in the first two series, {{but by the end of}} the third appears to have accepted that this will not happen and his detective work is just as important, in its own way, to the war effort. He argues that innocent victims of murder should not be forgotten <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there's</b> a war on.|$|R
5000|$|The track garned {{generally}} negative {{reviews from}} critics, who mostly criticized the song's [...] "cock, cock, cock" [...] line. Greg Knot from Chicago Tribune said that [...] "Peacock" [...] adapting the beat from Basil's [...] "Mickey" [...] into a suggestive metaphor [...] "barely qualifies as an off-color joke {{let alone a}} song." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic found the singer to have distinguished herself through [...] "desperate vulgarity". Erlewine concluded: [...] "All this stylized provocation is exhausting, and not <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there's</b> {{so much of it}} (none of it actually arousing). It's tiring because, at her heart, Perry is old-fashioned and is invested in none of her aggressive teasing." ...|$|R

"Miss Sampson," [...] I began, awkwardly yet swiftly, [...] "I--I got to {{thinking}} it over, and the idea struck me, maybe you felt bad about this gun-fighter Blome coming down here to kill Steele. At first I imagined you felt sick <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> might be blood spilled.

60|$|In {{a common}} school, too, {{there can be}} but little moral training, however {{efficiently}} the school may be conducted, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is little opportunity given for the development and display of individual character. The whole management of a school requires that the pupils be as speedily as possible brought to a uniform outward conduct, and thus an appearance of good behavior and propriety is produced within the school room, which is too often cast aside and forgotten the moment the pupils pass the threshold.|$|E

5000|$|I {{personally}} consider security bugs {{to be just}} [...] "normal bugs". I don't {{cover them}} up, but I also don't have any reason what-so-ever to think it's {{a good idea to}} track them and announce them as something special...one reason I refuse to bother with the whole security circus is that I think it glorifies—and thus encourages—the wrong behavior. It makes [...] "heroes" [...] out of security people, as if the people who don't just fix normal bugs aren't as important. In fact, all the boring normal bugs are way more important, <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there's</b> a lot more of them. I don't think some spectacular security hole should be glorified or cared about as being any more [...] "special" [...] than a random spectacular crash due to bad locking.|$|R

But I object that that was only the futile fancy of a gentleman of leisure. What was really going on was the gathering up of the Macedonian power to smash through Greece, and then make Greece conquer Asia. Your literature and philosophy are really just the private entertainment of old gentlemen out of the hurly-burly and ambitious young men too delicate to hunt or shoot. Thought is nothing in the world until it begins to operate in will and act, and the history of mankind doesn't show now, and it never has shown, any consecutive relation to human thinking.

6000|$|... § 20. If it be {{said that}} Shakspere wrote perfect {{historical}} plays on subjects belonging to the preceding centuries, I answer, that they are perfect plays <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>there</b> is no care about centuries in them, but a life which all men recognise for the human life of all time; and this it is, not because Shakspere sought to give universal truth, but because, painting honestly and completely from the men about him, he painted that human nature which is, indeed, constant enough,--a rogue {{in the fifteenth century}} being, at heart, what a rogue is in the nineteenth and was in the twelfth; and an honest or a knightly man being, in like manner, very similar to other such at any other time. And the work of these great idealists is, therefore, always universal; not because it is not portrait, but because it is complete portrait down to the heart, which is the same in all ages: and the work of the mean idealists is not universal, not because it is portrait, but because it is half portrait,--of the outside, the manners and the dress, not of the heart. Thus Tintoret and Shakspere paint, both of them, simply Venetian and English nature as they saw it in their time, down to the root; and it does for all time; but as for any care to cast themselves into the particular ways and tones of thought, or custom, of past time in their historical work, you will find it in neither of them, nor in any other perfectly great man that I know of.|$|E
