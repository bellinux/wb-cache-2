500|$|The country's sole {{female athlete}} at the 2016 Games was Bibiro Ali Taher, who {{competed in the}} 5000 metres. She participated on 16 August in the second heat of the competition. Taher was towards {{the back of the}} field as she passed the line on her second to last lap, when she heard the bell {{indicating}} the final lap. This was not meant for her, but instead for runners who were a full lap ahead of her. She mistakenly thought the bell indicated that it was her final lap, and so pulled up after another 400 metres. As such, she did not finish her race. She later said in an interview, [...] "I gave everything I could. I worked like crazy these past twelve months. I have no regrets, but I had tears in my eyes because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Rio with a new record." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{the game}} I told the captain that I {{was not happy}} and that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> After the game we spoke in the {{dressing}} room and then I went to have dinner. I got a call saying the captain had trashed my equipment. I was told the captain had said, [...] "if {{he does not want to}} play for Notts he can f*** off." [...] I have not spoken to Gallian since, nor have I received an apology. Pietersen was forced to complete the last year of his contract with Nottinghamshire, but [...] "didn't enjoy it at all".|$|E

5000|$|By March 2003, Reuters had {{assigned}} Dana {{away from}} Hebron {{for his own}} safety. He told a reporter for PBS's Frontline, [...] "My family is happy about this, but really, I'm not happy, because I like camera, and I like it here. When <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> camera, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it by myself, not be forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from EastEnders, Johnson was more candid in her reasons for leaving: [...] "I've {{had a great}} time but {{it got to the point}} where I was sat in bed at night thinking: 'Tomorrow will my character be crying, getting drunk or having an argument?'. It soon became physically exhausting and draining [...] I don't think the producers were very happy when I said <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> I was still very new and they had just set up the new Watts dynasty but no-one could have made me change my mind. When I said to the producers I wanted to go they told me they might have to recast Vicki. I don't mind. Life goes on and EastEnders goes on. I wouldn't want to go back at the moment - but never say never." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't want to. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> it to yourself. I wanted--oh yes, if that's {{what you}} wish to ask me--to see what you'd do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am in a {{fever of}} curiosity {{about what is}} to come," [...] she said, when we all parted for the night; [...] "and, even if <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> you, I could not {{possibly}} go away now, without hearing the stories to the end." ...|$|E

When I {{realized}} what was going on <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave,</b> and, I repeat, had the chief actress been an old hag or the usual sloven who plays this game, I would have fled; but she was as beautiful as a statue as she lay there, professedly in deep trance." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jake grinned as {{he promised}} and remarked {{as they went}} away: [...] "Makes a good due√±a, doesn't he? You can trust Dick to guard {{anything}} he's told {{to take care of}}.

6000|$|... "It is {{not that}} I want to be off, sir, for I was never happier in all my life, but I feel that I ought to go. It is likely enough that the ship may be short of middies, one or two may be away in prizes, {{and it will be}} strange if no one falls sick while they are lying in Port Royal.

6000|$|... "But {{when the}} robbers fell to {{cheating}} one another, I {{got my first}} clues {{to the state of}} affairs. One of the robbed robbers came to me after dark, with facts, figures, and assertions. I knew I was ruined if I went to law. The judges were corrupt like everything else. But I did do one thing. In the dead of night I went to Ericson's house. I had the same revolver I've got now, and I made him stay in bed while I overhauled things. Nineteen hundred and odd francs was what I carried away with me. He never complained to the police, and he never came back on board. As {{for the rest of the}} gang, they laughed and snapped their fingers at me. There were two Americans in the place, and they warned me to leave the law alone unless <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the Miele behind as well.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I {{told him}} I saw by his face, {{even before he}} spoke, that I had been wrong. He knew nothing {{whatever}} of it. Well, miss, he forgave me--forgave me wholly. He {{told me that he}} should never mention it to a soul, and as he has never mentioned it even to you, you may see how well he has kept his word. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the regiment. I felt that I could never mix with my comrades, knowing as I did that I had tried to murder their favourite officer. But the Major would not hear of it. He insisted that I should stay, and, even more, he promised that as soon as I was out of hospital I should be his servant, saying that as the son of an old tenant, he would rather have me than anyone else. You can well imagine, then, Miss Greendale, how willingly I would have given my life for him, and that when the chance came I gladly faced odds to save him.|$|E

6000|$|How the {{fatigues}} and annoyances {{of travel}} fill one with bitter prejudices sometimes! I might enter Florence under happier auspices a month hence {{and find it}} all beautiful, all attractive. But I do not care {{to think of it}} now, at all, nor of its roomy shops filled to the ceiling with snowy marble and alabaster copies of all the celebrated sculptures in Europe --copies so enchanting to the eye that I wonder how they can really be shaped like the dingy petrified nightmares they are the portraits of. I got lost in Florence at nine o'clock, one night, and staid lost in that labyrinth of narrow streets and long rows of vast buildings that look all alike, until toward three o'clock in the morning. It was a pleasant night and at first there were a good many people abroad, and there were cheerful lights about. Later, I grew accustomed to prowling about mysterious drifts and tunnels and astonishing and interesting myself with coming around corners expecting to find the hotel staring me in the face, and not finding it doing any thing of the kind. Later still, I felt tired. I soon felt remarkably tired. But there was no one abroad, now --not even a policeman. I walked till I was out of all patience, and very hot and thirsty. At last, somewhere after one o'clock, I came unexpectedly to one of the city gates. I knew then that I was very far from the hotel. The soldiers thought <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the city, and they sprang up and barred the way with their muskets. I said: ...|$|E

"Then {{it seemed}} to be not by our {{seashore}} that this was happening, but by the Sea of Galilee, just as it tells about it in the Bible, and there were fishermen mending their nets, and men sitting counting their money, and I saw Jesus come walking along, and heard him say to this one and that one, 'Leave all and follow me,' and it seemed that the moment he spoke they did it, and then he came to me, and I felt his eyes in my very soul, and he said, 'Wilt thou leave all and follow me?' I cannot tell now what a pain I felt--what an anguish. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> all, but my heart felt as if it were tied and woven with a thousand threads, and while I waited he seemed to fade away, and I found myself then alone and unhappy, wishing that I could, and mourning that I had not; and then something shone out warm like the sun, and I looked up, and he stood there looking pitifully, and he said again just as he did before, 'Wilt thou leave all and follow me?' Every word was so gentle and full of pity, and I looked into his eyes and could not look away; they drew me, they warmed me, and I felt a strange, wonderful sense of his greatness and sweetness. It seemed as if I felt within me cord after cord breaking, I felt so free, so happy; and I said, 'I will, I will, with all my heart;' and I woke then, so happy, so sure of God's love.|$|E
