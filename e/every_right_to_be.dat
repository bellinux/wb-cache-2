40|$|This essay {{examines}} how {{lawyers and judges}} have framed the question of children’s queerness in litigation over samesex marriage. First, it argues that in United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges, the US Supreme Court invoked the tropes of dignity, injury, and immutability to set the outer limits of sexual liberty for both children and adults. Next, the essay looks {{back to the early}} work of queer theorists, legal scholars, and lawyers to unearth a more promising vision of law’s relationship to children’s queerness. By juxtaposing how two judges approached the possibility of the gay child in Utah and California, it develops a claim that has yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> vindicated — that the US Constitution protects <b>every</b> child’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> queer...|$|R

Throughout her childhood, Ladd's mother and aunt, Juliet Niles, often chose to bring the young Christine with them to numerous women's rights lectures and suffrage meetings because both were incredibly passionate supporters of women's rights. Augusta Ladd believed that women had <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in the same positions that were held by men and [...] "belonged every place where a man should be."

This stimulating analysis delves into some important areas that will impact future prospects for integration of ®nancial services, {{as well the}} integration of economies, political structures and even security elements within regions throughout the world. The creation of a regional currency necessarily contemplates an enhanced confederation among countries within a region. In certain respects, this represents a federalist proposition.

It <b>is</b> useful <b>to</b> consider the existing factors that engender the individualistic approach of most countries with respect to currency.

We lived in the same house, a very little one, yet he would always communicate with me by note if I was not {{in the same room with}} him. He had dozens of letter books. He seized upon every opportunity for writing a letter, and every letter, whether to a publisher or to a cobbler, was written with the same care." [...] About a thousand of his letters have survived, and several sequences of them have been published in limited editions. [...] The letters reveal a lively, intelligent and absorbent mind, but because of Rolfe’s paranoiac tendencies they are often disputatious and recriminatory. [...] Among the commentators who rated Rolfe’s letters more highly than his fiction was W H Auden, who wrote that Rolfe [...] "had <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> proud of his verbal claws … A large vocabulary is essential to the invective style, and Rolfe by study and constant practice became one of the great masters of vituperation."

40|$|The Constitution of Botswana {{under section}} 3 read in {{conjunction}} with section 15, guarantees all Batswana equal enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms irrespective of one's race, colour, sex, tribe, status etc. Section 15 (3) further qualifies what conduct will be deemed discriminatory. Section 9 also ensures that <b>every</b> person's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy <b>is</b> protected except where the person has given consent <b>to</b> have their <b>right</b> violated. Notwithstanding, the same Constitution permits limitations to the full enjoyment of these fundamental rights and freedoms on matters of public interest, public morality or for protecting the interests and rights of others. However, limitations in order to pass the constitutional scrutiny, must take place in terms of the authority of the law and have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reasonably justifiable in a democratic society. Criminalisation of same sex conduct which is provided for under the Penal Code is a prima facie violation of the above constitutional provisions, which is, as it will be argued here, not capable of justification. The Penal Code violates section 3 of the Constitution, which aims at promoting equality of all citizens. It does so by criminalising certain sexual conducts committed by a certain group of persons (those involved in same-sex relationships), and not extending the same treatment to heterosexuals−thereby creating a discriminatory act. A prima facie violation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy under section 9 is also established by this criminalisation. It will be argued that permitting the law to traverse into the sexual life of grown up people and regulate their sexual behavior, is not only a violation of their privacy but also dignity. Prescribing who people should fall in love with and who they should engage in sexual conduct with, violates individual autonomy―freedom of choice, which freedom should be inherent in every individual. Section 15 of the Constitution is also violated in the sense that, although its objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> eradicate any form of discrimination, permitting {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation through criminalising same sex sexual conduct between consenting adults, defeats the very purpose that the provision is aimed at achieving. This paper acknowledges the existence of the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> religious beliefs and practices as well as the culture and morals of the majority in Botswana. Notwithstanding, it will be argued that, taking these rights into consideration, it still does not justify the violations that the Penal Code establishes through criminalisation. This paper will recommend that, because courts are vested with the powers to declare any law or policy which it finds unconstitutional, they should thus declare those provisions of the Penal Code null and void to the extent of their unconstitutionality...|$|R
40|$|In this Article, I {{discuss the}} Alden Trilogy 2 ̆ 7 s interpretive process and its {{redistribution}} of political power, {{but do not}} linger on either. This Article is written in praise of the Trilogy, but praise coupled with protest. I make three essential points. First, the Trilogy deserves praise as a pragmatic masterpiece. Through it the Court shrewdly avoided a constitutional quagmire that easily could have created a federalism crisis. Second, I argue that the Alden Trilogy is an exemplar of misdirection. Here I render reluctant praise, like that given to an opposing baseball team 2 ̆ 7 s dramatic double-play. Though one dislikes the outcome, one cannot deny the skill just witnessed. In this regard, I show that through its deft deployment of state sovereign immunity doctrine, the Supreme Court has enhanced its own power {{as well as that}} of the federal Executive Branch to the detriment of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s lawmaking power. Moreover, although the Trilogy focuses on Congress 2 ̆ 7 s remedial authority, it thwarts Congress 2 ̆ 7 s substantive lawmaking capacity. Third, I show that the Trilogy has a dark side. Today, no individual can bring a damage action in any court against an unconsenting state to enforce federal statutory <b>rights</b> enacted pursuant <b>to</b> Congress 2 ̆ 7 s Article I powers. 22 ̆ 2 This situation creates a profoundly disquieting enforcement gap that threatens to undermine the rule of law values in our constitutional scheme, particularly the principle that for <b>every</b> <b>right</b> there ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a remedy. <b>To</b> situate this Article 2 ̆ 7 s praise and protest of the Alden Trilogy doctrinally, I begin with an abridged summary of the federalism developments of the past several decades, developments that preordained the confrontation that resulted in the Trilogy. Next, I describe the holdings of each Trilogy case, including the interpretive frameworks adopted, and identify unresolved issues generated by these holdings. I then turn to my principal undertaking: consideration of 1) how the Trilogy pragmatically avoided a constitutional crisis; 2) how the three cases masterfully invite attention in one direction while moving the law in another; and 3) how these cases raise rule of law concerns by creating a disjunction between Congress 2 ̆ 7 substantive and remedial authority...|$|R

The fact was that my balance was at the moment small. I have not yet {{in the course of this}} narrative gone into my pecuniary position, but I may state here that it was an inconvenient one. It was big with possibilities, but of ready cash there was but a meagre supply. My parents had been poor. But I had a wealthy uncle. Uncles are notoriously careless of the comfort of their nephews. Mine was no exception. He had views. He was a great believer in matrimony, as, having married three wives--not simultaneously--he had <b>every</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> He was also of opinion that the less money the young bachelor possessed, the better. The consequence was that he announced his intention of giving me a handsome allowance from the day that I married, but not an instant before. Till that glad day I would have to shift for myself. And I am bound to admit that--for an uncle--it was a remarkably sensible idea. I am also of the opinion that it is greatly to my credit, and a proof of my pure and unmercenary nature, that I did not instantly put myself up to be raffled for, or rush out into the streets and propose marriage to the first lady I met. But I was making quite enough with my pen to support myself, and, be it never so humble, there is something pleasant in a bachelor existence, or so I had thought until very recently.|$|E
