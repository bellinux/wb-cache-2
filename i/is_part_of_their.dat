5|$|Games {{are played}} for entertainment—{{sometimes}} purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They {{can be played}} alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> audience and who is a player.|$|E
5|$|Humankind {{enters a}} golden age of {{prosperity}} {{at the expense of}} creativity. Five decades after their arrival, the Overlords reveal their appearance, resembling the traditional Christian folk images of demons: large bipeds with cloven hooves, leathery wings, horns, and tails. The Overlords are interested in psychic research, which humans suppose <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> anthropological study. Rupert Boyce, a prolific book collector on the subject, allows one Overlord, Rashaverak, to study these books at his home. To impress his friends with Rashaverak's presence, Boyce holds a party, during which he makes use of a Ouija board. Jan Rodricks, an astrophysicist and Rupert's brother-in-law, asks the identity of the Overlords' home star. George Greggson's future wife Jean faints as the Ouija board reveals a star-catalog number consistent with the direction in which Overlord supply ships appear and disappear. With the help of an oceanographer friend Jan Rodricks stows away on an Overlord supply ship and travels 40 light-years to their home planet. Due to the time dilation of special relativity at near-light speeds, the elapsed time on the ship is only a few weeks, and he arranges to endure it in drug-induced hibernation.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk. The site {{was used as a}} chemical works for at least 100years, and was decommissioned as such in the late 1980s. Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and he called for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil and groundwater impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and asbestos fibres. There were methane and carbon dioxide land gas readings as well. Mosque officials have stated that allowing the development to proceed would benefit the community, as decontamination of the site <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> building plan.|$|E

25|$|The Ganesha Purana is {{significant}} because it is, with Ganapati Upanishad, {{the two most important}} texts of the Ganapatya sect of Hinduism.

The text integrates ancient mythology and Vedantic premises into a Ganesha bhakti (devotional) framework.|$|E

25|$|During {{their years}} of residence, the Mosers {{collected}} extensive lexical and cultural information, {{much of which}} would be published later in various books and articles. Recorded legends and history were published in the Seri language, and some appear in later collections in English and Spanish. A Seri-Spanish vocabulary book was published in 1961, an ethnobotany (with botanist Richard S. Felger) in 1985 (which has been hailed as a modern classic), and a major dictionary in 2005, thirty years after Edward’s death, but based largely on work that he and Roberto Herrera Marcos (a.k.a. Roberto Herrera Thomson) had done. What is known today about Seri history and culture, including the so-called “band” structure of this group, is the result of work that the Mosers and Herrera did. Even work that does not bear either of their names as authors, such as the article in the journal Science about hibernating sea turtles, the book about the San Esteban people, and the 2005 dictionary, as well as most work on the Seri language and culture during the past half century) <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> legacy.|$|E
