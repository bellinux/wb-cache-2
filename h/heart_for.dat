His mother, Charlena Rector, worked as a clerk at a local Safeway supermarket, while his father, Milton Bradley Sr., was {{a veteran of the}} Vietnam War, and was awarded a Purple <b>Heart</b> <b>for</b> his service. Bradley was named Milton Bradley Jr. when Milton Bradley Sr. filled out his son's birth {{certificate}} without Rector's permission. According to Bradley Jr.'s mother, Bradley Sr. was addicted to cocaine, physically abused her, and was homeless for several years. Growing up, Bradley had four half-siblings from Rector's previous marriage.|$|E

5|$|For their {{action on}} December 7, the U.S. War Department in Communiqué No. 19 on December 13, 1941, {{designated}} Taylor and Welch {{as the first}} two American heroes of World War II, and awarded both the Distinguished Service Cross on January 8, 1942. Taylor learned {{that he was to}} receive the award in mid-December after reading several newspapers. The award is the United States Army's second highest honor for valor in the heat of combat. Additionally, he later received the Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, the Air Medal, and a Purple <b>Heart</b> <b>for</b> injuries he sustained. Both men were recommended for the Medal of Honor, but were turned down because they had taken off without orders.|$|E
5|$|For {{their efforts}} {{the men are}} given a week's leave: the {{airfield}} where they are based comes under enemy artillery bombardment; Bell receives a letter from his wife informing him that she has {{fallen in love with}} someone else and wishes to divorce; Captain Staros is relieved of his command by Lieutenant Colonel Tall, who deems him too soft for the pressures of combat and suggests that he apply for reassignment and become a lawyer in the JAG in Washington. He offers to arrange a Purple <b>Heart</b> <b>for</b> Staros, to avoid the unit's name being stained by having an officer removed from command. Witt comes across the locals and notices that they have grown distant and distrustful of him and quarrel regularly with one another.|$|E

John though was seriously wounded during the assault with a life-threatening injury to his heart. Marcus offers his own <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> transplantation, sacrificing himself to save John. As he recovers, John radios to other Resistance fighters that, although this battle has been won, the war is still not over.|$|E
5|$|Returning to the United States in 1970, Schwarzkopf {{was awarded}} a third Silver Star and a second Purple <b>Heart</b> <b>for</b> risking his life to protect the soldiers, as well as three Bronze Star Medals and a Legion of Merit for his command performance. Still, his {{experiences}} in Vietnam embittered him to U.S. foreign policy. Upon returning to the United States, he spoke of a wariness of future conflicts to author C. D. B. Bryan in 1971: He related these experiences under the assumed name of Lieutenant Colonel Byron Schindler.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{functions}} as a pump in the circulatory system to provide a continuous flow of blood throughout the body. This circulation consists of the systemic circulation {{to and from the}} body and the pulmonary circulation to and from the lungs. Blood in the pulmonary circulation exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs through the process of respiration. The systemic circulation then transports oxygen to the body and returns carbon dioxide and relatively deoxygenated blood to the <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> transfer to the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, May 24, {{they set}} out again, but stopped for breakfast after about three miles. As they {{finished}} eating, about 30 warriors approached. The men retreated, but four were shot and killed. Slain with St. Vrain were John Fowler, William Hale, and Aaron Hawley. An account of the massacre from Gen. George W. Jones, who was St. Vrain's brother-in-law {{and the man who}} identified his body, said the warriors had scalped the dead men, but also cut off the hands, head, and feet of St. Vrain and removed his heart. They reportedly passed around pieces of the <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> the braves to eat. At least one source indicated that the mutilation began before St. Vrain was dead.|$|E

Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders Hector, a hunter, to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill Snow White, Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors, and stifles Snow White with an enchanted ribbon.|$|E

He returned to duty on October 28 but saw no further action before hostilities ended with the armistice of November 11, 1918. For his actions in Cheppy, Patton received the Distinguished Service Cross. For his leadership of the brigade and tank school, {{he was awarded the}} Distinguished Service Medal.

5|$|In Tortuga, Jack hires a new crew, {{including}} Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, {{they are}} able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on Isla Cruces, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken, Will wants to rescue his father, and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off pretending to lure away the Dutchmans crew. Jones attacks the Pearl with the Kraken, which devours most of the crew and destroys {{all but one of the}} Pearls lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of explosives.|$|E
5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} posture has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with erect hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, a change of <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted {{the shape of the}} articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an erect limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E

When Lad was fifteen, he lost his hearing, after which the other dogs in residence began ignoring him and vice versa. Lad died on September 3, 1918, having had a tumor in his <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> five years before his death. Lad's obituary was carried on a multi-page spread of the September 14, 1918 issue of Field and Fancy magazine. He was buried near the driveway of Sunnybank, with the Honorary Crosses he was awarded. He was mourned by thousands of fans who had read Terhune's stories, with dozens of readers, primarily children, visiting Sunnybank to see Lad's grave. In one season, over 1,700 visitors came to see Lad's grave, prompting Terhune to close the place to visitors for the day.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a <b>heart</b> <b>for</b> good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E
5|$|When his men {{finally took}} the hill, 15 Germans {{had been killed}} and 35 wounded. Murphy's actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and {{kept him out of}} combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple <b>Heart</b> <b>for</b> this injury.|$|E
