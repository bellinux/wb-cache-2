40|$|The {{question}} of whether perceived self-efficacy for exercise and health value,respectively,varied {{as a function of}} gender and <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change was the focus of this study. An archival data set was used. Participants were 190 college students who completed a demographic questionnaire,the <b>Exercise</b> <b>Stage</b> of Change Questionnaire,the Rokeach Values Survey,and the Self-Efficacy for Exercise questionnaire before and after completing a lifetime fitness course. Two 2 -factor analyses of covariance were conducted for each dependent varible,self-efficacy and health-value. Gender and <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change were the independent variables. <b>Exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change was divided into four subcategories:contemplation,preparation,action nand maintenance. A pretest on each dependent variable served as the covariate. Results of the analysis indicated that health valuse scores were significantly different as a function of <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change. A significant main effect was found between health value and <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change. A sigificant main effect was found between health value and <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change. A Bryant Paulson procedure was performed to determine which of the four stages of change for exercise differed on health value scores. The analysis revealed that participants in the contemplation and preparation exercise stages of change ranked health value significantly lower than participants in the action and maintenance exercise stages of change.

(1996) {{examined the relationship between}} smoking and exercise across cognitive-behavioral mediators (i. e., decisional balance and self-efficacy) shown to be important in predicting readiness to change. In this study, we seek to replicate the study of King et al. (1996) in a low-income sample, the majority of whom are women, with at least one chronic illness who are attending primary care clinics. METHODS: Data were obtained from 270 adult outpatients attending four public primary care clinics in Louisiana. RESULTS: Smoking and <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change were not related. Significant relationships existed between the cognitive variables of smoking and exercise. No significant differences existed within <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change on the cognitive variables of smoking, and vice versa, no significant differences were noted within smoking stage of change on the cognitive variables of exercise.

40|$|We {{describe}} a wearable sensor developed for cardiac rehabilitation (CR) exercise. To effectively guide CR exercise, the dedicated CR wearable sensor (DCRW) automatically recommends the exercise intensity {{to the patient}} by comparing heart rate (HR) measured in real time with a predefined target heart rate zone (THZ) during exercise. The CR exercise includes three periods: pre-exercise, exercise with intensity guidance, and post-exercise. In the pre-exercise period, information such as THZ, exercise type, <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> order, and duration of each stage are set up through a smartphone application we developed for iPhones and Android devices. The set-up information is transmitted to the DCRW via Bluetooth communication. In the period of exercise with intensity guidance, the DCRW continuously estimates HR using a reflected pulse signal in the wrist. To achieve accurate HR measurements, we used multichannel photo sensors and increased the chances of acquiring a clean signal. Subsequently, we used singular value decomposition (SVD) for de-noising. For the median and variance of RMSEs in the measured HRs, our proposed method with DCRW provided lower values than those from a single channel-based method and template-based multiple-channel method for the entire <b>exercise</b> <b>stage.</b> In the post-exercise period, the DCRW transmits all the measured HR data to the smartphone application via Bluetooth communication, and the patient can monitor his/her own exercise history...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{effectiveness}} of different cooling regime intensities to maintain physiological and subjective comfort during physical exertion levels comparable to that engaged in during extravehicular activities (EVA) in space. We studied eight subjects (six males, two females) donned in our newly developed physiologically based shortened liquid cooling/warming garment (SLCWG). Rigorous (condition 1) and mild (condition 2) water temperature cooling regimes were compared at physical exertion levels comparable to that performed during EVA to ascertain the effectiveness of a lesser intensity of cooling in maintaining thermal comfort, thus reducing energy consumption in the portable life support system. Exercise intensity was varied across stages of the session. Finger temperature, rectal temperature, and subjective perception of overall body and hand comfort were assessed. Finger temperature was significantly higher in the rigorous cooling condition and showed a consistent increase across <b>exercise</b> <b>stages,</b> likely due to the restriction of heat extraction because of the intensive cold. In the mild cooling condition, finger temperature exhibited an overall decline with cooling, indicating greater heat extraction from the body.

Finally, this type of protocol is highly correlative to running economy and actual VO 2 max consumption with outdoor running. This provided additional reassurance that the protocol used is suitable for accurate measurement of VO 2 max, correlation assessment, and physiological testing of athletes in their natural environment [6, 18, 22].|$|E

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the reliability of NIRS-derived mBF and math formula responses from incremental dynamic exercise. Measurements of mBF and math formula were collected in the vastus lateralis of 12 healthy, physically active adults [seven men and five women; 25 (SD 6) years old] during three non-consecutive visits within 10 days. After 10 min rest, participants performed 3 min of rhythmic isotonic knee extension (one extension every 4 s) at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 % of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), before four venous occlusions and then two arterial occlusions. The mBF and math formula increased proportionally with intensity [from 0. 55 to 7. 68 ml min− 1 (100 ml) − 1 and from 0. 05 to 1. 86 ml O 2 min− 1 (100 g) − 1, respectively] up to 25 % MVC, where they began to plateau at 30 % MVC.

40|$|Background: After {{a cancer}} diagnosis, {{physical}} activity and healthy eating can help cancer survivors to maintain better physical and mental health. This study compared two models to help understand factors that predict {{physical activity and}} nutrition in survivors of breast or prostate cancer. The transtheoretical model (TTM) focuses on stage of readiness {{to engage in a}} behaviour, and the commonsense illness representations (CM) model looks at individual cognitive and emotional perceptions of the illness. Methods: Participants were 92 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and 154 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Participants completed a written or online questionnaire which assessed demographic and health information, illness representations, diet and <b>exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change, self efficacy and preferences regarding health behaviour interventions. Health behaviours in the past 7 days were measured via the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and concordance with national age- and gender-specific dietary guidelines. Results: The TTM model was related to physical activity in both male prostate cancer survivors and female breast cancer survivors. <b>Exercise</b> <b>stage</b> of change and exercise self-efficacy were significant independent predictors of activity in multiple regressions for both survivor groups. This model was also supported for women's nutrition scores but not for men's. The CM model was not supported in this study. Cancer survivors more frequently reported increasing physical activity and healthy eating since diagnosis than maintaining or decreasing these behaviours and many expressed interest in interventions that would assist with activity and healthy eating. Conclusion: Health behaviours among survivors of breast cancer or prostate cancer can be partially explained by the TTM model of behaviour change. Further investigation of the commonsense illness representations model in cancer survivors may require refinement of methods, as items referring to "your illness" appeared to be viewed as having limited relevance for many survivors. Research Implications: The applicability of the TTM model to health behaviours of cancer survivors could be further investigated through longitudinal research, intervention research, and studies with more targeted groups of survivors. Clinical Implications: Based on these results, it is likely that interventions based on the TTM model of behaviour change would be helpful for cancer survivors who want assistance with increasing their physical activity and/or healthy eating. This study showed that many survivors take their own steps to improve these health behaviours, and thus a stepped-care approach may be appropriate, with higher intensity health behaviour support available to those who require this type of support.
