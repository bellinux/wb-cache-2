5|$|The {{availability}} of food reflects the seasonal {{nature of the}} forests in which they live. During the hot season, fruit, flowers, and young leaves are more abundant, whereas the cold, wet season offers more young leaves and flowers. Despite this, the diet changes little between seasons, except that females will consume more high-protein, low-fiber items, such as young leaves and flowers, during pregnancy and lactation in order to offset the energy costs of reproduction. Nectar is only available sporadically, yet constitutes a major food source when the flowers bloom.

Khalid was a cousin of Umar, the future second Caliph, and they looked very similar.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to Pyramid Head has been favorable {{because of his}} distinctive appearance and role as an element of James' psyche. Critics cite him as an iconic villain of the Silent Hill series, a <b>favorite</b> <b>among</b> fans, {{and part of the}} appeal of Silent Hill 2. GameSpot compared Pyramid Head's appearance to Leatherface, the main antagonist of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre series of slasher films, and found him the most terrifying monster in Silent Hill 2. Computerworld named Pyramid Head {{as one of the most}} terrifying villains in computer and video games. GamesRadar felt that the scene in which he rapes the two other monsters was unsettling, since the subject of rape is not often tackled in video games, and disliked the final battle with him because of how anti-climactic it was, in comparison with his role throughout the rest of the game.|$|E
5|$|Gourcuff {{is the son}} of Christian Gourcuff. In 2001, he {{followed}} in his father's footsteps and joined Rennes.

Milan. Gourcuff achieved many club honours despite not being able to break into the starting eleven, which resulted in the player being sent on loan to Ligue 1 club Bordeaux in his home country of France. Following a successful season, in which Bordeaux captured the league and league cup double and Gourcuff attained several individuals honours, he signed with the club permanently. Gourcuff is a former winner of the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year award and, in December 2009, was named the French Player of the Year for the 2009 calendar year.

5|$|Remains {{of prehistoric}} horses {{have been found}} in the Poitou region, with Mesolithic remains (20,000 to 5,000 BC) located near Surgères and Échiré. Some enthusiasts claim that the Poitevin horse is descended {{directly}} from these horses, based on physical similarities, and claim a common origin with the Tarpan horse painted on the Lascaux cave walls. However, this has not been confirmed by scientific studies, and numerous claims by other horse breeds of this same relationship have been invalidated by further research. Other horses were probably brought to the area by migrating Celts, and there is a record from the 10th century of a bishop from Rome asking the Count of Poitou for a mare from the region. These horses, like mules, were a <b>favorite</b> <b>among</b> the magistrates and ecclesiastical personnel in the medieval era, and were sold around Niort, Saint-Maixent, Auvergne, Dauphiné, Languedoc and in Spain. The number of horses in the area, however, was not well known before the 17th century.|$|E

In the 2015–16 season, Watford reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup with a goal by midfielder Adlène Guedioura against Arsenal at Emirates Stadium, ending Arsenal's bid to win the competition for three successive times, and finished 13th in the Premier League, despite the club being, when the season began, a <b>favorite</b> <b>among</b> betting shops to be relegated. Sanchez was sacked in May 2016, a decision that Flores subsequently attributed to the difference between how the owners and himself assessed Watford's ongoing season, and replaced by Italian coach Walter Mazzarri.|$|E
