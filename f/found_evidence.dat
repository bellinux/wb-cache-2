5|$|Colchester {{has been}} {{inhabited}} since pre-Roman Britain, but the ancient route to Ipswich followed a different path, leaving Duncan's Gate and heading east of Castle Park and crossing the River Colne, thereby heading northeast {{to meet the}} current road. An excavation in 1930 <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> of road ditches on this alignment.|$|E
5|$|More recently, June Schlueter has <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> that Martin the Elder was in London {{when the}} {{engraver}} of the First Folio portrait {{was known to}} be in Madrid. Although she began her archival research hoping to prove Edmond's assertion that the elder Martin was the Shakespeare engraver, Schlueter concludes that the newly discovered evidence actually supports the younger.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February 2005, former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafic Hariri was killed, {{along with}} 21 others, when his {{motorcade}} {{was struck by}} a roadside bomb in Beirut.

5|$|Although not all Conservapedia {{contributors}} {{subscribe to}} a young-earth creationist point of view—former administrator Terry Koeckritz stated to the Los Angeles Times {{that he did not}} take the Genesis creation account literally—sources have attributed the poor science coverage to an overall editorial support of the young-earth creationist perspective and an over-reliance on Christian creationist home-schooling textbooks. In an analysis in early 2007, science writer Carl Zimmer <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> that much of what appeared to be inaccurate or inadequate information about science and scientific theory could be traced back to an over-reliance on citations from the works of home-schooling textbook author Jay L. Wile.|$|E
5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. fMRI findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigations}} have <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> of domestication of Cucurbita going back over 8,000 {{years from the}} very southern parts of Canada down to Argentina and Chile. Centers of domestication stretch from the Mississippi River watershed and Texas down through Mexico and Central America to northern and western South America. Of the 27 species that Nee delineates, five are domesticated. Four of them, C.argyrosperma, C.ficifolia, C.moschata, and C.pepo, originated and were domesticated in Mesoamerica; for the fifth, C.maxima, these events occurred in South America.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{surveys have}} <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> that Native Americans used the {{immediate}} vicinity of Yucca Mountain on a temporary or seasonal basis. Some Native Americans disagree with the conclusions of archaeological investigators that their ancestors were highly mobile groups of hunter-gatherers who occupied the Yucca Mountain area before Euroamericans began using the area for prospecting, surveying, and ranching. They believe that these conclusions overlook traditional accounts of farming that occurred before European contact.|$|E

Although no surviving posters have been <b>found,</b> <b>evidence</b> from comments Espejo made in his writings suggests that he wrote them.|$|E
5|$|Curling is a {{team sport}} that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's tournament {{was held at the}} 1924 Winter Olympics before the sport was removed from the {{official}} programme until the 1998 Games. For 82years, the 1924 tournament was considered a demonstration sport, so the medals were not officially counted by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The tournament was won by a team from the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland, who represented Great Britain. In 2006, Scottish newspaper The Herald conducted an investigation that <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> that curling {{had been part of the}} official programme. The IOC subsequently recognized the top three teams as full medal winners.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E

5|$|Humans have {{inhabited}} the Columbia's watershed {{for more than}} 15,000years, with a transition to a sedentary lifestyle based mainly on salmon starting about 3,500years ago. In 1962, archaeologists <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> of human activity dating back 11,230years at the Marmes Rockshelter, near {{the confluence of the}} Palouse and Snake rivers in eastern Washington. In 1996 the skeletal remains of a 9,000-year-old prehistoric man (dubbed Kennewick Man) were found near Kennewick, Washington. The discovery rekindled debate in the scientific community over the origins of human habitation in North America and sparked a protracted controversy over whether the scientific or Native American community was entitled to possess and/or study the remains.|$|E

5|$|In 1923, Compton {{moved to}} the University of Chicago as Professor of Physics, a {{position}} he would occupy for the next 22 years. In 1925, he demonstrated that the scattering of 130,000-volt X-rays from the first sixteen elements in the periodic table (hydrogen through sulfur) were polarized, a result predicted by J. J. Thomson. William Duane from Harvard University spearheaded an effort to prove that Compton's interpretation of the Compton effect was wrong. Duane carried {{out a series of}} experiments to disprove Compton, but instead <b>found</b> <b>evidence</b> that Compton was correct. In 1924, Duane conceded that this was the case.|$|E
