5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|Rudy Giecek {{claims that}} the Dumas is haunted by the ghost of Elinore Knott. Author Karen Stevens also {{recalled}} paranormal experiences related to the brothel. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Knott's ghost {{is one of several}} at the Dumas.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{focused on}} intermediate community between society {{and individuals who}} experienced hikikomori. I conducted group interview with {{members of a group}} issues the information magazines of school refusal and hikikomori. As a result, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> sense of security obtained through sharing of experiences of school refusal or hikikomori is factor and motivation in their relationship. Also, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> their sensitivities to hurting others and other’s pain mediate their relationship. As regards the function of this community, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> members of the community can share their experiential knowledge through the information magazines. Also, it <b>was</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the activities of editing and selling the magazines moderates their internal confl icts...|$|R
50|$|Erythrocytes are in {{the shape}} of a biconcave disc. It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this shape <b>is</b> optimal for surface area, but this {{hypothesis}} has not been widely accepted. In addition, it has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the biconcave shape is needed to optimise the blood's flow properties.|$|R
50|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> signals {{other than}} those {{directly}} detectable in sequences may improve gene prediction. For example, the role of secondary structure {{in the identification of}} regulatory motifs has been reported. In addition, it has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> RNA secondary structure prediction helps splice site prediction.|$|R
5|$|This form of {{inheritance}} for Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome is}} not yet absolute, though, as a girl has been reported with the disorder. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> further analysis is needed for the inheritance to be formally established.|$|E
5|$|Cognition {{can also}} be {{affected}} in Wilson's disease. This comes in two, not mutually exclusive, categories: frontal lobe disorder (may present as impulsivity, impaired judgement, promiscuity, apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making) and subcortical dementia (may present as slow thinking, memory loss and executive dysfunction, without signs of aphasia, apraxia or agnosia). It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the disease.|$|E
5|$|He {{could not}} breathe {{for the first}} twenty minutes of his life. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> this {{deprivation}} may have caused him to develop Asperger's syndrome—some of his biographers, such as Mitchell Snay, maintain that this condition would account for his eccentric behaviors in later life. He was of English descent, and his forebears included early settlers of Massachusetts and New Hampshire.|$|E
50|$|It has <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> {{the ethnic}} {{aspect of the}} attacks {{are linked to the}} use of ethnic {{mobilisation}} by Jacob Zuma. It has also <b>been</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the successful challenge by Abahlali baseMjondolo to the so-called 'Slums Act' in the Constitutional Court was a factor in the attacks.|$|R

5|$|In most brachiopods, diverticula (hollow extensions) of {{the mantle}} {{penetrate}} through the mineralized {{layers of the}} valves into the periostraca. The function of these diverticula is uncertain and it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> they may be storage chambers for chemicals such as glycogen, may secrete repellents to deter organisms that stick to the shell or may help in respiration. Experiments show that a brachiopod's oxygen consumption drops if petroleum jelly is smeared on the shell, clogging the diverticula.|$|E
5|$|It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> by the Early Cambrian, organisms {{higher in}} the food chain caused the {{microbial}} mats to largely disappear. If these grazers first appeared as the Ediacaran biota started to decline, then it may suggest that they destabilised the microbial substrate, leading to displacement or detachment of the biota; or that {{the destruction of the}} mat destabilised the ecosystem, causing extinctions.|$|E
5|$|Parentage : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} for the Library lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the early Christian writings the Clementine Homilies, it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E

5|$|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor {{results show}} that gamma rays and {{antimatter}} particles (positrons) can be generated in powerful thunderstorms. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> the antimatter positrons are formed in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGF). TGFs are brief bursts occurring inside thunderstorms and associated with lightning. The streams of positrons and electrons collide higher in the atmosphere to generate more gamma rays. About 500 TGFs may occur every day worldwide, but mostly go undetected.|$|E
5|$|The {{resultant}} Cleveland Street scandal implicated other high-ranking {{figures in}} British society, and rumours swept upper-class London of {{the involvement of}} a member of the royal family, namely Prince Albert Victor. The prostitutes had not named Albert Victor, and it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, fabricated and spread the rumours to take the heat off his client. Letters exchanged between the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Augustus Stephenson, and his assistant, Hamilton Cuffe, make coded reference to Newton's threats to implicate Albert Victor.|$|E
5|$|He {{is known}} to have absorbed the {{abilities}} of Luke Cage, Vision, Red Hulk and Protector, and it <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> he also absorbed the abilities of his current Dark Avengers. In his final form, his body grew to the Hulk's size, and like Hulk he was capable of creating shockwaves by hitting the ground or smashing his hands together. His durability was sufficient to withstand the combined attacks of all the Avengers, and he demonstrated remarkable healing abilities, recovering in seconds after Daisy Johnson used her powers to make his heart explode. He could also turn intangible by manipulating his density, as the Vision does.|$|E

5|$|When {{originally}} {{conceived by}} Nuckols, laser-driven inertial fusion confinement {{was expected to}} require lasers {{of a few hundred}} kilojoules and use fuel droplets created by a perfume mister arrangement. LLNLs research since that time has demonstrated that such an arrangement cannot work, and requires machined assemblies for each shot. To be economically useful, an IFE machine would need to use fuel assemblies that cost pennies. Although LLNL does not release prices for their own targets, the similar system at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics at the University of Rochester makes targets for about $1 million each. It <b>is</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> NIF's targets cost more than $10,000.|$|E
