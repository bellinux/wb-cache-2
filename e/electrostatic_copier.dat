50|$|In a {{diversification}} {{move into}} the wider office technology sector, Smith Corona purchased the Kleinschmidt Corporation in 1956 and Marchant Calculator in 1958, changing its corporate name to Smith-Corona Marchant Inc. Also in 1958, Smith Corona acquired British Typewriters, Ltd. of West Bromwich, England, a company that made small portable typewriters. The company invented the typewriter power carriage return in 1960, the same year it moved from Syracuse to Cortland, New York and opened new corporate headquarters on Park Avenue in New York City. 1960 also saw the company's first foray into the photocopier business with the Vivicopy range of machines, also the accounting machinery market {{with a range of}} punch card and tape products manufactured for it in Germany by Kienzle. Still on the acquisition trail, SCM acquired the St. Louis Microstatic Company in 1961. This merger gave rise to the Model 33 <b>Electrostatic</b> <b>Copier,</b> which went on sale in April 1962.|$|E

However, an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copier</b> scans the document using CCD/CMOS image sensors, converts the analog signal to a digital signal, and then performs the electrophotographic process.|$|E
40|$|A {{method of}} {{reporting}} results of tests {{performed in a}} hospital bacteriological laboratory is described in which a modified commercially available <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copier</b> is used. This device was designed for a hispital system {{in which more than}} one report per specimen is issued and in which rubber stamps are widely used and frequently changed. It has been working satisfactorily for more than six months. It increases accuracy and saves time and money. Attention to the clarity of reproduction is necessary. It is suggested that this system could be modified for other laboratory reporting systems...|$|E
30|$|In this section, {{we present}} the {{algorithm}} for distinguishing documents produced by laser printers, inkjet printers, and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers.</b> We first give {{an overview of}} the different steps involved and then provide more details in the subsections that follow.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{proposed}} a method for detecting fraudulent documents. Characters in the document are analyzed to identify the signatures of the common device(s) used to create them. These devices could include laser printers, inkjet printers, and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers.</b>|$|R
30|$|In {{the next}} section, we develop an {{approach}} to differentiate between documents or characters produced by different devices based on the above observations. AWGN noise energy, impulsive noise energy, and contour roughness are used to differentiate between laser printers and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers.</b> Contour roughness and average gradient along the contour are used to differentiate between laser-printer and inkjet-printer documents.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Diamond, {{because of}} its high modulus of elasticity, {{chemical}} inertness and exceptionally high hardness, is ideal for obtaining fine surface finish and accuracy. Today’s requirement of high precision parts like magnetic memory device, laser equipment, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copier,</b> printing machine, etc., made of non-ferrous materials, such as aluminum, copper and resin demands very high surface finish. The Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) tool is suitable for such precision machining {{because of its}} low affinity to these materials and sharp cutting edges. PCD tools {{also can be used}} for machining of carbon, ceramics, glass, reinforced plastics, rubbers, plastics and resins, aluminum oxide, etc. In this paper, Response Surface Methodology is used to make a predictive mathematical model of surface roughness for aluminum turned using PCD tool on a CNC turning center. This model can be used for selecting the values of process variables namely work piece rpm, feed and depth of cut to get the desired value of the response i. e. surface finish within the range of experimentation. Keywords—PCD tool, Surface Roughness, Response Surface Methodology, CNC turning center...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method to}} distinguish documents produced by laser printers, inkjet printers, and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers,</b> three commonly used document creation devices. The proposed approach can distinguish between documents produced by these sources based on features extracted from {{the characters in the}} documents. Hence, it {{can also be used to}} detect tampered documents produced by a mixture of these sources. We analyze the characteristics associated with laser/inkjet printers and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers</b> and determine the signatures created by the different physical and technical processes involved in each type of printing. Based on the analysis of these signatures, we computed the features of noise energy, contour roughness, and average gradient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to distinguish documents produced by laser printer, inkjet printer, and copier based on features extracted from individual characters in the documents. Experimental results show that this method has an average accuracy of 90 % and works with JPEG compression.|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} {{a method to}} distinguish documents produced by laser printers, inkjet printers, and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers,</b> three devices that are commonly used today. The proposed approach can distinguish between documents produced by these sources based on {{the characters in the}} document. Hence, it {{can also be used to}} detect tampered documents produced by a mixture of these sources. We analyze the characteristic for laser/inkjet printers and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers</b> and determine the telltale ‘signatures’ caused by the different physical and technical processes involved in each type of printing. Based on the analysis of these signatures, we compute features comprising noise energy, contour roughness, and average gradient. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to distinguish documents produced by laser printers, inkjet printers, and copiers based on features extracted from individual characters in the documents. Using individual characters also allows us to detect and localize document forgeries created using different types of source documents.|$|R
30|$|As {{described}} in Section 3.1, laser printers and <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers</b> have similar architectures. Nevertheless, they produce significantly different printout qualities. Noise is {{introduced to the}} document during the scanning step in the copying process. This noise consists of AWGN and impulsive noise. AWGN noise mainly exists in the edge region of the character and has a strong influence on character morphology. In the edge region, a copied character has more significant texture than a printed character. The impulsive noise occurs mainly in the text region, appearing as white dots on the character. As described above, we extract the noise energy of AWGN and impulsive noise from the edge and text regions of the character, respectively. The noise energy in a copied character {{is expected to be}} greater than in a printed character.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of digital printing technology, production of small numbers of publications had many limitations. Large print jobs were not a problem, but small numbers of printed pages were typically during the early 20th century produced using stencils and reproducing on a mimeograph or similar machine. These produced printed pages of inferior quality to a book, cheaply and reasonably fast. By about 1950, <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers</b> were available to make paper master plates for offset duplicating machines. From about 1960 copying onto plain paper became possible for photocopy machines to make multiple good-quality copies of a monochrome original. As technology advanced it became possible to store text in digital form—- paper tape, punched cards readable by digital computer, magnetic mass storage, etc.—- and to print on a teletypewriter, line printer or other computer printer, but the software and hardware to produce original good-quality printed colour text and graphics and to print small jobs fast and cheaply was unavailable.|$|R
50|$|Colored toner became {{available}} in the 1950s, although full-color copiers were not commercially available until 3M released the Color-in-Color copier in 1968, which used a dye sublimation process rather than conventional electrostatic technology. The first <b>electrostatic</b> color <b>copier</b> was released by Xerox (the 6500) in 1973. Color photocopying is a concern to governments, as it facilitates counterfeiting currency and other documents: for more information, see Counterfeiting section.|$|R
50|$|An electrofax {{involved}} <b>electrostatic</b> printer and <b>copier</b> technology, {{where an}} image was formed {{directly on the}} paper, instead of first on a drum, then transferred to paper, {{as it would be}} in xerography. It was used in the United States from the 1950s through the 1980s.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this monograph {{is to provide a}} concise introduction to the dynamics of systems comprised of charged small-scale particles. Flowing, small-scale, particles ("particulates'') are ubiquitous in industrial processes and in the natural sciences. Applications include <b>electrostatic</b> <b>copiers,</b> inkjet printers, powder coating machines, etc., and a variety of manufacturing processes. Due to their small-scale size, external electromagnetic fields can be utilized to manipulate and control charged particulates in industrial processes in order to achieve results that are not possible by purely mechanical means alone. A unique feature of small-scale particulate flows is that they exhibit a strong sensitivity to interparticle near-field forces, leading to nonstandard particulate dynamics, agglomeration and cluster formation, which can strongly affect manufactured product quality. This monograph also provides an introduction to the mathematically-related topic of the dynamics of swarms of interacting objects, which has gained the attention of a number of scientific communities. In summary, the following topics are discussed in detail: (1) Dynamics of an individual charged particle,  (2) Dynamics of rigid clusters of charged particles, (3) Dynamics of flowing charged particles, (4) Dynamics of charged particle impact with electrified surfaces and (5) An introduction to the mechanistic modeling of swarms. The text {{can be viewed as a}} research monograph suitable for use in an upper division undergraduate or first year graduate course geared towards students in the applied sciences, mechanics and mathematics that have an interest in the analysis of particulate materials...|$|R
50|$|Iwatsu {{was seeking}} the third {{signature}} product following telephones and oscilloscopes. After {{years of research}} in Europe and the U.S., Iwatsu took notice of RCA's <b>electrostatic</b> printer and <b>copier</b> technology (electrofax). Iwatsu signed a patent license with RCA and began {{research and development of}} what was seemingly unrelated to Iwatsu's then-existing technologies. The idea behind this decision was that there wasn't much difference in terms of communications, whether electronic or on paper.|$|R
50|$|President Arnold Maremont {{declared}} in January 1957 {{that it was}} possible the company could double its size within a year and intimated that other paper companies could be acquired. By 1958 the corporation was specializing in three areas of production: book papers, business papers and school supply papers. The Allied book paper lines then included grades from the thinnest bible paper to heavy book paper for novels. Business papers include forms, mimeo, duplication and offset for reproduction machines, bond, carbon insets and special coated papers for <b>electrostatic</b> office <b>copiers.</b> School supply papers include notebook filler, construction and drawing paper, pads, envelopes and reproduction and typing papers. Also in early 1957 Allied announced they would build a large new pulp mill {{on the north side of}} Cork St in Kalamazoo but this addition never occurred. Bryant Mills A and B continued to be used to de-ink waste paper for use as stock in the Kalamazoo paper mills. This use of recycled paper would cause huge problems for the corporation in future years. Included in the recycled paper was carbonless copy paper manufactured by the National Cash Register (NCR) Company and this paper contained toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).|$|R
