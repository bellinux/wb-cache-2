Observations were conducted using three ionospheric vertical sounders located at the corners of a triangle spaced from each other at a distance of 50 km, a four azimuth <b>electrophotometer</b> by the method of space reception with a small distance and a recording unit.

With this improved method calcium content of 0. 2 -several mgs per liter can be determined using only 5 cc. of river water sample with an error of 土 10 %. Only 2 minutes are enough for a single determination and this method surpassed the ordinary oxalate method in accuracy...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} field {{test for the}} estimation of the active principle in biologically active substances, such as molluscicides, {{that are used in}} high dilution is necessary for the proper control of the application of such substances. Colorimetric methods have proved very successful in this connexion, and the present paper describes two such methods for the quantitative determination of 5, 2 ′-dichloro- 4 ′-nitrosalicylicanilide—the active ingredient of the molluscicide Bayer 73 —in very low concentrations. In the first method, the molluscicide is extracted from the water sample with amyl acetate, a methanolic solution of sodium hydroxide is added to the extract, and the resulting yellow colour is measured at 385 mμ in an <b>electrophotometer.</b> In the second method, the dye safranin is added to the sample, the colour complex then formed with the molluscicide is extracted with a mixture of organic solvents, and the colour intensity of the extract is determined by means of a wedge colorimeter, which does not need electric current for its operation. The first method, though more exact, is less suitable for use in the field than the second method, which is simpler and gives results of acceptable accuracy...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for construction of}} a nomogram, based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, with which photometric pH values can be calculated from the absorbance of an indicator in a sample and the absorbance of the indicator in a single standard solution. Thereby the necessity of preparing calibration curves {{from a series of}} standard solutions is avoided. The procedure is particularly convenient when the stock solution of the indicator is subject to slow fading, {{as in the case of}} phenol red. An application of the procedure to the photometric determination of the pH of human plasma is detailed and the results are compared with those obtained with a glass electrode. A. SINGLE-STANDARD indicator solution for a pH near the middle of the range to be covered is used. From the absorbances of the indicator in this standard arid in tile sample the pH of the sample is read on a nomogram based on the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. An indicator concentration is used such that, over the pH range to be covered, absorbances fall within the range, estimated by Gridgenlan (1) to be 0. 2 - 0. 6, where the instrumental error of an <b>electrophotometer</b> is least. The procedure and method of constructing tile nomogram can be used with any indicator that follows tile Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. For plasma pH measured with phenol red as indicator a standard for pH 7. 4 is used. Its absorbance is noted on the A 74 scale on the right of Fig. 1. A straight line from this point to the point indicating the absorbance, A, of the sample of plasma-phenol red solution on tile left hand scale cuts tile pH scale at a point that indicates tile p 1 -i of the sample. The procedure was devised to avoid repeated preparation of stand...|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the nitrates {{determination}} bj r the phenoldisulfonic acid method in the soils of São Paulo State. Several modifications were introduced which led to outline an analytical procedure. The nitrates are extracted by percolation, with a solution of H 2 SO 4 0, 01 N which is efficient in obtaining clear filtrates without clay {{and it is a}} saving time procedure. The ratio employed to remove soil nitrates is one weight of soil for three volumes of the extractor. The H 2 SO 4 solution was the best extractor found because it dissolves less organic matter from the soil than other methods. Also, with the method described, the operation of removing chlorides is easy and it is possible to use a blank determination. Losses of nitrates are significant when chlorides are present in concentration as high as 11 e. &# 956;g (3. 9 p. p. m.). The efficient removal of chlorides by using silver sulfate, can be performed only in acid extracts, if losses of nitrates are to be avoided. The solution free from chlorides must be neutralized with NaOH 1 N because acid reaction causes loss in nitrates which are liberated as HNO 3 (gas). The residual organic matter is destructed with hydrogen peroxide after drying the solution. The hydrogen peroxide always has nitrates and the quantity of them must be determined. The residual salts from the above treatments are attacked with phenoldisulfonic acid and this solution dilutes to a convenient volume and neutralized with ammonium hidroxide (1 + 1). The color intensity developed in this reaction is read in an AC model Fisher <b>Electrophotometer</b> with B- 425 filter calibrated for nitrates. The best readings are between 3 - 45 or 0, 25 - 16, 5 e. &# 956;g of NO- 3...|$|E
40|$|However, the creams which {{contained}} no perfumes showed no fluorescent reactions, so I assumed the fluorescent substances {{might be in}} the combined perfumes. I investigated the intensity of fluorescent grade of 59 sort of natural or artificial oils of perfumes by fluorescent <b>electrophotometer</b> and recorded its colour by using 2 ̆ 2 International Colour degree Table 2 ̆ 2. Its result showed that the most strong fluorescent were noticed in Bergamott group than another. In animal experiments, I applied the patch test with absorptions ointment mixture of various percent of isolated fluorescent substances on the pinnes of rabbits, and irradiated the ultravioletaays. The animal experiment result showed apparently the causative significance compaired with contrast group. As I mentioned above, I assumed that one of the causative agents of cosmetic dermatitis were the photodynamic action of fluorescent suabstance in cosmetic cream, so I advice to the makers, it is necessary to select the perfume {{in order to avoid the}} cosmetsc dermatitis. I had attention in our clinic for several years that higt rate of woman face dermatitis would be of cosmetic origin. I attempt to clear up the causes of cosmetic dermatitis and examined some etiological factor in cosmetic cream. I studied 101 cases which supposed the cosmetic causes in their history. The main site of predilection were cheek, eyelid and neck, but also seldom appears on the dorsal surface of the hand and forearm. Most of them showed further sharply bounded fresh red erythema (25 cases); erythema, edematous papules, slight desquamation (67 cases); erythema, papules, vesicules, exudation and crusts (7 cases); pigmentation (2 cases), and all cases were usually acompanied with pruritus. The age of the patients were uaually in young woman, especially at 16 - 30 years, and the beginning of the disease were approximately 60 percent of cases at March to August. Such seasonable distribution may suggested the relation this disorder and ultraviolet wavelength. The patch test were performed in those patients with suspected cosmetics, its results showed 16. 4 percent positive in cosmetic creams and 6. 3 percent positive in cosmetic lotions. Three typical cases were presented in more detail. In some cosmetics, which were called medicated cosmetic cream, contained irritant substances such as Bismut or Mercury, and apparently this substances causes the contact dermatitis in some individuals, but at another cosmetic cream (except the speciality of contained Vitamins, Hormons or Proteins), these specific character would be considered upon the combined perfumes. It is prolable that some relation may present between cosmetic injury and ultraviolet ray of sunlight. I isolated the fluorescent substances with 10 percent hydrochrolic acid dilution and ether from each marketly creams, and estimated the intensity of fluorescent. All marketly creams showed the presence of more or less fluorescent substances, but its component were uncertain...|$|E
