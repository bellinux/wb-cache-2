In the HC mode, the effects of fuel nozzle geometry on fuel-air mixing were investigated in terms of flame stability and pollutant emissions.

It {{deals with the}} creation of Mach cones which are supposed to exhibit a characteristic structure in the measured angular particle distributions allowing for direct conclusions about the Equation of State and in particular about the speed of sound of the medium. Several different scenarios of jet energy loss are examined and different mechanisms of energy and momentum loss are analyzed, ranging from weak interactions (based on calculations from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics, pQCD) to strong interactions (formulated using the Anti-de-Sitter/Conformal Field Theory Correspondence, AdS/CFT). Though they result in different angular particle correlations which could in principle allow to distinguish the underlying processes, it is shown that the characteristic structure observed in experimental data can be obtained due to the different contributions of several possible jet trajectories through an expanding medium. Such a structure cannot directly be connected to the Equation of State.

In addition, many properties of laminar diffusion flames are directly relevant to turbulent diffusion flames using laminar flamelet concepts.

Motivated by these observations, the shapes of round hydrocarbon-fueled laminar <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames were considered, emphasizing conditions where effects of buoyancy are small because most practical flames are not buoyant. Earlier studies of shapes of hydrocarbon-fueled nonbuoyant laminar <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames considered combustion in still air and have shown that flames at the laminar smoke point are roughly {{twice as long as}} corresponding soot-free (blue) flames and have developed simple ways to estimate their shapes.

These studies were limited to soot-containing flames at laminar smoke point conditions and also developed simple ways to estimate their shapes but the behavior of corresponding soot-free flames has not been addressed. This is unfortunate because ways of selecting flame flow properties to reduce soot concentrations are of great interest; in addition, soot-free flames are fundamentally important because they are much more computationally tractable than corresponding soot-containing flames. Thus, the objectives of the present investigation were to observe the shapes of weakly-buoyant laminar <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames at both soot-free and smoke point conditions and to use the results to evaluate simplified flame shape models.

The motivation behind {{this study was to}} obtain {{a better understanding of the}} dynamics of <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames, as part of a long-term effort in achieving flexible fuel utilisation such as interchangeable fuels and achieving more effective combustion control such as better combustion efficiency. In the experimental study of <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flames, the influences of parameters such as nozzle exit diameter, fuel flow rate, fuel types and burner geometries have been investigated, where the focus was on the effects of fuel mixture on the flame dynamics. The frequency spectra, flame vortex development and flickering frequencies were measured using flow visualisation techniques and data acquisition systems. It was observed that the fuel jet velocity and the type of burner had a weak influence on the pulsation frequency for all the tested diameters. In contrast it has been found that both the ambient condition and fuel variability do have significant effects on the flame flickering frequency. Flame structure and dynamics are very different for the methane, propane and mixed fuel jet flames. Since the measurements of variables such as entrainment properties are difficult to obtain under experimental conditions, it is more effective to deal with such problems numerically. In the second part of this study, the dynamics of the buoyant <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flame has been investigated by idealised axisymmetric direct numerical simulations (DNS). The physical problem is a fuel jet issuing vertically into an oxidant ambient. Taking the advantages of idealised computational conditions, the effects of nozzle velocity profile, initial momentum thickness, Froude number, Reynolds number and co-flow on the near-field dynamics of a <b>jet</b> <b>diffusion</b> flame have been investigated. The computational cases have shown the development of different vortical structures, which suggest that vortical structures depend on both buoyancy and jet nozzle velocity profile. The flickering frequency and flickering energy results provide supportive evidence of the above finding. The results of the co-flow case indicate no significant flame-vortex interaction, and the flame oscillation is being suppressed. In general, the study suggested that the velocity shear plays a significant role in the near-field flame dynamics, apart from the buoyancy effects.

This requires us to have a full understanding of the physical properties of magnetized plasmas of different degrees of ionization {{for a wide range of}} densities and temperatures. We derive general equations governing the magneto-hydrodynamic evolution of a three-fluid medium of arbitrary ionization, also including the possibility of charged dust grains as the main charge carriers. In a companion paper (Pinto & Galli 2007), we complement this analysis computing accurate expressions of the collisional coupling coefficients. Over spatial and temporal scales larger than the so-called large-scale plasma limit and the collision-dominated plasma limit, and for non-relativistic fluid speeds, we obtain an advection-diffusion for the magnetic field. We derive the general expressions for the resistivities, the diffusion time scales and the heating rates in a three-fluid medium and we use them to estimate the evolution of the magnetic field in molecular clouds and protostellar jets. Collisions between charged particles significantly increase the value of the Ohmic resistivity during the process of cloud collapse, affecting in particular the decoupling of matter and magnetic field and enhancing the rate of energy dissipation. The Hall resistivity can take larger values than previously found when the negative charge is mostly carried by dust grains. In weakly-or mildy-ionized protostellar <b>jets,</b> ambipolar <b>diffusion</b> is found to occur on a time scale comparable to the dynamical time scale, limiting the validity of steady-state and nondissipative models to study the jet's structure.

40|$|A {{computational}} model {{to study the}} stability characteristics of an evolving buoyant helium gas jet in ambient air environment is presented. Numerical formulation incorporates a segregated approach to solve for the transport equations of helium mass fraction coupled with the conservation equations of mixture mass and momentum using a staggered grid method. The operating parameters correspond to the Reynolds number varying from 30 to 300 to demarcate the flow dynamics in oscillating and non-oscillating regimes. Computed velocity and concentration fields were {{used to analyze the}} flow structure in the evolving jet. For Re= 300 case, results showed that an instability mode that sets in during the evolution process in Earth gravity is absent in zero gravity, signifying the importance of buoyancy. Though buoyancy initiates the instability, below a certain <b>jet</b> exit velocity, <b>diffusion</b> dominates the entrainment process to make the jet non-oscillatory as observed for the Re= 30 case. Initiation of the instability was found to be dependent on the interaction of buoyancy and momentum forces along the jet shear layer...|$|R
