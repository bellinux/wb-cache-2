5|$|Another similar rags-to-riches {{story is}} Pang Lim, {{who was an}} illegal fruit hawker in Sungei Road in the 1970s. <b>His</b> <b>big</b> break came when he saved enough money to rent a coffee shop in 1990 with his younger brother and uncle. They rented the stalls out to other hawkers and managed the drinks stall themselves. The {{business}} took off and from one coffee shop, Pang is now the managing director of Koufu, which operates 20 foodcourts, five coffee shops and five cafes around the island.|$|E

5|$|West got <b>his</b> <b>big</b> {{break in}} the year 2000, {{when he began to}} produce for artists on Roc-A-Fella Records. West came to achieve {{recognition}} and is often credited with revitalizing Jay-Z's career with his contributions to the rap mogul's influential 2001 album The Blueprint. The Blueprint is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums, and the critical and financial success of the album generated substantial interest in West as a producer. Serving as an in-house producer for Roc-A-Fella Records, West produced records for other artists from the label, including Beanie Sigel, Freeway, and Cam'ron. He also crafted hit songs for Ludacris, Alicia Keys, and Janet Jackson.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} at Zaragoza, {{the team was}} in need of money, as a result, Villa made <b>his</b> <b>big</b> move to one of Spanish football's heavyweights, as a new look Valencia under Quique Sánchez Flores parted with €12million to secure his {{services}} in the summer of 2005. During his first game in a Valencia shirt, an Intertoto Cup match against Belgian outfit Gent, Villa scored the first goal in a game which Valencia won 2–0. He made his league debut for Valencia coming on as a substitute against Real Betis in a 1–0 win on 27 August 2005. The next match would see his previous team, Zaragoza, leading 2–1 {{for the majority of the}} match; however, on the 81st minute, Villa came on as a late substitute for Rubén Baraja and scored the equalizer within the space of a minute, earning Valencia a point in a 2–2 draw.|$|E
5|$|After the World Cup England {{lost the}} annual Home Championship to Scotland after a 3–2 defeat in April 1967, Charlton scored {{for the second}} {{successive}} international game running after also finding the net against Wales the previous November. He injured his foot during the game as he broke two sesamoid bones in <b>his</b> <b>big</b> toe. As his career went on he began to miss England games with niggling injuries {{so as to avoid}} friendly games in favour of playing important matches for Leeds; Brian Labone would take his place in the England team during Charlton's absences. He was named in the squad for UEFA Euro 1968, but did not feature in either of England's games. He won five caps in 1969, helping England to a memorable 5–0 win over France and scoring in a 1–0 win over Portugal from a corner taken by his brother Bobby.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, Day-Lewis worked in theatre and {{television}} including Frost in May (where he played an impotent man-child) and How Many Miles to Babylon? (as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland) for the BBC. Eleven {{years after his}} film debut, Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi (1982) as Colin, a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character. In late 1982 he had <b>his</b> <b>big</b> theatre break {{when he took over}} the lead in Another Country. The following year, he had a supporting role as the conflicted, but ultimately loyal first mate in The Bounty, after which he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of <b>his</b> <b>big</b> public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He now had to reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|Offscreen, Robert Mitchum's {{arrest and}} {{conviction}} for marijuana possession—he would serve {{two months in}} jail—was widely assumed to mean career death for RKO's most promising young star, but Hughes surprised the industry by announcing that his contract was not endangered. Of much broader significance, Hughes decided to get the jump on <b>his</b> <b>Big</b> Five competitors by being the first to settle the federal government's antitrust suit against the major studios, which had won a crucial Supreme Court ruling in United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Under the consent decree he signed, Hughes agreed to dissolve the old parent company, Radio-Keith-Orpheum Corp., and split RKO's production-distribution business and its exhibition chain into two entirely separate corporations—RKO Pictures Corp. and RKO Theatres Corp.—with the obligation to promptly sell off one or the other. While Hughes delayed the divorcement procedure until December 1950 and didn't actually sell his stock in the theater company for another three years, his decision to acquiesce {{was one of the}} crucial steps in the collapse of classical Hollywood's studio system.|$|E

5|$|While his {{selections}} {{provided the}} album's {{country and western}} foundation, the musical arrangements represented its contemporary influence. Eager to display <b>his</b> <b>big</b> band ensemble in studio, Charles enlisted premier jazz arrangers Gerald Wilson and Gil Fuller, while Marty Paich, who {{was active in the}} West Coast jazz scene, was hired to arrange the lush strings and chorus numbers. Despite enlisting a roster of professional arrangers and musicians, Charles intended to control the artistic direction of the recordings. To indicate specific licks he wanted emphasized for certain songs, Charles would put together voice-and-piano demos and pass them along to the arrangers, informing them of {{what he wanted to do}} with specific sounds. According to Feller, at one point during recording, Charles rewrote an entire botched arrangement and dictated the parts to each of the 18 backing musicians.|$|E
