40|$|This {{research}} {{encompasses the}} automated design and structural optimization of reinforced concrete slab <b>frame</b> <b>bridges,</b> considering investment costs and environmental impacts. The most {{important feature of}} this work is that it focusses on realistic and complete models of slab <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> rather than on optimization of only individual members or sections of a bridge. The thesis consists of an extended summary of publications and three appended papers. In the first paper, using simple assumptions, the possibility of applying cost-optimization to the structural design of slab <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> was investigated. The results of the optimization of an existing constructed bridge showed the potential to reduce the investment cost of slab <b>frame</b> <b>bridges.</b> The procedure was further developed in the second paper. In this paper, automated design was integrated to a more refined cost-optimization methodology based on more detailed assumptions and including extra constructability factors. This procedure was then applied to a bridge under design, before its construction. From {{the point of view}} of sustainability, bridge design should not only consider criteria such as cost but also environmental performance. The third paper thus integrated life cycle assessment (LCA) with the design optimization procedure to perform environmental impact optimization of the same case study bridge as in the second paper. The results of investment cost and environmental impact optimization were then compared. The obtained results presented in the appended papers highlight the successful application of optimization techniques to the structural design of reinforced concrete slab <b>frame</b> <b>bridges.</b> Moreover, the results indicate that a multi-objective optimization that simultaneously considers both environmental impacts and investment cost is necessary in order to generate more sustainable designs. The presented methodology has been applied to the design process for a time-effective, sustainable, and optimal design of concrete slab <b>frame</b> <b>bridges.</b> QC 20170316 </p...|$|R

30|$|The {{two most}} {{prevalent}} courses of frame alignment in an FRP context are <b>frame</b> <b>bridging</b> and <b>frame</b> amplification. <b>Frame</b> <b>bridging</b> allows an FRP to link previously unconnected master frame components {{so as to}} expand its potential audience. Often times, FRPs divide the electorate in two antagonistic groups with their dualistic frames. Nationalism does this by creating those {{within and outside the}} nation. Populism differentiates between ‘the people’ and the ‘elite’. Authoritarianism differs between those who submit to and those who reject authority. Xenophobia emphasises fear of ‘the other’. In this context, it is advantageous for FRPs to generate overlap between several of these antagonistic categories, thereby <b>bridging</b> different audiences. <b>Frame</b> amplification indicates that certain master frame components take priority over others. Because these components are often directly and most concretely linked to the electorate, this process reduces ambiguity and increase consideration for the (entire) FRP master frame. This is mostly achieved through rhetoric (about immigration, the EU, etc.) and is a particular strength of FRPs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Against {{the problem}} of the {{aerodynamic}} interference effects on aerostatic coefficients between parallel continuous rigid <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> with high-pier and long-span, the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in the parallel long-span continuous rigid <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> were investigated in details by means of wind tunnel test. The space between the two main beams and wind attack angles were changed during the wind tunnel test to study the effects on aerodynamic interferences of aerostatic coefficients of main beam. The test got aerostatic coefficients of 10 conditions. The research results have shown that the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in parallel bridges can not be ignored. The aerodynamic interference effects on parallel bridge main beam is shown mainly as follows: The drag coefficient of main beam downstream dropped and the drag coefficient of main beam upstream changed but not change significantly. There are also the aerodynamic interference effects of lateral force coefficient and torque coefficient between the main beams upstream and downstream. The effects upstream are smaller and the effects downstream are larger...|$|R

40|$|FE-modeling is {{a rapidly}} {{spreading}} method to analyze structures nowadays. With this theunderstanding {{of the outcome}} is of very high importance and potential inaccuracies areimportant to find so that faulty and over dimensioning of the structure does not occur whichleads to unnecessary costs. One of these inaccuracies is the unrealistic sectional forces that occurdue to thermal effects in the transversal direction for concrete <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> which leads to anexcessive amount much reinforcement in the structure than actually needed. This has beenstudied with several cases by using two approaches on how to apply {{the temperature in the}} framebridge, only in the superstructure and in the whole structure, but also by analyzing severalboundary conditions. By examining the results for the sectional forces and stresses one of thetemperature approaches could be disregarded because of the extreme values in the transitionbetween superstructure and support. But the other approach was much more useful because ofits better compliance with reality. With these results and by calculating the reinforcement neededfor the worst case, one model {{has been found to be}} the most favorable and can be used whenmodeling concrete <b>frame</b> <b>bridges</b> with acceptable outcome. The study resulted in a model whereone applies a varying temperature on the whole structure, with spring boundary conditions over asurface that represents the bottom slab...|$|R
