40|$|Air-atomizing, splash-groove {{injectors}} {{were shown}} to improve primary-zone <b>fuel</b> <b>spreading</b> and reduce combustor exhaust emissions for Jet A and diesel number 2 fuels. With Jet A fuel large-orifice, splash-groove injectors the oxides-of-nitrogen emission index was reduced, but emissions of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, or smoke were unaffected. Small-orifice, splash-groove injectors did not reduce oxides of nitrogen, but reduced the smoke number and carbon monoxide and unburned-hydrocarbon emission indices. With diesel number 2 fuel, the small-orifice, splash-groove injectors reduced oxides of nitrogen by 19 percent, smoke number by 28 percent, carbon monoxide by 75 percent, and unburned hydrocarbons by 50 percent. Smoke number and unburned hydrocarbons were twice as high with diesel number 2 as with Jet A fuel. Combustor blowout limits were similar for diesel number 2 and Jet A fuels...|$|E
40|$|A two-part {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to address the issues of supersonic fuel mixing enhancement and efficient combustor development. The first part of the study involved quantitative characterization of fuel-air mixing in a non-reacting supersonic flowfield. Two flow configurations were compared: i.) a baseline case with normal fuel injection and ii.) a case with an acoustically open cavity placed downstream of the injection in order to excite mixing. Direct measurements of local atomic fuel-air ratio were acquired using Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS), which was applied {{for the first time in}} a supersonic flowfield. Indirect measurements of <b>fuel</b> <b>spreading</b> rate were inferred from intensity gradients in time-averaged Schlieren images. The quantitative results were compared to show conclusive gains in fuel-air mixing rate for the cavity configuration. LIBS was proven as an effective diagnostic for quantifying supersonic mixing. In the second part of the study, a baseline supersonic combustor was designed, built, and tested for future comparative studies of combustion performance. The combustor featured a square cross-section and a three-dimensional expanding section, with optical access on one side. Combustor wall pressure was measured at various fuel injection conditions. Supersonic combustion was evident for some conditions, but results indicated poor combustion efficiency for all cases. This shows the need for either mixing enhancement or a redesign of the baseline conditions...|$|E

40|$|The accreting {{millisecond}} pulsar XTE J 1814 - 338 exhibits oscillations at the known spin frequency during Type I X-ray bursts. The {{properties of the}} burst oscillations reflect {{the nature of the}} thermal asymmetry on the stellar surface. We present an analysis of the variability of the burst oscillations of this source, focusing on three characteristics: fractional amplitude, harmonic content and frequency. Fractional amplitude and harmonic content constrain the size, shape and position of the emitting region, whilst variations in frequency indicate motion of the emitting region on the neutron star surface. We examine both long-term variability {{over the course of the}} outburst, and short-term variability during the bursts. For most of the bursts, fractional amplitude is consistent with that of the accretion pulsations, implying a low degree of <b>fuel</b> <b>spread.</b> There is however a population of bursts whose fractional amplitudes are substantially lower, implying a higher degree of <b>fuel</b> <b>spread,</b> possibly forced by the explosive burning front of a precursor burst. For the first harmonic, substantial differences between the burst and accretion pulsations suggest that hotspot geometry is not the only mechanism giving rise to harmonic content in the latter. Fractional amplitude variability during the bursts is low; we can only rule out the hypothesis that the fractional amplitude remains constant at the l(sigma) level for bursts that do not exhibit photospheric radius expansion (PRE). There are no significant variations in frequency in any of the bursts except for the one burst that exhibits PRE. This burst exhibits a highly significant but small (= 0. 1 Hz) drop in frequency in the burst rise. The timescale of the frequency shift is slower than simple burning layer expansion models predict, suggesting that other mechanisms may be at work...|$|R
40|$|Upward flame <b>spread</b> over {{discrete}} <b>fuels</b> {{has been}} analyzed through experimental research on vertical arrays of alternating lengths of PMMA and insulation. By manipulating the lengths of the PMMA fuel and the insulation, several important trends related to flame spread {{were identified and}} assessed. The peak flame spread rate for arrays with 4 cm lengths of PMMA occurred at a fuel percentage of 67 %; for arrays with 8 cm PMMA, a peak flame spread rate occurred at fuel percentages of 67 %, 80 %, and 89 %. It has been hypothesized that increased air entrainment at these fuel percentages maximizes the flame spread rate. Based on observed trends, this study proposed a method for approximation of the <b>fuel</b> <b>spread</b> rate at various fuel percentages. Given reasonable estimates for the homogeneous flame spread rate and the lowest fuel percentage that sustains spread, an estimation for intermediate spread rate values is feasible...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Converting a {{gasoline}} engine to propane (LPG) usually results in power reduction. This can be mitigated by careful {{design of the}} injection system so the heat required for evaporation of the LPG is drawn from the intake air, so it is cooled and densified, resulting {{in an increase in}} volumetric efficiency. In this work, LPG sprays were imaged using Mie and LIF imaging techniques from {{a gasoline}} direct injection (GDI) injector, a port fuel injector and from long and short pipes connecting a remote LPG metering valve to the injection point. Images were taken in an optically accessed pressure chamber at pressures from atmospheric to 20 bar and with fuel line pressures from 10 to 80 bar. The imaging of the pipe-coupled injection system shows that there is significant evaporation in the pipe, which amount depends on the length and diameter of the pipe. During its travel down the pipe, the injected pulse of <b>fuel</b> <b>spreads</b> out so the duration of the LPG pulse at the manifold end is, for 300 mm pipes, five times the original duration at the injector and even greater for 600 mm pipes. The narrow structure of the sprays and the amount of evaporation that occurs before the fuel enters the manifold explains the observed differences in engine torque and in-cylinder mixture temperature observed with the different systems. The spray structures with gasoline and LPG from the direct injector are similar and more sensitive t...|$|R

40|$|AbstractSustained {{combustion}} and optimization of combustor {{are the two}} challenges being {{faced by}} combustion scientists working {{in the area of}} supersonic combustion. Thorough mixing, lower stagnation pressure losses, positive thrust and sustained combustion are the key issues in the field of supersonic combustion. Special fluid mechanism is required to achieve good mixing. To induce such mechanisms in supersonic inflows, the fuel injectors should be critically shaped incurring less flow losses. Present investigations are focused on the effect of fuel injection scheme on a model scramjet combustor performance. Ramps at supersonic flow generate axial vortices that help in macro-mixing of fuel with air. Interaction of shocks generated by ramps with the fuel stream generates boro-clinic torque at the air & liquid fuel interface, enhancing micro-mixing. Recirculation zones present in cavities increase the residence time of the combustible mixture. Making use of the advantageous features of both, a ramp-cavity combustor is designed. The combustor has two sections. First, constant height section consists of a backward facing step followed by ramps and cavities on both the top and bottom walls. The ramps are located alternately on top and bottom walls. The complete combustor width is utilized for the cavities. The second section of the combustor is diverging area section. This is provided to avoid thermal choking. In the present work gaseous hydrogen is considered as fuel. This study was mainly focused on the mixing characteristics of four different fuel injection locations. It was found that injecting fuel upstream of the ramp was beneficial from <b>fuel</b> <b>spread</b> point of view...|$|R
