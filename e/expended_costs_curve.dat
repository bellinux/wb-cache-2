50|$|In economics, a <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is a graph of {{the costs}} of {{production}} as a function of total quantity produced. In a free market economy, productively efficient firms use these curves to find the optimal point of production (minimizing cost), and profit maximizing firms can use them to decide output quantities to achieve those aims. There are various types of <b>cost</b> <b>curves,</b> all related to each other, including total and average <b>cost</b> <b>curves,</b> and marginal ("for each additional unit") <b>cost</b> <b>curves,</b> which are equal to the differential of the total <b>cost</b> <b>curves.</b> Some are applicable to the short run, others to the long run.|$|R

50|$|<b>Cost</b> <b>curves</b> can be {{combined}} {{to provide information about}} firms. In this diagram for example, firms are assumed to be in a perfectly competitive market. In a perfectly competitive market the price that firms are faced with would be the price at which the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> cuts the average <b>cost</b> <b>curve.</b>|$|R
50|$|A short-run {{marginal}} <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> graphically {{represents the}} relation between marginal (i.e., incremental) cost incurred by a firm in the short-run production of a good or service and the quantity of output produced. This curve is constructed to capture {{the relation between}} marginal cost {{and the level of}} output, holding other variables, like technology and resource prices, constant. The marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is usually U-shaped. Marginal cost is relatively high at small quantities of output; then as production increases, marginal cost declines, reaches a minimum value, then rises. The marginal cost is shown in relation to marginal revenue (MR), the incremental amount of sales revenue that an additional unit of the product or service will bring to the firm. This shape of the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is directly attributable to increasing, then decreasing marginal returns (and the law of diminishing marginal returns). Marginal cost equals w/MPL. For most production processes the marginal product of labor initially rises, reaches a maximum value and then continuously falls as production increases. Thus marginal cost initially falls, reaches a minimum value and then increases. The marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> intersects both the average variable <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> and (short-run) average total <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> at their minimum points. When the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is above an average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> the average curve is rising. When the marginal <b>costs</b> <b>curve</b> is below an average curve the average curve is falling. This relation holds regardless of whether the marginal curve is rising or falling.|$|R
5000|$|Assuming that factor {{prices are}} constant, the {{production}} function determines all cost functions. The variable <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is the inverted short-run production function or total product curve and its behavior and properties {{are determined by}} the production function.

40|$|This {{case study}} uses {{data from a}} {{self-insured}} employer plan to perform an analysis into {{the properties of the}} health care <b>cost</b> <b>curve.</b> The analysis shows that one statistical property of the health care <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is that <b>costs</b> rise continuously, not on an annual or monthly basis. Graphical analysis indicates that managed care techniques used to restrain costs can also smooth utilization, producing the continuously growing <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> observed. The analysis further illustrates that there is no one ‘‘cost curve’’—analysis must be segmented by population. Finally, the power of predictive models to ﬁt the <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> varies by population. To the extent that these results generalize to other health plans, this analysis should be used to inform the implementation of strategies to bend the <b>cost</b> <b>curve.</b> Population health management programs and health policy should be based on continuous analysis and adaption rather than implemented as one-off changes.

50|$|The long-run {{marginal}} <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> {{is shaped}} by returns to scale, a long-run concept, rather than the law of diminishing marginal returns, which is a short-run concept. The long-run marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> tends to be flatter than its short-run counterpart due to increased input flexibility as to cost minimization. The long-run marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> intersects the long-run average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> at the minimum point of the latter. When long-run marginal costs are below long-run average costs, long-run average costs are falling (as to additional units of output). When long-run marginal costs are above long run average costs, average costs are rising. Long-run marginal cost equals short run marginal-cost at the least-long-run-average-cost level of production.

5000|$|A typical average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> {{will have}} a U-shape, because fixed costs are all {{incurred}} before any production takes place and marginal costs are typically increasing, because of diminishing marginal productivity. In this [...] "typical" [...] case, for low levels of production marginal costs are below average costs, so average costs are decreasing as quantity increases. An increasing marginal <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> will intersect a U-shaped average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> at its minimum, after which point the average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> begins to slope upward. For further increases in production beyond this minimum, marginal cost is above average costs, so average costs are increasing as quantity increases. An example of this typical case would be a factory designed to produce a specific quantity of widgets per period: below a certain production level, average cost is higher due to under-utilized equipment, while above that level, production bottlenecks increase the average cost.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a nonparametric {{method of obtaining}} the minimum of the long run average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> of a firm to define its capacity output. This provides a benchmark for measuring of capacity utilization at the observed output level of the firm. In the case of long run constant returns to scale, the minimum of the short run average <b>cost</b> <b>curve</b> is determined to measure short run capacity utilization. An empirical application measures yearly rates of capacity utilization in U. S. manufacturing over the period 1968 - 1998.
