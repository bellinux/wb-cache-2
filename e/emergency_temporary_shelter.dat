50|$|In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans {{and much}} of the Gulf Coast region. The Superdome was used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>shelter</b> for {{displaced}} residents. The stadium suffered damage from the hurricane (notably from flooding and part of the roof being torn off as well as internal damage), and from lack of available facilities. The Saints were forced to play their first scheduled home game against the New York Giants at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey (the Giants' home stadium); other home games were rescheduled at the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas or Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. During the season, it was rumored that Saints owner Tom Benson might deem the Superdome unusable and seek to legally void his contract and relocate the team to San Antonio, where he has business interests. Ultimately, however, the Superdome was repaired and renovated in time for the 2006 season at an estimated cost of US$185 million. The New Orleans Saints' first post-Katrina home game was an emotionally charged Monday Night Football game versus their division rival, the Atlanta Falcons. The Saints, under rookie head coach Sean Payton and new quarterback Drew Brees, defeated the Falcons 23-3, and went on to notch the second playoff win in franchise history.|$|E

30|$|Researchers {{attempted}} {{to gauge the}} strength of cultural norms in the recovery process by determining where (sources of aid) people sought assistance and how {{many different types of}} aid where provided by each source. The fundamental idea being that the more types of aid a source provided, the fewer number of sources a household would have to reach-out to. The research covered the entire recovery processes as set forth by Quarantelli (1991), from the moment of impact (i.e., warning [or lack thereof], <b>emergency</b> <b>sheltering,</b> <b>temporary</b> <b>sheltering,</b> <b>temporary</b> housing, and to permanent housing). This article focuses primarily on {{the latter half of the}} survey: sources of aid for housing recovery, though previous research has shown that there is a tendency for disenfranchised households to “adopt” temporary housing as a permanent solution to a sheltering crisis (Phillips 1993; Quarantelli 1991).|$|R

40|$|The {{growing number}} of {{disasters}} occurred for the past decades has been {{increasing the number of}} studies on disaster subject. The topics are varies ranging from theory, mitigation and management, educations, as well as design and planning for post-disaster context. The demand for products for emergency response has also increased. Not limited to food, medicines, blankets and cloths that must be made available immediately following any catastrophic event, but survivors also need shelters. “The great mass of survivors must get a roof over their head, and quickly above all”. Considering the important of providing shelters for survivors, the Centre for Design Innovation (CDI) of Swinburne University of Technology is embarking a project called ‘Humanitarian village (Shelter+) Project (sanctuary from distress, community care). This project focused on community-led design for better <b>temporary</b> pop up <b>shelter</b> villages for people escaping highly distressing scenarios, particularly smaller to medium sized events such as flood and bushfires.

The red cross used the larger gymnasium as a <b>temporary</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> for large number of persons displaced by fire (or other natural disasters. Many neighboring churches from many different denominations participated in a dinner held for the residence of the shelter. Additionally, two group homes were started in neighboring apartments, called Gilead house and St Francis house, for the chronically mentally ill. After seven years of service, Rev. Shuster was called to continue the ministry.In 1990, St. Luke's Chapel provided a homeless shelter for homeless women and children.

5000|$|Upon the {{invasion}} of the Netherlands by the Nazis in May 1940, Parsons joined a network of resistance composed of people from diverse walks of life—farmers, teachers, business people. Similar to the famous Corrie ten Boom, Parsons sheltered downed Allied airmen in her home, [...] "Ingleside", near Laren. At the beginning of the German occupation, Parsons dismissed her servants so that their quarters {{on the top floor of}} Ingleside could be used to accommodate Allied airmen. A “hiding place” behind the closet in the master bedroom was available as a <b>temporary</b> <b>emergency</b> <b>shelter</b> for the airmen in the event that her home was searched by the Nazis. Once the pilots left Parsons' home, they were transported to Leiden, where fishing boats took them to rendezvous with British submarines for their return to England. The number of Allied pilots she saved is unknown. The last airmen to hide at Ingleside remained for an unprecedented six days in September 1941. The network had been infiltrated, and contacts were unable to move the airmen as previously planned. Flight Engineer William 'Jock' Moir and Navigator Richard Pape were finally moved to Leiden, where they were caught by the Gestapo.|$|R

40|$|Number {{of victims}} from the {{disaster}} has been dramatically increasing around the world. This phenomenon causes {{a very high}} demand of <b>emergency</b> and <b>temporary</b> <b>shelters</b> on particular basis including the need of permanent houses in resettlement programmes. Noticeably, those resettlement programmes have shown the success and failure of their activities. For instance, plenty communities have been forced by governments to abandon their lands to the new locations for safety purpose. Inevitably, many suffered people {{have to stay in}} the provided areas because they have no place to go (Gall, 2004). Furthermore, there are abundant cases in which people move back to their original land. Certainly, those failures have shown from the total change of life patterns and styles which cause people many difficulties (Dikmen, 2002). These results show the unsuccessful resettlement programmes which require a better solution. According to the previous works, vulnerable hazard areas have been rarely studied in term of people behaviours correlated between the spatial and social aspects. Based on the resettlement paradigm, building a new settlement site better, safer and suitable for suffered people from disaster, traditional lifestyle of people in communities has to be carefully studied before setting a displacement or resettlement plan. Spatial analysis model with employing several scenes of high-resolution images is an effective tool proposed in this study. The applications of spatial analysis techniques in resettlement programmes are introduced to present a crucial integration between human behaviours in hazard areas and the relevant factors. Prescriptive method is employed to describe the current situations due to the advantage of this method in studying the complexity of human behaviours. This study is an initial part of literature review associated with the application of spatial analysis in resettlement programme. An expected outcome of this study is a framework to develop a model for simulating the human interaction between the spatial and nonspatial parameters. Apart from this study, the designed spatial and non-spatial database in geoinformatics will be suggested to set some factor criteria in the next step of this study. Eventually, this study will be beneficial to other case studies with the similar context...|$|R
