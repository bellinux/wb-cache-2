50|$|Although {{variations}} exist, {{as noted}} below, most rear derailleurs have several components in common. They have a cage that holds two pulleys that guide the chain in an S-shaped pattern. The pulleys {{are known as}} the jockey pulley or <b>guide</b> <b>pulley</b> (top) and the tension pulley (bottom). The cage rotates in its plane and is spring-loaded to take up chain slack. The cage is positioned under the desired sprocket by an arm that can swing back and forth under the sprockets. The arm is usually implemented with a parallelogram mechanism to keep the cage properly aligned with the chain as it swings back and forth. The {{other end of the}} arm mounts to a pivot point attached to the bicycle frame. The arm pivots about this point to maintain the cage at a nearly constant distance from the different sized sprockets. There may be one or more adjustment screws that control the amount of lateral travel allowed and the spring tension.|$|E
50|$|Within the spherical joint, {{the main}} tube is led through {{a kind of}} guide tube, which is capable of turning, in a {{vertical}} plane, upon side trunnions; These trunnions being supported by bearings which work in vertical guides, and are capable of being raised or lowered by the arrangement shown in Fig. 2. This arrangement is as follows: From each bearing a chain is led, over a <b>guide</b> <b>pulley</b> situated {{at the top of}} the guide belonging to that bearing, to an arm fixed on a rocking-shaft placed close to the floor of the vessel. On this rocking-shaft there is also fixed another arm, and from this a chain proceeds aft to the piston rod of a horizontal steam cylinder, placed as shown in Fig. 2. This cylinder is provided with a slide valve, by which the steam can be admitted to or released from the forward end of the cylinder at pleasure; and, when the steam is so admitted, it drives back the piston, and, by means of the arrangement of chains and rocking-shaft already described, raised the guide tube, through which the main tube passes, and thus depresses that end of the latter which carries the torpedo. The extent to which the piston in the steam cylinder is driven back, and, consequently, the extent to which the guide tube is raised, is regulated by means of a screw which passes through the back cylinder cover, this screw, which is furnished with a handwheel and check-nut, forming a stop against which the piston rests when driven back by the steam.|$|E

50|$|The {{lower part}} of the bow of the vessel, instead of being made solid as usual, is {{composed}} of two iron flaps, each hinged at the top, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. When closed, the outer surfaces of these flaps correspond to the general shape of the bow, and, when the torpedo machinery is not being worked, they are kept down in their places by means of chains attached to them near their lower edges, and passing in through a pair of hawsepipes situated between the flaps. Each chain, after entering its hawsepipe, is attached to an iron rod, these rods passing into the vessel through stuffing-boxes at the inner ends of the hawsepipes. From the inner ends of these rods chains are led, over <b>guide</b> <b>pulleys,</b> to the ends of a winch, situated as shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and by means of this winch, which is worked by hand, the flaps can be closed when required. The opening of the flaps is effected by the arrangements shown in Figs. 1 and 4, from which it will be seen that each flap has a chain attached to its outside, and that these chains, after being led up over <b>guide</b> <b>pulleys</b> supported by brackets placed {{at the level of the}} gunwale, are crossed and then led down through hawseholes in the deck to the winch below. The chains for opening, in fact, form continuations of those for closing the flaps, or vice versa.|$|R

40|$|The micromanipulator’s force {{feedback}} {{is one of}} the key research contents of minimally invasive surgical robotic system. Because the micromanipulator is a kind of compact construction which is suitable for valve installation with small space in surgery, especially for the influence of disinfection method, there are major difficulties and limitations to integrate compact sensors in the end of micromanipulator. This article focuses on the 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s clamping force sensing, and these three joints are actuated by wirerope driving. A clamping force sensing method is proposed based on static tension of wirerope driving, and a static model between the clamping force and wirerope’s static tension is established considering the influence of real friction resistance in the mechanical system. Finally, an equivalent experimental test platform for 3 -degree-of-freedom micromanipulator’s clamping force sensing is set up, and then a series of experiments of the clamping force are studied. The frictional resistances of wirerope between the guide plate and <b>guide</b> <b>pulley</b> mechanism are tested, and a calibration and correction method of the experimental clamping force is proposed. The final experiment results show that the total average accuracy of experimental clamping force is about 78. 3 %, and it can be the basic measurement force to realize micromanipulator’s clamping {{force feedback}} of a minimally invasive surgical robot...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Powered robotic exoskeletons for {{assistance}} of human locomotion are currently under development for military and medical applications. The energy requirements for such devices are excessive, {{and this has}} become a major obstacle for practical applications. Legged locomotion in many animals, however, is very energy efficient. We propose that poly-articular elastic mechanisms are a major contributor to the economy of locomotion in such specialized animals. Consequently, {{it should be possible to}} design unpowered assistive devices that make effective use of similar mechanisms. Methods A passive assistive technology is presented, based on long elastic cords attached to an exoskeleton and <b>guided</b> by <b>pulleys</b> placed at the joints. A general optimization procedure is described for finding the best geometrical arrangement of such "exotendons" for assisting a specific movement. Optimality is defined either as minimal residual joint moment or as minimal residual joint power. Four specific exotendon systems with increasing complexity are considered. Representative human gait data were used to optimize each of these four systems to achieve maximal assistance for normal walking. Results The most complex exotendon system, with twelve pulleys per limb, was able to reduce the joint moments required for normal walking by 71 % and joint power by 74 %. A simpler system, with only three pulleys per limb, could reduce joint moments by 46 % and joint power by 47 %. Conclusion It is concluded that unpowered passive elastic devices can substantially reduce the muscle forces and the metabolic energy needed for walking, without requiring a change in movement. When optimally designed, such devices may allow independent locomotion in patients with large deficits in muscle function. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the concept and}} preliminary investigations related {{to the development of}} simple bioinspired actuation mechanisms for the eyeballs of an android robotic face. Two design solutions for a one-degree-of-freedom mechanism are proposed and analytically studied according to linear models. Both of them are based on new contractile actuators made of electroactive polymers, employed as pseudomuscular devices. The actuators consist of dielectric elastomers and are capable of electrically driven linear contractions. The arrangement and the functionality of the actuators were conceived to mimic those of rectus-type human ocular muscles. Both the presented solutions rely on a couple of agonist-antagonist actuators, in order to enable bidirectional rotations of the eyeball around an axis. The two configurations basically differ in the presence/absence of <b>pulleys,</b> <b>guiding</b> tendon-like wires which connect the actuators to the eyeball. The influence on the system performances of both rest length and elastic modulus of the actuators was studied for both configurations. Geometrical constraints allow the configuration with pulleys to perform more than the other, despite a potential intrinsic superior efficacy of the latter. The paper describes also the assembly of a simple prototype version of the system and presents the results of preliminary tests. These permitted us to assess the feasibility of the proposed concept and suggested possible improvements...|$|R
