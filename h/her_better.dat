5|$|Lightning has {{received}} mixed commentary from critics—much of it relating to her cold personality, which {{was compared to}} that of Final Fantasy VIIs protagonist Cloud Strife. She was criticized for her relative absence in XIII-2. Her role in Lightning Returns had a mixed reception: some critics saw her as underdeveloped and unlikable, while others found <b>her</b> <b>better</b> developed and more human than in previous games. Lightning later appeared on lists, compiled by video game publications, of the best characters in the Final Fantasy series and in video games as a whole. She has been received favorably in polls of public opinion by Famitsu, Square Enix, and other organizations.|$|E
5|$|The Dawn of Love {{intentionally}} {{presents a}} moral dilemma to viewers. By his open depiction of nudity and sensuality, Etty makes {{the same argument}} as that presented by Comus, that it is rational for the viewer to succumb to their lustful thoughts while in private. The picture presents the same moral challenge to the viewer as that which Comus presents to The Lady, that of remaining true to <b>her</b> <b>better,</b> moral and rational, nature, despite there being no apparent disadvantage in surrendering to desire.|$|E
5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive {{about the details}} of her life as a commercial writer, it is not known when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of <b>her</b> <b>better</b> work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E

However, not long afterwards Aij Tjeng's father Oh Pin Loh comes to tell Aij Tjeng {{that he has been}} betrothed to Gwat Nio, the daughter of the plantation's owner Liok Keng Djim. Marsiti is sent away by the elder Oh and, after Aij Tjeng orders his manservant Tirta to find her, Tirta disappears as well. After the marriage, Aij Tjeng finds in Gwat Nio all of the same traits which made him fall in love with Marsiti, but even more polished owing to <b>her</b> <b>better</b> education. He falls in love with her and begins to forget Marsiti, and the couple have a daughter, Lily.|$|E

25|$|The {{problem now}} is that Tracy was going to {{impersonate}} Joanna, but Edna Stricken – the woman who Rosie hurried away earlier – now believes that Rosie is Joanna, spoiling Tracy's big chance (an analogy to Rosie losing her big chance as Jane Eyre). The only chance of success now is if Rosie continues impersonating Joanna. Sam persuades Rosie, against <b>her</b> <b>better</b> judgement, to do so.|$|E
6000|$|However, she said, [...] "Your servant, sir," [...] and curtsied {{with an air}} {{of perfect}} {{deference}} as she advanced towards him: she was not the woman to misbehave towards <b>her</b> <b>betters,</b> and fly {{in the face of the}} catechism, without severe provocation.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Nat Hicks, a wry-faced, curiously sweet woman, so awed by <b>her</b> <b>betters</b> that Carol {{wanted to}} kiss her, {{completed}} the day's grim task by {{a paper on}} [...] "Other Poets."

6000|$|Miss Ophelia still persevered in her labors in the {{housekeeping}} line.

25|$|After an {{incident}} when Janet {{was found in}} a bathtub, presumably drunk, Janet becomes embarrassed and both Moon and Kate notice the change in her mood. As her friend, Kate hopes that this situation does not harm Janet's credibility at the university, although she finds that many of the professors no longer care for Janet. Although Kate defends Janet, it is no use. Many people ridicule Janet and seem to have no desire to get to know <b>her</b> <b>better.</b>|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} {{disaster}} in the fourth task, this task further influenced the decision in later series to give Sir Alan the chance to fire more than one candidate outside of the interview stage. Whilst Sir Alan deemed Michelle most at fault, {{he added that he}} was tired of Samuel's excuses and held him liable for the marketing aspect of the task. Ultimately, Michelle was saved by <b>her</b> <b>better</b> track record and her more convincing argument.|$|E
25|$|The brand-new Shalom begun {{her career}} {{with a series}} of short cruises out of Haifa, before embarking on her fully booked first {{crossing}} to New York on 17 April 1964. However, by the time she entered service the transatlantic liner trade was already in decline, with more passenger crossing the Atlantic by air than by sea since 1959. To make <b>her</b> <b>better</b> suited for cruise service, Shalom was rebuilt in the Netherlands in October 1964, increasing the number of first-class cabins.|$|E
50|$|In the Montreal Olympics, she {{qualified}} for the semi-finals {{but was unable to}} make the final with a sub-par performance, as 6 of the qualifiers ahead of <b>her</b> <b>bettered</b> the standing Olympic record.

25|$|One of <b>her</b> <b>better</b> known works, Ordo Virtutum (Play of the Virtues), is a {{morality}} play. It {{is uncertain}} {{when some of}} Hildegard's compositions were composed, though the Ordo Virtutum {{is thought to have}} been composed as early as 1151. The morality play consists of monophonic melodies for the Anima (human soul) and 16 Virtues. There is also one speaking part for the Devil. Scholars assert that the role of the Devil would have been played by Volmar, while Hildegard's nuns would have played the parts of Anima and the Virtues.|$|E
25|$|According to Armenian lore, {{there are}} women who, in {{consequence}} of deadly sins, are condemned to spend seven years in wolf form. In a typical account, a condemned woman is visited by a wolfskin-toting spirit, who orders her to wear the skin, which causes her to acquire frightful cravings for human flesh soon after. With <b>her</b> <b>better</b> nature overcome, the she-wolf devours each of her own children, then her relatives' children in order of relationship, and finally the children of strangers. She wanders only at night, with doors and locks springing open at her approach. When morning arrives, she reverts to human form and removes her wolfskin. The transformation is generally said to be involuntary, but there are alternate versions involving voluntary metamorphosis, where the women can transform at will.|$|E
25|$|On 4 October 1948, while Bhumibol {{was driving}} a Fiat Topolino on the Geneva-Lausanne road, he {{collided}} with the rear of a braking truck 10km outside Lausanne. He injured his back, suffered paralysis in half {{of his face and}} incurred cuts on his face that cost him the sight of his right eye. Both the royal cremation and coronation had to be postponed once more. While he was hospitalised in Lausanne, Sirikit visited him frequently. She met his mother, who asked her to continue her studies nearby so that Bhumibol could get to know <b>her</b> <b>better.</b> Bhumibol selected for her a boarding school in Lausanne, Riante Rive. A quiet engagement in Lausanne followed on 19 July 1949, and they were married on 28 April 1950, just a week before his coronation. Their wedding was described by The New York Times as “the shortest, simplest royal wedding ever held in the land of gilded elephants and white umbrellas”. The ceremony was performed by Bhumibol's ageing grandmother, Savang Vadhana.|$|E

After they make camp for the night, the manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tries to guide Emma into betraying Merida once they reach {{the home of the}} wisps. The manifestation of Rumplestiltskin tells Emma that once Merida speaks into the Wisp, it will continue to do her bidding until she dies, and thus, the only solution would then be for Emma to kill her. Merida overhears the conversation, and sneaks off to the Hill of Stones by herself. Emma catches up with her in the morning and is goaded by Rumplestiltskin's manifestation, against <b>her</b> <b>better</b> judgment and good nature, to rip Merida's heart out. Before Emma can crush the heart, Hook appears with the others and stops her. Once everything has settled down, Mary Margaret hands Emma the dagger; however, Emma, believing that carrying the dagger would give her too much power, wants someone else to possess it. She decides to give the dagger to Regina, since she would be the only one capable of killing Emma if necessary. Moments later, King Arthur and some of his knights arrive on horseback in order to proclaim that they have been awaiting Emma's arrival. Arthur believes that Emma will be able to reunite them with Merlin, and everyone involved joins forces on their quest en route to Camelot.|$|E
