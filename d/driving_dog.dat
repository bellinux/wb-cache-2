50|$|The term cur {{refers to}} the lowest class of nameless dog or Pariah Dog, {{generally}} a mixed-breed dog. Originally the word cur referred to a certain English purpose-bred, short-tailed cattle <b>driving</b> <b>dog</b> known only from historical records, the cur dog, but in modern usage it applies to any mixed-breed.|$|E
50|$|Born in 1903 in a {{small village}} called St. Lunaire in Newfoundland, Bursey was 5’7” tall, a husky vibrant man who seemed bigger than life. He grew up fishing on the Grand Banks from his father’s schooner, <b>driving</b> <b>dog</b> teams across the frozen land and bay, {{skinning}} seals for food and clothing. The seafaring family from which he came worked hard six days a week, gardening in the rocky soil and fishing {{in the summer and}} mending nets, dogsledding, and catching seals in the winter. Bursey’s family was a little better off than many of his cousins, aunts, and uncles because of their schooner and their family-owned store where the fisher folk traded. They also bought and sold all the fish in the village. With two brothers and three sisters, everyone had to work to survive. Men did not dare to fear, for then they would fear life itself.|$|E

60|$|An anxious hour went by, and in {{that time}} Dick did all he could for Tom, who still laid in a stupor. Then came a shout, and Gus Schmidt appeared, <b>driving</b> his <b>dog</b> team and with the runaway team also in harness. Behind the first sled was the second--the one Tom had taken.|$|R
25|$|People wore {{waterproof}} salmon-skin mittens to {{keep their}} hands dry while kayaking, <b>driving</b> a <b>dog</b> sled, or working with fish nets. Woven seashore grass liners went inside for warmth. To prepare the fish skins, they were first soaked in urine, scraped clean, and then hung outside to freeze-dry in cold weather. The last step was to scrape off the scales.|$|R
60|$|The elderly, clean-shaven man he {{had seen}} {{last night in the}} kitchen had come into the yard with a <b>dog,</b> <b>driving</b> the cows to their milking. Ashurst saw that he was lame.|$|R
60|$|Then Denton, with a shout, was <b>driving</b> the <b>dogs</b> before him. The sword flashed {{above his}} head with a sudden new freedom of gesture, and then he {{vanished}} down the staircase. She made six steps to follow him, and on the landing there was blood. She stopped, and hearing the tumult of dogs and Denton's shouts pass out of the house, ran to the window.|$|R
5000|$|Other breeds, {{notably the}} Border Collie, {{get in front}} of the animals and use what is called strong eye to stare down the animals; they are known as headers. The headers or {{fetching}} dogs keep livestock in a group. They consistently go to the front or head of the animals to turn or stop the animal's movement. The heelers or <b>driving</b> <b>dogs</b> keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. The Australian Kelpie and Australian Koolie use both these methods and also run along the backs of sheep so are said to head, heel, and back. Other types such as the Australian Shepherd, English Shepherd and Welsh Sheepdog are moderate to loose eyed, working more independently. The New Zealand Huntaway uses its loud, deep bark to muster mobs of sheep. Belgian Shepherds, German Shepherd Dogs and Briards are historically tending dogs, who act as a [...] "living fence," [...] guiding large flocks of sheep to graze while preventing them from eating valuable crops and wandering onto roads.|$|R
60|$|The {{two boys}} {{occupied}} the rear sled {{with one of}} the bundles, while Gus Schmidt did the driving from the other sled and carried the rest of the traps. On and on they went, mile after mile, the German <b>driving</b> the <b>dogs</b> with great skill. They passed over hill after hill, and over vast expanses of ice and snow. At noon they rested half an hour for lunch. Tom tried to stand up, but was too weak.|$|R
50|$|Frissell {{came from}} a well-to-do family (his {{grandfather}} was {{founder and president of}} the Fifth Avenue Bank of New York), studied at Yale, and took a keen interest in film at an early age. He was mentored by renowned documentarian Robert Flaherty. In 1921, Frissell heard a lecture by Dr Wilfred Grenfell, which inspired him to visit the Labrador mission and to explore the northern wilderness. In 1922, Frissell volunteered to work for the International Grenfell Association, <b>driving</b> a <b>dog</b> team in the winter and working on the hospital boat Strathcona in the summer.|$|R
60|$|The start {{was made}} {{early the next}} day, Andy and Chet taking turns at <b>driving</b> the six <b>dogs,</b> the pick of what were left of the pack. The course was along the lead westward, and after a mile had been covered, they reached a spot where some new ice covered the water.|$|R
500|$|Heading {{south-east}} {{towards the}} Mertz Glacier, with Mertz skiing ahead and Mawson and Ninnis <b>driving</b> the <b>dogs,</b> the party covered [...] on 18 November. This was despite encountering sastrugi—ridges {{in the ice}} caused by wind—as high as , that caused the dogs to slip and the sledges to roll. During the day they passed two peaks, which Mawson named Madigan Nunatak and Aurora Peak, after {{the leader of the}} Eastern Coastal Party and the expedition's ship. The following day they began the steep descent to the Mertz Glacier. After the sledges several times overtook the dogs, the huskies were allowed to run free down the slope.|$|R
5000|$|After that, {{for more}} than 20 years, their expeditions were to the Arctic. Henson traded with the Inuit and {{mastered}} their language; they called him Mahri-Pahluk. He was remembered as the only non-Inuit who became skilled in <b>driving</b> the <b>dog</b> sleds and training dog teams in the Inuit way. He was a skilled craftsman, often coming up with solutions for what the team needed in the harsh Arctic conditions; they learned to build igloos out of snow, for mobile housing as they traveled. He and Peary with their teams covered thousands of miles in dog sleds and reached the [...] "Farthest North" [...] point of any Arctic expedition until 1909 [...]|$|R
5000|$|Whip use by sound never or rarely {{strikes the}} animal; instead, a long, {{flexible}} whip is cracked, {{to produce a}} very sharp, loud sound. This usage also functions {{as a form of}} operant conditioning: most animals will flinch away from the sound instinctively, making it effective for <b>driving</b> sled <b>dogs,</b> livestock and teams of harnessed animals like oxen and mules. The sound is loud enough to affect multiple animals at once, making whip-cracking more efficient under some circumstances. This technique can be used as part of an escalation response, with sound being used first prior to a pain stimulus being applied, again as part of operant conditioning.|$|R
60|$|The dog tore and {{strained}} at his chain with starting eyes and furious bark, but there the dwarf lay, snapping his fingers with gestures of defiance and contempt. When he had sufficiently recovered from his delight, he rose, {{and with his}} arms a-kimbo, achieved a kind of demon-dance round the kennel, just without {{the limits of the}} chain, <b>driving</b> the <b>dog</b> quite wild. Having by this means composed his spirits and put himself in a pleasant train, he returned to his unsuspicious companion, whom he found looking at the tide with exceeding gravity, and thinking of that same gold and silver which Mr Quilp had mentioned.|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} carting is sulky <b>driving,</b> where a <b>dog</b> or dogs pulls a two-wheeled cart (sulky) {{with a person}} riding in the sulky. This sport offers both {{exercise}} and discipline opportunities for energetic breeds. Many working breeds are happier when given a job or task, and carting / sulky driving can be a rewarding hobby for both dog and owner.|$|R
40|$|Ventilation {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{presented}} problems during the <b>driving</b> of <b>dog</b> headings. During <b>driving</b> such heading has only one connection with air stream routes, which significantly make difficult the process of its ventilation. In a case of its driving in coal in the methane seam, this heading is endangered also to methane emission. In such case process of its ventilation is much more difficult. In the paper there are presented results of numerical analysis of ventila-tion of blind dog headings using air-duct forcing the air into its mine face. The analysis was performed for four different velocities of the air at the outlet from air-duct. The calculations were made for the excavation of heading with heading machine and conveyor belt...|$|R
50|$|There {{are five}} dairy farms, {{together}} with the local school and community center in Langfjordbotn. In addition to farming, there are some family-run tourism businesses {{as well as the}} Finnmarkskollektivet which deals with adolescents with substance abuse problems. The fjord is a versatile area for outdoor activities with the nearby fjords, plains, mountains, forests, and marshes. In winter, there are excellent conditions for skiing, summit hikes, snowmobile <b>driving</b> and sled <b>dog</b> racing.|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a discrete set of individual agents interacting with a continuum. Examples {{might be a}} predator facing a huge group of preys, or a few shepherd <b>dogs</b> <b>driving</b> a herd of sheeps. Analytically, these situations can be described through a system of ordinary differential equations coupled with a scalar conservation law in several space dimensions. This paper provides a complete well posedness theory for the resulting Cauchy problem. A few applications are considered in detail and numerical integrations are provided...|$|R
50|$|In 1955, when Herbert was 21, {{he carried}} out {{surveying}} in the Antarctic with the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey, {{during which he}} became an expert in dog sleighing. On a journey along the Antarctic Peninsula from Hope Bay to Portal Point, he sledged some 5,000 km. This experience with dogs {{led him to a}} job with the New Zealand Antarctic programme, which commissioned him to purchase dogs in Greenland for the Antarctic.

50|$|Young Thomas helped {{around his}} uncle's farm, tending sheep with a sheep <b>dog,</b> <b>driving</b> teams of oxen, {{and helping to}} harvest wheat and corn. His uncle also held a few slaves. Formal {{education}} was not easily obtained, but Thomas attended school when and where he could. After learning to read, he became largely self-taught.

40|$|African wild dog Lycaon pictus {{populations are}} declining due to {{persecution}} {{as well as}} habitat destruction and fragmentation. Understanding the natural mechanisms driving population dynamics is important for conservation management as it clarifies natural from human-induced factors. Therefore, this understanding is essential to compensate for disadvantaging ecological factors and successfully apply conservation actions. Juvenile survival is important in <b>driving</b> wild <b>dog</b> population dynamics, and therefore this study investigated the influence of rainfall and pack size on the survival of juveniles up {{to the age of}} 12 months. We found that past rainfall significantly influenced pup survival up to 9 months of age, such that pups benefited from preceding dry periods. The positive effects of pack size on juvenile survival only became evident for pups older than 9 months and, despite this delayed Allee effect, we found no evidence of reproductive failure in small packs as compared with larger ones...|$|R
60|$|Different {{from the}} Mackenzie {{toboggans}} were the Klondike sleds with runners under them. And different was {{the method of}} <b>driving</b> the <b>dogs.</b> There was no fan-formation of the team. The dogs worked in single file, one behind another, hauling on double traces. And here, in the Klondike, the leader was indeed the leader. The wisest as well as strongest dog was the leader, and the team obeyed him and feared him. That White Fang should quickly gain this post was inevitable. He could not be satisfied with less, as Matt learned after much inconvenience and trouble. White Fang picked out the post for himself, and Matt backed his judgment with strong language after the experiment had been tried. But, though {{he worked in the}} sled in the day, White Fang did not forego the guarding of his master's property in the night. Thus he was on duty all the time, ever vigilant and faithful, the most valuable of all the dogs.|$|R
60|$|Long and {{cross-country}} is {{the drive}} from Royston Railway Station to Worsted Skeynes. To George Pendyce, <b>driving</b> the <b>dog</b> cart, with Helen Bellew beside him, it seemed but a minute--that strange minute when the heaven is {{opened and a}} vision shows between. To some men that vision comes but once, to some men many times. It comes after long winter, when the blossom hangs; it comes after parched summer, when the leaves are going gold; and of what hues it is painted--of frost-white and fire, of wine and purple, of mountain flowers, or the shadowy green of still deep pools--the seer alone can tell. But this is certain--the vision steals from him who looks on it all images of other things, all sense of law, of order, of the living past, and the living present. It is the future, fair-scented, singing, jewelled, as when suddenly between high banks a bough of apple-blossom hangs quivering in the wind loud with the song of bees.|$|R
50|$|Driving {{with a dog}} can be very dangerous. According to a {{national}} study by AAA (American Automobile Association), 31 {{percent of the people}} that responded admitted to being distracted by their dogs. Fifty-nine percent of people that were surveyed had participated in at least one distracting behavior while <b>driving</b> with their <b>dog.</b> Eighty percent of respondents said they'd driven with their pets, and only 17 percent said they used any form of pet restraint. The AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety found that looking away from the road for only two seconds doubles a driver's risk of being in a crash.|$|R
50|$|The WOW (which {{was built}} {{as just a}} design concept) was {{designed}} to fit the needs of both man and man's best friend.

On the illogical principle, probably, that being [...] "in for a penny" [...] justified being [...] "in for a pound," [...] the pony laid himself out for a glorious run. He warmed to his work, caused the dust to fly, and the clothes-basket to advance with irregular bounds and swayings as he scampered along, <b>driving</b> many little <b>dogs</b> wild with delight, {{and two or three}} cats mad with fear.
