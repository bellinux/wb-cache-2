5|$|The Lee <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> {{used for}} formal banquets. It is lit by an 1825 Irish crystal chandelier. One hundred place {{settings}} of fine china and 150 place settings of sterling silver flatware were acquired from Tiffany & Co. in 1988 {{for use in}} the dining room.|$|E
5|$|The porch {{leads into}} the great hall which has a Minton tile floor and a large stone chimney piece. In the east wing is the long gallery which has oak panelling, a chimney-piece and a {{panelled}} ceiling. Behind the long gallery is an irregularly-shaped billiard room and the drawing room. To the south {{of these is the}} library. Behind the great hall is the main staircase. The circular tower at the north-west corner contains the octagonal dining room with a Minton tile floor, two fireplaces, and a vault of eight radial ribs running to a central boss. The room contains an oak sideboard with a carved Green Man. Below the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> a wine cellar. On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the {{entrance}} lies the dining room, which was formerly the Jacobean great hall. The room least damaged by the fire, it was restored by Barry to its 17th century appearance, with facsimiles of the original ceiling and carved wooden screen. It contains an overmantel featuring a relief of Plenty, considered to be original, and a large stone chimneypiece, which {{is believed to be the}} only surviving work by Blore on the interior. The oak parlour, in the south west, contains a large wooden Jacobean overmantel, featuring Green Men carving. The Jacobean carving here and in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> noticeably cruder than the Victorian work. The carved parlour is another reproduction by Barry of the original. Panelled in oak, it has a plaster frieze of the Elements, Graces and Virtues. The alabaster chimneypiece depicts the winged figure of Time rewarding Industry and punishing Sloth, symbolised by two boys, which is surmounted by a carved portrait of Sir Randolph Crewe.|$|E
25|$|The second-class lounges were {{expanded}} {{to the sides}} of the ship and used for banqueting. On R deck, the first-class <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> reconfigured and subdivided into two banquet venues, the Royal Salon and the Windsor <b>Room.</b> The second-class <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> subdivided into kitchen storage and a crew mess hall, while the third-class <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> initially used as storage and crew space.|$|R
50|$|While the Napoleon (main) <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1920, the {{adjoining}} <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>were</b> constructed in 1831 and originally used as stables and slave quarters for the Hermann-Grima House, which now {{operates as a}} museum.|$|R
50|$|In 1969, a <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> {{added to}} the clubhouse by Massey & Flanders. The senior lounge, for club members over 21 years of age, was {{converted}} into the Commodore's boardroom. In 1970, the clubhouse stairs and <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>were</b> remodelled. In 1971, a sloping ramp was replaced with a terrace.|$|R
25|$|To {{the left}} of the Entrance Hall, {{mirroring}} the Living Room is the Dining Room. The room features rounded curio cabinets in the north end corners of the room, and black marble flooring {{in the center of the}} room, with carpet around the perimeter. Connected to the <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> the Kitchen that was not open to the public until 1995, as Elvis' aunt Delta used it until her death in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{entrance}} into the original area of the residence is {{through a set of}} double doors beneath a neo-classical porch bearing the words GOUVERNEUR GÉNÉRAL on the frieze and the crest of the Royal Arms of Canada in the tympanum. Within is a foyer with marble tile floor and a stair descending to the basement and, through another set of doors in a screen with translucent leaded glass sidelights and fanlight, is a hall; both rooms are in the Georgian style, in beige, cream, and gold. The Small <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> similarly Georgian in decor, with robin's egg blue walls and white-painted trim. From the ceiling hang two crystal chandeliers.|$|E
25|$|The Dining Room (marked 8 {{on first}} floor plan) {{is one of}} the rooms most {{frequently}} changed since the completion of the mansion. Yet today it closely resembles its original form. Sited {{on the first floor of}} the corps de logis, some distance from the original kitchen (on the ground floor of the North Pavilion), the <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> decorated in a neoclassical style inspired by the work of Robert Adam. The ceiling is divided into geometric panels by ornate plasterwork. Each panel originally contained a painted lunette or medallion by Theodore de Bruyn, depicting a classical scene in grisaille. The walls too have plaster panels which contained medallions, matching those of the ceiling.|$|E
50|$|The ship's {{degree of}} modernity was {{unlike that of}} any ship previously. The {{first-class}} <b>dining</b> <b>room's</b> decor <b>was</b> simple. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> also the largest of any ship, rose three decks high, and had a grand staircase for an entrance.|$|R
50|$|A {{separate}} <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> {{and cooling}} shed were reputedly {{built on the}} site during the 1870s. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> later used as a kitchen and at some stage {{was linked to the}} homestead by a covered walkway. Adjacent to the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> a cooling shed built at much the same time from Cyprus pine and with a wooden shingle roof which has since been replaced by corrugated iron.|$|R

25|$|The {{front of}} the house faces {{northwest}}. The first floor of the house is divided in two by a central passage, leading from a door in the northwest to a door in the southeast, with a staircase running up on the northeast side. On the northeast side of the central passage is the primary chamber (or bedroom) in the front, and the little parlor in the back. Between the primary chamber and the little parlor is a smaller passage, leading to a service staircase and a small, side stairway. The Gunston Hall Plantation official website says that on the southwest side of the house is a parlor in the front and a dining room in the back. However, the Historic American Buildings Survey says that on the southwest side of the house the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> in the front and a palladian room is in the back.|$|E
25|$|The kitchen area {{reflects}} {{the original design}} concept; it includes separate stations for baking and pastries and was never reduced when the original project was downsized. High quality kitchen appliances were installed so the hotel could compete with fine dining establishments, and the facility was specifically constructed to handle special events and functions. The wood beames {{in the dining room}} are actually hollow, with steel beams going through them for fire safety reasons. Every detail was carefully thought out. The alcove window {{at the end of the}} room perfectly framed Yosemite Falls when the hotel was completed. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> 130 feet long and 51 feet wide, with a 34-foot ceiling supported with rock columns creating a cathedral like atmosphere. While the dress code for the park is usually very casual, the Ahwahnee Dining Room used to require a jacket for men, but it later relaxed that tradition. Now collared shirts for men are allowed and women may wear either a dress or slacks and a blouse.|$|E
500|$|Above the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> {{the drawing}} room and, above that, Lady Churchill's bedroom, {{described}} by Churchill as [...] "a magnificent aerial bower".|$|E

500|$|Inside {{the main}} house, a {{stairway}} leads {{up from the}} front entry, with a parlor occupying the space to the left. [...] The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> behind the parlor, with the kitchen occupying the first addition. [...] The parlor and dining room have matching fireplaces with black marble mantels. [...] The upstairs of the main house has three bedrooms, one of which has a builtin desk and bookcases, {{and may have been}} used as a study.|$|E
500|$|Some of the servers at the Sci-Fi Dine-In wear roller skates, {{acting as}} carhops, while others improvise {{characters}} {{such as a}} police officer ostensibly in search of people who have sneaked into the theater without paying. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> dark and air-conditioned, and measures [...] The ceiling simulates a night sky replete with twinkling stars made from optical fibers. There is the facade of a snack counter {{at the back of the}} room, behind which is the kitchen. The upper walls of the dining room display a cyclorama of Southern California as seen over a fence.|$|E
500|$|Flay's first {{restaurant}} venture outside New York, Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill {{was opened}} at Caesars in 2004 and features bold, southwestern cuisine. Serving lunch and dinner, the menu includes shrimp and roasted corn or sweet potato and pecan tamales, spice-rubbed pork tenderloin with ancho chili sauce {{and a variety}} of steak, seafood and duck dishes. It has room for 200 covers in the main dining room, with an additional 50 seats in a private dining room. The entire space, including the kitchen area comprises [...] The interior of the main <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> designed by David Rockwell and features a rotisserie reaching a height of [...] above the diners.|$|E
50|$|The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the focal}} points of the hotel’s design. The hall was {{expanded}} several times until {{it was able to}} seat 1000 people, the tables placed across the room at intervals of five feet and a 10-foot passageway {{down the middle of the}} <b>room.</b> The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>was</b> expanded after the Civil War years to serve up to 1,400 people at a time.|$|R

500|$|By 1904 the War Office had {{concluded}} that Walmer had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castle to the Office of Works, who accepted it {{on the condition that}} they were paid £2,400 in order to carry out repairs. The Office's survey noted that [...] "the lower floor ... is very inconvenient, dark and not conducive to health while the women servants have to sleep in a sort of dormitory in the slopes of the roof... The principal floor is, generally speaking, badly arranged and badly lighted and the <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> very small"; the report suggested that {{it would be best to}} demolish the building and rebuild it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the west}} wing are the {{surviving}} rooms from Charles Legh's extension, the dining room {{on the ground floor}} and the drawing room above it. [...] Both rooms are panelled and decorated in Classical style, with pediments over the doors and chimneypieces. [...] The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> the simpler of the two, and contains a white marble fireplace that has been dated to 1742. [...] The fireplace in the drawing room is also in white marble but is more elaborate, carved with scrolls, garlands, and a profile of Minerva. [...] This room also contains giant Corinthian pilasters. [...] Above its doors are wood-carvings in the style of William Kent, depicting the heads of Bacchus, Ceres, Flora, and Neptune. [...] The rooms in the south wing include family sitting rooms decorated with Rococo style ceilings, and Gothic and Chinoiserie motifs. [...] Also in the rooms of this wing are items moved from the demolished parts of {{the west wing}}. [...] The east wing contains service rooms.|$|E
500|$|The State <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> {{very much}} as Blore {{designed}} it, and has a panelled ceiling with pendants, and wooden panelling up {{to the line of}} the dado. [...] The room contains a large fireplace in early Renaissance style, made from white and variegated marble, and containing the family arms. [...] Also in the room are sculptures by Joseph Wilton. [...] The Staircase Hall is by Salvin, and is divided from the Sculpture Gallery by three semicircular archways. [...] On the walls are portraits of the Bromley family. [...] The staircase has a wrought iron balustrade decorated with acanthus and roundels with the crests of the Bromleys and the Davenports. [...] The Davenport crest consists of a felon with a rope around his neck; in these roundels the felon has the face of William Gladstone, a political opponent of the Davenports. [...] There are four further ground floor rooms, all by Salvin.|$|E

500|$|... "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do" [...] is {{the first}} Family Guy episode to be written by Tom Devanney. When Stewie {{attempts}} to asphyxiate himself in the supermarket, he was originally meant to state [...] "Either I was a C-section or you're Stretch Vagstrong", {{which would have been}} a reference to the Stretch Armstrong action figure, but broadcasting standards prohibited them from showing it. During the [...] "Take On Me" [...] sequence, Family Guy had obtained full rights to use the [...] "Take On Me" [...] music video completely, but animators re-produced the video {{to make it easier for}} production. Originally, a joke had been drafted showing Brian standing next to a tabloid newspaper with a picture of Kirstie Alley and commenting on her weight, only for her to enter the grocery shop in Godzilla-like size and throw items from the shelves, but the sketch was removed to save time during the episode. The Matisse painting shown in the Griffins' <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> only animated similar to an actual Matisse painting due to a legal issue with the paintings. The episode production staff spent a lot of time deciding what would be Lois' motivation for stealing en masse.|$|E
500|$|The Great <b>Dining</b> <b>Room</b> <b>is</b> {{situated}} in the east wing extension {{of the house and}} was added in 1877 under J. MacVicar Anderson {{during the time of the}} Red Earl. The room was inspired by the ballroom of Buckingham Palace, with walls hung with faded, red damask silk. The Spencers ate their regular meals in the Tapestry Dining Room, an inner room of the east side to the east of the Wooton Hall. Aside from the two fine vividly constructed tapestries, one of gypsies and one of farming, the room is fairly bleak in design compared to other rooms in the house; the dining table is relatively small, with a drab grey floor and open brick fireplace dated in large letters to 1683. The [...] "sombre" [...] oak panelling originally came from the family's other property of Wormleighton Manor in Warwickshire. [...] Charles Spencer recalled that three generations of Spencers would eat their lunch together and that dining conditions were [...] "silent, apart from the noises of my grandfather eating with great gusto, a napkin tucked in around his neck, hanging down over his popping-out tummy, and it was all very sad and tense".|$|E
500|$|Dimlands (or Dimland Castle or Dimland Lodge) (...) is {{situated}} about a kilometre {{back from the}} clifftops of the Bristol Channel {{along the road to}} St. Donats. It was owned at one time by John Whitlock Nicholl Carne of the University of Oxford who moved there after his father's death. Dimlands was built by John Carne's father, Rev. Robert Carne, {{at the end of the}} 18th century, upon land left him by his father, Whitlock Nicholl of The Ham, sheriff for the county of Glamorgan in 1746. The property was held by the Nicholl family since the time of King Henry VII. The dwelling is of castellated Tudor architecture with blue [...] limestone exterior, and Coombedown stone windows and cornices. The south-facing front is more than [...] in length. The western coast of Cornwall and Lundy Island are visible from the turrets. The carved chimney in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> <b>is</b> made of Caen stone, and the chimney-piece in the drawing room is also. Other features are the Minton tile flooring, the large Tudor-style staircase, two sitting rooms, and the library, a newer addition. The Dimlands stables feature sharp-pointed gables, as well as a carved stone with the date of the original grant (1336).|$|E
