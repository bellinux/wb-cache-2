For various metallic corrosion resistant materials from several different suppliers, extensive laboratory investigations have been carried out, testing them in a ?grinding pot,? thereby studying the corrosion and abrasion behavior at different flow velocities. Coated materials and welding materials were also tested; various parts were examined for crevice corrosion. It can be concluded that only certain duplex materials show a sufficient corrosion resistance, depending on the pH-value and chloride content of the flue gas desulphurization suspension, and on certain alloying elements and the heat treatment the materials received. A presentation of the design executions for an optimum design of pumps in flue gas desulphurization plants is offered. The principal elements of a centrifugal pump, such as <b>impeller,</b> <b>casing,</b> and shaft sealing with a packed stuffing box and mechanical seal are addressed...|$|E
40|$|Slurry {{pumps are}} used for the {{transportation}} of solids in coal, copper, iron ore, phosphate and in other mining operations. They are also used on dredges cleaning waterways, in environmental cleanup and in reclaiming land throughout the world. Slurries {{by their very nature}} are very abrasive requiring the <b>impeller,</b> <b>casing</b> and suction liner wet end component parts be replaced at regular intervals. It is not uncommon, for example, for six liners, three impellers and two casings to be consumed in one year. It is estimated that about $ 500 million in slurry pump wear parts are consumed every year. Numerical models now exist to predict component wear for a given set of operating conditions with a given design. The use of these models is however available to a select few and no general relations exist for the user. The writers in this paper model a selection of pump designs producing general relationships for the different pump casing, impeller and liner components for different duties.

40|$|As {{part of the}} MIT {{research}} program on micro-engines (of size [approximately] 1 cm), this thesis defines concepts and designs to improve micro-turbomachinery and overall system performance. Three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes computations (FLUENT) {{have been carried out}} to quantify the performance limiting processes in micro-impellers. These processes include (i) heat transfer to the compressor flow responsible for up to 25 points efficiency penalty, (ii) <b>impeller</b> <b>casing</b> drag (17 points penalty) and (iii) passage boundary layer loss (10 points penalty). The magnitude of the first effect {{is a result of the}} engine small length scale selection and is characterized by the total heat to impeller flow as fraction of inlet flow enthalpy. The magnitudes of the last two effects can be attributed to low Reynolds number. Scaling laws for elucidating the parametric controlling trend in these effects have been formulated. A mean-line analysis and design tool based on the above micro-impeller characterization is developed to formulate design guidelines. The guidelines show that the optimal micro-impeller geometry changes with impeller wall temperature, an effect, not present for large turbomachinery. In particular, impeller inlet angle, back-sweep angle, solidity and radial size for peak efficiency decrease with increasing impeller wall temperature. This behavior is a result of the competing effects of geometry on (i) aerodynamic loss and (ii) on heat transfer to impeller flow. In accord with these findings, CFD calculations show that configuring a micro-impeller excluding the heat addition as a design variable can incur a penalty of more than 10 efficiency points. An aero-thermal system model is developed to enable micro-engine system analysis and(cont.) selection of system design parameters. It is shown that, in contrast to large engine design, an optimal turbine inlet temperature, associated with peak system efficiency, exists for the micro-engine thermodynamic cycle. This condition is related to the competition between the benefit in cycle performance associated with increasing turbine inlet temperature, and the degradation in compressor performance associated with increasing heat transfer. Furthermore, system efficiency approximately doubles as turbomachinery size is scaled up two times. This is related to the different scaling of heat transfer, parasitic power loss, and Reynolds number in micro-engines. Minimum requirements on advanced technology levels are established for a self-sustaining micro-engine. Two designs, based on different advanced technologies, producing 10 - 20 Watts of net shaft power with chemical-to-shaft mechanical conversion efficiency of 1. 5 - 2. 0 % are proposed for micro-engine development. by Borislav T.

The intake system needs to be evaluated as well to ensure {{it is capable of}} handling the upgraded pumps without introducing problems such as increased vortex activities. Even slight increase in pump capacity can create or increase vortex activity. Free surface and subsurface vortices can be extremely damaging to a pump and can cause major problems such as cavitation to the pump?s <b>impeller</b> and <b>casing,</b> vibration, and decreased performance. The challenge here is to modify the existing cooling water intake system without major reconstruction that would be both costly and schedule intense. This paper presents a case study of an existing South Texas petrochemical plant where a turnaround upgrade required an increase in cooling water flow through the existing sump basin and the associated engineering work for a physical hydraulic model study. The main purpose of the physical hydraulic model study was to ascertain simple and low cost modifications to the pump intake bays that allow the required flow increase through the existing pump intake system without flow disruptions from the higher flow volume. The hydraulic model replicated the fundamental flow parameters in the sump?s pump intake bays and led to an inexpensive, timely, and easy to implement solution that did not require major construction changes to the intake system. With physical modeling, the intricate interaction between cooling water and air can be analyzed and tested, a task that computational fluid dynamics cannot achieve to the required degree of precision.
