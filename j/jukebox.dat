5|$|Beginning with Sweden Calling DXers on Radio Sweden in 1948 (there was a {{slightly}} earlier short-lived program from Radio Australia), many shortwave radio stations began programs providing news.

5|$|Rather than {{overlaying}} {{songs on}} the soundtrack, or employing a score, The Wire primarily uses pieces of music that emanate from a source within the scene, such as a <b>jukebox</b> or car radio. This kind of music is known as diegetic or source cue. This practice is rarely breached, notably for the end-of-season montages and occasionally with a brief overlap of the closing theme and the final shot.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Jones {{continued}} to work through guest appearances and as session musicians. In 1980, they formed The Professionals, which lasted for two years. Jones went on {{to play with the}} bands Chequered Past and Neurotic Outsiders. He also recorded two solo albums, Mercy and Fire and Gasoline. Now a resident of Los Angeles, he hosts a daily radio program called Jonesy's <b>Jukebox.</b> Having played with the band Chiefs of Relief in the late 1980s and with Edwyn Collins in the 1990s, Cook is now a member of Man Raze. Following The Rich Kids' break-up in 1979, Matlock played with various bands, toured with Iggy Pop, and recorded several solo albums. He is currently a member of Slinky Vagabond.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, it covered the {{entertainment}} industry, such as circuses, fairs, and burlesque shows. It also created a mail service for travelling entertainers. Billboard began focusing more on the music industry as the <b>jukebox,</b> phonograph, and radio became commonplace. Many topics it covered were spun-off into different magazines, including Amusement Business in 1961 to cover outdoor entertainment, so that it could focus on music. After Donaldson died in 1925, Billboard was passed down to his children and Hennegan's children, until it was sold to private investors in 1985, and has since been owned by various parties.|$|E
5|$|The Moonshine Jungle Tour was {{the second}} concert tour by American singer-songwriter Bruno Mars. The tour {{supported}} his second studio album, Unorthodox <b>Jukebox</b> (2012). After an official announcement on February 10, 2013, which coincided with Mars performance at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, a promotional trailer and behind-the-scenes footage of the tour were released through Mars' official YouTube channel and website. Mars and his team selected Ellie Goulding and Fitz & the Tantrums as the opening acts, in the first North American leg, while music video director Cameron Duddy was signed as creative director for the tour in North America. In Europe and Oceania, Mayer Hawthorne and Miguel were selected to commence the show in all the dates, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{tour was}} first {{scheduled}} to begin in February, having been booked a year in advance. Nevertheless, {{not only was the}} album, Unorthodox <b>Jukebox</b> (2012), released later than expected, but many tours were already scheduled {{in the first quarter of}} the year. This led to the tour being delayed until summertime in North America. According to Marx, this chain of events, along with the previous mentioned unusual announcements, were some of the factors that contributed to the success of the Moonshine Jungle Tour. Notwithstanding, Marx has run successful tours with several artists during the first quarter.|$|E

5|$|In August 1972, Bushnell and Alcorn {{installed}} the Pong prototype {{at a local}} bar, Andy Capp's Tavern. They selected the bar because of their good working relation with the bar's manager, Bill Gaddis; Atari supplied pinball machines to Gaddis. Bushnell and Alcorn placed the prototype {{on one of the}} tables near the other entertainment machines: a <b>jukebox,</b> pinball machines, and Computer Space. The game was well received the first night and its popularity continued to grow over the next one and a half weeks. Bushnell then went on a business trip to Chicago to demonstrate Pong to executives at Bally and Midway Manufacturing; he intended to use Pong to fulfill his contract with Bally, rather than the driving game. A few days later, the prototype began exhibiting technical issues and Gaddis contacted Alcorn to fix it. Upon inspecting the machine, Alcorn discovered that the problem was the coin mechanism was overflowing with quarters.|$|E

Not willing to leave his first steady job in a year, he rejects the offer, but Glenda asks him to think about it. Upon returning to town, Glenda calls the Highway Beverage Company, after which she and Tex quit the Tallman campaign {{to return to their}} own roadshow. Later that night, Deke is provoked at a restaurant by the boyfriend of one of his fans, who wants to hear him sing a song. After singing to a tune from the <b>jukebox,</b> he starts a fight with him. He is later exonerated by the police.|$|E
5|$|After {{deciding}} {{to begin work}} on a coin-operated version of Spacewar, the pair, with assistance from Tuck's family, bought a PDP-11 and started working on a prototype. They spent a total of 20,000 to build a single arcade machine for two players, like the original Spacewar, {{deciding to}} price the game at ten cents per play or 25 cents for three games, with the winner of a match given a free game. They used a PDP-11/20 version of the PDP-11 (US$14,000), a Hewlett-Packard 1300A Electrostatic Display (3,000), and spent the remainder on the coin acceptors, joysticks, wiring, and casing. Pitts build the computer hardware and handled the programming, while Tuck, a mechanical engineer, designed the enclosing cabinet. The display adapter for the monitor was built by Ted Panofski, the coin acceptors were sourced from <b>jukebox</b> manufacturer Rowe International, and the joysticks found at a military surplus store as remainders from B-52 bomber controls. The code for the game {{was based on a}} version of Spacewar running on a PDP-10 in the Stanford artificial intelligence lab, but modified with additional features.|$|E

5|$|Cave Story {{has been}} ported to Linux, AROS, MorphOS, AmigaOS 4 and Mac OS X {{operating}} systems, PlayStation Portable, Xbox, Dreamcast, Sega Genesis, GP2X, GP2X Wiz, and the TI graphing calculator. An enhanced port, featuring updated character designs, remixed music and extra game modes, {{was developed by}} Nicalis and released on WiiWare on 22 March 2010 in North America and 10 December 2010 in Europe. Nicalis also ported the game to DSiWare on 29 November 2010 in North America and 22 November 2011 in Japan. Although it does not feature the enhanced graphics and sound {{or some of the}} extra modes from the Wii version, it does include the Sanctuary Attack mode. There is also a free/libre SDL-based recreation of the original game engine, titled NXEngine, made by programmer Caitlin Shaw, which allows for extended modification of the game, and the creation of ports for additional devices. The game was released for the Nintendo 3DS's Nintendo eShop service (separate from the retail 3DS game) in the United States on 4 October 2012 and in Europe on 1 May 2014. This version includes the DSiWare version's <b>Jukebox</b> mode, as well as all the additional modes included in Cave Story+.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the album}} was {{similarly}} successful. It debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart as the Official Charts Company predicted, with 136,391 copies sold in its first week, thus becoming the third fastest-selling album recorded by an artist in 2012, after Mumford & Sons's Babel, and Take Me Home by One Direction.

She wears a {{perforated}} yellow visor, black brassiere, spiked yellow Louboutins and ethnic slim-fit pants. The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a <b>jukebox</b> on. At the bar, Azalea's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table, and a long-haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on {{a chair in the}} centre of building. Azalea, dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts, performs a lap dance for the man. She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends, who drive the man's convertible out into the desert. Azalea is seen standing in the car, waving a thin piece of material in the wind. They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning. Azalea's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk, where the video ends with her walking in the city. She wears dark sunglasses, striped black-and-white shorts and a custom-made dalmatian-print blazer in the final scene.|$|E

50|$|Color-Sonics visual <b>jukeboxes</b> {{were the}} first ones to use {{continuous}} loop cartridges, which were both more durable and more easily replaced than the film reels used by their competition i.e. Cinebox and Scopitone. The Color-Sonics films were shot on 35 mm, as opposed to the 16 mm film used for Scopitone and Cinebox. Before Color-Sonics, Panoram had already pioneered the use of visual <b>jukeboxes</b> in America.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{in about}} 1933, the Wurlitzer name {{gradually}} {{became more and}} more closely associated with <b>jukeboxes</b> than with actual musical instruments. In 1942, organ production at the North Tonawanda factory ceased and production was shifted to the manufacture of bomb proximity fuses for World War II. After the war, normal production efforts resumed but with more focus on radios, <b>jukeboxes,</b> and small electronic organs for private homes.|$|R
