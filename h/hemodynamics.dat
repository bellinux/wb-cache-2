25|$|Overall, {{the heart}} rate is {{decreased}} while blood pressure is increased, resulting in a net increase in stroke volume, leading to increased tissue perfusion. This causes the myocardium to work more efficiently, with optimized <b>hemodynamics</b> and an improved ventricular function curve.|$|E
25|$|Slight {{vasodilation}} is seen {{in heart}} failure. This effect is contrary to effects that {{should be seen as}} a result of increased intracellular calcium levels, but this occurs since digoxin improves <b>hemodynamics,</b> which leads to restored angiotensin levels and decreased sympathetic discharge, causing indirect vasodilation.|$|E
25|$|Legg {{believed}} {{the cause was}} impairment of blood supply to the femoral epiphysis, Calve believed rickets, and Perthes deduced an infection possibly causing degenerative arthritis leads to LCP disease. Currently, {{a number of factors}} have been implicated, including heredity, trauma, endocrine dysfunction, inflammation, nutrition, and altered circulatory <b>hemodynamics.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since the 1890s it {{has been}} known that changes in blood flow and blood {{oxygenation}} in the brain (collectively known as <b>hemodynamics)</b> are closely linked to neural activity. When neurons become active, local blood flow to those brain regions increases, and oxygen-rich (oxygenated) blood displaces oxygen-depleted (deoxygenated) blood around 2 seconds later. This rises to a peak over 4–6 seconds, before falling {{back to the original}} level (and typically undershooting slightly). Oxygen is carried by the hemoglobin molecule in red blood cells. Deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb) is more magnetic (paramagnetic) than oxygenated hemoglobin (Hb), which is virtually resistant to magnetism (diamagnetic). This difference leads to an improved MR signal since the diamagnetic blood interferes with the magnetic MR signal less. This improvement can be mapped to show which neurons are active at a time.|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local <b>hemodynamics,</b> blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E
500|$|Ultrasonography of leg veins is a risk-free, {{non-invasive}} procedure that uses ultrasound technology to give {{information about the}} anatomy, physiology and pathology of both the superficial and the deep venous systems, (SVS) and (DVS). It is indicated mainly {{on the study of}} two [...] pathologies: venous thrombosis and venous insufficiency. As with heart ultrasound (echocardiography) studies, venous ultrasonography requires an understanding of <b>hemodynamics</b> in order to give useful examination reports. In chronic venous insufficiency, sonographic examination is of most benefit; in confirming varicose disease, making an assessment of the <b>hemodynamics,</b> and charting the progression of the disease and its response to treatment. It has become the reference standard for examining the condition and <b>hemodynamics</b> of the lower limb veins.|$|E
500|$|... {{calls for}} {{a high level of}} expertise, so that the {{examiner}} must be well qualified and experienced in order to give effective results. In contrast to arterial ultrasonography the wall of the vein is not relevant and importance is given to the hemodynamic conclusions that the examiner can obtain in order to provide a valuable report. (<b>Hemodynamics</b> is the study of blood flow and of the laws that govern the circulation of blood in the blood vessels). It follows that the [...] examiner knowledge of venous <b>hemodynamics</b> is crucial, which can be a real barrier to a radiologist untrained in this field, who might wish to carry out these examinations.|$|E
500|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{examination}} is focused mainly {{on the study of}} two pathologies; venous thrombosis and venous insufficiency. [...] It allows the examiner to evaluate the gross anatomy of the superficial and deep venous networks as well as the blood flow direction, which is crucial in determining vein pathology. [...] It has become the reference standard used in the assessment of the condition and <b>hemodynamics</b> of the veins of the lower limbs. The normal physiological blood flow is anterograde, flowing from the periphery towards the heart, so that the evidence of an opposite, retrograde flow might indicate a pathology. The presence of a reflux is likewise of note; a reflux when not isolated in a vein (as simply retrograde), means that the blood flow is bi-directional where once the flow had been only anterograde.|$|E
500|$|The first {{reports of}} kidney failure {{occurring}} in individuals with chronic liver diseases {{were from the}} late 19th century by Frerichs and Flint. [...] However, the hepatorenal syndrome was first defined as acute kidney failure {{that occurred in the}} setting of biliary surgery. [...] The syndrome was soon re-associated with advanced liver disease, and, in the 1950s, was clinically defined by Sherlock, Hecker, Papper and Vessin as being associated with systemic hemodynamic abnormalities and high mortality. [...] Hecker and Sherlock specifically identified that individuals with HRS had low urinary output, very low sodium in the urine, and no protein in the urine. [...] Murray Epstein was the first to characterize splanchnic vasodilation and kidney vasoconstriction as the key alterations in <b>hemodynamics</b> in patients with the syndrome. [...] The functional nature of the kidney impairment in HRS was crystallized by studies demonstrating that kidneys transplanted from patients with hepatorenal syndrome returned to function in the new host, leading to the hypothesis that hepatorenal syndrome was a systemic condition and not a kidney disease. The first systematic attempt to define hepatorenal syndrome was made in 1994 by the International Ascites Club, a group of liver specialists. The more recent history of HRS has involved elucidation of the various vasoactive mediators that cause the splanchnic and kidney blood flow abnormalities of the condition.|$|E
500|$|The risk {{of death}} in hepatorenal {{syndrome}} is very high; consequently, {{there is a significant}} emphasis on the identification of patients who are at risk for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. [...] As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications [...] to prevent HRS. [...] Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. [...] The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. [...] In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. [...] Also, large volume paracentesis—which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in <b>hemodynamics</b> to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. [...] The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS. [...] Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins.|$|E
500|$|Venous {{ultrasonography}} of {{the lower}} limbs is the most demanding of the medical complementary examinations. It {{is dependent on the}} examiner's expertise and training, and the interpretation of the results is subjective and reliant on an understanding of venous <b>hemodynamics.</b> [...] (A mapping does help the reproducibility and the inter-observer agreement of this examination). The examination is made even more difficult because there can be dilated veins without insufficiency, (by hyper-debit), and non dilated [...] but incompetent veins. Moreover, veins can be discretely incompetent in summer but then be normal in winter. Also, by definition of insufficiency, (insufficient blood flow) blood may be seen to flow freely in both directions, anterograde and retrograde between two valves. Another problem when dealing with the superficial venous system, is that venous anatomy is not constant; the position of veins can vary in different patients; also in the same patient the right lower limb is not identical to the left lower limb. As a further complication to the examination, where venous insufficiency is evidenced, the examination needs to be done with the probe in the transversal position but the mapping must be done showing the veins in their longitudinal aspect. This demands a rapid extrapolation by the physician from the transversal images seen to the longitudinal drawing needed. The dynamic maneuvers also need to be well executed. The need of a specialized training is mandatory which is a huge problem for many countries today.|$|E

2500|$|The circulatory system, {{also called}} the {{cardiovascular}} system or the vascular system, is an organ system that permits blood to circulate and transport nutrients (such as amino acids and electrolytes), oxygen, carbon dioxide, hormones, and blood cells {{to and from the}} cells in the body to provide nourishment and help in fighting diseases, [...] stabilize temperature and pH, and maintain homeostasis. The study of the blood flow is called <b>hemodynamics.</b> The study of the properties of the blood flow is called hemorheology.|$|E
2500|$|Examples of {{specialized}} services are intensive and critical care, anesthesia, defibrillation, {{but also some}} forms of hemotherapy, rehabilitation, and even nutrition, diet, post-partum treatment, and family planning, especially assisted reproductive technology. [...] Specialized treatment can also be involved in detecation, prescription and implementation of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, especially those related to prenatal diagnosis in risk groups, diagnosis by imaging, interventionist radiology, <b>hemodynamics,</b> nuclear medicine, neurophysiology, endoscopy, lab tests, biopsies, radiotherapy, radiosurgery, renal lithotripsy, dialysis, techniques of respiratory therapy, organ transplants and other tissue and cell transplants.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hemodynamics</b> {{affect the}} {{development}} of AAA, which has a [...] for the [...] aorta. The histological structure and mechanical characteristics of the infrarenal aorta {{differ from those of}} the thoracic aorta. The diameter decreases from the root to the aortic bifurcation, and the wall of the infrarenal aorta also contains a lesser proportion of elastin. The mechanical tension in the abdominal aortic wall is therefore higher than in the thoracic aortic wall. The elasticity and [...] also decline with age, which can result in gradual [...] of the segment. Higher intraluminal pressure in patients with arterial hypertension markedly contributes to the progression of the pathological process. Suitable hemodynamic conditions may be linked to specific intraluminal thrombus (ILT) patterns along the aortic lumen, which in turn may affect AAA's development.|$|E
2500|$|A {{feature of}} the {{pulmonary}} artery catheter that has been largely ignored in the clinical setting {{is its ability to}} monitor total body oxygen extraction by measuring the mixed venous oxygen saturation. [...] Regardless of the value obtained by measurements of the cardiac output, the mixed venous oxygen saturation is an accurate parameter of total body blood flow and therefore cardiac output. The assumption that a low mixed venous oxygen saturation (normal = 60% except for the coronary sinus where it approximates 40% reflecting the high metabolic rate of the myocardium) represents less than adequate oxygen delivery is consistent with physiological and metabolic observations. High oxygen extraction is associated with low cardiac output and decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation. Except during hypothermia and in severe sepsis, low mixed venous oxygen saturations are indication of inadequate <b>hemodynamics.</b> The ability of the pulmonary artery catheter to sample mixed venous blood is of great utility to manage low cardiac output states.|$|E
