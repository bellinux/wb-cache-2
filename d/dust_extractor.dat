40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the study {{results of the}} structural features and functional properties of the limestone filler {{as well as the}} basalt and amphibolite dusts from a <b>dust</b> <b>extractor</b> of a Hot-Mix Asphalt plant in Poland. Additionally, the selected physical and mechanical properties of asphalt concrete 0 – 16 mm in laboratory conditions were evaluated. The principal purpose of the study is to understand the structural and functional properties of baghouse dusts and “fillers mixed” from the perspective of their use as fillers for Hot-Mix Asphalt (HMA). The analysis of the results of grain-size distribution, specific surface, air voids of dry compacted fillers, increase in the softening point using the Ring & Ball method, as well as selected properties of the AC 16, all have shown that the studied baghouse dusts meet the requirements of fillers for HMA. Research results have also shown that these dusts as “fillers mixed” with limestone filler optimally meet the requirements of fillers for HMA. Presented results contribute substantially to expending the knowledge in the field of the quality, structure and functional properties of fillers...|$|E

5000|$|Chronic {{exposure}} to human nail dust {{is a serious}} occupational hazard that can be minimized by not producing such dust. Best practice is to avoid electrical debridement or burring of mycotic nails unless the treatment is necessary. [...] When the procedure is necessary, {{it is possible to}} reduce exposure by using nail <b>dust</b> <b>extractors,</b> local exhaust, good housekeeping techniques, personal protective equipment such as gloves, glasses or goggles, face shields, and an appropriately fitted disposable respirators to protect against the hazards of nail dust and flying debris.|$|R
40|$|Cladobotryum spp. are {{responsible}} for cobweb disease of mushrooms. In two commercial and one experimental mushroom-growing room, Cladobotryum conidia were released into the air in direct response to physical disturbance of disease colonies during either crop watering or treatment by covering with salt to 10 mm. Conidia were detected using a Burkard spore trap or agar-based trap plates. A maximum concentration of ∼ 25, 000 conidia m− 3 was recorded in a small (75 -m 3) experimental growing room in the hour following the salting of 16 cobweb patches (0. 55 m 2). Concentrations of 100 and 40 conidia m− 3 were recorded in the two larger commercial growing rooms in the hour following the salting of 18 and 11 patches of cobweb (diameter, approximately 50 to 200 mm), respectively. In controlled experiments, disturbed conidia were dispersed rapidly throughout a small growing room, with 91 to 97 % of conidia settling out within 15 min. Eighty-five percent of conidia settled out within a 0. 5 -m radius when air-conditioning fans were switched off, consistent with airborne spore dispersal. Alternative methods for treating diseased areas to minimize conidial release and distribution were investigated and included covering disease colonies with damp paper tissue prior to salt application (tissue salting) and holding a <b>dust</b> <b>extractor</b> above disease colonies during salt application. Both methods resulted in no detectable airborne conidia, but the tissue paper salting technique was more convenient. Prevention of airborne conidial release and distribution is essential to avoid mushroom spotting symptoms, secondary colonies, and early crop termination...|$|E
40|$|The Eco-design {{directive}} {{published by}} the European Union aims at 34 TWh of annual savings with industrial fans by the year 2020. This is about 10 % of the total saving aim of 366 TWh. Electric motors are still responsible for over 40 % of the planned savings with 135 TWh of annual savings by 2020. These aims are translated into European directives to guide the market towards more energy efficient systems. An evolution within those regulations {{is the fact that}} directives are not only focusing on one particular part in the drive system (e. g. the induction motor), but consider the entire system with all its parts to rise the overall system energy efficiency. Examples of this total system approach are the latest EU directives on circulator pumps [1] [2], air conditioning systems [3], domestic comfort fans [3] and industrial fans [4]. This system approach demands a thorough analysis of all the different parts of the drive system {{in order to make a}} sound technical and economical choice on which part to invest to rise the overall system efficiency. This paper describes a practical case study carried out on an industrial <b>dust</b> <b>extractor</b> in preparation of a new research project proposal in which o. a. the EU-directive 327 / 2011 [4] will be investigated. The different drive parts were analyzed based on their efficiency and replaced if technically and economically feasible. Research and test bench results of previous and on-going research projects on energy efficiency were used to predict the potential savings. At each step energy consumption measurements were carried out before and after to validate the estimated savings...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with an experimental and theoretical study of the behaviour of a reinforced earth retaining wall built on a rigid foundation, during and after construction with special attention paid {{to the effect of}} the compaction process. The theory and development of reinforced earth, four case histories, and tests on full scale models and small scale models related to the effects of compaction and current design methods have been reviewed with comments. The research work is tackled on two fronts: - Experimental model study. - Theoretical studies. 1) Experimental model study The model study, a three dimensional model, simulates a vertical reinforced earth retaining wall of height 6. 0 m with a model scale ` 10 '. The model comprises an open fronted wooden box 1300 mm long, 900 mm wide and 700 mm high, and the box contains the wall retaining 1200 Kg of sand reinforced with aluminium foil strips 0. 1 mm thick attached to perspex facing panels of 150 x 150 x 18 mm each. The sand bed in the model was formed using a sand spreader, <b>dust</b> <b>extractor</b> machine and a vibratory compaction device simulating the compaction plant in the field. Sixty six strain gauges, sixteen miniature pressure cells, which were developed and calibrated completely in the laboratory, and eight LVDTs were used to monitor the behaviour of the wall before, during and after compaction, under various uniform and variable compaction lengths and different methods of construction. Two methods of calibrating the density in the models were established, viz. temporary metal metal cylinders and permanent perspex cylinders. 2) Theoretical studies These were divided into two sections as follows: a - Theoretical study of compaction. b - Finite element method...|$|E

The particle sizes range from 0.1 to 100 um and 86% of these particles are less than 5 um in diameter and therefore capable of entry into the alveoli.|$|R
40|$|Concentration and {{elemental}} {{composition of the}} total suspended particulates (TSP) emitted&# 13; due to manufacturing activities of an enamelware industry in Lagos, Nigeria were investigated. &# 13; Gravimetric method was used in mass concentration determination and an energy dispersive x-ray&# 13; fluorescence (ED-XRF) analyzer was employed in the multi-elemental analysis. The Federal Ministry&# 13; of Environment (FMENV, Nigeria's environment regulating body) set limit of 250 ug/m 3 for ambient&# 13; TSP was exceeded {{in five of the}} seven sampling locations within the company premise. The maximum&# 13; concentration (about 8 fold of the limit) was recorded in the Decorating section and the minimum in&# 13; Front of the Administrative Block (about 3 times less than set limit) that is an outdoor location. &# 13; Elements detected from all the samples were Al, Si, P, K, Ca, Ti, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd and Na.

40|$|The {{filtration}} efficiency of free-standing <b>dust</b> <b>extractors</b> fitted with filter bags {{of various types}} and challenged with wood dust of various grades has been measured. During each test, the air pressure inside the filter bag, the extractor air flow rate and the concentration of dust penetrating the filter bag were monitored. Needlefelt filter bags allowed a limited quantity of dust, usually at a concentration well below the maximum exposure limit (MEL) of 5 mgm ~ 3, to penetrate when they were clean and improved greatly as they became loaded with dust. Filter bags made from woven cotton let more dust through. Needlefelt bags with specially coated fibres were no more efficient than standard bags but those with a microporous membrane coating were highly efficient. However, an increase in {{filtration efficiency}} during loading was invariably accompanied {{by an increase in}} air pressure inside the filter bag and a drop in extractor air flow, all effects being more marked when fine dust was used. Some of the <b>extractors</b> leaked <b>dust</b> from around loosely fitting filter bags and dust collector bags, or through holes in the fan housing, indicating that not all aspects of design are ideal. Tests carried out on bags that had been used for long periods indicated that air entering the filter bag gives rise to an initial high external dust concentration, though this did not usually persist. Periodic cleaning of the bag is recommended. Vacuum cleaning the inside when the bag is removed from the cleaner almost restores its original condition, but results in the generation of large quantities of airborne dust. The use of a tool that fits inside the bag enables cleaning to be carried out effectively in situ without exposing the operator to significant con...|$|R
40|$|The {{trials were}} carried out in a pasta factory in Bari Province and {{confirmed}} that the existent studies regarding health risks in the pasta production sector {{can be used as}} the starting point. However it is necessary to make a specific analysis of the parameters which constitute risk factors, using scientific apparatus. Evaluation of the risks deriving from noise involved a problem of interpretation. The differences found between data obtained with a phonometer and data obtained with a dosimeter may be in contrast, and the dosimeter data can be a source of concern for the workers’ health and therefore for their employers who are responsible for health and safety. In actual fact, when {{the reality of the situation}} was examined, it was seen that different plant operations involve workers’ movements which can stress the microphones differently from acoustic pressure. Therefore, the noise levels which are actually indicative of the situation in the workplace are the phonometer data. However, these too were quite high: daily exposure levels of over 80 dB(A), 85 dB(A) and 90 dB(A) in one case, while the impulsive noise levels were always lower Lpk= 112 dB(C). Evaluation of the risk from exposure to particulate matter showed concentrations of inhalable particulate matter PM 10 which were constantly below the level of TLV-TWA = 0. 5 mg/m 3 adopted by the ACGIH as the maximum inhalable dose in eight hours of work. This shows the efficiency of the <b>dust</b> <b>extractor</b> system, which the firm recently upgraded. However, we looked at preventive measures which consisted of: -	working regulation defined by applying industrial health and safety procedures; -	correct and continuous maintenance of the extractor system; -	identification of workers who are more susceptible to respiratory diseases – mostly caused by semolinas powder - even when exposed to levels below TLW. This study has further confirmed that the risk evaluation is not an exact science; in that it does not consist only of technical and mechanical factors, but needs also to consider the many factors connected to workers’ interaction with the workplace...|$|E
40|$|I {{prepared}} {{my thesis}} on Health Support at Workplaces under Particular Conditions of a Textile Factory. The main {{objective was to}} determine the company management?s activities in the field of health support. The second objective was to map the information provided to the staff on health support at the workplace, and the third objective was to propose the concept of a specific preventive programme. When preparing the concept of the preventive programme for the textile company I co-operated with the company management and with the company doctor. The reference group was represented by women employed in a textile plant in South Bohemia who worked in different workshops producing car seat covers, housing and children?s clothing. The work described in this thesis was carried out as quantitative research. For data collection I used anonymous questionnaires and the results of this research were plotted on graphs. The thesis is divided into a theoretical part and an empirical part. The theoretical part mainly deals with health support at the workplace, with an analysis of health risks at work including the impact of physical factors. At the beginning of the empirical part I set the goals and set out three hypotheses. Having analysed the collected data I found that H 1, H 2 and H 3 were confirmed. The empirical section includes a description of the research technique which shows that more than 50 per cent of employees of the textile factory are overweight, then that there is a greater occurrence of health problems in the departments of sewing and embroidery machines and many women also had no idea of the meaning of health support at the workplace. According to the results it is possible to say that the textile company does not organize any physical activities or rehabilitative exercises for their employees. Based on the information I would recommend organizing sports courses, providing healthy canteen meals, reducing stress at the workplace and introducing <b>dust</b> <b>extractors</b> in order to reduce dust at the workplace. This thesis may bring the company better working comfort and help to improve the employees? health. The proposed preventive programme can also be a manual for employers in the textile plant in the field of health support at the workplace...|$|R
