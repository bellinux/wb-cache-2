6000|$|... "How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> yourself?" [...] Feeling at a disadvantage, the Elector {{avoided the}} direct {{question}} that was in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, they say,' {{returned}} his wife, 'that listeners never hear any good of themselves; though you--but pray how long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> sir?' ...|$|E

'Your {{words of}} comfort and blessing come to me with fresh {{strength}} just now, two days only after the time when <b>you</b> too, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> would in private have laid your hand on my head and called down God's blessing upon me. I shall never know in this world what I owe to your prayers.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Sir Hugh took Florence in to dinner, {{and when}} the soup had been eaten made an attempt to talk to her. [...] "How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> Miss Burton?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Billy!" [...] {{cried the}} girl, rushing toward him with out-stretched hands. [...] "O Billy, {{we thought you}} were dead. How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here?</b> Why haven't you been to see me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Day before yesterday--no, yesterday. It seems a month, I've {{seen and}} done so much," [...] he said, with his laugh. [...] "Miss Anderson's been showing {{me the whole}} of Washington society. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> long?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Paul, what <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> doing <b>here</b> all night? Do {{you know}} that it is past mid-day? Has {{anything}} happened? Are you ill?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> living <b>here</b> {{all these}} days without telling me? <b>You</b> <b>have</b> left your home. I fear I am {{something}} {{to blame for}} this?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear, {{your news}} is so {{infinitely}} more important, that I own I {{forgot all about}} the letter. Besides, as {{this is the fourth}} that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> since <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> it <b>is</b> not of such extreme importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{give you}} {{something}} better to do, at any rate. How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here?</b> It 's an age since I have seen you. We consider you domiciled here, and expect you to play host and entertain us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you remember?" [...] {{he said to}} her. [...] "I've {{talked to}} you about him often." [...] And then to me: [...] "But why didn't you let me know you were coming? How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here?</b> How long {{are you going to}} stay? Why didn't you come an hour earlier, and we would have dined together?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{was miserable}} {{to hear them}} say it, for {{it was the same}} cold fear that was in my own mind. Then we saw poor old Father Peter {{wandering}} along back, with his head bent down, searching the ground. When he was pretty close to us he looked up and saw us, and said, [...] "How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> boys?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] said Mr. Holiday. [...] "I am {{very glad}} {{that she has}} gone. And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> staying <b>here</b> {{to take care of}} me?" [...] he asked.|$|R
6000|$|... "Josephine, if you please," [...] she said, [...] "and all the {{friendship}} {{you care to}} claim. There, see how rapidly we <b>have</b> progressed! <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> barely {{a quarter of an}} hour and I <b>have</b> given <b>you</b> what really means a great deal to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|NORA. Why {{should he}} come? He's seen the tower often enough: it's no {{attraction}} to him. [Genteelly] An {{what do you}} think of Ireland, Mr Broadbent? <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>been</b> <b>here</b> before? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> a great while?" [...] she asked, {{turning her}} head slowly toward Colville, {{and looking at}} him with a little {{difficulty}} she had in raising her eyelids; when she was younger the glance that shyly stole from under the covert of their lashes was like a gleam of sunshine, and it was still like a gleam of paler sunshine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{it is my}} duty to {{tell you}} that you are wasting your time. It would not matter that you have no talent, talent does not run about the streets in these days, but you have not the {{beginning}} of an aptitude. How long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here?</b> A child of five after two lessons would draw better than you do. I only say one thing to you, give up this hopeless attempt. You're more likely to earn your living as a bonne a tout faire than as a painter. Look." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Ellie, my darling, my pettikins [kissing her], {{how long}} <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> <b>here?</b> I've been at home all the time: I was putting flowers and {{things in your}} room; and when I just sat down {{for a moment to}} try how {{comfortable}} the armchair was I went off to sleep. Papa woke me and told me you were here. Fancy your finding no one, and being neglected and abandoned. [Kissing her again]. My poor love! [She deposits Ellie on the sofa. Meanwhile Ariadne has left the table and come over to claim her share of attention]. Oh! you've brought someone with you. Introduce me.|$|E
6000|$|... "But if {{they were}} the same escort you spoke of, they must <b>have</b> known <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>here,</b> and have"--he <b>was</b> about to say [...] "abandoned you," [...] but checked himself, remembering they were her father's soldiers.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Aha, Ellen!' she cried, gaily, {{jumping up}} and running to my side. 'I shall have a pretty story to tell to-night; and so you've found me out. <b>Have</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>been</b> <b>here</b> in your life before?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... --GIT up, you old cow! {{stumbling}} {{like that}} when we've just <b>been</b> praising <b>you!</b> out on a scout and can't {{live up to the}} honor any better than that? Antonio, how long <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> out <b>here</b> in the Plains and the Rockies?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so {{hot in the}} schoolroom," [...] she said, [...] "and some of the girls, poor things, are so ill-tempered at rehearsal--I {{have made}} my escape. I hope you got your breakfast, Miss de Sor. What <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> doing <b>here,</b> all by yourself?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am so sorry," [...] he said politely. [...] "I really <b>had</b> {{forgotten}} that <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>here.</b> But <b>you</b> know--that <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> to sleep?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind my business," [...] Captain Francis {{answered}} curtly; [...] "what about yours? Why <b>have</b> <b>you</b> <b>been</b> hanging about <b>here</b> for me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> a minute, <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> {{two good}} hours," [...] she went on. [...] "All by {{yourself}} in the Major's study. I am of a jealous disposition--I am. And I {{want to know what}} it means." [...] She advanced a few steps nearer to me, with a heightening color and a threatening look. [...] "Is he going to bring you out on the stage?" [...] she asked, sharply.|$|R
6000|$|... "An {{excuse for}} keeping away from Monksmoor--in the {{interests}} of my own tranquillity. The experiment <b>has</b> failed. While <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>here,</b> I can't keep away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O’ course I made a fuss when I {{found out}} how I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> deceived. <b>You</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> when he came, Mrs. Church, weren’t you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{she looked}} at him steadily. [...] "It is the first time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here.</b> Something unusual must <b>have</b> brought <b>you.</b> Jimmy, <b>is</b> it war?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker," [...] said Mr. Pumblechook. [...] "If <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> born such, would <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> now? Not you--" ...|$|R
50|$|Quotes {{from the}} Jury of the TV program:"This {{was even better}} that the other two times <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here.</b> Every time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raising the bar".|$|R
6000|$|Then the Duchess {{signified}} her {{pleasure that}} her cheek should be touched,--and it was touched. [...] "Mrs. Pepper {{will show you}} your room. It <b>is</b> the same <b>you</b> <b>had</b> when <b>you</b> <b>were</b> <b>here</b> before. Perhaps <b>you</b> know that Mr. Green comes down to Stamford on the first, {{and that he will}} dine here on that day and on Sunday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I may go on--though if <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>here</b> but {{a moment}} or two sooner, <b>you</b> would <b>have</b> heard your praises sounded by Georgiana.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{the first}} time <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> and this {{difference}} appears a little unusual," [...] he said. [...] "Won't you come in?" ...|$|R
