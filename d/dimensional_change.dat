25|$|It is {{probably}} impossible to completely eliminate <b>dimensional</b> <b>change</b> in wood, but elimination {{of change in}} size may be approximated by chemical modification. For example, wood can be treated with chemicals to replace the hydroxyl groups with other hydrophobic functional groups of modifying agents (Stamm, 1964). Among all the existing processes, wood modification with acetic anhydride has been noted for the high anti-shrink or anti-swell efficiency (ASE) attainable without damage to wood. However, acetylation of wood {{has been slow to}} be commercialised due to the cost, corrosion and the entrapment of the acetic acid in wood. There is an extensive volume of literature relating to the chemical modification of wood (Rowell, 1983, 1991; Kumar, 1994; Haque, 1997).|$|E

25|$|Shrinkage and {{swelling}} may occur in wood when the moisture content is changed (Stamm, 1964). Shrinkage occurs as moisture content decreases, while swelling takes place when it increases. Volume {{change is not}} equal in all directions. The greatest <b>dimensional</b> <b>change</b> occurs in a direction tangential to the growth rings. Shrinkage from the pith outwards, or radially, is usually considerably less than tangential shrinkage, while longitudinal (along the grain) shrinkage is so slight as to be usually neglected. The longitudinal shrinkage is 0.1% to 0.3%, in contrast to transverse shrinkages, which is 2% to 10%. Tangential shrinkage is often about twice as great as in the radial direction, although in some species it is as much as five times as great. The shrinkage is about 5% to 10% in the tangential direction and about 2% to 6% in the radial direction (Walker et al., 1993).|$|E

40|$|Background: The second {{processing}} cycle for adding the artificial teeth to heat-polymerized acrylic resin denture bases {{may result in}} <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> of the denture bases. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> of the heat-polymerized acrylic resin denture bases with one and two-cycle processing methods. Materials and Methods: A metal edentulous maxillary arch was used for making 40 stone casts. Maxillary complete dentures were made with heat-polymerized acrylic resins (Meliodent and Acropars) with one and two stage processing methods (n = 10 for each group). Linear <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> in anteroposterior and mediolateral distances and vertical changes in the first molar region were measured following each {{processing cycle}}, using a digital caliper. Mean percentage of the <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> were subjected to two-way analysis of variance and Tukey honest significant difference tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Postpolymerization contraction occurred in both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions in all studied groups; however, the vertical dimension was increased. Acropars acrylic resin showed the highest <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> and the second processing cycle significantly affected the measured distances (P < 0. 05). Meliodent acrylic resin was not significantly influenced by the processing method. Conclusion: Reheating of the acrylic resin denture bases for the addition of denture teeth result in linear <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes,</b> which can be clinically significant based on the acrylic resin used...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to compare <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> of specimens processed by conventional and injection-molding techniques. SR-Ivocap Triplex Hot resin was used for conventional pressure-packed and SR-Ivocap High Impact was used for injection-molding techniques. After processing, all the specimens were stored in distilled water at room temperature until measured. For dimensional accuracy evaluation, measurements were recorded at 24 -hour, 48 -hour and 12 -day intervals using a digital caliper with an accuracy of 0. 01 mm. Statistical analysis was carried out by SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using t-test and repeated-measures ANOVA. Statistical significance was defined at P< 0. 05. After each water storage period, the acrylic specimens produced by injection exhibited less <b>dimensional</b> <b>changes</b> compared to those produced by the conventional technique.
