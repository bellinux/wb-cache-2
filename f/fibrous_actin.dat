40|$|Identification, {{localization}} {{and partial}} biochemical characterization of actins {{expressed in the}} larval stage of the cestode parasite Taenia solium has been carried out. Frozen tissue sections of cysticerci, the larval stage of this parasite, were reacted with rhodamine-phalloidin, parasite actin was purified by polymerization {{in the presence of}} K, mg(�) and ATP actin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting of actin was performed in PVDF membranes and with commercial anti-actin monoclonal antibodies. Parasitic tissues showed different <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> fluorescence patterns, which correlated with the expression of isoactins. Purified globular actin had a similar molecular mass to rabbit commercial actin (similar to 44 kDa). Actin was resolved into seven isoforms, indicating a family of actin genes.

40|$|For {{purposes}} of studying {{the degree of}} polymerization of actin in nuclei, nuclei from 35 S-labeled amoebas (Amoeba proteus) were transplanted into unlabeled cells, which were immediately lysed and extracted under conditions considered to stabilize preexisting <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin.</b> The enucleated 35 S-donor cells were similarly treated for analysis of cytoplasmic actin. The extraction conditions permitted separation of soluble (unpolymerized or G) actin from pelletable (polymerized or F) actin, and the radioactivity of each was determined after the actin was separated from other proteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We found that about 2 / 3 of the actin within the nucleus is pelletable, whereas only about 1 / 3 of the cytoplasmic actin is pelletable. We speculate that polymerized actin in the nucleus {{is involved in the}} condensation of chromatin...|$|E
40|$|A {{methanol}} extract of Alsomitra macrocarpa {{leaves and}} branches induced a marked alteration of cell morphology {{in a human}} stellate cell line (LX- 2). Similar morphologic alterations were observed in several other cell lines. Active compound was purified from the extract and determined to be cucurbitacin E (Cuc E). It has been known that Cuc E causes marked disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, supporting our observation, but how Cuc E altered the actin cytoskeleton has not been elucidated. By using the standard fluorescence assay using copolymerization and depolymerization of native and pyrene labelled actin, this study revealed that Cuc E interacted directly with actin consequently stabilizing the polymerized actin. When NIH- 3 T 3 cells exogenously expressing YFP-labeled actin were treated with Cuc E, firstly the aggregation of globular actin and secondly the aggregation of actin including disrupted <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> in the cells was observed...|$|E
50|$|Thin filaments, 7 nm in diameter, consist {{primarily}} of the protein <b>actin,</b> specifically <b>fibrous</b> (F) <b>actin.</b> Each F actin strand {{is composed of}} a string of subunits called globular (G) actin. Each G actin has an active site that can bind to the head of a myosin molecule. Each thin filament also has approximately 40 to 60 molecules of tropomyosin, the protein that blocks the active sites of the thin filaments when the muscle is relaxed. Each tropomyosin molecule has a smaller calcium-binding protein called troponin bound to it. All thin filaments are attached to the Z-line.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} {{in a variety}} of laboratories have shown that the <b>fibrous</b> proteins <b>actin</b> and tubulin are involved in a wide spectrum of cellular activities, including motility and the transfer of materials across cell membranes. The investigation that forms the subject of this thesis used the wealth of background information on events following section of the XIIth cranial (hypoglossal) nerve in the rat, to see what part actin and tubulin play in the withdrawal and re-establishment of synaptic boutons: to investigate synapse modelling. Quantitative protein changes were measured by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Cellular location of the changes was shown by immunofluorescence microscopy. This work was extended to include an investigation of a small amount of human material. Using the same analytical techniques as were employed in the experimental work on rats, a tentative identification is made of the material that forms the neurofibrillary tangles in presenile and senile dementia. Suggestions are made about the nature and origin of these diseases. Some observations are also made about the protein skeletin, but because isolation and characterization methods currently available give conflicting results about the true nature of this important cellular component, it was excluded from an in depth study pending more detailed information about it...|$|R
40|$|Changing {{patterns}} of actin localization {{have been studied}} on a light microscopic level by means of fluorescently labeled heavy meromyosin. The cellular distribution of actin is characterized by four major patterns, each of which corresponds to a particular phase of cell division. Long actin fibers are a prominent feature of the interphase cell. They disappear as the cell rounds up for mitosis and are replaced by a diffuse distribution of actin throughout the cytoplasm. During cytokinesis, the actin is localized predominantly in the cleavage furrow. The final shift of actin occurs {{after the completion of}} cytokinesis. At this time the actin becomes concentrated in the distal poles of the cell where pseudopods form to pull the daughter cells apart. When the daughter cells have separated, they flatten on the culture dish and the <b>fibrous</b> pattern of <b>actin</b> characteristic of interphase cells returns. All of these changes take place during the 1 -hr period required for cell division...|$|R
40|$|Cerebral endothelial cells {{accomplish}} the barrier functions between blood and brain interstitium. Structural features are the tight junctions between adjacent endothelial cells {{and the formation}} of marginal folds at the cell-cell contacts. The glucocorticoid hydrocortisone (HC) has been reported to enforce the blood-brain-barrier in vitro measurable by an increase of the transendothelial electrical resistance. This study shows the impact of HC on the mechanical and morphological properties of confluent cell layers of brain microvascular endothelial cells. HC induces an increase in height of these marginal folds and a reduction of the intercellular contact surface. These morphological changes are accompanied by changes in cell elasticity. Staining of <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> indicates that HC induces a reorganization of the actin cortex. The quantitative determination of the local elastic properties of cells reveals for the first time an HC-induced increase of the representative Young's modulus according to cytoskeletal rearrangements. For this study, cells of two different species, porcine brain capillary endothelial cells and murine brain capillary endothelial cells, were used yielding similar results, which clearly demonstrates that the HC effect on the cell elasticity is species independent...|$|E
40|$|Actins {{isolated}} from embryonic chick brain and muscle differ in mobility when subjected to electrophoresis in gels containing urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Experiments {{were carried out}} to determine whether these actins are products of different structural genes and differ in primary amino acid sequence, or whether they are products of the same structural gene but are different because of post-translational modification. Messenger RNA from brain and muscle tissue was used to direct cell-free protein synthesis in wheat germ extracts. The synthesized actins were identified by conversion from globular to <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> and by two-dimensional chromatographic analysis of tryptic peptides. The differences in electrophoretic mobility of brain compared to muscle actin were maintained in the cell-free protein synthetic products. Therefore, these mobility differences were not due to post-translational modification. It was concluded that brain and muscle actin are coded by different messenger RNAs and therefore arise from different structural genes. In addition, messenger RNA from 13 - and 16 -day embryonic thigh muscle directed the synthesis of both brain- and muscle-type actins, suggesting that muscle cell differentiation involves the regulation {{of at least two}} different actin genes...|$|E
30|$|Chemical {{stimulation}} is sensed through specific biological cascades. Cells {{respond to}} the biochemical changes in extracellular matrix (ECM) through the crosstalk between integrins and cytoskeleton. Chemical signals {{are connected to the}} local adhesion sites or by regulating global cellular processes through chemical factor receptor signaling pathways (Kim et al. 2011). The pathway of mechanical stimulation is somehow different as mechanical loading is initially received by the adhesive membrane proteins and transferred to the cell body. Mechanotransductive pathways such as Wnt and TGFβ can be activated through alterations to the micro-mechanical environment (Si and Kang 2006). In addition to such pathways, mechanical incentives can be directly transferred to the cell body through the cytoskeleton with a fine mesh-like assembly of fibers. Actin structure is mostly responsible for transferring such stimulation to the nucleus and organelles (Paul et al. 2008). The remodeling in actin structure that was observed in this study is most likely related to the mechanical stimulation which in turn caused enhanced cardiac fate. Interestingly, the function of cardiac cells as muscular cells is highly dependent on the cytoskeleton. The enhanced <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> network described by alignment, bundling and generation of stress fibers results in optimized muscle contractility that facilitates the function of myocardium.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{kinetics}} of actin unfolding {{induced by}} guanidine hydrochloride of different concentrations was studied. The parametric {{representation of the}} kinetic dependencies of tryptophan fluorescence intensity changes recorded at two wavelengths allowed us to detect and characterize a new essentially unfolded kinetic intermediate. Its characteristics suggested that this intermediate state is a premolten globule. It was shown that the equilibrium transition between inactivated and completely unfolded states is also a two-step process and proceeds via an essentially unfolded kinetic intermediate. The new kinetic pathway of actin unfolding-refolding was proposed. According to it, the founded essentially unfolded kinetic state is the on-pathway intermediate, while inactivated actin is the off-pathway misfolded state stabilized by aggregation of partially folded macromolecules of protein. Actin {{is one of the}} main proteins of the muscle system and cytoskeleton of nonmuscle eukaryotic cells (1 - 3). At low ionic strength, actin exists as a monomer (G-actin). In the presence of neutral salts, it polymerizes, forming double-stranded polymer (the so-called <b>fibrous</b> form of <b>actin,</b> or F-actin). F-actin forms the backbone of thin filaments o...|$|R
40|$|The role {{of calcium}} and magnesium-ATP on the {{structure}} and contractility in motile extracts of Amoeba proteus and plasmalemma- ectoplasm "ghosts" of Chaos carolinensis has been investigated by correlating light and electron microscope observations with turbidity and birefringence measurements. The extract is nonmotile and contains very few F-actin filaments and myosin aggregates when prepared {{in the presence of}} both low calcium ion and ATP concentrations at an ionic strength of I = 0. 05, pH 6. 8. The addition of 1. 0 mM magnesium chloride, 1. 0 mM ATP, {{in the presence of a}} low calcium ion concentration (relaxation solution) induced the formation of some <b>fibrous</b> bundles of <b>actin</b> without contracting, whereas the addition of a micromolar concentration of calcium in addition to 1. 0 mM magnesium-ATP (contraction solution) (Taylor, D. L., J. S. Condeelis, P. L. Moore, and R. D. Allen. 1973. J. Cell Biol. 59 : 378 - 394) initiated the formation of large arrays of F-actin filaments followed by contractions. Furthermore, plasmalemma-ectoplasm ghosts prepared in the relaxation solution exhibited very few straight F-actin filaments and myosin aggregates. In contrast, plasmalemmaectoplasm ghosts treated with the contraction solution contained many straight F-actin filaments and myosin aggregates. The increase in the structure of ameba cytoplasm at the endoplasm-ectoplasm interface can be explained by a combination of the transformation of actin from a less filamentous to a more structured filamentous state possibly involving the cross-linking of actin to form fibrillar arrays (see above-mentioned reference) followed by contractions of the actin and myosin along an undetermined distance of the endoplasm and/or ectoplasm...|$|R
40|$|Smooth and {{striated}} muscle alpha-tropomyosins differ {{as a consequence}} of alternative splicing of exons 2 and 9 encoding amino acid residues 39 - 80 and 258 - 284, respectively [Ruiz-Opazo, N., Weinberger, J. & Nadal-Ginard, B. (1985) Nature (London) 315, 67 - 70]. To understand the relationship between alternatively spliced exons and functional domains in tropomyosin, recombinant unacetylated {{striated muscle}}, smooth muscle, and chimeric rat alpha-tropomyosins (+H 3 N-tropomyosins) expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli were analyzed. The functional differences between the isoforms can be primarily ascribed to exon 9. +H 3 N-Tropomyosins with the smooth muscle exon 9 bound to skeletal muscle filamentous actin with at least a 5 -fold higher affinity than +H 3 N-tropomyosins with the striated muscle exon 9. On the other hand, in the presence of Ca 2 +, troponin increased the affinity of +H 3 N-tropomyosins with the striated muscle exon 9 at least 50 -fold, whereas it had little effect on +H 3 N-tropomyosins with the smooth muscle exon 9. The unique striated muscle alpha-tropomyosin exon 9 seems to be specialized for Ca(2 +) -insensitive interaction with troponin on the thin filament. The unique smooth muscle alpha-tropomyosin exon 2 was associated with a slightly lower actin affinity than the striated muscle exon 2. Although the regions encoded by exons 2 and 9 correspond to functional domains, they are not recognizable as independent units or structural domains in the extended coiled-coil structure of this <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> binding protein...|$|E
40|$|This brief {{review of}} the rapidly {{developing}} research on vascular smooth muscle presents {{the state of the}} art as I see it from within my own frame of reference. For a more objective, detailed insight into the workings of vascular smooth muscle, several substantial reviews and compendi-ums may be read (1 - 7). CONTRACTILE PROTEINS The mechanical events responsible for the contraction of vascular smooth muscle are associat-ed with its contractile proteins. These proteins not only develop the mechanical force responsible for the contraction but also act as the enzyme that catalyzes the release of energy by which this force is developed. They are both the spark plug and the piston of the contractile machine. The contractile proteins of vascular smooth muscle are arranged in well-organized thick and thin filaments (8 - 10). The thick filaments, presum-ably bundles of myosin molecules, average 15. 5 nm in diameter and have lateral projections suggestive of cross-bridges extending toward adjacent thin filaments. The thin filaments, presumably <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin,</b> average 5 - 8 nm in diameter and appear to be attached to dense bodies that are usually connected to the cell membrane. Contraction of vascular smooth muscle most probably is effected by some version of the Huxley sliding filament mechanism. The most easily interpretable studies of the functions of the contractile proteins are those performed in isolation with the determinants of the enzymatic and physical responses tightly controlled. There is a qualitative similarity between the actomyosin of vascular smooth muscle and the actomyosin of skeletal muscle (11) evidenced by the observation that a hybrid actomyosin can be prepared by combining myosin from one of these types of muscle with actin from the other; thi...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the mechanism of}} α-naphthyl isothiocyanate (ANIT) inducing cholestatic hepatitis. MethodsA total of 60 healthy male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into normal control group (N group with 30 rats) and model group (ANIT group with 30 rats), and each group was further divided into three subgroups according to different time phases after gavage (at 24, 48, and 72 hours after gavage), with 10 rats in each group. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and total bilirubin (TBil) were measured, {{and the level of}} malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver was measured. A light microscope was used to observe the pathological changes in the liver, and a transmission electron microscope was used to observe the changes in the ultrastructure of the bile canaliculus. A confocal laser scanning microscope was used to analyze the mean fluorescence intensity of phalloidine labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate {{in order to determine the}} change in the level of <b>fibrous</b> <b>actin</b> (F-actin). ResultsAfter the administration of ANIT by gavage, the model group showed significant increases in the serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, and TBil and the level of MDA in liver tissue compared with the normal control group. The model group also showed damage in the structure of the hepatic lobules, hyaline degeneration of hepatocytes, spotted, patchy, and focal necrotic lesions, and neutrophil infiltration mostly confined to the hepatocytes around the bile duct, proliferation of biliary epithelial and fibrous tissues, widened perisinusoidal spaces, dilation of the bile canaliculi, extensive shedding of microvilli, and formation of bile thrombi in the bile capillaries, as well as a low fluorescence intensity of F-actin. The above changes were the most obvious at 48 hours; recovery began at 72 hours, but significant differences were still seen between the two groups. ConclusionANIT can cause lipid peroxidation in liver tissue and lead to degeneration and necrosis of liver cells, damage of microvilli of the bile canaliculi, and formation of bile thrombi, as well as reduction in the expression of F-actin in the bile canaliculi. Therefore, it affects the function of the liver to secrete bile and causes cholestatic hepatitis...|$|E
