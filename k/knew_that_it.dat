5|$|After {{developing}} the core {{concepts of the}} show, Abrams began to seek studios to develop the show; Abrams' past successes led to Warner Bros. Television and the Fox Television Network to quickly jump on board the project. Peter Roth, {{the chief executive of}} Warner Bros. Television, had been actively seeking to bring any Abrams' project to his studio, and heard Abrams' pitch for Fringe at a dinner meeting in August 2007. Similarly, Kevin Reilly, the entertainment chairman at Fox, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was critical for him to bring the next Abrams' project to his network, and worked with Roth to assure this would happen.|$|E
5|$|John, like Basil II before him, was a {{slow but}} steady campaigner. His armies made careful, {{measured}} gains over time, rarely exposing themselves to excessive risks, but nevertheless advancing inexorably towards their objectives. However, the Turks were resilient, {{and they did not}} allow themselves to be decisively defeated in any one engagement. They <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was difficult for the emperor to remain in one theatre of war for a long time, as events elsewhere often intervened that required his attention.|$|E

5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was now mathematically {{impossible for him to}} win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|For his successes, Licario {{was rewarded}} with the post of megas konostaulos, head of the Latin mercenaries, and {{eventually}} appointed as megas doux after Philanthropenos's death in ca. 1276; the first foreigner to be thus honoured. He commanded the Byzantine navy {{in a series of}} expeditions against the Latin-held Aegean islands. The first to fall was Skopelos, whose fortress was believed to be impregnable. Licario, however, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacked water supplies. Thus, he attacked it during the hot and dry summer of 1277 and forced its surrender. Its lord, Filippo Ghisi, was captured and sent to Constantinople; his other possessions, the islands of Skyros, Skiathos and Amorgos, were also taken soon after. After that, Licario went on to capture the islands of Kythera and Antikythera off the southern coast of the Morea, and later Kea, Astypalaia, and Santorini in the Cyclades. The great island of Lemnos was also captured, although its lord, Paolo Navigajoso, withstood a three-year siege before surrendering.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was risky to produce an acoustic based album because it {{was very different from}} the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E

5|$|The French Indian Ocean island {{bases of}} Île de France and Île Bonaparte had been ideal {{positions}} from which French cruisers could raid the valuable trade routes from Britain to India {{since the start}} of the war in 1803. However, it was not until 1808 that the French authorities spared a significant force to operate from the region, providing a squadron of four frigates under Commodore Jacques Hamelin. In 1809 and early 1810, these frigates operated with impunity along British trade routes, capturing seven valuable East Indiamen, a number of smaller merchant ships and several small warships. In response, the British admiral at the Cape of Good Hope, Albemarle Bertie, provided a small force of British warships to blockade the islands under Commodore Josias Rowley. Rowley <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be almost impossible find and defeat the French ships out in the wider ocean with his limited resources, but he was able to limit French effectiveness by attacking their bases, raiding Saint Paul harbour in 1809 and capturing Île Bonaparte in 1810, renaming it Île Bourbon.|$|E
5|$|The {{underwater}} {{scene was}} the first to be shot, and for its filming Stage 16 at Fox Studios was reconstructed into a 36 by 45meter tank, 4.5meters deep, containing 548,000gallons of water. The decision was made to convert the stage rather than film the scene elsewhere, since moving the film crew to the nearest adequate facility in San Diego would have been too costly for a single scene, and by converting Stage 16 20th Century Fox would {{be able to use the}} tank for future films. Because of the aquatic filming, the ability to swim was a prerequisite for cast and crew when signing onto the film. The cast trained in swimming pools in Los Angeles with professional divers to learn how to use the equipment. An additional two and a half weeks of training took place at the studio with stunt coordinator Ernie Orsatti and underwater cinematographer Peter Romano. Weaver, however, was unable to participate in most of the training due to commitments on Broadway. Winona Ryder faced a challenge with the scene, as she had nearly drowned at age 12 and had not been in the water since. She suggested using a body double, but <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be too obvious to audiences due to the difference in hair length. She filmed the scene, but suffered from anxiety on the first day of filming.|$|E

25|$|While driving {{together}} {{on their way}} to a Scouting function in Pocatello, Idaho, Dr. Mortensen proposed they call their program “Varsity Scouting”. The name fit. Everyone in the car <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> satisfied their requirements perfectly and the name was adopted on the spot. The unit would be called a “Team”, the adult leader a “Coach”, and the principal youth leader a “Captain”. An award, the Varsity Scout Letter, was designated as the top award for Varsity Scouts.|$|E
25|$|The first {{archaeological site}} to be {{preserved}} under the Antiquities Act was the Arizona complex that would become {{the centerpiece of the}} eponymous Montezuma Castle National Monument. Hewett knew of Montezuma Castle from his work inventorying the Southwest for the GLO and Lacey, and he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not only archaeologically significant but also imperiled by aggressive pot hunting (sometimes using dynamite to knock down walls so that rooms within could be excavated). Hewett lent his support to the creation of this national monument, which came into being in 1907.|$|E

25|$|Tension existed {{within the}} Cuban revolutionary {{committee}} between Martí and his military compatriots. Martí feared a military dictatorship would {{be established in}} Cuba upon independence, and suspected Dominican-born General Máximo Gómez of having these intentions. Martí knew that the independence of Cuba needed time and careful planning. Ultimately, Martí refused to cooperate with Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo Grajales, two Cuban military leaders from the Ten Years' War, when they wanted to invade immediately in 1884. Martí <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was too early to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.|$|E
25|$|The Banner of Peace symbol has ancient origins. Perhaps its {{earliest}} known example appears on Stone Age amulets: three dots, without the enclosing circle. Roerich came across numerous later examples {{in various parts}} of the world, and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> represented a deep and sophisticated understanding of the triune nature of existence. But for the purposes of the Banner and the Pact, Roerich described the circle as representing the totality of culture, with the three dots being Art, Science, and Religion, three of the most embracing of human cultural activities. He also described the circle as representing the eternity of time, encompassing the past, present, and future. The sacred origins of the symbol, as an illustration of the trinities fundamental to all religions, remain central to the meaning of the Pact and the Banner today.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 2008 the Malaysian {{police have}} {{obtained}} a warrant of arrest against Raja Petra for criminal defamation. This {{is due to}} his statutory declaration connecting Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Tun Razak’s wife, Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor, saying she was present when Mongolian national Altantunya Shaariibuu’s body was blown up. On 17 July, Raja Petra was charged with three counts of criminal intimidation over his statutory declaration on the murder of Mongolian translator Altantuya Shaariibuu. He {{is alleged to have}} defamed Deputy Prime Minister's wife Datin Seri Rosmah Mansor by making a libellous statement in the declaration which he affirmed on 18 June when he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would tarnish her good name. He also faced similar charges against Kolonel Norhayati Hassan and her husband Acting Kolonel Abdul Aziz Buyong.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} the Cadbury-Browns had a holiday home near the Suffolk town of Aldeburgh. Cadbury-Brown had {{designed}} a studio for Benjamin Britten {{in the early}} days of the Aldeburgh Festival and Britten had acquired a site opposite the parish church to build an opera house upon it. When this idea did not come to fruition, Britten converted the maltings at Snape and Cadbury-Brown bought the site. Seeing that the site already had a single storey dwelling on it he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had potential and together with his wife they designed a new home. After the house was completed in 1964 he sold part of the garden to Britten's colleague, the musician Imogen Holst and designed a house for her too. In 2000 the original house was Grade 2 Listed.|$|E

Merrill's choice of Bennett as an {{investor}} was no accident or stroke of luck, as he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was common for oil companies {{to invest in the}} development of airplanes, and frequently sponsored flights and other events to highlight the performance of their products. After Merrill’s convincing presentation, Bennett joined Merrill in forming the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The aircraft was to be a twin-engine (called bimotored in the 1930s), eight-place mid-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted Jacobs L-6 engines. The passenger cabin for six passengers was behind the two-crew flight deck.|$|E
25|$|As Emperor Wuzong <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not {{the wishes}} of chancellors Yang Sifu and Li Jue that he become emperor, he had both Yang Sifu and Li Jue {{relieved}} of their chancellorships soon after he took the throne.

Yang Sifu and Li Jue were sent out of the capital, to serve as the governors of Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) and Gui District (桂管, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi), respectfully, while such associates as Pei Yizhi (裴夷直) and Li Zhongmin (李中敏) were also demoted.|$|E
