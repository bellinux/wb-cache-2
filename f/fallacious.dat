5|$|For {{the philosopher}} Edward W. James, astrology is irrational {{not because of}} the {{numerous}} problems with mechanisms and falsification due to experiments, but because an analysis of the astrological literature shows that it is infused with <b>fallacious</b> logic and poor reasoning.|$|E
5|$|Early {{analyses}} of emeralds and beryls by Martin Heinrich Klaproth, Torbern Olof Bergman, Franz Karl Achard, and Johann Jakob Bindheim always yielded similar elements, {{leading to the}} <b>fallacious</b> conclusion that both substances are aluminium silicates. Mineralogist René Just Haüy discovered that both crystals are geometrically identical, and he asked chemist Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin for a chemical analysis.|$|E
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{connection}} of conspiracy theorists and occultists follows from their common <b>fallacious</b> premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what the Establishment spurns—must be true. The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} {{half of the}} Song dynasty (960–1279), the study of {{archaeology}} developed out of the antiquarian interests of the educated gentry and their desire to revive the use of ancient vessels in state rituals and ceremonies. This {{and the belief that}} ancient vessels were products of 'sages' and not common people was criticized by Shen Kuo, who discussed metallurgy, optics, astronomy, geometry, and ancient music measures in addition to archeology. His contemporary Ouyang Xiu (1007–1072) compiled an analytical catalogue of ancient rubbings on stone and bronze. In accordance with the beliefs of the later Leopold von Ranke (1795–1886), some Song gentry —such as Zhao Mingcheng (1081–1129)— valued archaeological evidence over historical works written after the fact, finding written records unreliable when they failed to match with the archaeological discoveries. Hong Mai (1123–1202) used ancient Han dynasty era vessels to debunk what he found to be <b>fallacious</b> descriptions of Han vessels in the Bogutu archaeological catalogue compiled during the latter half of Huizong's reign (1100–1125).|$|E
25|$|Popular {{perceptions}} of randomness are frequently mistaken, based on <b>fallacious</b> reasoning or intuitions.|$|E
25|$|Mark Colyvan, Jay Garfield and Graham Priest (2005) {{have argued}} that a theistic {{explanation}} for fine tuning is faulted due to <b>fallacious</b> probabilistic reasoning.|$|E
25|$|Flawed {{reasoning}} in arguments {{is known as}} <b>fallacious</b> reasoning. Bad reasoning within arguments can be because it commits either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy.|$|E
25|$|Critics of the multiverse-related {{explanations}} {{argue that}} there is no independent evidence that other universes exist. Some criticize the inference from fine-tuning for life to a multiverse as <b>fallacious</b> , whereas others defend it against that challenge.|$|E
25|$|In nature, events rarely {{occur with}} {{perfectly}} equal frequency, so observing outcomes {{to determine which}} events are more probable makes sense. It is <b>fallacious</b> to apply this logic to systems designed to make all outcomes equally likely, such as shuffled cards, dice, and roulette wheels.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{of ethical}} vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so {{consider}} {{the comparison of}} eating livestock with killing people to be <b>fallacious.</b> This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.|$|E
25|$|Russell Doolittle: Doolittle, upon whom Behe based {{much of his}} {{discussion}} of blood clotting, described it as misrepresenting a simplified explanation he had given in a lecture, and presenting a <b>fallacious</b> creationist miscalculation of improbability by omitting known options, which {{also contributed to the}} original publisher turning down the book for publication.|$|E
25|$|The psi {{assumption}} — The {{assumption that}} any statistical deviation from chance is evidence for telepathy is highly controversial. Strictly speaking, a deviation from chance is only evidence that either {{this was a}} rare, statistically unlikely occurrence that happened by chance, or something was causing a deviation from chance. Flaws in the experimental design are a common cause of this, and so the assumption {{that it must be}} telepathy is <b>fallacious.</b>|$|E
25|$|Historians have {{subsequently}} explained Chamberlain's {{policies in}} various ways. It {{could be said}} that he believed sincerely that the objectives of Hitler and Mussolini were limited and that the settlement of their grievances would protect the world from war; for safety, military and air power should be strengthened. Many have judged this belief to be <b>fallacious,</b> since the dictators' demands were not limited and appeasement gave them time to gain greater strength.|$|E
25|$|Penrose's {{argument}} {{stemmed from}} Gödel's incompleteness theorems. In Penrose's first book on consciousness, The Emperor's New Mind (1989), {{he argued that}} while a formal system cannot prove its own consistency, Gödel’s unprovable results are provable by human mathematicians. He took this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not formal proof systems and are not running a computable algorithm. According to Bringsjorg and Xiao, {{this line of reasoning}} is based on <b>fallacious</b> equivocation on the meaning of computation.|$|E
25|$|In other situations, {{facts about}} a group of study {{outcomes}} may be gathered and discussed {{in the form of a}} systematic research synthesis (SRS). A SRS can be more or less useful, depending on the evaluation protocol chosen, and errors in choice or use of a protocol have led to <b>fallacious</b> reports. The meaningfulness of a SRS report on an intervention is limited by the quality of the research under consideration, but SRS reports can be helpful to readers seeking to understand EBP-related choices.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Fodor {{attempts}} {{to establish that}} this theoretical paradigm is <b>fallacious</b> and misleading by demonstrating the impenetrability of perception to the background knowledge of subjects. The strongest case can be based on evidence from experimental cognitive psychology, namely the persistence of perceptual illusions. Knowing that the lines in the Müller-Lyer illusion are equal does not prevent one from continuing to see one line as being longer than the other. This impenetrability of the information elaborated by the mental modules limits the scope of interpretationalism.|$|E
25|$|The first work Huygens put {{in print}} was Theoremata de quadratura (1651) {{in the field}} of quadrature. It {{included}} material discussed with Mersenne some years before, such as the <b>fallacious</b> nature of the squaring of the circle by Grégoire de Saint-Vincent. His preferred methods were those of Archimedes and Fermat. Quadrature was a live issue in the 1650s, and through Mylon, Huygens intervened in the discussion of the mathematics of Thomas Hobbes. Persisting in trying to explain the errors Hobbes had fallen into, he made an international reputation.|$|E
25|$|Late in his life, Sagan's books {{elaborated}} on his skeptical, naturalistic {{view of the}} world. In The Demon-Haunted World, {{he presented}} tools for testing arguments and detecting <b>fallacious</b> or fraudulent ones, essentially advocating wide use of critical thinking and the scientific method. The compilation Billions and Billions: Thoughts on Life and Death at the Brink of the Millennium, published in 1997 after Sagan's death, contains essays written by Sagan, such as his views on abortion, and his widow Ann Druyan's account of his death as a skeptic, agnostic, and freethinker.|$|E
25|$|Both the holotype and paratype were {{recovered}} from disparate locations, both disarticulated and unassociated. Consequently, spatial relationships {{are impossible to}} determine. No record of the original orientation of the material even as recovered, exists. Further material assigned to the taxon has been recovered in isolation with no apparent spatial relationships to each other, and more or less {{has been referred to}} Protoavis spuriously. Thus, the presentation of the holotype and paratype as coherent skeletons by Chatterjee is <b>fallacious.</b> Such representations are ad hoc conglomerations of bone whose status as conspecific is not apparent from their taphonomy.|$|E
25|$|Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique}} of Marx's theories was put under intense scrutiny by Marxian economists, such as Nikolai Bukharin. In his Economic Theory of the Leisure Class (1927), Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk's axiomatic assumptions of individual freedom in his subjectivist theories are <b>fallacious</b> in that economic phenomena {{can only be}} understood under the prism of a coherent, contextualised, and historical analysis of society, such as Marx's. By contrast, Austrian economists have regarded Böhm-Bawerk's {{critique of}} Marx as definitive. For example, Gottfried Haberler argued Böhm-Bawerk's thorough critique of Marx's economics was so devastating that as of the 1960s no Marxian scholar had conclusively refuted it.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with this definitive statement, such scholars as Frederick Poulson, E.R. Dodds, Joseph Fontenrose, and Saul Levin all stated {{that there were}} no vapors and no chasm. For the decades to follow, scientists and scholars believed the ancient descriptions of a sacred, inspiring pneuma to be <b>fallacious.</b> During 1950, the French hellenist Pierre Amandry, who had worked at Delphi and later directed the French excavations there, concurred with Oppé's pronouncements, claiming that gaseous emissions were not even possible in a volcanic zone such as Delphi. Neither Oppé nor Amandry were geologists, though, and no geologists had been involved in the debate up to that point.|$|E
25|$|Sociobiologists have a {{different}} theory to Harris. Indeed, his theory and interest in the topic of infanticide is born of his more generalised opposition to the sociobiological hypothesis of the procreative imperative. According to this theory of imperative, based on the 19th-century vogue for explanations rooted in evolution and its premise of natural selection, the biological {{differences between men and}} women meant that many more children could be gained among the elites through support for male offspring, whose fecundity was naturally much greater: the line would spread and grow more extensively. Harris believes this to be a <b>fallacious</b> explanation because the elites had sufficient wealth easily to support both male and female children. Thus, Harris and others, such as William Divale, see female infanticide as a way to restrict population growth, while sociobiologists such as Mildred Dickemann view the same practice as a means of expanding it.|$|E
25|$|The League {{concerned}} {{itself with}} the issue of active believers who had infiltrated its own membership and who were trying to prove their loyalty to the regime or even undermine the antireligious work of the League. League members who suspected each other of harbouring religious beliefs secretly discussed their concerns in the early years. The League also had {{to address the issue of}} atheists in its membership who may have sympathized with the religious believers and who may have had doubts about what they were doing. In answer to these, the League adopted a policy that any League member who entered a church (to conduct antireligious work by checking on the strength of believers or numbering them) had to first receive local branch approval beforehand in order so that he did not give the impression that he was going to the church to pray. In contrast the League in Tashkent actually tried to translate the Quran into Uzbek so that more Muslims could read it, in hope that when Muslims were able to read what the Quran actually said, they would reject its content as <b>fallacious.</b>|$|E
500|$|..... {{it seems}} that it happens in the lordships and states of earthly dignitaries, that as they are at their highest peak, so {{presently}} does their decline and ruin follow, and not without the providence of divine justice, in order to punish sins and {{so that no one}} should place his trust in <b>fallacious</b> good fortune.|$|E
500|$|Bertrand Russell, {{during his}} early Hegelian phase, {{accepted}} the argument; he once exclaimed: [...] "Great God in Boots!—the ontological argument is sound!" [...] However, he later criticized the argument, asserting that [...] "the argument does not, {{to a modern}} mind, seem very convincing, but {{it is easier to}} feel convinced that it must be <b>fallacious</b> than it is to find out precisely where the fallacy lies." [...] He drew a distinction between existence and essence, arguing that the essence of a person can be described and their existence still remain in question.|$|E
500|$|Thea Hillman, an {{intersex}} {{activist and}} board member for the (now defunct) Intersex Society of North America (ISNA), {{wrote in the}} Lambda Book Report, 2002, {{that the combination of}} incest and intersex is [...] "inaccurate and misleading". Noting that incest is a loathed social taboo that has [...] "shameful, pathological and criminal repercussions", she criticized Eugenides for underscoring that Cal's intersex condition is due to incest. Hillman stated that this adds to the <b>fallacious</b> belief that intersex people are [...] "shameful and sick" [...] and a danger to society's wellbeing.|$|E
500|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered by Lord Diplock, the Privy Council rejected this interpretation, finding the Public Prosecutor's argument <b>fallacious.</b> Reading {{the definition of}} written law as stated in Article 2(1) together with Article 4, which provides that [...] "any law enacted by the Legislature after the commencement of this Constitution which is inconsistent with this Constitution shall, {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency, be void", their Lordships held that [...] "the use of the expression 'law' in Art 9(1) ... does not, in the event of challenge, relieve the court of its duty to determine whether the provisions of an Act of Parliament passed after 16 September 1963 and relied upon to justify depriving a person of his life or liberty are inconsistent with the Constitution and consequently void".|$|E
500|$|Published by Little, Brown and Company on November 18, 2008, Outliers debuted {{at number}} one on the bestseller lists for The New York Times in the United States and The Globe and Mail in Canada on November 28, 2008, holding the {{position}} on the former for eleven consecutive weeks. Between June 2011, when the paperback version was released, and February 2017, the book made the New York Times bestseller list for paperback nonfiction 232 times. As in his other books, Gladwell's engaging and vivid prose drew praise in Outliers, though Gladwell's methodology has been criticized for too often falling prey to <b>fallacious</b> reasoning, inadequate and anecdotally based sampling, and oversimplified analysis. [...] In particular, Anders Ericsson and coauthors who conducted the study upon the 10,000-Hour Rule was based have written in their book that Gladwell had overgeneralized, misinterpreted, and oversimplified their findings.|$|E
500|$|Drexler {{responded by}} {{publishing}} a rebuttal later in 2001 through the Institute for Molecular Manufacturing, which was co-authored with others including Robert Freitas, J. Storrs Hall, and Ralph Merkle. [...] The authors first discussed the [...] "fat fingers" [...] argument by attacking Smalley's {{notion that a}} chemical reaction must involve five to fifteen atoms, stating that many reactions involve only two reactants, one {{of which can be}} immobilized and the other attached to a single [...] "finger". They cited as evidence experimental and theoretical results indicating that using scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tips and related technologies {{could be used as a}} reactive structure for positional control and for interaction with surface-bound molecules. They also noted that atomically precise final products do not require precise control of all aspects of the chemical reaction. The authors noted that the [...] "sticky fingers" [...] problem is valid in some reactions, but argue that it would be <b>fallacious</b> to conclude that all reactions have this problem.|$|E
500|$|MacArthur {{was invited}} {{to speak at the}} 51st National Encampment of the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Chicago on 26 August 1950. He {{declined}} the invitation, but instead sent a statement that could be read out aloud, in which he contradicted Truman's policy towards the island of Formosa, saying: [...] "Nothing could be more <b>fallacious</b> than the threadbare argument by those who advocate appeasement and defeatism in the Pacific that if we defend Formosa we alienate continental Asia." [...] Truman was infuriated by the word [...] "appeasement," [...] and discussed the possibility of relieving MacArthur with Secretary of Defense Louis A. Johnson. Johnson responded that MacArthur was [...] "one of the greatest, if not the greatest generals of our generation." [...] Truman told Johnson to send MacArthur an order withdrawing his statement, which he did; but it had already been read into Congressional Record. As it turned out, it was not MacArthur who was relieved, but Johnson. Truman had become irritated with Johnson's conflict with Secretary of State Acheson, and although he had said that Johnson would remain his Secretary of Defense for [...] "as long as I am President," [...] he asked Johnson for his resignation. Publicly, Johnson received much of the blame for the defense cuts that had led to the lack of preparedness and consequent early defeats in Korea. He was replaced by General of the Army George Marshall.|$|E
500|$|Prescott {{expressed}} interest in his correspondence in writing a biography of Molière, and Ticknor records that he sent Prescott [...] "a collection of about 50 volumes" [...] of relevant material. However, after writing to Ángel Calderón de la Barca, a Spanish minister living in Mexico, {{who was able to}} provide source material, Prescott started research on what was to become the History of the Conquest of Mexico. He extensively read the works of Alexander von Humboldt, who had written on Mesoamerica, and started corresponding with the historian Washington Irving, the Swiss writer Sismondi and the French historian Jacques Nicolas Augustin Thierry. [...] He also received assistance in collecting sources from a college friend, Middleton, and a Dr. Lembke. In contrast to the lengthy time spent researching the History of Ferdinand and Isabella, Prescott started drafting the History of the Conquest of Mexico in October 1839. However, Prescott faced difficulties in writing the work which he had not encountered previously. There was relatively little scholarship on Aztec civilization, and Prescott dismissed much of it as [...] "speculation", [...] and he therefore had to rely almost exclusively on primary sources (with the exception of Humboldt). In particular, he considered Edward King's theory that the pre-Columbian civilizations were non-indigenous to be <b>fallacious,</b> although he was greatly indebted to him for his anthology of Aztec codices in the Antiquities of Mexico. Prescott also studied Spanish writers contemporary to the conquest, most significantly Torquemada and Toribio de Benavente.|$|E
500|$|The Scott myth {{lasted until}} the final quarter of the 20thcentury, when it was {{replaced}} by one that characterised him as a [...] "heroic bungler" [...] whose failure was largely {{the result of his}} own mistakes. This portrayal, the cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski asserts, is as <b>fallacious</b> as the earlier one in which he was considered beyond criticism. In the early 21stcentury, writers have suggested more reasoned explanations for the Scott tragedy than his incompetence, and his reputation has to some extent been rescued. The renewed spotlight on Scott has also highlighted Amundsen's achievements: Barczewski writes that [...] "Amundsen and his men reached the pole due to a combination of superb planning, long experience with sledge-dogs and skis and impressive physical stamina". In her account of Scott's expedition, Diana Preston is equally specific in identifying the basis of Amundsen's success. He was focused on the single goal of reaching the pole, whereas Scott had to reconcile the competing claims of geographical exploration and scientific knowledge. [...] "A practical and experienced professional, [...] planned carefully and applied all the lessons he had learned in the Arctic... e relied exclusively on the well-tried means of transport and unsentimentally exploited their food potential. He was similarly efficient and unsentimental in his management of his men". The United States' scientific base at the South Pole, founded in 1957, is named the Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station, to honour the memories of both polar pioneers.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, argumentation theorists (especially Sheldon Wein) have {{suggested}} that, frequently, when people advocate adopting a zero tolerance policy, they commit {{what he has}} called the [...] "zero tolerance fallacy". Subsequently, Wein has proposed standards which arguments for zero tolerance policies must meet {{in order to avoid}} such <b>fallacious</b> inferences.|$|E
2500|$|The back {{reaction}} of the medium is an determinant of source motion. In many important cases, linear thinking (small cause = small effect) is <b>fallacious.</b> Unstable fluid motion or the sound generated by it can feedback to the source and control it, much like audio feedback squeal. The basic requirements for a feedback controlled system are: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Judgment of Solomon is a {{story from}} the Hebrew Bible in which King Solomon of Israel ruled between two women both {{claiming}} to be {{the mother of a}} child. [...] He tricked the parties into revealing their true feelings by using a <b>fallacious</b> appeal to moderation. Some consider it an archetypal example of an impartial judge displaying wisdom in making a ruling.|$|E
2500|$|This story {{concerns}} a 20th-century United States Navy cadet named David Lamb who {{rises in the}} ranks while avoiding any semblance of real work by applying himself enthusiastically {{to the principle of}} [...] "constructive laziness". Shortly after telling the story Lazarus mistakenly calls David [...] "Donald", which is intended to make the reader think the story is <b>fallacious,</b> while actually pertaining to Lazarus directly.|$|E
