5|$|Academic reviewers {{were mostly}} positive, but several raised {{concerns}} over Berger's incorrect use of terminology. Reviewers noted the study's importance in developing Pagan studies {{as an academic}} discipline and helping further the wider sociological investigation into new religious movements in the United States. In the years following the study's publication, Berger continued to investigate the Pagan community, focusing <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> on the popularity of Wicca among teenagers.|$|E
5|$|At 12 {{years of}} age, she left home {{and began to}} work for a wealthy {{neighboring}} family, performing chores on their farm. She continued to keep house, cook and sew for wealthy families for 15 years.

5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation {{and descriptions of}} people and places that inspired her. By {{the time of her}} third book, Italian Food, David had begun to add sections {{about the history of the}} cuisine and the particular dishes that she wrote about. <b>Her</b> <b>interest</b> in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, baking, and ice.|$|E

Throughout her lifetime she was noted for <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the lives of}} the soldiers. The flirtatious Maria had a number of innocent crushes on the young men she met, beginning in early childhood. She hoped to marry and have a large family.|$|E

5|$|She {{traveled}} to Utah in 1901 {{for a visit}} with Mormon president Joseph F. Smith, a former missionary to the Hawaiian Island. There she joined in services at the Salt Lake Tabernacle, and was feted at a Beehive House reception, attended by many expatriate Native Hawaiians.

5|$|The {{magazine}} {{lasted for}} 5 issues {{in its first}} incarnation, and for another 20 in the revived version from Popular Publications. Mary Gnaedinger edited both series; <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in reprinting Merritt's work helped make {{him one of the}} better-known fantasy writers of the era. A Canadian edition from 1948 to 1951 reprinted 17 issues of the second series; two others were reprinted in Great Britain in 1950 and 1951.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Meehan & Sons of Philadelphia {{designed}} the English Garden in 1910. It was first {{known as the}} Wisteria Garden. In 1925, Ninah attended a lecture on azaleas given by H. Harold Hume, a horticulturist known for his work with azaleas, camellias, and citrus. This lecture sparked <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in azaleas, so she visited azalea gardens in Charleston, South Carolina for inspiration. Advised by Hume, she replanted much of her English garden with them, renaming it the Azalea Garden.|$|E

5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with were coming to terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|While Carey's {{new musical}} {{direction}} caused tension {{between her and}} Columbia, it began to severely strain {{her relationship with her}} husband at the time, Tommy Mottola. Mottola had always been involved in Carey's career, because he was the head of Sony Music, the parent company of her label. Since the time of Carey's debut, Mottola had controlled nearly every aspect of her career, keeping her sound carefully regulated and insisting that she continue recording middle-of-the-road pop music, despite <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in hip hop.|$|E
5|$|William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, who was prime {{minister}} when Victoria {{came to the}} throne and a political mentor to the young queen, was forty years her senior, but is portrayed as a much younger man in the film. As for King Leopold, he was her favourite uncle whose advice she constantly sought; <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in Albert was due not to the latter's success in wooing her, but simply to please Leopold.|$|E

5|$|A doctor {{performed}} an autopsy and showed Eddy her husband's diseased heart, but she responded by giving more interviews about mesmerism. Fraser {{wrote that the}} articles made Eddy a household name, a real-life version of the charismatic and beautiful Verena Tarrant in Henry James's The Bostonians (1885–1886), with <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in spiritualism, women's rights and the mind cure. Shortly after the death, Eddy moved next door to 571 Columbus Avenue with several students. The following year, 1883, she founded the Journal of Christian Science (later called the Christian Science Journal), which spread news of her ideas across the United States.|$|E
5|$|At Giles' {{apartment}} Xander and Anya argue, as Anya {{is trying}} to get Xander to tell her what she means to him. He is unable to answer her. Willow attends a meeting of the campus Wicca group, hoping to meet others who share <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in studying witchcraft, but is disappointed when they only talk about bake sales. Willow raises the subject of spells but is chastised for pandering to the stereotype about witches performing magic. A shy woman in the group, Tara Maclay, starts to speak up to support Willow's suggestion, but falls silent when the attention turns to her.|$|E
5|$|Azalea also envisioned an Eastern {{theme for}} the music video because of the song's Eastern music {{influences}} and <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in Bollywood films. BRTHR wrote a Hindu wedding scenario for the video, with Azalea as the bride. At Azalea's request, the video was filmed in Mumbai's streets and slums, and on Bollywood sets. Because of the increased cost of filming on location, Azalea decided to personally contribute to the video's budget. T.I. was scheduled {{to appear in the}} music video, but was unable due to visa delays. Azalea's stylist, Alejandra Hernandez, coordinated the rapper's wardrobe, inspired by Bollywood disco era and Indian actress Parveen Babi. Hernandez used bold-coloured saris in the video; she prepared Azalea's wardrobe in Los Angeles, and her creations were made in London and Mumbai. Azalea's jewelry was also purchased in Mumbai.|$|E

5|$|During World War I, Mackinnon {{worked in}} {{military}} hospitals in Britain, researching {{and helping to}} diagnose amoebic dysentery. Her work in the military hospitals fuelled <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in the topic, which she focussed on during the following years. In 1919, Mackinnon joined King's College, London as a lecturer and became Chair of Zoology in 1927, the first female Chair at the college. She remained in the role as Chair and professor for 22 years. Her research work focussed on parasitic protozoa, and she gave many lectures on the subject over the period of 30 years. She also gave broadcast lectures for schools.|$|E
5|$|During {{her second}} year, Geiling was {{retained}} by the FDA to research unusual deaths related to elixir sulfanilamide, a sulfonamide medicine. Kelsey assisted on this research project, {{which showed that}} the 107 deaths were caused {{by the use of}} diethylene glycol as a solvent. The next year, the United States Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. That same year she completed her studies and received a Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of Chicago. Working with Geiling led to <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in teratogens, drugs that cause congenital malformations (birth defects).|$|E
5|$|During {{their time}} at Stowe House, Day {{introduced}} Sabrina {{to members of}} the local intellectual circle, including the priest at Lichfield Cathedral, Thomas Seward. Seward and his wife hoped that Day might be a suitor for their daughter, Anna, and Anna's writings of the time show <b>her</b> <b>interest</b> in Day. Anna was also enchanted by Sabrina, who became the link between Day and the Seward family. Anna took a keen interest in Sabrina's story, as her father had taken in Honora Sneyd when Sneyd's mother had died.|$|E
