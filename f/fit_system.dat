The E. coli <b>fit</b> <b>system</b> consists of six genes designated fitA, -B, -C, -D, -E, and -R. Based on DNA sequence analysis, fit encodes an outer membrane protein (FitA), a periplasmic binding protein (FitE), two permease proteins (FitC and -D), an ATPase (FitB), and a hypothetical protein (FitR). Introduction of the E. coli <b>fit</b> <b>system</b> into E. coli strain K- 12 increased intracellular iron content and transformed bacteria were {{more sensitive to}} streptonigrin, which suggested that fit transports iron in E. coli.

40|$|Background: Cortactin is a {{classical}} Src kinase substrate that participates in actin cytoskeletal dynamics by activating the Arp 2 / 3 complex and interacting with other regulatory proteins, including FAK. Cortactin has various domains that {{may contribute to}} the assembly of different protein platforms to achieve process specificity. Though the protein is known to be regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, how tyrosine phosphorylation regulates cortactin activity is poorly understood. Since the basal level of tyrosine phosphorylation is low, this question must be studied using stimulated cell cultures, which are physiologically relevant but unreliable and difficult to work with. In fact, their unreliability may be the cause of some contradictory findings about the dynamics of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in different processes. Methodology/Principal Findings: In the present study, we try to overcome these problems by using a Functional Interaction Trap (<b>FIT)</b> <b>system,</b> which involves cotransfecting cells with a kinase (Src) and a target protein (cortactin), both of which are fused to complementary leucine-zipper domains. The <b>FIT</b> <b>system</b> allowed us to control precisely the tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and explore its relationship with cortactin acetylation. Conclusions/Significance: Using this system, we provide definitive evidence that a competition exists between acetylation and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and that phosphorylation inhibits cell spreading.

40|$|The European Union {{has adopted}} {{targets for the}} {{expanded}} use of renewable energies (REs) as one mean to achieve improved energy security, reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and improved competitiveness of the European economies. Realising that rapid expansion of RE will not happen in the energy market place, as it now exists, various support mechanisms are under consideration, most prominently these may be grouped into two major categories, tradable green certificates (TGC) and feed-in tariffs (FiT). Experiences {{from a number of}} countries in Europe suggest that FiT deliver larger and faster penetration of RE than TGC, at lower cost. The two major systems are compared in overall terms. In a TGC system, a target for RE penetration is set by public authorities seeking to minimise cost for achieving this target. The certificate price is set by the market. In a <b>FiT</b> <b>system,</b> public authorities set an effective price but are not limiting the quantity installed. This has led to impressive growth rates, particularly in Denmark, Germany, and Spain. It is found that investor risks are much lower in a <b>FiT</b> <b>system,</b> and that innovation incentives are larger. Against this background, the European Commission proposal for an EU-wide TGC system is discussed. It is found that such a system is likely to be less effective and less efficient than maintaining national FiT systems, and that it also risks time-consuming legal processes during which investor uncertainties would risk a marked slow-down in investments. Given the underlying objective of addressing security, climate change and competitiveness, it therefore appears that, {{at least for the time}} being, continued reliance on national systems, especially FiT would be preferred.

The result showed that about 60 % of the currently operating mega solar plants (as of May, 2014) had investors from outside of the region, such as major companies. Since the <b>FIT</b> <b>system</b> assures income for the investors, the high ratio of outside investors means that the citizens' electricity charges in the region flow out to other regions and have little contribution to the local economies.

Here, we use genetic code reprogramming through a flexible in-vitro translation (<b>FIT)</b> <b>system</b> to investigate how mutations in tRNAPro affect EF-P function. We show that the 9 -nt D-loop closed by the stable D-stem sequence in tRNAPro is a crucial recognition determinant for EF-P. Such D-arm structures are shared only among the tRNAPro isoacceptors and tRNAfMet in Escherichia coli, and the D-arm of tRNAfMet is essential for EF-P-induced acceleration of fMetâpuromycin formation. Thus, the activity of EF-P is controlled by recognition elements in the tRNA D-arm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract â Multi-core {{programming}} presents developers with {{a dramatic}} paradigm shift. Whereas sequential programming largely allowed the decoupling of source from underlying architecture, it is now impossible to develop new patterns and abstractions in isolation from issues of modern hardware utilization. Synchronization and coordination are now manifested {{at all levels of}} the software stack, and developers currently lack the essential tools to even partially automate reasoning techniques and system configuration management. As a first stage to addressing this problem, this paper proposes a framework for a tool suite designed to partially automate the acquisition and management of static system visualization in a feedback loop with dynamic execution properties. This model enables developers to find a best <b>fit</b> <b>system</b> configuration, potentially reconciling resource contention and utilization tensions that are critical to multi-core platforms.
