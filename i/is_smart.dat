In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber <b>is</b> <b>smart</b> {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E

She invites Otonashi to join the SSS, an organization she founded and leads which fights against God. She <b>is</b> <b>smart</b> and decisive when making operations and decisions. She carries a silver Beretta 92.

500|$|He next {{played the}} protagonist in the English {{language}} art film, Being Cyrus (2006), co-starring alongside Naseeruddin Shah and Dimple Kapadia. Directed by debutant Homi Adajania, the psychological drama revolves around a dysfunctional Parsi family with who Khan's character moves into. The film received predominantly positive reviews, and Khan was particularly praised. Later in the year, he portrayed {{the character of}} Iago in Omkara, the Indian adaptation of William Shakespeare's Othello. Directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, the film is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set {{against the backdrop of}} the political system in Uttar Pradesh.

Omkara was received positively by critics, and Khan went on to receive major acclaim earning the awards for Best Performance in a Negative Role at the Filmfare, Screen, Zee Cine and IIFA ceremonies; his performance was later included in the 2010 issue of the [...] "Top 80 Iconic Performances" [...] by Filmfare. Variety described it as a [...] "powerhouse performance" [...] and wrote that [...] "t is Khan's movie through and through, in a performance of rugged, contained malevolence which trades on his previous screen persona as a likable best friend as well as his stint as the manipulative outsider in Being Cyrus.

The three Carlin {{siblings}} start at King High School, where they each try to fit in. Glen (Chris Hunter), a talented basketball player, tries out for the school basketball team, upsetting the star player Aiden Dennison (Matt Cohen) and his cheerleader girlfriend Madison Duarte (Valery Ortiz).

Glen's sister Spencer (Gabrielle Christian) joins the cheerleading squad but ends up doing little more than take orders from Madison. She befriends the rebellious Ashley, but when Ashley indicates her interest in girls, Spencer starts to avoid her, only to admit later that she enjoyed their time spent together. That night, though, she dreams of being taunted by the cheerleaders and called gay, although she denies it. Glen and Spencer's adopted African American brother Clay (Danso Gordon) <b>is</b> <b>smart</b> but naïve, and he finds himself facing the racial tensions of LA that he never experienced in Ohio.

500|$|Michelle Erica Green, who {{reviewed}} the episode for TrekNation in May 2007, {{thought she might}} be more forgiving in hindsight as she knows that the follow-ups to [...] "Datalore" [...] were great episodes. She thought it was reminiscent of the evil twin of Captain James T. Kirk in [...] episode [...] "" [...] and the mirror universe version of Spock seen in [...] "". She felt that Lore lacked any motivation for what he was intending to do, and that the crew were made to look [...] "pretty stupid" [...] by their inaction to the Lore threat. She thought that the ending was shocking, as transporting the villain into space would never have occurred if they were human, and [...] "a moment of utter inconsistency" [...] as Lore had only just told the entity to attack when the shields drop following a transporter activation. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] valued the episode for providing backstory to Data, but said that [...] "no one <b>is</b> <b>smart</b> enough to realize the obvious. None of the crew except Boy Wesley realizes that Lore is impersonating Data — and when Wesley (who is always somehow more observant than the silly adults) brings this to their attention, we get helpful lines like, [...] "Shut up, Wesley," [...] which lead to even more helpful lines of would-be teenage rebellion when Wesley complains about the officers not listening to him. Quite simply, this is annoying material, continuing in season one's trend of Wesley's child status as a plot device. Meanwhile, all the adults look terminally clueless." [...] He gave the episode a score of three out of four.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} years of her career, Cyrus had a {{generally}} wholesome image as a teen idol. Her fame increased dramatically following the Vanity Fair photo scandal, and it was reported that photos of Cyrus could be shopped for $2,000 apiece. In the following years, Cyrus' image continued to shift dramatically, differing from her previous teen idol status. Donny Osmond wrote of Cyrus' transition into adulthood: [...] "Miley will have to face adulthood..... As she does, she'll want to change her image, and that change will be met with adversity." [...] The release of Can't Be Tamed (2010) saw Cyrus officially attempting to distance herself from her teenage years, releasing controversial music videos for her songs [...] "Can't Be Tamed" [...] (2010) and [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] (2010). Her behavior generated a considerable amount of controversy throughout 2013 and 2014, though godmother Dolly Parton stated [...] "...the girl can write. The girl can sing. The girl <b>is</b> <b>smart.</b> And she doesn't have to be so drastic. But I will respect her choices. I did it my way, so why can't she do it her way?" [...] Cyrus was placed at number seventeen on Forbes' list of the most powerful celebrities in 2014, with the magazine noting that [...] "The last time she made our list was when she was still rolling in Hannah Montana money. Now the pop singer is all grown up and courting controversy at every turn." [...] In August 2014, it was reported that Bluewater Productions has documented her life in a comic book called Fame: Miley Cyrus, starting with her controversial 2013 MTV Video Music Awards performance to her Disney fame, and exploring her childhood in Tennessee.

500|$|Observing {{that the}} show's main {{characters}} are each {{based on a}} stereotype, Jonathan Bernstein of The Daily Telegraph identified Rachel as [...] "the self-absorbed one who goes from riches to rags." [...] According to Reign Magazine, Rachel is [...] "a human being full of vulnerability, humor and strength while aesthetically donning an undeniable beauty and allure." [...] Originally depicted as a character who is unprepared for [...] "the world as an adult", Rachel's personality was gradually tailored to suit Aniston as the series progressed, becoming [...] "more self-sufficient and sympathetic." [...] According to Shining in the Shadows: Movie Stars of the 2000s author Murray Pomerance, [...] "The more boundary collapsed between the 'real' Jennifer Aniston and Rachel, the more 'authentic' Aniston became." [...] Pomerance {{also noted that the}} character's [...] "well-roundedness, normalcy and relatability" [...] is similar to Aniston's, while both the character and the actress herself are very expressive, talking [...] "with [...] hands a good deal." [...] In her book How To Write For Television, author Madeline Dimaggio wrote that although [...] "Rachel grew {{within the context of the}} series ... she would always struggle with the spoiled, image-conscious Daddy's girl who fled from her wedding in the pilot." [...] Similarly, BuddyTV wrote that although Rachel [...] "eventually evolves into being less absorbed in later series, she [...] the most image-centric among the six", while Vogues Edward Barsamian opined, [...] "She might have been self-centered and bratty, but Rachel Green was perhaps the most stylish and unabashedly fashion-obsessed character on the show." [...] TV Land summarized the character's arc and development in the website's biography of her, writing, [...] "Rachel is a born shopper, but... she’s not necessarily a born worker. In fact, before moving in with Monica, she’s never had to work at all, thanks to the generosity of her parents. Luckily, Rachel <b>is</b> <b>smart,</b> resourceful and chic, so her future is bright, both as a member of the workforce and with her newfound tribe." [...] Examining the character's sexuality, Splitsider's Mike D'Avria determined that Rachel has had the third most sexual partners, 14, as well as the highest percentage of serious monogamous relationships at 71%. D'Avria opined, [...] "Throughout the whole series Rachel is continually meeting men she wants to impress. Her flirtations typically fail, but she somehow winds up in a serious relationship with them." [...] Additionally, Rachel is also the only character to admit to having had a homosexual experience.|$|E
500|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{several of}} whom voiced their {{preference for the}} character over her predecessor, Ariel from The Little Mermaid.

[...] Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, [...] "there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant," [...] while Boxoffice scribed, [...] "Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the cute little 'Mermaid' Ariel {{was nothing more than}} a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty—aptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a [...] "smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal'," [...] while crowning her the [...] "main attraction of Beauty and the Beast." [...] Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as [...] "a feminist heroine who [...] more rounded than previous Disney characters", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's [...] "feminist kick." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that [...] "Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a real live girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda." [...] TV Guide wrote that [...] "The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle," [...] concluding, [...] "Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle <b>is</b> <b>smart,</b> knows what she wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince." [...] Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her [...] "the hero" [...] of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, [...] "Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul." [...] TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] heroine, crediting the character for [...] "break Disney's passive-princess mold." [...] About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an [...] "admirable" [...] heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as [...] "three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story," [...] and Seibert calling Belle a [...] "strong female character" [...] who [...] "sidesteps most of the clichés surrounding Disney heroines."
