40|$|In {{order to}} harness the {{enormous}} potential of schemes in optical quantum information processing, readily scalable photonic circuits will be required. A major obstacle for this scalability is the monolithic integration of quantum light sources with the photonic circuit on a single chip. This dissertation presents the experimental demonstration of different in-plane single photon sources that allow for this integration with planar light circuits. To this end, the spontaneous recombination of excitons in single indium arsenide quantum dots was exploited to generate single photons. The emission into on-chip waveguides was achieved {{by the use of}} advanced two-dimensional photonic crystal structures. First, slow-light effects in a unidirectional photonic crystal waveguide were exploited to achieve on-demand single photon emission with a rate of up to 18. 7 MHz, corresponding to a remarkable estimated internal device efficiency of up to 47 %. Waveguide-coupled L 3 defect cavities with record Q-factors of up to 5150 were then studied for improved Purcell enhancement of the emission, and in-plane single photon generation from such a device was demonstrated. Finally, an electrically tunable, integrable quantum light source with a total tuning range of 1. 9 nm was demonstrated by exploiting the quantum-confined Stark effect in an <b>electrical</b> <b>PIN</b> diode. These results are the first demonstrations of in-plane single photon emission at optical wavelengths and mark an important cornerstone for the realisation of fully integrated quantum photonic circuits in optical quantum information science...|$|E
40|$|Background: Radiotherapy {{is based}} on the premise of {{accurate}} dose delivery to target volumes within a patient, while minimizing dose to surrounding tissues. Recent developments in the treatment of breast cancer have focused on “gating” the delivery of the treatment beams to minimize the effect of patient motion during treatment, and increasing separation between the target volume and organs at risk (OAR), such as lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery. The basic principle involves rapidly switching the treatment beam on or off depending on the patient breathing cycle. It is therefore important to know the characteristics of gated treatments such as latency. Methods: In this work an <b>electrical</b> <b>PIN</b> diode circuit (EPDC) was designed for quality assurance (QA) purposes to examine beam latency timing properties. Evaluation of the EPDC was performed on a TrueBeam™ (Varian, Palo Alto) linear accelerator and its internal gating system. The EPDC was coupled to a moving stage to simulate a binary pattern with fast beam triggering within predefined limits, the so called “gating window”. Pulses of radiation were measured with the PIN diode and the results were compared to measurements of current produced across the linac target. Processing of the beam pulses and calculation of the latency timings was performed by an Atmega 328 P microcontroller. Results: For beam-on latencies, 2. 11 ms (6 MV) and 2. 12 ms (10 MV) were measured using the PIN diode, compared to 2. 13 ms (6 MV) and 2. 15 ms (10 MV) using the target current signal. For beam-off latencies, 57. 69 ms (6 MV) and 57. 73 ms (10 MV) were measured using the PIN diode, compared to 57. 33 ms (6 MV) and 56. 01 ms (10 MV) using the target current. Conclusions: PIN diodes can be used for accurate determination of the beam-on and beam-off latency characteristics, which could potentially lead to improvements in gated radiotherapy treatments, for example optimizing the gating windows and in estimating dosimetric errors associated with treatment beam latencies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} pin-constrained electrowetting-ondielectric (EWOD) biochips becomes {{a serious issue}} to realize complex bio-chemical operations. Due to limited number of control pins and routing resources, {{additional}} Printed Circuit Board (PCB) routing layers may be required which poten-tially raises the fabrication cost. Previous state-of-the-art work has tried to develop a framework that uses a network-flow-based method for broadcast electrodeaddressing EWOD biochips. Nevertheless, greedily merging of <b>electrical</b> <b>pins</b> in previous works is {{at high risk of}} producing unroutable design. Routability should have higher priority than pin reduction. While previous works dedicated their effort on pin reduction, we have addressed our attention on routability of broadcast addressing. Experimental results demonstrate that taking routability into consideration can even have higher pin reduction. Viewed in this light, we present ACER, a routability driven clustering algorithm followed by escape routing using integer linear programming that effectively solves both pin merging and routing in broadcast addressing framework. Our proposed algorithm does not greedily focus on pin-reduction. Instead, routability is taken into consideration through agglomerative clustering. Compared to previous state-of-the-art, our proposed algorithm can further reduce required control pins by an average of 13 % and route the design using 68 % less wirelength.

In order to model the temperature and velocity field inside a wrapped fuel assembly under unblocked and blocked conditions, a detailed experimental campaign as well as 3 D thermal hydraulic analyses of the fuel assembly are required. The present paper is focused on the CFD modeling and preliminary computational analysis of the new experimental facility „Blocked‟ Fuel Pin bundle Simulator (BFPS) that will be inserted in the heavy liquid metal NACIE-UP (NAtural CIrculation Experiment-UPgrade) facility located at the ENEA Brasimone Research Center (Italy). The BFPS test section aims to carry out suitable experiments to fully investigate different flow blockage regimes in a 19 -pin fuel bundle providing experimental data in support of the development of the ALFRED (Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator) LFR DEMO. The BFPS test section, LBE cooled, was conceived with a thermal power of about 250 kW and a wall heat flux up to 0. 7 MW/m 2, which are relevant values for a LFR. It consists of 19 grid-spaced <b>electrical</b> <b>pins</b> placed on a hexagonal lattice with a pitch to diameter ratio of 1. 4 and a diameter of 10 mm.
