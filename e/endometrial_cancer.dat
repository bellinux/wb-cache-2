5|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{can also}} cause <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> Overall, hereditary causes contribute to 2–10% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> cases. Lynch syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that mainly causes colorectal cancer, also causes <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> especially before menopause. Women with Lynch syndrome have a 40–60%risk of developing <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> higher than their risk of developing colorectal (bowel) or ovarian cancer. Ovarian and <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> develop simultaneously in 20% of people. <b>Endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> nearly always develops before colon cancer, on average, 11years before. Carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome comes from a mutation in MLH1 and/or MLH2: genes that participate {{in the process of}} mismatch repair, which allows a cell to correct mistakes in the DNA. Other genes mutated in Lynch syndrome include MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2, which are also mismatch repair genes. Women with Lynch syndrome represent 2–3% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> cases; some sources place this as high as 5%. Depending on the gene mutation, women with Lynch syndrome have different risks of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> With MLH1 mutations, the risk is 54%; with MSH2, 21%; and with MSH6, 16%.|$|E
5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> Previously having ovarian cancer is a risk factor for <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Women with {{a family}} history of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable to the use of tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
40|$|Aims: Mismatch repair gene {{malfunction}} occurs {{early in}} the carcinogenesis of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancers (HNPCCs), leading to an accelerated accumulation of mutations and possibly to change in expression of cell cycle proteins. There is strong evidence that tumorigenesis in HNPCCs differs from sporadic ones. HNPCC-related <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> are less well studied. Our aim was to compare expression of cell cycle and apoptosis-related proteins in relation to proliferation and apoptosis in HNPCC-related and sporadic <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> to identify differences in their carcinogenetic pathways. Methods and results: Eighteen HNPCC-related <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers,</b> each matched by tumour type, stage and grade with two sporadic <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers,</b> were examined for proliferation, apoptosis and the expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptors, cyclin B 1, D 3 and E, p 21, p 27, bcl- 2, bax, p 53 and COX- 2. No differences in proliferation or apoptotic indices were detected between HNPCC-related and sporadic <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers.</b> Cyclin B 1 expression was significantly higher in HNPCC-related cancers than in sporadic <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers.</b> More HNPCC-related <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> had total loss of bax expression. Conclusions: Apart from differences in cyclin B 1 and bax expression, HNPCC-related and sporadic <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> are comparable. The subtle differences detected {{are consistent with the}} minor clinical diversity between HNPCC-related and sporadic <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

5|$|PTEN and p27 loss of {{function}} mutations {{are associated with a}} good prognosis, particularly in obese women. The Her2/neu oncogene, which indicates a poor prognosis, is expressed in 20% of endometrioid and serous carcinomas. CTNNB1 (beta-catenin; a transcription gene) mutations are found in 14–44% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> and may indicate a good prognosis, but the data is unclear. Beta-catenin mutations are commonly found in <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> with squamous cells. FGFR2 mutations are found in approximately 10% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers,</b> and their prognostic significance is unclear. SPOP is another tumor suppressor gene found to be mutated in some cases of endometrial cancer: 9% of clear cell endometrial carcinomas and 8% of serous endometrial carcinomas have mutations in this gene.|$|R
5|$|<b>Endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> appears most {{frequently}} during perimenopause (the period just before, just after, and during menopause), {{between the ages}} of 50 and 65; overall, 75% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> occurs after menopause. Women younger than 40 make up 5% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> cases and 10–15% of cases occur in women under 50years of age. This age group is at risk for developing ovarian cancer at the same time. The worldwide median age of diagnosis is 63years of age; in the United States, the average age of diagnosis is 60years of age. White American women are at higher risk for <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> than black American women, with a 2.88% and 1.69% lifetime risk respectively. Japanese-American women and American Latina women have a lower rates and Native Hawaiian women have higher rates.|$|E
5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> High blood pressure is also a risk factor, but {{this may be because}} of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and insulin resistance are risk factors for TypeI <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> Obesity increases the risk for <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> by 300–400%.|$|E

30|$|While {{sporadic}} <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> {{that have}} microsatellite instability are almost exclusively of endometrioid type, usually well to moderately differentiated, {{those related to}} LS tend to be histologically more diverse also occurring non-endometrioid carcinomas, including serous, clear cell and undifferentiated ones, although the majority is still of endometrioid type [38, 43]. LS-related <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> also show a predilection for the lower uterine segment, with up to one-third of these tumours arising in this location [44 – 46].|$|R
5|$|Vaginal {{bleeding}} or spotting {{in women}} after menopause occurs in 90% of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> Bleeding is especially common with adenocarcinoma, occurring in {{two-thirds of all}} cases. Abnormal menstrual cycles or extremely long, heavy, or frequent episodes of bleeding in women before menopause {{may also be a}} sign of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cancers can be {{analyzed}} using genetic techniques (including DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry) to determine if certain therapies specific to mutated genes {{can be used to}} treat it. PARP inhibitors are used to treat <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> with PTEN mutations, specifically, mutations that lower the expression of PTEN. The PARP inhibitor shown to be active against <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> is olaparib. Research is ongoing in this area as of the 2010s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{a cancer}} that {{arises from the}} {{endometrium}} (the lining of the uterus or womb). It {{is the result of}} the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. The first sign is most often vaginal bleeding not associated with a menstrual period. Other symptoms include pain with urination, pain during sexual intercourse, or pelvic pain. <b>Endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> occurs most commonly after menopause.|$|E
40|$|The colorectum and uterine {{endometrium}} are the {{two most}} commonly affected organs in hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), but the genetic basis of organ selection is poorly understood. As tumorigenesis in HNPCC is driven by deficient DNA mismatch repair (MMR), we compared its typical consequence, instability at microsatellite sequences, in colorectal and <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> from patients with identical predisposing mutations in the MMR genes MLH 1 or MSH 2. Analysis of non-coding (BAT 25, BAT 26, and BAT 40) and coding mononucleotide repeats (MSH 6, MSH 3, MLH 3, BAX, IGF 2 R, TGF beta RII, and PTEN), as well as MLH 1 - and MSH 2 -linked dinucleotide repeats (D 3 S 1611 and CA 7) revealed significant differences, both quantitative and qualitative, between the two tumor types. Whereas colorectal cancers displayed a predominant pattern consisting of instability at the BAT loci (in 89 % of tumors), TGF beta RII (73 %), dinucleotide repeats (70 %), MSH 3 (43 %), and BAX (30 %), no such single pattern was discernible in <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers.</b> Instead, the pattern was more heterogeneous and involved a lower proportion of unstable markers per tumor (mean 0. 27 for <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> versus 0. 45 for colorectal cancers, P < 0. 001) and shorter allelic shifts for BAT markers (average 5. 1 bp for unstable <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> versus 9. 3 bp for colorectal cancers, P < 0. 001). Among the individual putative "target" loci, PTEN instability was associated with <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers</b> and TGF beta RII instability with colon cancers. The different instability profiles in <b>endometrial</b> and colorectal <b>cancers</b> despite identical genetic predisposition underlines organ-specific differences that may be important determinants of the HNPCC tumor spectrum...|$|R

40|$|Background: Angiogenesis is {{essential}} for development, growth and advancement of solid tumors. During angiogenesis, ETS- 1 is strongly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and the adjacent inter-stitial cells, while the inhibition of ETS- 1 expression leads to suppression of angiogenesis. This prompted us to study the clinical implications of ETS- 1 in relation to angiogenesis in uterine endo-metrial cancers. Patients and methods: Sixty patients underwent resection for uterine <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers.</b> From the tissues of 60 uterine <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers,</b> the levels of ets- 1 mRNA, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (bFGF), platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF) and interleukin (IL) - 8 were determined by competitive RT–PCR using recombinant RNA and enzyme immunoassay, and the localization and counts of microvessel were determined by immuno-histochemistry. Results: There was a significant correlation between microvessel count and ets- 1 gene expression levels in uterine <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers.</b> Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the localization of ETS- 1 was similar to that of vascular endothelial cells. The level of ets- 1 mRNA tended to increase with increasing disease stage. Furthermore, the level of ets- 1 mRNA correlated with levels of VEGF in well-differentiated adenocarcinomas (G 1) and of bFGF in moderately differentiated adenocarcinomas (G 2) and poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas (G 3). Conclusions: ETS- 1 is a possible angiogenic mediator in uterine <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Clear cell {{carcinoma}} is a Type II endometrial tumor {{that makes up}} less than 5% of diagnosed <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> Like serous {{cell carcinoma}}, it is usually aggressive and carries a poor prognosis.

5|$|<b>Endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> is {{not widely}} {{known by the}} general populace, despite its frequency. There is low {{awareness}} of the symptoms, {{which can lead to}} later diagnosis and worse survival.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} surgery is not indicated, palliative {{chemotherapy}} is an option; higher-dose chemotherapy {{is associated with}} longer survival. Palliative chemotherapy, particularly using capecitabine and gemcitabine, is also often used to treat recurrent <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic {{people is not}} indicated, since the disease is highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E

40|$|Background: Vitamin D has a {{wide range}} of {{physiological}} functions in skeletal and nonskeletal tissues which {{may play a role in}} many diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recent evidence regarding the effects of Vitamin D on several health outcomes in women including breast <b>cancer,</b> ovarian and <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers,</b> hypertension, and osteoporosis. Materials and Methods: We searched PubMed and Google Scholar databases through March 2016. We included the most current systematic reviews and meta-analyses assessing the associations of Vitamin D intake and/or serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) levels with the risk of incidence of breast <b>cancer,</b> ovarian and <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers,</b> hypertension, and osteoporosis. Results: Many studies have represented that Vitamin D supplementation and high 25 (OH) D levels can decrease the risk of breast cancer occurrence or mortality. However, there is no strong evidence to support the existence of a relationship between Vitamin D and ovarian or <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers.</b> Furthermore, the results regarding the effects of Vitamin D on hypertension were inconsistent. Although observational studies have shown an association between Vitamin D and hypertension, there is no evidence regarding effectiveness of Vitamin D in lowering blood pressure in several clinical trials. On the other hand, the findings associating the impact of Vitamin D on osteoporosis were more definitive and most studies have represented that Vitamin D may have beneficial effects on osteoporosis. Conclusion: Although the adequate Vitamin D level can play a protective role in the incidence and development of breast cancer, hypertension, and osteoporosis, there is limited evidence regarding ovarian and <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancers...</b>|$|R

5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer</b> in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer.</b> The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of <b>endometrial</b> <b>cancer,</b> so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can be of some use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma.
