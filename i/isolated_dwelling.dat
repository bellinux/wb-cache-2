60|$|As it chanced, I had {{in one of}} my rambles {{come upon}} an <b>isolated</b> <b>dwelling</b> in the very heart of these lonely moors, which I at once {{determined}} should be my own. It was a two-roomed cottage, which had once belonged to some shepherd, but had long been deserted, and was crumbling rapidly to ruin. In the winter floods, the Gaster Beck, which runs down Gaster Fell, where the little dwelling stood, had overswept its banks and torn away a part of the wall. The roof was in ill case, and the scattered slates lay thick amongst the grass. Yet the main shell of the house stood firm and true; and it was no great task for me to have all that was amiss set right.|$|E
60|$|After amusing {{ourselves}} with {{the spectacle of}} the diligence, we found the scenery too beautiful to re-enter the carriage immediately, and {{we walked to the}} top of the mountain. The view from the summit was truly admirable. The Seine comes winding its way through a broad rich valley, from the southward, having just before run east, and, a league or two beyond due west, our own Susquehanna being less crooked. The stream was not broad, but its numerous isles, willowy banks, and verdant meadows, formed a line for the eye to follow. Rouen in the distance, with its ebony towers, fantastic roofs, and straggling suburbs, lines its shores, at a curvature where the stream swept away west again, bearing craft of the sea on its bosom. These dark old towers have a sombre, mysterious air, which harmonizes admirably with the recollections that crowd the mind at such a moment! Scarce an <b>isolated</b> <b>dwelling</b> was to be seen, but the dense population is compressed into villages and bourgs, that dot the view, looking brown and teeming, like the nests of wasps. Some of these places have still remains of walls, and most of them are so compact and well defined that they appear more like vast castles than like the villages of England or America. All are grey, sombre, and without glare, rising from the background of pale verdure, so many appropriate bas reliefs.|$|E

40|$|The archaeological {{investigations}} at the Getae fortified {{settlement of}} Horodca Mică revealed some {{materials from the}} medieval period. In {{the central part of}} its internal space a one-room dwelling with the floor deepened into the ground was found, characterized by two phases of habitat. At the first stage it was warmed by a clay oven located {{in the middle of the}} east wall, and at the second - by a rounded open hearth located in the central part of the room. In the filling and on the floor of the house, besides rather interesting collection of ceramics, there were found the following objects: an iron knife, an sub-rectangular iron buckle, a leaf-shaped arrowhead and a fragment of a whetstone with hanging hole. On the floor of the house there was also found a medieval coin issued by Moldavian Prince Iliaş (1432 - 1443), which was attributed to type V and dated approximately from 1442. The discovery of the coin makes possible dating the dwelling with the first half of 15 th century. Further investigation of the internal space of the Getae fortified settlement will show whether it was an <b>isolated</b> <b>dwelling</b> or it was part of the medieval settlement arranged on the place of an ancient fortress by virtue of the military-political circumstances. ...|$|E
40|$|Isolated {{dwellings}} {{present their}} own problems of sewage disposal. The septic tank has conventionally been used to treat the sewage. It usually consists {{of one or two}} tanks for settling of solids with the overflow disposed via subsurface soil percolation. Depending on soil permeability a soak well is used in very permeable soil, whereas a trench is used where the soil is less permeable allowing for more infiltration area. Settled solids in the tank(s) undergo some anaerobic decomposition, but have to be emptied on a regular basis. Properly designed a septic tank may perform satisfactorily in unobtrusively conveying wastewater away from a dwelling. It can, however, pose health hazards in rocky or tight clay soils resulting in ponding of untreated sewage. More generally septic tanks contaminate groundwater with human pathogens, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and other pollutants disposed with domestic wastewater. The problems are accentuated where groundwater is close to the surface, or withdrawn for water supply for the <b>isolated</b> <b>dwelling.</b> There are now a variety of options for wastewater treatment, disposal and reuse for isolated dwellings. Such systems can produce an effluent quality equal to or better than a conventional treatment plant. They may also be more cost effective than reticulated sewerage in rural and semi-rural areas besides isolated dwellings of remote areas, because extensive piping and pumping is avoided. There are also questions {{from the point of view}} of a local community particularly in developing countries besides the affordability of the chosen system for them, such as control over technologies that have the potential to influence the dynamics, form and autonomy of the community into which they are introduced. In addition there are now growing environmental and social pressures to consider reusing wastes and to begin introducing systems which are sustainable in the long term. This section will discus the criteria to be considered in general in the process of selection of a particular technology for isolated dwellings and then describe a few technologies which are approved to be used in Australia to illustrate technologies that can be applied in other parts of the world. Use of local materials, modified design to suit local conditions and preference of a community should be taken into account when determining what is best for a particular case...|$|E

50|$|This {{process is}} {{versatile}} {{as it can}} be adapted to small flows (< 1 m3/d), such as onsite sewage as well as to flows generated by a municipality (> 240 000 m3/d).

40|$|Définition des {{habitats}} isolés, diffus et groupés. Méthode de caractérisation et de cartographie de ces types d'habitat dans le contexte de prévention du risque d'incendie. Mise en relation des types d'habitat avec le risque d'incendie. / In {{a context}} of forest fire risk, the development of actions concerning wildfire prevention and land management is necessary and essential particularly in wildland urban interfaces (WUI). The term WUI' always includes components such as human presence and wildland vegetation. Both the hazard (probability of fire outbreak, distribution) and the vulnerability of urban areas can be characterized through the spatial organization of houses and vegetation. The first required step is to characterize and map WUI in large areas and at a large scale, which in turn requires qualifying different types of dwellings and mapping them. With this goal in view, the paper presents a brief synthesis of results coming from an exploratory process for the characterization of dwelling types (Lampin et al., 2007), and develops a method based on GIS-geo treatments to characterize different types of dwelling with regard to fire risk. Three types of <b>dwellings</b> were classified: <b>isolated</b> <b>dwellings,</b> scattered dwellings and clustered dwellings, using criteria based on the distance between houses, the size of clusters of houses and housing density, which can be mapped automatically. Within dwelling types, the density value of forest fire ignition changed and was twice as high for <b>isolated</b> <b>dwellings</b> as for clustered dwellings. The spatial organization of dwellings {{seems to have a}} real impact on fire occurrence. Thus maps of different dwelling types can be interpreted for use in developing fire fighting strategies or prevention actions concerning end-users such as forest and land planning managers or fire-fighters...|$|R
