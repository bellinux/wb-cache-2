25|$|The work on {{the problem}} has been in terms of {{solutions}} in natural numbers (understood as the non-negative integers) rather than arbitrary integers. The two problems are equivalent: any general algorithm that can decide whether a given <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation</b> has an integer solution could be modified into an algorithm that decides whether a given <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation</b> has a natural number solution, and vice versa. This can be seen as follows: The requirement that solutions be natural numbers can be expressed with the help of Lagrange's four-square theorem: every natural number is the sum of the squares of four integers, so we simply replace every parameter with the sum of squares of four extra parameters. Similarly, since every integer can be written as the difference of two natural numbers, we can replace every parameter that ranges in integers with the difference of two parameters that range in natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|Diophantine {{equations}} {{have been}} studied for thousands of years. For example, the solutions to the quadratic <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation</b> x2 + y2 = z2 are given by the Pythagorean triples, originally solved by the Babylonians (c. 1800 BC). Solutions to linear Diophantine equations, such as 26x + 65y = 13, may be found using the Euclidean algorithm (c. 5th century BC).|$|E
25|$|In logic, {{the second}} problem on David Hilbert's list of open {{problems}} presented in 1900 was {{to prove that the}} axioms of arithmetic are consistent. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, proved in 1931, showed that this was not possible – at least not within arithmetic itself. Hilbert's tenth problem was to determine whether a given polynomial <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation</b> with integer coefficients has an integer solution. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich proved that this could not be done.|$|E
30|$|Now we {{will remind}} some <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equations</b> with their {{solutions}}. The solutions of these equations are explored in [3] and [6]. We will use these equations for determining all solutions of other <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equations.</b>|$|R

25|$|We may {{speak of}} the degree of a Diophantine set as being the least degree of a {{polynomial}} in an equation defining that set. Similarly, we can call the dimension of such a set the least number of unknowns in a defining equation. Because of the existence of a universal <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation,</b> it is clear that there are absolute upper bounds to both of these quantities, and there has been much interest in determining these bounds.|$|E
25|$|A {{polynomial}} equation {{for which}} one is interested only in the solutions which are integers is called a <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation.</b> Solving Diophantine equations is generally a very hard task. It has been proved that there cannot be any general algorithm for solving them, and even for deciding whether the set of solutions is empty (see Hilbert's tenth problem). Some {{of the most famous}} problems that have been solved during the fifty last years are related to Diophantine equations, such as Fermat's Last Theorem.|$|E
25|$|Already in the 1920s Thoralf Skolem {{showed that}} any <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation</b> is {{equivalent}} to one of degree 4 or less. His trick was to introduce new unknowns by equations setting them equal to the square of an unknown or the product of two unknowns. Repetition of this process results {{in a system of}} second degree equations; then an equation of degree 4 is obtained by summing the squares. So every Diophantine set is trivially of degree 4 or less. It is not known whether this result is best possible.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, David Hilbert {{proposed}} the solvability of all <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equations</b> as the tenth of his fundamental problems. In 1970, Yuri Matiyasevich solved it negatively, by proving that a general algorithm for solving all <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equations</b> cannot exist.|$|R

25|$|The {{reason of}} the {{interest}} for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that K may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves C that have no point defined over K, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to E, which by definition has a point over K to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish C that have genus 1, from elliptic curves E that have a K-point (or, in other words, provide a <b>Diophantine</b> <b>equation</b> that has a solution in K). The curves C {{turn out to be}} torsors over E, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that K is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve C over Q has no particular reason to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over K to put C into that form over K.|$|E
