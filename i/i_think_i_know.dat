500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, Richardson said, [...] "Ah, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what you want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E

[...] Throughout the run of The Simpsons, Azaria has had to sing in character several times, a task which he describes as easier than singing normally. The Smurfs writer David N. Weiss says Azaria [...] "has a beautiful treasure trove of talent", and [...] "became what you wished you were writing". Playwright Jenelle Riley wrote in 2005 that Azaria was [...] "by far" [...] her favorite actor, praising his [...] "versatility" [...] and [...] "tendency to take small roles that would normally fade into the background and to consistently create characters people care about", noting his roles in Shattered Glass, Mystery, Alaska and especially [...]|$|E

5000|$|The {{majority}} of the adult actors in the film, including John Ritter, Dennis Christopher, Tim Reid, and Harry Anderson, were hand-chosen by Wallace and Cohen for their roles. Annette O'Toole was cast in the film {{at the suggestion of}} Ritter, with whom she had recently shot The Dreamer of Oz: The L. Frank Baum Story (1990): [...] "I think John may have talked to somebody, because I got an offer play Beverly," [...] O'Toole recalled. [...] "It happened really fast; <b>I</b> don’t <b>think</b> <b>I</b> even went in for a reading.
