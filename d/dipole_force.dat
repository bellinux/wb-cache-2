5000|$|At {{the advent}} of laser cooling techniques, Maxwell’s theory of {{electromagnetism}} had already led to the quantification of electromagnetic radiation exerting a force, however it wasn’t until {{the turn of the}} twentieth century when studies by Lebedev (1901), Nichols (1901), and Hull (1903) experimentally demonstrated that force. Following that period, in 1933, Frisch exemplified the pressure exerted on atoms by light. Starting in the early 1970s, lasers were then utilized to further explore atom manipulation. The introduction of lasers in atomic manipulation experiments acted as {{the advent of}} laser cooling proposals in the mid 1970s. Laser cooling was separately introduced in 1975 by two different research groups: Hänsch and Schawlow, and Wineland and Dehmelt. They both outlined a process of slowing heat-based velocity in atoms by “radiative forces.” In the paper by Hänsch and Schawlow, the effect of radiative pressure on any object that reflects light is described. That concept was then connected to the cooling of atoms in a gas. [...] These early proposals for laser cooling only relied on “scattering force,” the name for the radiative force. In later proposals, laser trapping, a variant of cooling which requires both scattering and a <b>dipole</b> <b>force,</b> would be introduced.|$|E

The {{main body of the}} review is devoted to discussion of atom traps based on the <b>dipole</b> radiation <b>forces,</b> <b>dipole</b> magnetic <b>forces,</b> combined <b>dipole</b> radiation–magnetic <b>forces,</b> and the forces combined of the dipole radiation–magnetic and gravity forces.

40|$|We {{report a}} study on the optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> in a ladder like three level atomic systems in the context of {{coherent}} population transfer with the chirped few-cycle-pulse laser fields. The phenomenon of coherent population transfer is investigated by numerically solving the appropriate density matrix equations beyond the rotating wave approximation. On the other hand, optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> is calculated by numerically solving the force equation and density matrix equations self-consistently. By analysing the centre-of-mass motion, it is shown that the optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> with chirped pulses may be used for focusing and defocusing of atoms in an atomic beam similar to the near or non-resonant optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force.</b> Moreover, the robustness of the population transfer against the variation of the pulse parameters and the effect of the variation of the Rabi frequencies and the chirp rates on the optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> are also investigated. The proposed scheme may open new perspectives in the focusing and de-focusing of atoms and molecules in an atomic beam, since this scheme mitigates the demand for the generation of transform-limited pulse laser fields at arbitrary frequencies...|$|E
40|$|An atom {{moving in}} a focused laser beam will {{experience}} a velocity-dependent <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> due to the Doppler effect, which allows the operation of a Maxwell's demon. Photon scattering {{and other forms of}} dissipation can be negligibly small, which appears to contradict quantum information proofs that a Maxwell's demon must dissipate a minimum amount of energy. We resolve this 'paradox' by showing that Schrodinger's equation does not predict a velocity-dependent <b>dipole</b> <b>force.</b> Forces of that kind have been observed experimentally, however, and we show that Heisenberg's equation does predict a velocity-dependent <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> in agreement with experiment, provided that the total time derivative of an operator is evaluated along the trajectory of an atom.

40|$|The {{properties}} of molecule-optical {{elements such as}} lenses or prisms based on the interaction of molecules with optical fields depend in a crucial way on the molecular quantum state and its alignment created by the optical field. Herein, we consider the effects of state-dependent alignment in estimating the optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> acting on the molecules and, to this end, introduce an effective polarizability which takes proper account of molecular alignment and {{is directly related to}} the alignment-dependent optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force.</b> We illustrate the significance of including molecular alignment in the optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force</b> by a trajectory study that compares previously used approximations with the present approach. The trajectory simulations were carried out for an ensemble of linear molecules subject to either propagating or standing-wave optical fields for a range of temperatures and laser intensities. The results demonstrate that the alignment-dependent effective polarizability can serve to provide correct estimates of the optical <b>dipole</b> <b>force,</b> on which a state-selection method applicable to nonpolar molecules could be based. We note that an analogous analysis of the forces acting on polar molecules subject to an inhomogeneous static electric field reveals a similarly strong dependence on molecular orientation. clos...|$|E

In the low power regime the differences between the two models are negligible and both models show that, for lithography purposes, pattern widths of 150 nm can be achieved. In the high power channelling regime the conservative force model, predicting 100 nm features, is shown to break down.

However, for sufficiently large blue detunings, the rate of diffusion is so slow that the resulting distribution approaches a quasisteady state.
