5|$|In Hong Kong Cantonese, 女傭 (maid) and 外傭 (foreign servant) are neutral, socially-acceptable {{words for}} foreign {{domestic}} helpers.

5|$|Increasing labour export <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines</b> {{coincided with}} the {{economic}} rise of Hong Kong during the late 1970s and early 1980s. When the People's Republic of China implemented wide-reaching economic reform in the late 1970s and initiated trade with other countries, Hong Kong became mainland China's biggest investor. Labour-intensive Hong Kong industries moved to the mainland, and high-profit service industries in the territory (such as design, marketing and finance) expanded dramatically. To deal with the resulting labour shortage and increase in labour costs, the female labour force was mobilised. Two-income families sought help to manage their households, creating a demand for domestic workers. Female participation in the workforce increased, from 47.5 percent in 1982 to 54.7 percent in 2013. Families began hiring foreign domestic workers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines,</b> {{with the number of}} workers steadily increasing during the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

As it was, Tarbuck became a loyal supporter of MacArthur.|$|E
5|$|In the typhoon's early stages, {{news reports}} {{stated that the}} outer bands of the storm {{produced}} heavy rainfall in the Philippines, resulting in 16 fatalities. However, a meteorological analysis of the storm showed that Kirogi was {{not responsible for the}} rain; instead, a monsoon depression that later became Typhoon Kai-tak caused the flooding rains. Typhoon Kirogi was never closer than 835km (520mi) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines.</b> However, large swells produced by the storm caused moderate damage along coastal areas of the Philippines, forcing workers in Manila to clear debris left by the damaging waves.|$|E

Though a weaker storm when it struck China, damage was more severe due to extensive flooding. Several coastal cities were completely inundated. Throughout the country, at least 200 people died and losses reached 1.2billion yuan ($319million USD). Additionally, 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in Hong Kong.|$|E
5|$|Upon being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration issued Public Storm Warning Signal #1 for Samar, Leyte, the Camotes Islands, Surigao del Norte, Siargao Island, and Dinagat Island as winds up to 60km/h (37mph) were expected to affect those areas. Three hours later, Biliran Island was also put under the warning signal. On January4, all signals, except in Eastern Samar, were lifted as Auring recurved and moved away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines.</b> The warning signal for Eastern Samar was lifted early the next day.|$|E

These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. labiata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. labiata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types of prey. The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results.

There is a South Asian population of Indians and Pakistanis; some Vietnamese refugees have become permanent residents of Hong Kong. There are also Britons, Americans, Canadians, Japanese, and Koreans working in the city's commercial and financial sector.

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Pacific War, remnants of the United States Asiatic Fleet fled to Australia, on orders from Washington. The S-boats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines</b> were organized into a fighting force at Brisbane, and Admiral Ernest King ordered S-boats from the Atlantic Fleet to supplement the force in Australia. Christie went along, arriving in April 1942, {{just in time for the}} Battle of the Coral Sea. During the Solomon Islands campaign, he ordered his boats to patrol around harbors which, while being key points for shipping, also tended to be heavily patrolled by aircraft and anti-submarine craft. In step with then-current U.S. Navy submarine doctrine, he made capital ships the prime targets, rather than have his boats focus on merchant shipping.|$|E

Damage reports <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines</b> remained scarce, though the PAGASA indicated that damage costs totaled 67.250million Philippine pesos (US$1.26million). On July18, an Airbus A330-242 carrying 242passengers bound for Hong Kong encountered Koni in the South China Sea and attempted to deviate from its planned trajectory in order to avoid severe weather. However, the plane inadvertently encountered an area of severe turbulence, resulting in three minor injuries on board. The plane was later able to exit the area of turbulence and land safely at Hong Kong International Airport.|$|E

5|$|Later on September9, Sarah turned sharply northward as the {{lee side}} low rapidly tracked northeast. Reintensification {{gradually}} took {{place as the}} storm moved away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Philippines,</b> with the storm reaching typhoon status by September10. Tracking generally towards the north-northwest, Sarah entered a favorable region for development and underwent a period of explosive intensification on September11. Over a six-hour span, the storm's winds increased from 140km/h (85mph) to 215km/h (135mph). A powerful typhoon, Sarah featured a well-defined eye and multiple outflow channels. The storm reached its peak strength later that day as a Category4equivalent typhoon on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). The JMA assessed Sarah to have been somewhat weaker, estimating peak ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) along with a barometric pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E
