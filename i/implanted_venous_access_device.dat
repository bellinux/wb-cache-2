40|$|<b>Implanted</b> <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>device</b> (IVAD) late {{dysfunction}} {{is commonly}} caused by fibrin sheath formation. The standard method of endovascular fibrin sheath removal is performed via the femoral vein. However, {{it is not}} always technically feasible and sometimes contraindicated. Moreover, approximately 4 - 6 [*]h of bed rest is necessary after the procedure. In this article, we describe an alternative method of fibrin sheath removal using the brachial vein approach in a young woman receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer. The right basilic vein was punctured, and a long 6 °F introducer sheath was advanced into the right subclavian vein. Endovascular maneuvers consisted on advancing Atrieve™ Vascular Snare 15 - 9 [*]mm after catheter insertion in the superior vena cava through a 5. 2 °F Judkins left catheter. IVAD patency was restored without any complication, and the patient was discharged immediately after the procedure. In conclusion, fibrin sheath removal from an obstructed IVAD could be performed via the right brachial vein. Further research is necessary in order to prove efficacy of this technique...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{catheter}} embolization from <b>implanted</b> <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> are reported and the available literature is reviewed. The catheter from an im-planted <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>device</b> migrated {{into the right}} heart after slippage of the O-ring, which attaches the catheter to the infusion port. The distal 6 cm of an infusion port catheter embolized to the right heart after spontaneous fracture of the catheter {{at the point where}} it passed between the clavicle and first rib. Both catheters were removed percutaneously without complication. Risk factors for embolization were apparent on x-ray films with evidence of O-ring slippage in 1 case an obvious kinking of the catheter in the other. Symptoms of embolization included chest discomfort, right upper quadrant pain, and nausea. In 1 case, an extra heart sound, initially thought to be an S 3, disappeared when the catheter was removed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{oncology}} patients need {{a reliable}} <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> {{for the administration}} of chemotherapy: totally <b>implanted</b> <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> (TIVAD) allow infusion of drugs and blood sampling {{with a minimum of}} discomfort. For nurses, these devices are practical in use. However, device occlusion can occur leading to a delay in the prescribed therapy. Attempts to solve this problem is for both health care providers and patients a time-consuming task. Incidence rates of blood withdrawal occlusion (WO) varies from 3 to 28 % of all accesses in different hospitals using different maintenance protocols. We hypothesized that differences in protocols of care can influence the incidence of withdrawal occlusion. Material and methods: In 2004, data on the incidence of WO in 8, 658 TIVAD accesses were prospectively recorded in oncology day clinics in the frame of a multicentre study in Flanders conducted by VlaNinka (Flemish Network on Vascular Access). A secondary data-analysis was carried out trying to highlight risk factors related to the incidence of WO. Results: Relationship between flush solution (volume of normal saline, volume and concentration of heparin, syringe diameter), discard volume of first aspirate before blood sampling, number of days between needle change and incidence of WO will be reported. A flushing volume of 10 ml of normal saline is the optimal volume in reducing the risk on WO. Conclusion: Further research has to focus on all potential risk factors for development of WO such as insertion procedure, catheter tip position, device shape and material, compliance to maintenance protocols and differences in skills within nursing staff. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Implanted</b> <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> (IVADs) {{are often}} used in {{patients}} who require long-term intravenous drug administration. The most common causes of device dysfunction include occlusion by fibrin sheath and/or catheter adherence to the vessel wall. We present percutaneous endovascular salvage techniques to restore function in occluded catheters. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of these techniques. Through a femoral or brachial <b>venous</b> <b>access,</b> a snare is used to remove fibrin sheath around the IVAD catheter tip. If device dysfunction is caused by catheter adherences to the vessel wall, a new "mechanical adhesiolysis" maneuver was performed. IVAD salvage procedures performed between 2005 and 2013 were analyzed. Data included clinical background, catheter tip position, success rate, recurrence, and rate of complication. Eighty-eight salvage procedures were performed in 80 patients, mostly women (52. 5 %), with a mean age of 54 years. Only a minority (17. 5 %) of evaluated catheters were located at an optimal position (i. e., cavoatrial junction ± 1 cm). Mechanical adhesiolysis or other additional maneuvers were used in 21 cases (24 %). Overall technical success rate was 93. 2 %. Malposition and/or vessel wall adherences were the main cause of technical failure. No complications were noted. These IVAD salvage techniques are safe and efficient. When a catheter is adherent to the vessel wall, mechanical adhesiolysis maneuvers allow catheter mobilization and a greater success rate with no additional risk. In patients who still require long-term use of their IVAD, these procedures can be performed safely to avoid catheter replacement...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chemotherapy in {{colorectal}} cancer is usually administered as continuous infusion of 5 -fluorouracil, often {{in combination with}} oxaliplatin or irinotecan. Targeted drugs are most efficient and tolerable in conjunction with continuous infusion dosing. <b>Implanted</b> <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> (VAD) are the prerequisite for continuous infusion administration. The reported catheter migration frequency with VAD is 0 % - 3. 5 %. The purpose of this case-control study was to evaluate the predisposing factors of catheter migration. Methods: We inserted VADs in 88 radically operated {{colorectal cancer}} patients randomized to adjuvant 48 -hour-infusion chemotherapy repeated every 14 days, altogether 12 times over 24 weeks. Three out of 88 patients (3. 4 %) had a symptomatic catheter migration from the superior caval vein into the internal jugular vein. The fourth case had chemotherapy for osteosarcoma. These 4 cases were compared with 12 controls from the same 88 patient study population, matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), physical activity level and right subclavian insertion site. Tip position, port model, complications, catheter length and material was studied. The post insertion catheter tip position in the chest X-ray was numbered from 1 (in subclavia) to 8 (in atrium). Results: The four cases, all male, had a median position of 3 (range 3 - 4) and controls 6 (range 4 - 8), P = 0. 004, median difference 3 (CI 95 % 1 - 5). At notification of migration the patients had experienced discomfort in the neck region starting 5 to 15 days before at strenuous upper extremities activity with Valsalva maneuvers. Conclusion: Optimal catheter tip position when sitting is in the right atrium or low in the superior vena cava to avoid migration. Patients with VADs should avoid strenuous activity with Valsalva maneuvers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pyoderma gangrenosum is an aseptic skin disease. The {{ulcerative}} form of pyoderma gangrenosum {{is characterized}} by a rapidly progressing painful irregular and undermined bordered necrotic ulcer. The aetiology of pyoderma gangrenosum remains unclear. In about 70 % of cases, it is associated with a systemic disorder, most often inflammatory bowel disease, haematological disease or arthritis. In 25 – 50 % of cases, a triggering factor such as recent surgery or trauma is identified. Treatment consists of local and systemic approaches. Systemic steroids are generally used first. If the lesions are refractory, steroids are combined with other immunosuppressive therapy or to antimicrobial agents. Case presentation A 90 years old patient with myelodysplastic syndrome, seeking regular transfusions required totally <b>implanted</b> central <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>device</b> (Port-a-Cath ®) insertion. Fever and inflammatory skin reaction at the site of insertion developed on the seventh post-operative day, requiring the device's explanation. A rapid progression of the skin lesions evolved into a circular skin necrosis. Intravenous steroid treatment stopped the necrosis' progression.

40|$|ABSTRACTOtherwise unexplained {{clinical}} signs of infection {{in patients with}} long-term tunnelled or totally <b>implanted</b> central <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> (CVADs) are suspected to be CVAD-associated. Diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or port reservoir. In {{the case of a}} suspected CVAD-related bloodstream infection in paediatric oncology patients, in-situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be attempted. Removal of the CVAD should be considered if bacteraemia persists or relapses ≥ 72 h after the initiation of (in-vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. Timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis. Antibiotic lock techniques in addition to systemic treatment are beneficial for Gram-positive infections. Although prospectively controlled studies are lacking, the concomitant use of urokinase locks and taurolidine secondary prophylaxis seem to favour catheter salvage...|$|R
40|$|Haemophilia {{prophylaxis}} {{is superior}} to on-demand treatment to prevent joint damage. High-dose prophylaxis' as used in Sweden is more effective in preventing arthropathy than an intermediate-dose regimen' (the Netherlands) and the Canadian tailored primary prophylaxis. Prophylaxis may {{reduce the risk of}} developing inhibitors. There is no difference in inhibitor risk between plasma derived and recombinant factor VIII (rFVIII) products but the Rodin study showed increased risk with second-generation rFVIII products. MRI is a new and very sensitive tool to detect the symptoms of early arthropathy but some results (soft tissue changes in bleed-free joints') still need to be investigated. Ultrasound is a very helpful method to aid diagnosis especially during the acute phase of a bleed. The risk of infection with central <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> remains a matter of debate. A fully <b>implanted</b> central <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>device</b> (CVAD) has a significant lower risk of infection compared to external CVADs.

Therefore, the infusion system should be tested before each use and each new symptom, even when not obviously related to the catheter should be carefully documented and evaluated by expert physicians to avoid severe catheter-associated complications. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTotally implantable <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> (TIVAD) {{are used}} widely in the {{management}} of cystic fibrosis (CF) [Standards of Care: Standards for the clinical care of children and adults with cystic fibrosis in the UK. The Cystic Fibrosis Trust's Clinical Standards and Accreditation Group. Cystic Fibrosis Trust, London, UK, 2001]. They {{have been shown to be}} safe and advantageous in the long term administration of intravenous antibiotics [A-Rahman A, Spencer D. Totally implantable vascular <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> for cystic fibrosis. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2003 (3) ]. However, TIVADs are not without short and long term complications including infections, thrombosis and mechanical failure [Munck A, Malbezin S, Bloch J.

Experience of totally implantable <b>venous</b> <b>access</b> <b>devices</b> (TIV Ads) in adults with cystic fibrosis over a 13 -year period. Respir Med 2000; 94 : 1161 – 5]. Patients should be counselled prior to TIVAD insertion regarding the risks and instructed on post-operative care of the device to minimise the risks. However it is not routine practice to advise on seating position within the car in relationship to the seatbelt placement over the anterior chest wall. Line failure due to direct pressure from a seatbelt worn to prevent injury in the sudden deceleration involved during a motor vehicle accident (MVA) has not been described previously in the CF literature We report the case of an 8  year old child who fractured her Vascuport® line secondary to seatbelt trauma following a road traffic accident (RTA). Children and adults with CF should be advised to sit in the car on the side that places the shoulder strap of the seatbelt on the opposite side to the TIVAD line...|$|R
