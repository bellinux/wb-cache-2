5|$|Using {{alternating}} first-person perspectives, {{the novel}} tells {{the stories of}} Henry DeTamble (born 1963), a librarian at the Newberry Library in Chicago, and his wife, Clare Anne Abshire (born 1971), an artist who makes paper sculptures. Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes {{to be known as}} Chrono-Impairment, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 {{at the opening of the}} novel, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her before, although she has known him most of her life.|$|E
5|$|Impa {{says that}} the mark on Link's hand means {{that he is the}} hero chosen to awaken Zelda. She gives Link a chest {{containing}} six crystals and ancient writings that only a great future king of Hyrule can read. Link finds that he can read the document, even though <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> the language before; it indicates that the crystals must be set into statues within six palaces scattered all over Hyrule. This will open the way to the Great Palace, which contains the Triforce of Courage. Only the power of the combined Triforces can awaken the enchanted Zelda. Taking the crystals, Link sets out to restore them to their palaces. Meanwhile, the followers of Ganon are seeking to kill Link, as sprinkling his blood on Ganon’s ashes will bring Ganon back to life.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

60|$|A squat robot with undulating arms {{passed by}} him, its arms weaving inquiringly. The robot went on its way, disappearing under some debris. Hendricks watched it go. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> that type before.

5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen,</b> and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate between}} poskim whether the {{prohibition}} applies to a recorded voice, where the singer cannot be seen, where {{the woman is}} not known {{to the man who}} is listening and where <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her or a picture of her.|$|E
25|$|The male lead is bewitched by the {{feminine}} allure of Ondine. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a creature as lovely as her {{and decides to}} marry Ondine, forsaking his betrothed, Beatrice (Berta). Similar to the Prince in Swan Lake, Palemon is destroyed by breaking the trust of his intended.|$|E

25|$|Korine also {{appeared}} in the 2007 documentary film Beautiful Losers in which his life and career {{were one of the}} foci of the film, along with other artists such as Mike Mills, Shepard Fairey, Margaret Kilgallen, Jo Jackson and Barry McGee. In the documentary, Korine discusses his motivation as an artist and filmmaker, as well as his inspiration for creating films <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen.</b> Footage also appears from one of Korine's rare, early, and untitled short films, which preceded his work on Kids.|$|E
500|$|In {{the final}} scene, Hermie, {{suddenly}} approaching manhood, is seen looking at Dorothy's old {{house and the}} ocean from a distance before he turns to join his friends.

500|$|Series creator Matt Groening {{stated that}} while he {{is a fan of}} the Star Trek {{franchise}} <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> an episode of The Original Series in its entirety, but has seen [...] But director Pat Shinagawa said that there was a certain amount of jealousy among the crew that she got to work on this episode. All of the living members of the original Star Trek cast agreed to appear in the episode with the exception of James Doohan, whose agent replied with [...] "No way." [...] Because of this, the episode's working title was jokingly named [...] "We got everybody but Scotty" [...] and so Scotty was replaced with [...] "Welshie". William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy recorded their lines together, which was unusual as actors usually record solo. Following his work on Futurama, Goodman went on to join the writing staff on Star Trek: Enterprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said; and then, {{finding that}} it was not {{possible}} that he should hear her through her veil, she raised it. She was very pale, and there was a look of painful care, almost of agony, round her mouth. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her look so pale,--but he said to himself {{at the same time that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> her look so beautiful.|$|R

500|$|According to {{historian}} Pamela Crossley, proficiency with shamanism {{was among}} the qualities that the Qianlong Emperor (r. 1735–1796) promoted as {{being part of the}} [...] "Old Way" [...] (fe doro) of the Manchus when he attempted to formalize the Manchu heritage late in his reign. Mark Elliott has countered that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> shamanism listed among [...] "the qualities the court expected of Manchus" [...] in any Qing documents, and that shamanism was therefore [...] "never formally enunciated as part of the Manchu Way" [...] (Manjusai doro). Nicola di Cosmo of the Institute for Advanced Studies comments that once Manchu rituals were codified into formal regulations, they became [...] "mere simulacra of the ancestral cults" [...] and lost their place {{at the center of the}} spiritual life of Manchu clans. Nonetheless the persistence of shamanistic practices at the Qing court into the twentieth century suggests that the Manchus were not automatically [...] "sinicized" [...] by the sole fact that they ruled over China.|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{has said}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> a High School Musical film, to which Glee has been compared, and that his {{interest}} lay in creating a [...] "postmodern musical", rather than [...] "doing a show where people burst into song", drawing more heavily on the format of Chicago. Murphy intended the show to {{be a form of}} escapism. [...] "There's so much on the air right now about people with guns, or sci-fi, or lawyers running around. This is a different genre, there's nothing like it on the air at the networks and cable. Everything's so dark in the world right now, that's why Idol worked. It's pure escapism," [...] he said. Murphy intended to make a family show to appeal to adults as well as children, with adult characters starring equally alongside the teenage leads, and as of October 2009 he had already mapped out plans for the series covering three years of broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Males find females by {{following}} their scent trails, sometimes tracking them {{for hundreds of}} meters a day. If a female is found and flees, the male follows. Courtship involves side-by-side parallel [...] "flowing" [...] behavior, tongue flicking along the back and excited lashing of the tail. Pairs stay together {{for one or two}} days after mating. Males chase away their rivals and engage in combat. Often, this also starts with the aforementioned flowing behavior before culminating in the dramatic [...] "adder dance." [...] In this act, the males confront each other, raise up the front part of the body vertically, make swaying movements and attempt to push each other to the ground. This is repeated until one of the two becomes exhausted and crawls off to find another mate. Interestingly, Appleby (1971) notes that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> an intruder win one of these contests, as if the frustrated defender is so aroused by courtship that he refuses to lose his chance to mate. There are no records of any biting taking place during these bouts.|$|E

500|$|A young Cambridge University professor, Horace Holly, is {{visited by}} a colleague, Vincey, who reveals {{that he will}} soon die. Vincey {{proceeds}} to tell Holly a fantastical tale of his family heritage. He charges Holly {{with the task of}} raising his young son, Leo (whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen)</b> and gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo turns 25. Holly agrees, and indeed Vincey is found dead the next day. Holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on Leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious [...] "Sherd of Amenartas", which seems to corroborate Leo's father's story. Holly, Leo and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa but are shipwrecked. They alone survive, together with their Arab captain, Mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the African interior, they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshipped as Hiya or [...] "She-who-must-be-obeyed". The Amahagger are curious about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen.|$|E
500|$|After Wally goes AWOL for {{a second}} day, David is pressed into service. [...] He admits to Karros and the judge in {{chambers}} that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> {{the inside of a}} courtroom. [...] Karros, in a moment of humanity, offers a deal: if David finishes the trial, she will not pursue sanctions against Finley & Figg. [...] Judge Seawright offers to help David through the trial and adds that Finley & Figg probably won't suffer from any malpractice lawsuits if the trial goes through. [...] David agrees to finish the trial but there is hardly any real case for him to present. Karros tears to pieces the main Finley & Figg expert witness: a Russian doctor of very questionable credentials and whose English is atrocious even after fifteen years in the U.S. The second expert, an equally shady pharmacologist, escapes without testifying, pocketing the $50,000 he got from Finley & Figg. Rueben Massey, Varrick's CEO, instructs Karros not to move for likely successful summary judgment, he is determined to have a jury clear Krayoxx of all charges and Varrick's public relations machine stands ready to trumpet this decision in all the media. Zinc declineS to cross-examine the row of expert witnesses that Varrick calls, all having impeccable credentials and David having no facts with which to shake their defense of Krayoxx. Rather, he spends the time studying Karros' methods, [...] "learning from a master", as he puts it in his own mind.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly afterward, Alicia discovers Nash is {{once again}} working on his [...] "assignment". [...] Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes into the house to find her baby {{submerged}} in the tub. [...] Nash claims that Charles was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash believes Parcher is trying to kill her. [...] He rushes in to push Parcher away, and accidentally knocks Alicia and the baby to the ground. [...] As Alicia flees the house with their baby, Nash jumps in front of Alicia's car and begs her to stay. Nash tells her that he realizes that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> Marcee age, even though he's known her for three years.

2500|$|One of Sabu's {{most infamous}} matches was the No-Rope Barbed-Wire match with Terry Funk at Born to be Wired, a match which was {{promoted}} as being [...] "too extreme even for ECW". In {{one of the}} most memorable moments in ECW history, Sabu attempted the [...] "Air Sabu" [...] corner splash on Funk, Terry moved and Sabu ended up colliding violently into the wire which tore open his biceps. He then asked his manager Bill Alfonso for some tape and after Alfonso went to get some Sabu began to tape the approximately 10 inch gash up. Funk has stated that, to this day, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> anything like what Sabu did that night. The match ended with both men so badly tangled up together in the barbed wire that it took several ring technicians armed with wire cutters to free them from the predicament (on the DVD Bloodsport – ECW's Most Violent Matches released by World Wrestling Entertainment, Paul Heyman said that the match was [...] "so gruesome, I never ever dared to schedule another one like it", and that they never had another Barbed-Wire match in ECW because [...] "no one could top that one – and in good conscience, I never wanted anyone to try").|$|E
2500|$|In 219, Lü Meng {{came up with}} a plan to help Sun Quan seize {{control of}} Liu Bei's territories in Jing Province. He pretended to be sick and asked for {{permission}} to return to Jianye to seek medical treatment. Sun Quan played along by pretending to approve his request. Lu Xun went to visit Lü Meng and said, [...] "Guan Yu is near the border. How can we remain far behind the border and not worry about having to guard against him?" [...] Lü Meng replied, [...] "What you've said is true, but I'm seriously ill now." [...] Lu Xun then said, [...] "Guan Yu is proud of his own valour and he scorns others. He may have made great achievements, but he's overly conceited. Besides, he's heading north and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> us a threat. When he knows you're sick, he'll definitely lower his defences. If we attack him when he lowers his guard, we can capture him. I came here to discuss with you a plan to attack him."

2500|$|The episode [...] "Uncertainty Principle" [...] is {{significant}} for the backstory it gives on the familial relationships, particularly Charlie's difficulty in dealing with his mother's death from cancer. While it's unclear how Don reacted, Charlie spent {{the last three months}} of his mother's life isolated in the garage, incessantly working on one of the Millennium Prize Problems, specifically P vs NP; it's a point of contention between the brothers. Also, Charlie doesn't think Don understood what he went through during their school years, especially how he was treated as [...] "Don's brainiac little brother" [...] by his peers in high school, and how he often left him to his own resources as a child, though he was not as inept as Don had reasoned. However, Charlie's relationship with Don remains strong, as he has begun to increasingly fear for his brother's safety on the job and still looks to his older brother for acceptance. Charlie and his father worry about Don committing to relationships, and for a time, fear that he had been cheating on Robin Brooks. Ironically, Charlie has similar problems with women himself. After a couple dozen murder cases, Charlie is somewhat jaded and world-weary like his brother. FBI agent David Sinclair of Don's team even comments that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> two brothers so similar and yet so different. In [...] "The Janus List", the brothers seem to take on each other's tendencies a bit. Though, in season five, Charlie is dismayed that Don does not reveal to him his newfound religious faith.|$|E
