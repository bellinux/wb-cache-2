SCU # 1112 Fort Devens, Mass Service Club Number OneFort Devens, Massachusetts 14 April 44 Dear Bryant Service Club- I {{had thought}} maybe you had {{forgotten}} {{some of the boys}} in the Service because of changes in address and was glad to hear from the organization which was started while I was still in attendance at Bryant. I was moved from Harvard Univ, when the Army’s College training program was halted + have been in Devens since the 8 th of March awaiting my new assignment which is only two week[s] away. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have a mimeographed list of the boys in the service and their current addresses. I would like the address of the fellows in the class of ’ 43 A + F who are still in the service. Phil Cornell, AAF, class of ’ 43 if we had been able to finish is on his way overseas if not at his overseas base already. I keep in touch with quite a few of the old gang as often as possible. I {{want to thank you for}} your lovely Easter package which I received today. I’m sure all the fellows appreciate the packages. Have some work to do so I’ll have to cut this a little short- so till next time. Yours in the serviceBill Bliven [Transcription ends...|$|E

One of the first things I will do when I get home is to go and see Bryant and possibly meet some of my old friends. I received a letter from the Service Club sometime ago and I have been meaning to answer it but something always seems to come up, but I mad up my mind that this would be the time to write. I will enclose my correct address at the bottom of this letter. I wish you would pass on my best wishes to all the gang, and especially to the class of 36. I have recently been promoted. As for myself I am fine and have done considerably traveling since I entered the service. One of my most enjoyable trips was to Rome, where I had the opportunity and good fortune of seeing the Vatican and the Pope. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were still publishing the Bulletin which I used to receive once in a while when I was in Africa. If you are I would appreciate it, if you would put me on the distribution list. I enjoyed reading it very much and would like to get it again. The weather gets pretty miserable around here at times, but I guess we can take for a little while longer. I sure hope to get home one of these days and have now over 2 years on foreign soil. Well its chow time now so I will have to close and do hope I shall hear from you soon and I will try and answer your letters promptly in the future.

40|$|While {{living in}} Shanghai last year, Jacob Dreyer found himself {{working as a}} 证婚人 [zhenghunren] {{in one of the}} city’s many wedding facilities. Translated as “wedding officiant,” “priest for weddings,” or “wedding witness,” zhenghunrenhas no real {{equivalent}} in the West. The role involves leading the wedding ceremony, but {{there is no need for}} a zhenghunren to be certified or authorized to perform weddings — which is one reason Dreyer was able to slip into the position so easily. Shanghai, September 2009. It was the time of year when it was just beginning to be crisp. At a party at night, you got your jacket off of the couch when you went outside to smoke. My friend M. and I stood on a balcony gazing into an endless sea of lights, building sites, and peasants maneuvering bicycles between it all. “I’m going back to Australia for a bit, to register my business … <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could do me a favor,” he said, giving me a cigarette. It didn’t take much time for us to adjust to Chinese habits; while we were foreign, we were also two 20 -year-olds come to the big city to make our fortunes, and naturally adapted to accepting the proffered cigarettes, and to doing strange favors for devious motives, so I naturally agreed without hearing what it was. “Meet me at People’s Square metro tomorrow at 2,” he said, and we went back inside. The next day, both of our faces, slightly stubbled, had the strange dry feeling that a face does the day after drinking, a dehydration not yet compensated for. We exchanged a few words, but were mostly silent as we went deep into Pudong, a region I typically avoided; for me, Pudong is the most repulsive area of Shanghai. Lujiazui is one thing, but the endless, Houstonian landscapes make me fear that modern Chinese people are learning to fear each other as much as we have long done in the USA. At Deping Road, line 6, we got off, and walked onto a highway only sparsely populated with traffic. A typical Pudongnese vista; some tacky hotels and other glistening buildings here and there, hardware stores, various individuals selling fried bread, tangerine peels on the sidewalk — and, a château? A chintzy building, with a sign that declared (ungrammatically) it to be the Villa D’Roman — we pushed through gates and found ourselves in a reception room, featuring a table laid with cookies, lychees, and soft drinks; a hubbub of chatting middle-aged people dressed in clothing that was simultaneously formal yet vulgar. M. brusquely went into a room to the side and got a black folder, and explained, “I marry people here, each time for 500 RMB. I give this speech,” indicating the characters with pinyin underneath in his book, “and then that’s it. It’s really easy, good money — watch me, so when I leave, you can do it. ...|$|E
