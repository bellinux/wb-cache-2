50|$|The Hamburger Wagon is <b>a</b> small wagon, <b>large</b> {{enough for}} only two people to work side by side; one cooks while the other one prepares the buns and handles the money. The wagon, still at {{approximately}} the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly. The establishment has changed ownership hands several times throughout the years, most recently bought by Jack Sperry in September 2008 from Michelle Lyons. Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> <b>skillet</b> and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper. The burgers have a crispness on the outside due to being deep fried.|$|R

40|$|Keywords:GIS; {{emergency}} evacuation; large building; visual simulation Abstract. To {{meet the}} requirements of emergency evacuation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building, this paper introduces design and implementation of emergency evacuation simulation model <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building based on GIS in detail. Firstly, three-tire architecture and functions of the simulation model are designed in the paper. Secondly, the key technologies of the model are emphasized. The base data of the model is the internal design map of <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hotel and the urban electronic map. The spatial analysis function of GIS is used to determine evacuation analysis of emergencies and disasters <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building and achieve the optimal emergency evacuation plan for crowd. Research results showed the model improves the simulation precision and can provide effective service for emergency evacuation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> building...|$|R
