40|$|Wood is a {{heterogeneous}} material mainly constituted of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and extractives which all have different isotopic signatures. For applicationswhere δ 13 Cmeasurement ofα-cellulose is required, {{it is important}} that residues of the other constituents remain below an acceptable level. The laboratory method most widely used for the extraction of α-cellulose consists of several successive treatments: organic solvents and boiled water, acidified sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) application, and finally a NaOH treatment. Different variants of this method were tested systematically to optimize the extraction of α-cellulose from wood samples of four tree species: oak, beech, poplar, and pine. Mid-infrared spectroscopy in Attenuated Total Reflection mode (IRATR) combined with a curve resolution method (Bayesian Positive Sources Separation statistical analysis) was used to monitor the residues of other wood constituents in extracted α-cellulose. IR-ATR spectroscopy was shown to be sensitive enough to detect residual compounds in α-cellulose extracts below a concentration which does not present <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> <b>bias</b> for δ 13 C measurements. For all tree species, a residual concentration of lignin below the bias threshold for δ 13 C measurements was reached with fewer additions of acidic NaClO 2 than usually reported.

The results from the measurements of field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer confirmed high opaqueness and greatly improved interface adhesion between fillers and the matrix. The introduction of surface-coated particles remarkably increases the shear viscosity of the composite melts in the low shear rate region due to the strong interfacial interaction.

Analysis of {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} at several time points after the primary and booster inoculations revealed no detectable virus or proviral DNA. At 6 weeks after the booster, immunized cats and additional naive control cats were challenged with a cell-free preparation of the infectious biological isolate FIV-PPR by the intraperitoneal route. Virus was detected after challenge in unvaccinated control cats but not in any of the FIV-pPPR-Δvif-immunized cats.

(1) When the reactive site of a photosubstrate is an alpha-carbon atom of the type CH-CO 2 -, decarboxylation is preferred over dehydrogenation, whereas {{the reverse is true}} for the neutral CH-CO 2 H.

When the substate does not contain a carboxylate group, isotope effects occur, in verification of previous reports, e. g. for benzyl alcohol C 6 H 5 -C 2 H 20 H. (3) The mechanism of flavin-sensitized substrate photodecarboxylation is assumed to consist in a primary carbanion fixation at the flavin nucleus (position 4 a, 5 or 8) with concomitant liberation of CO 2. This step is followed by rapid fragmentation of the adduct CH-Fl-red., provided that the substrate contains a functional and electron-donating group X, e. g. X = OH, OCH 3 or NH 2 (but not NH 3 + !) in X CH-CO 2 -. (4) The minimal requirement for flavin-sensitized C-H dehydrogenation is the presence of a hydroxyl group. For example, methanol as substrate and solvent is dehydrogenated at pH sufficiently alkaline for detection of the presence of the active species CH 3 O-, whereas at more acidic pH substrate dehydrogenation is competing with flavin autophotolysis, which depends on the substituents in the flavin nucleus...|$|R

ADDITIONAL KEY WORDS blood rheology parallel plate viscometer blood flow distribution microcirculation non-Newtonian flow yield shear stress hematocrit pulmonary circulation • It has been recognized since the time of PoiseuUle that blood is a complex fluid rheo-logically. Studies (1 - 4) have since shown that blood behaves in vitro as a non-New-tonian fluid whose viscosity may vary with the flow geometry and flow conditions. Sim-ilarly, the tendency of erythrocytes to aggre-gate in normal human blood has been well known since the work of Fahraeus (5) and is the basis of the test of sedimentation rate. However, only recently has work been under-taken to obtain quantitative rheological meas-urements in the low-shear region, where red cell aggregation is important (6 - 11). In par-ticular, experiments with Couette and capil-lary viscometers by Merrill and Cokelet and their co-workers (10 - 13) have indicated that the plasma protein fibrinogen causes normal human blood to <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> yield shear stress under no-flow conditions.

Among the edible parts of mallard, the greatest concentrations of Hg were observed in K and L, although they did not exceed 1. 5 mg/kg dry weight (dw). Average concentrations in K, L, and BM were 0. 27, 0. 25, and 0. 13 mg/kg dw, respectively. Significant correlations were observed between Hg concentrations in BM and K and in BM and L (rs = 0. 92) as well as between Hg con-centrations in these tissues and BF. In addition, we found significant correlations between Hg concentrations in SC and BM (rs = 0. 72) and in L and K (rs = 0. 55). In con-clusion, mallard <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> response to envi-ronmental Hg pollution and meets the requirements of a bioindicator. Mercury (Hg) is one of the most toxic trace metals affecting living organisms. In nature, this element is present in the greatest concentrations in bituminous shales, basic crystalline rocks, clay and peat soils, oil, and coal. Hg enters the envi-ronment as a result of volcanic eruptions and also as a result of human activity, the latter being mainly associated with municipal waste, cement, paints, dental amalgams, the steel industry, and the burning of fossil fuels. Global Hg emissions in 2005 were 1930 tonnes, of which 1480 tonnes were from anthropogenic sources (Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme/United Nations Environment Programme 2008). In Europe, Poland ranks second to Russia in emitting Hg into the environment, nearly 16 tonnes/y, which represents approximately 10 % of total European emissions (Arcti...|$|R
40|$|Ethanol {{enhancement}} of 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) 3 A receptor-mediated responses may have important consequences in the intoxicating and addictive properties of ethanol. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, ethanol-mediated {{enhancement of}} 5 -HT 3 receptor current {{has been proposed}} to occur due to stabilization of the open-channel state. It has not been possible to directly measure the open state of the channel due to the extremely low single-channel conductance of 5 -HT 3 A channels. Recently, three arginine residues within the large intracellular loop of the 5 -HT 3 A subunit were substituted by their equivalent residues (glutamine, aspartate, and alanine) of the 5 -HT 3 B subunit to produce a 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) subunit that forms functional homomeric channels <b>exhibiting</b> <b>a</b> <b>measurable</b> single-channel conductance. Using whole-cell rapid-agonist application techniques and the cell-attached single-channel recording configuration, we examined human 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The agonist sensitivity, macroscopic kinetics, and modulation by ethanol were similar between mutant and wild-type channels, suggesting the substitutions had not altered these channel structure-function properties. The open time histogram for single-channel events mediated by 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) receptors {{in the presence of}} maximal 5 -HT was best fit by three exponentials, but in the presence of ethanol a fourth open state was evident. In summary, the QDA substitution greatly enhanced single-channel conductance with little effect on 5 -HT 3 A channel's kinetic properties and ethanol enhances agonist action on 5 -HT 3 A receptors by inducing a new, long-lived open-channel state. Furthermore, the 5 -HT 3 A(QDA) receptor appears to be suitable for pharmacological studies of 5 -HT 3 A receptor modulation at a single-channel level...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the fractal {{curvature}} measures of invariant sets of one-dimensional conformal iterated function systems satisfying the open set condition exist, {{if and only if}} the associated geometric potential function is nonlattice. Moreover, in the nonlattice situation we obtain that the Minkowski content exists and prove that the fractal curvature measures are constant multiples of the δ-conformal measure, where δ denotes the Minkowski dimension of the invariant set. For the first fractal curvature measure, this constant factor coincides with the Minkowski content of the invariant set. In the lattice situation we give sufficient conditions for the Minkowski content of the invariant set to exist, contrasting the fact that the Minkowski content of a self-similar lattice fractal never exists. However, every self-similar set satisfying the open set condition <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> Minkowski <b>measurable</b> C^ 1 +α diffeomorphic image. Both in the lattice and nonlattice situation average versions of the fractal curvature measures are shown to always exist. Comment: 36 page...|$|R

In this work we have synthesized macroscopic single layer graphene with well-defined uniaxial periodic modulation on a stepped Ir(332) substrate and transferred it to a dielectric support. The applied fast transfer process does not damage the Ir crystal which can be repeatedly used for graphene synthesis. Upon transfer, a millimeter sized graphene flake with a uniform periodic nano-ripple structure is obtained, which <b>exhibits</b> <b>a</b> macroscopically <b>measurable</b> uniaxial strain. The periodic one dimensional arrangement of graphene ripples was confirmed by atomic force microscopy and polarized Raman measurements. An important feature of this system is that the graphene lattice is rotated in several different, well-defined orientations {{with respect to the}} direction of the ripple induced uniaxial strain. Moreover, geometry of the ripples can be modified by changing the graphene synthesis parameters...|$|R

As an alternative and supplementation to the numerous other approaches to visualization of social network data {{and as an}} attempt to overcome some of the drawbacks of these approaches, DySoN interactively visualizes streaming event data of social interactions by an interactive three-dimensional model of interpolated NURBS ”tubes”, representing activity and social proximity within a given set of actors during a given time period by using three dimensions of temporal information mapping: spatial density (tube distance), tubecolor and tube-diameter. We use a self assembled large collaboration network of Jazz musicians with a straightforward semantics for the computation of relation strengths for the evaluation of the approach. We also discuss applications of the concept for awareness services in mobile peer to peer social networks, which <b>exhibit</b> <b>a</b> vivid <b>measurable</b> social micro dynamics in time and space...|$|R

The asymmetric response is produced using rf electrodes of differing materials, and hence different secondary electron emission coefficients. This asymmetry in the emission coefficients can produce <b>a</b> significant, <b>measurable</b> dc <b>bias</b> voltage (Vbias /Vrf &# 8764; 0  0. 2), together with an asymmetry in the plasma density profiles and ion flux to each electrode. The dc bias formation can be understood from a particle-flux balance applied to each electrode, and results from two main effects: (1) the larger effective ion flux at each electrode due to the emission of secondary electrons and (2) ion-flux multiplication within the sheath due to ionization from these emitted secondary electrons. By making use of an empirical fit to the simulation data, the possibility of non-invasively estimating secondary electron emission coefficients in CCP systems is discussed...|$|R
