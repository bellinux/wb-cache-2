40|$|Although the {{phenomenon}} of <b>induced</b> <b>traffic</b> has been theorized for more than 60 years and is now widely accepted among transport researchers, the traffic-generating effects of road capacity expansion are still often neglected in transport modelling. Such omission can lead to serious bias in the assessments of environmental impacts {{as well as the}} economic viability of proposed road projects, especially in situations where there is a latent demand for more road capacity. This has been illustrated in the present paper by an assessment of travel time savings, environmental impacts and the economic performance of a proposed road project in Copenhagen with and without short-term <b>induced</b> <b>traffic</b> included in the transport model. The available transport model was not able to include long-term <b>induced</b> <b>traffic</b> resulting from changes in land use and in the level of service of public transport. Even though the model calculations included only a part of the <b>induced</b> <b>traffic,</b> the difference in cost-benefit results compared to the model excluding all <b>induced</b> <b>traffic</b> was substantial.

By exaggerating the economic benefits of road capacity increase and underestimating its negative effects, omission of <b>induced</b> <b>traffic</b> can result in overallocation of public money on road construction and correspondingly less focus on other ways of dealing with congestion and environmental problems in urban areas...|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} the most {{important}} cause of dementia but there is no therapy that has been demonstrated to stop or slow disease progression. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is the source of amyloid-β (Aβ), which aggregates in Alzheimer's disease to form toxic oligomeric species. The endo-lysosomal system can clear APP and Aβ from the cell if these molecular species are trafficked through to the lysosome. Currently, there are no easy methods available for the analysis of lysosomal APP trafficking. We therefore generated a fusion protein (tandem-fluorescent, or tf-APP) that allows detection of changes in APP trafficking using accessible techniques such as flow cytometry. This permits rapid analysis or screening of genes and compounds that alter APP processing in the cell. Using our novel molecular probe, we determined that starvation <b>induces</b> <b>trafficking</b> of APP and APP-carboxy-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs) to the degradative endo-lysosomal network. In line with this finding, suppression of mTOR signalling using AZD 8055 also strongly <b>induced</b> <b>trafficking</b> of APP to the endo-lysosomal system. Remarkably, activation of mTOR signalling via RHEB over-expression inhibited the starvation-induced autophagy but did not affect trafficking of tf-APP. These results show tf-APP can be used to determine how APP is trafficked through the lysosomal system of the cell. This molecular probe is therefore useful for determining the molecular mechanism behind the commitment of APP to the degradative pathway or for screening compounds that can induce this effect. This is important as clearance of APP and APP-CTF provides an important potential therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer's disease. Leanne K. Hein, Pirjo M. Apaja, Kathryn Hattersley, Randall H.
