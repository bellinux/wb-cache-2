2500|$|Construction of the {{new road}} deck and {{stiffening}} truss of the 1950 span was conducted differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in [...] long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high above the roadway level, upon which prefabricated stiffening truss assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. [...] After the traveling derricks (called [...] "layleg rigs" [...] by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled {{in a series of}} steps. On the new bridge, the stiffening truss featured a series of outer members called [...] "chords" [...] that formed {{the top and bottom of}} the stiffening truss. These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed. Next, an [...] deep stiffening truss [...] "floor beam" [...] perpendicular to the length of the bridge was installed at intervals of [...] (the distance between suspender cables; they were installed at each vertical beam member in the stiffening truss). These floor beams, each [...] wide, would form the upper lateral stiffening mechanism in the deck itself. After the floor beams were installed, at alternate <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> panel points a set of diagonal bracing struts were installed. Then, a series of lateral bracing struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight [...] deep I-beam [...] "stringers" [...] were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised [...] on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their [...] "jewels" [...] to the vertical stiffening truss members.|$|E

50|$|Several restorations were {{completed}} over the years. The wooden abutments were replaced with concrete {{some time after}} 1900. In 1904, new planks were laid over the oak floor. New wooden trusses were installed in 1933. In 1955, part of the floor was replaced and covered with crushed stone. In 1959, parts from an old Bailey truss bridge were used to replace the internal structure; metal parts were hidden by pine panels. The roof was re-shingled in 1987 and some beams were replaced in 1995 and 1996. In late 2012 to early 2013, a <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> replacement and some roof repairs {{were completed}}.|$|E
50|$|However, {{a revised}} {{planning}} application was {{submitted by the}} developer which reduced the proposed height by 4.66 m to 289.9 m (951.2 ft), due to possible interference with the flight paths of the nearby London City Airport.

In addition, {{the level of the}} soffit has been decreased and the viewing gallery height has been reduced, which was intended to be double height.

Kupets was {{expected}} to compete on <b>floor,</b> <b>beam,</b> and uneven bars; but a leg injury (later discovered to be a stress fracture in her hip) caused her to be suddenly withdrawn from the beam lineup. Mohini Bhardwaj took her place on the event, and Kupets competed only on bars and floor in the team final. She received the team's highest score on bars (9.662), putting the U.S. temporarily ahead of eventual winner Romania in the standings.

50|$|Decades of {{deferred}} maintenance caused {{the bridge to}} deteriorate significantly; by 1988, more than 200 cables in the suspension had snapped, and pieces of concrete were falling from the bridge. The bridge's structural integrity was rated as 1.6 out of a scale of 1 to 7. Inspectors were appointed to monitor the bridge's status and make temporary bridge closures based {{on the amount of}} stress placed on the bridge. The bridge was completely shut down to motor vehicle traffic and subway trains on April 11, 1988, after a painter noticed a large hole in a girder; upon further review, inspectors also discovered severe corrosion in a <b>floor</b> <b>beam.</b> The bridge was reopened in June 1988.|$|E
50|$|The {{project was}} {{initiated}} in 2009, when Beverly Hills Fire Chief Timothy J.

Around the beam, there are curved granite benches, meant for visitors to reflect upon the tragedy. Behind the beam, there are replicas of the Twin Towers, the Pentagon and the field near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. There are also stainless steel plaques with the names of the 2,977 lives lost that day. Construction of the monument was overseen by McCoy Construction. It was entirely funded by private donors, who collectively gave over US$600,000. Their names are inscribed on the monument, as can be seen on the picture.|$|E
50|$|The first mills were {{modelled}} on Lombe's Mill, {{there were}} austere brick buildings of 4, 5 or 6 storeys, {{similar to those}} found in the naval dockyards. They were 22 ft wide, to accommodate the Italian filatoio. By 1820 throwing was done on rectangular frames and the width of the building was dependent solely on the strength of the <b>floor</b> <b>beam.</b> Spans greater than 8 m needed to be supported by cast iron pillars. Silk does not require the fire-proof construction techniques essential for cotton so are lighter in construction. In 1820 Jacquard equipped looms entered the mills. These were significantly taller than previous looms so mills needed to be built with increased floor heights. These are instantly recognised by the tall windows.|$|E

50|$|Watson's {{plan and}} {{elevation}} document the bridge's structure. The two main cables were anchored about 50 {{feet above the}} water to the top story of White's manufactory on the east shore and to boughs of a tree on the west. Twenty-four pairs of suspender cables (hangers), about 16 feet apart, dropped from the main cables and attached {{to the ends of}} the wooden <b>floor</b> <b>beams.</b> Wooden joists spanned between the <b>floor</b> <b>beams,</b> creating a substructure that was decked with 2-foot planks. A pair of horizontal wires strung from shore to shore tied together the suspender cables and <b>floor</b> <b>beams,</b> and a second pair functioned as guardrails. Six guy-wires anchored the bridge to rocks in the river and on both shores. Another pair of guy-wires anchored the tree to other trees behind it. A guyed mast at mid-river, about twice the height of a man, functioned as the center suspender cable where the main cables dipped to the level of the deck. At each shore the narrow walkway was at ground level; over the river it was suspended about 16 feet above the water.|$|R
50|$|The {{concrete}} floor in most basements is structurally {{not part of}} the foundation; only the basement walls are. If there are posts supporting a main <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> to form a post and beam system, these posts typically go right through the basement floor to a footing underneath the basement floor. It is the footing that supports the post and the footing is part of the house foundation. Load-bearing wood-stud walls rest directly on the {{concrete floor}}. Under the concrete floor is typically gravel or crushed stone to facilitate draining. The floor is typically four inches (100 mm) thick and it rests on top of the foundation footings. The floor is typically sloped towards a drain point, in case of leaks.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{domestic}} scene, {{she has been}} a British Gymnastic Champion on three occasions, her first title being won at the age of 14, making her the youngest ever gymnast to win the senior title. Her worst noteworthy injury was when she broke her arm in 1995 at the junior British championships after falling off the uneven bars. During the resulting surgery, she had two plates and twelve bolts inserted in the injury. Six months later, she returned to claim the title of senior British champion. She then defended that title twice consecutively, a first for any gymnast. Lisa was the first British gymnast to ever win Gold at a Grand Prix event.
