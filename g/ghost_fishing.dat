50|$|Acute {{stressors}} can inflict other damage, via unsustainable {{fishing practices}}, boat anchors or accidental groundings. Some fishing practices are destructive to reef habitats, such as bottom trawling, dynamite fishing and cyanide fishing. <b>Ghost</b> <b>fishing</b> (unintended damage from abandoned fishing equipment) harms many coral reefs. Even small-scale fishing can damage reefs if herbivores are not removed and thereby {{not allowed to}} protect reefs from encroachment by algae. Boaters can damage coral by dropping their anchors on reefs instead of sand. Accidental boat groundings can obliterate areas of coral reef. Lettuce corals and branching corals such as elkhorn and finger coral are fragile, but even massive boulder corals can be crushed or broken and turned upside down to die by a sailboat keel. Groundings in sand, or even the churning action of propellers, can cause major localized siltation, indirectly killing adjacent corals.|$|E

40|$|Blue swimmer crabs (Portunus pelagicus) are an {{economically}} important crab caught in baited traps throughout the Indo-west Pacific and Mediterranean.

A lost contemporary, collapsible trawl mesh pot will catch between 3 and 223 R pelagicus per year after the bait has been exhausted, while a traditional wire mesh pot would catch 11 - 74 crabs peryear.

40|$|<b>Ghost</b> <b>fishing</b> and its {{consequences}} are little known in the French West Indies. In Guadeloupe, no allegation concerning <b>ghost</b> <b>fishing</b> was made public to date. In the absence of objective studies about this phenomenon, {{it is impossible to}} quantify the impact of these lost gears on the resource (Chaves et al. 2006). However, the characteristics of small-scale fishing existing in this area let think that it happens indeed that fishing machines are lost: - weather constraints, sometimes of catastrophic type (storms, hurricanes). The fishermen fix less racks (traps) during the period preceding the hurricane season in preparation for possible loss (Komla-Soukha and Bouchereau 2007). Of the 40 000 Caribbean traps around Guadeloupe, about 20 000 are lost each year during hurricane season, but continue to catch fish for many months (Burke and Maidens 2004); - accidents (most common causes after the literature) occurring during a fishing operation are events already well orally brought back (Macfayden et al. 2009); - the voluntary abandonment at sea of material by the fisherman for convenience reasons; - the consequences of conflicts of use (thefts, destruction of fishing gears, boardings of ships). It is the case in the Caribbean area in connection with the interactions related to the stake on resources exploitation (Blanchet et al. 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of 'ghost fishing' {{has been identified as}} a major issue in the capture fishing industry. The present study assesses the potential for <b>ghost</b> <b>fishing</b> in the creel (baited trap) fishery for Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus, one of the most valuable fished species in European waters. Baited creels were deployed and monitored at a shallow and a deep site for 363 and 217 d, respectively. Catch was counted at regular intervals by SCUBA diving at the shallow site and by periodically hauling creels at the deepwater site. Both trials showed that most captured species were able to escape from the creels, with only N. norvegicus being trapped {{for long periods of time}}, suggesting that creels are very selective for the target species. Dead target or non-target species within creels appeared to be ineffective at attracting additional N. norvegicus into the creels. It was concluded that, following the initial attraction to creels, once all the bait has been consumed, lost creels will cease to fish. The main reasons for the low <b>ghost</b> <b>fishing</b> performance of N. norvegicus creels may be the design of the creel itself (which allows non-target species to escape relatively easily), the behaviour of N. norvegicus restricting the number of animals entering the creels once the bait has been consumed, and the ability of N. norvegicus to survive for long periods of time once caught...|$|E
40|$|During trap-fishing {{investigations}} on {{the crab}} Cancer johngarthi along Baja California peninsula's southwestern coast, Baja California Sur, Mexico, conducted between 2002 and 2006, information was gathered to assess fishing efficiency {{in terms of}} the number of crabs caught per trap during one hour of operation (catch per unit of effort, CPUE = c/ht). As a result of vessel operation issues, some trap lines were abandoned, whereas vessels returned to land for repairing, and because the effective fishing time for these traps was significantly longer than normal, the information so obtained was regarded as reflecting the potential effect on fishing of traps lost during fishing operations (<b>ghost</b> <b>fishing).</b> Of 651 line sets analyzed, involving 45, 152 traps, 77 % had effective fishing times below 60 h, 14 % between 70 and 150 h and 9 % between 150 and 5, 500 h. There is an exponential reduction in CPUE with increasing fishing time that could be associated to trap saturation. The number of crabs per trap also decreased with immersion time, fitting a power function. After 1, 000 h of immersion, each trap may contain 7 – 18 crabs. Four hundred traps were lost over the course of 14 fishing trips.
