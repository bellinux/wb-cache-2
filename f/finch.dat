5|$|An {{accomplished}} woman, <b>Finch</b> gained {{her appointment}} as royal governess in August 1762 upon {{the birth of}} George, Prince of Wales, the eldest son of King George and Queen Charlotte. Finch's duties included oversight of the royal nursery and all the staff employed therein, as well as organising lessons for the children. <b>Finch</b> oversaw the princes' education until they became old enough to live in their own households under the watch of governors, while the six princesses remained under her supervision until they turned 21. <b>Finch</b> retired from her role in 1793, though she continued to correspond {{with members of the}} royal family and receive gifts from them.|$|E
5|$|Lady Charlotte <b>Finch</b> (née Fermor; 14 February 1725 – 11 July 1813) {{served as}} royal governess to the {{children}} of King George III and Queen Charlotte for over thirty years, holding the position from 1762 to 1793. She was born to Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and his wife Henrietta Louisa Jeffreys, both of whom held court appointments. The couple were educated and frequently travelled with their growing brood of children to the continent. Charlotte, like her sisters, was well-educated; in 1746, she married the Hon. William <b>Finch</b> and had issue including George <b>Finch,</b> 9th Earl of Winchilsea.|$|E

40|$|Determining the {{relative}} access {{of a species}} to critical limiting resources requires knowledge of the spectrum of their resource utilisation (niche space) and that of potential competitors, and the frequency distribution of resources in the environment. We used this theoretical framework to assess {{the relative}} access to nesting sites {{and the potential for}} interspecific competition between two sympatric cavity-nesting <b>finches.</b> Gouldian (Erythrura gouldiae) and Long-tailed (Poephila acuticauda) <b>Finches</b> are both estrildid <b>finches</b> with similar ecological requirements, gross morphology and geographical ranges. By measuring the characteristics of all tree-cavities in an area of breeding habitat, and identifying those used by each of the two species, we were able to quantify the relationship between total available variation and variation in use by Gouldian and Long-tailed <b>Finches.</b> Using a likelihood-based method, we found that Longtailed <b>Finches</b> exhibited a broader niche than Gouldian <b>Finches</b> with respect to available variation, and that these niches overlapped. Using these data we estimated that the effective availability of suitable nesting sites for Long-tailed <b>Finches</b> was 38 % greater than for Gouldian <b>Finches.</b> Their relatively specialised niche and overlap with a more generalist competitor has the potential to constrain reproduction for Gouldian <b>Finches,</b> and will have implications for the conservation of remaining populations of this endangered species. 8 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Evolutionary {{mismatch}} {{occurs in}} house <b>finches</b> {{when they are}} exposed to infectious individuals. Male house <b>finches</b> tend to feed in close proximity to other <b>finches</b> that are sick or diseased. This {{is due to the fact}} that sick individuals are less competitive than usual, in turn increasing the chances of the healthy male to win an aggressive interaction if it happens. To ensure that there is a lower possibility of losing a social confrontation, healthy <b>finches</b> are inclined to forage near individuals that are lethargic or listless due to disease. However, this disposition has created an evolutionary trap for the <b>finches</b> after the introduction of the MG disease in 1994. Since this disease is infectious, healthy <b>finches</b> will be in danger of contraction if they are in the vicinity of individuals that have previously developed the disease. The relatively short duration of the disease's introduction has caused an inability for the <b>finches</b> to adapt quickly enough to avoid nearing sick individuals, which ultimately results in the mismatch between their behavior and the changing environment.|$|R

40|$|We use genetic {{divergence}} at 16 microsatellite loci {{to investigate}} how geographical {{features of the}} Galápagos landscape structure island populations of Darwin’s <b>finches.</b> We compare the three most genetically divergent groups of Darwin’s <b>finches</b> comprising morphologically and ecologically similar allopatric populations: the cactus <b>finches</b> (Geospiza scandens and Geospiza conirostris), the sharp-beaked ground <b>finches</b> (Geospiza difficilis) and the warbler <b>finches</b> (Certhidea olivacea and Certhidea fusca). Evidence of reduced genetic diversity due to drift was limited to warbler <b>finches</b> on small, peripheral islands. Evidence of low levels of recent interisland migration was widespread throughout all three groups. The hypothesis of distance-limited dispersal received the strongest support in cactus and sharp-beaked ground <b>finches</b> as evidenced by patterns of isolation by distance, while warbler <b>finches</b> showed a weaker relationship. Support for the hypothesis that gene flow constrains morphological divergence was only found in one of eight comparisons within these groups. Among warbler <b>finches,</b> genetic divergence was relatively high while phenotypic divergence was low, implicating stabilizing selection rather than constraint due to gene flow. We conclude that the adaptive radiation of Darwin’s <b>finches</b> {{has occurred in the}} presence of ongoing but low levels of gene flow caused by distance-dependent interisland dispersal. Gene flow does not constrain phenotypic divergence, but may augment genetic variation and facilitate evolution due to natural selection. Both microsatellites and mtDNA agree in that subsets of peripheral populations of two older groups are genetically more similar to other species that underwent dramatic morphological change. The apparent decoupling of morphological and molecular evolution may be accounted for by a modification of Lack’s two-stage model of speciation: relative ecological stasis in allopatry followed by secondary contact, ecological interactions and asymmetric phenotypic divergence...|$|R
40|$|Wildzebra <b>finches</b> use {{distance}} {{calls in}} a wide variety of contexts including flight, mild alarm, perching, and courtship. The call is also thought to allow paired males and females to maintain contact in large flocks. The purpose of this study is to compare the acoustic structure of distance calls of wild and domesticated zebra <b>finches.</b> We analyzed distance calls from our own colony and combined the results of this analysis with the findings from two other published studies on distance calls of domesticated <b>finches.</b> The results from these studies were compared to earlier research on the distance calls of wild zebra <b>finches.</b> Overall, domesticated male and female zebra <b>finches</b> produce calls that have longer duration, lower fundamental frequency, and higher frequency of maximum amplitude than those of wild zebra <b>finches.</b> These differences were generally consistent across different domesticated populations. Domesticated males produce distance calls in which the frequency modulation of the noise element is substantially different from the noise element of wild males. Furthermore, there was little consistency in the structure and location of the male's noise element across different domesficated populations. It remains to be demonstrated whether these changes have altered the function of this call in domesticated <b>finches.</b> ...|$|R

He further reveals that Creedy, a leader of the Norsefire Party, released the virus onto English soil, killing 100,000 British residents and framing the outbreak as an attack by a terrorist organisation. The Party, which promised security in times of social instability, used the ensuing wave of fear to elevate Sutler to the newly created office of High Chancellor and win an overwhelming majority in Parliament, becoming the elected government. <b>Finch</b> later discovers the man he met was V in disguise, and though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is severely shaken.|$|E

25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian <b>finches</b> often join mixed flocks consisting of long-tailed <b>finches</b> and masked <b>finches.</b> This {{is probably a}} defense against predation. Flocks used to consist of up to 1,000–2,000 individuals. During {{the breeding}} season they are usually found on rough scree slopes where vegetation is sparse. In the dry season, they are more nomadic and will move to wherever there is food and water.|$|R
50|$|The {{orange weaver}} is {{commonly}} kept in aviculture. They are quite hardy for small birds. Like all <b>finches,</b> {{they should be}} kept in groups.

However, individual orange weavers can become quite aggressive during breeding season. Because of this, the aggressive <b>finches</b> must sometimes be separated from the group. Orange weavers should be fed a diet that is a balanced mixture of small cereal seeds, fresh greens and some live foods, such as meal worms.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} whether wing morphology differed {{between the}} sedentary House <b>Finches</b> (Carpodacus mexicanus) of western North America and the introduced population of eastern North America, {{as the latter}} has developed migratory behavior since its inception. Wing morphology differed between eastern and western House <b>Finches.</b> Eastern House <b>Finches</b> had shorter proximal primaries and a longer outer primary, perhaps reflecting a thinner and more pointed wing, although no disparity in wing length was detected. Since we interpret these differences in wing shape as modifications for flight capability, we believe that initial evidence for morphological divergence relative to migratory habit between eastern and western House <b>Finches</b> has been established here. Confirmatory studies to determine if wing morphology varies according to the gradient in expression of migratory behavior throughout the range of eastern House <b>Finches</b> are now warranted...|$|R

40|$|Zebra <b>finches</b> {{have been}} a rich {{experimental}} system for studying neurobiological questions of relevance to human health for decades. In particular, <b>finches</b> are the leading nonhuman model organisms for investigating the biological basis of vocal learning, a critical behavioral substrate for speech acquisition.

Despite their importance for neurobiology, the usefulness of <b>finches</b> as an experimental system has been restricted by a lack of genetic manipulation methods. To overcome this barrier, our laboratory has developed methods for generating transgenic birds, including zebra <b>finches.</b> The successful implementation of this transgenic technology by multiple research laboratories has the potential to dramatically accelerate the progress of our understanding of the genetic basis of complex biological processes such as vocal learning. Moreover, the ability to genetically manipulate zebra <b>finches</b> could also be used to generate novel genetic models for human disorders that cannot be studied elsewhere or that can be more easily studied in this small bird. Here, we describe a protocol to generate transgenic zebra <b>finches</b> using recombinant lentiviruses...|$|R

30|$|Although {{fire effects}} were detected, these were muted within current fire regimes {{experienced}} in the region, and {{it is unlikely that}} appreciable impacts would occur on S. stipoideum seed availability to Gouldian <b>finches</b> while breeding.

Early dry season fires maximize Sorghum spp. seed abundance. These findings support the implementation of low intensity early dry season burning to promote optimal food and breeding resources for threatened <b>finches.</b>|$|R
