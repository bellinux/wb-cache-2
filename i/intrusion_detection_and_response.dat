This paper is an initial look at the relatively unexplored terrain of using mobile agents for <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> <b>response.</b> It looks not only at the benefits derived from mobility, but also those associated with software agent technology.

The first issue is mainly focused on the consideration of a stochastic approach to model the normal behavior of the network system to be monitored and protected. This anomaly-based detection methodology is combined with a signature-based one, thus resulting in a hybrid detection system, {{in order to improve}} the overall detection throughput. On the other hand, a honeysystem-based approach is also introduced to deal with the development of a pro-active response mechanism in the context of <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> technologies.

40|$|Current network {{security}} tools generally lack sufficient context for maintaining a well informed and proactive defense posture. Vulnerabilities are usually assessed in isolation, without considering how {{they contribute to}} overall attack risk. Similarly, intrusion alarms are logged as isolated events, with limited correlation capabilities. Security professionals are overwhelmed by constant threats, complexity of security data, and network growth. Our approach to network defense applies attack graphs for advanced vulnerability analysis <b>and</b> <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection.</b> Attack graphs map paths of vulnerability, showing how attackers can incrementally penetrate a network. We can then identify critical vulnerabilities and provide strategies for protection of critical network assets. Because of operational constraints, vulnerability paths may often remain. The residual attack graph then guides optimal <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> attack <b>response.</b> This includes optimal placement of <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> sensors, correlating <b>intrusion</b> alarms, accounting for missed <b>detections,</b> prioritizing alarms, <b>and</b> predicting next possible attack steps. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{emerging}} malware {{that can}} spread through local wireless networks among mobile devices {{has so far}} received less attention than computer worms in the Internet. The local wireless links provide an alternative propagation path that circumvents <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> at the service provider gateways. On the mobile nodes, conventional <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> <b>intrusion</b> <b>response</b> techniques such as address blacklisting and content filtering {{are more difficult to}} deploy {{due to the lack of}} central entities and the resource constraints of mobile nodes. We propose a new architecture for an intrusion response system that takes advantage of an infrastructure network (e. g., cell phone network) to manage security of the mobile nodes. Infection patterns in ad hoc networks are highly correlated with geographic proximity. Thus an ecologically inspired diffusion-reaction and advection models can provide estimates for the current spread of the worm. These estimates allow the service provider to precisely target a containment response. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{analysis}} of security defense processes {{is of utmost}} importance {{in the management of}} various cyber-security attacks, which are increasing in scope and rapidity. Organizations need to optimize their resources based on a sound understanding of the level of their security defense processes' efficiency and the impact of their investment. Modeling and characterization of the dynamics of cyber security management are essential to risk prediction, damage assessment, and resource allocations. This dissertation addresses the interactions between human factors and information systems. On the basis of the spiral life cycle model of software development processes, we develop a realistic, holistic security attack-defense model - Man-Machine Model (M 3), which combines human factors and information systems' (i. e., machine) states under an integrated analytical framework. M 3 incorporates man and machine components. The man component is comprised of several variables such as Skill & Knowledge (SKKN) and Teamwork Quality (TWQ). The machine component is composed of variables such as traffic volume and the amount of downtime. M 3 enables the {{analysis of}} <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> incident <b>response</b> process efficiency, i. e., security defense team performance. With data analysis, we formulate and test four major research hypotheses based on the data collected during security experiments. Through hypothesis testing, we evaluate regression models to estimate the security defense team performance (i. e. efficiency) at different levels of human intelligence (e. g., skill and knowledge) and teamwork (e. g., teamwork quality). We assess the fitness and significance of the regression models, and verify their assumptions. Based on these results, organizations can hire those who have an appropriate level of skill and knowledge when it concerns investments to increase the level of skill and knowledge of security personnel. They also can attempt to increase the level of skill and knowledge of security personnel...|$|R

Therefore, this technology has also become attractive for tactical networks, such as in command posts, vehicle convoys, autonomous robot systems, and also for infantry troops. Due to its radio characteristics, it is widely known that MANETs may become subject to different kinds of attacks against their availability and against the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the information that is transmitted, processed, and stored on their devices. In terms of information assurance, many protective measures need to be applied to these networks in order to make them deployable even for critical missions - in terms of <b>intrusion</b> prevention, <b>detection,</b> resistance, <b>and</b> <b>response.</b> MITE (MANET <b>Intrusion</b> <b>Detection</b> for Tactical Environments) is a collaborative research project that aims at developing prototypical solutions for <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> in MANETs - especially in tactical scenarios.

40|$|Abstract—The {{design of}} {{automated}} online security and intru-sion tolerance solutions for computer systems and networks is a theoretically achievable objective. However, {{after two decades}} of research, this objective has still not yet successfully passed the practicality test to become widely adopted. We believe that the main reason behind this gap lies in the misleading definition of autonomous security that precludes human intervention in trying to achieve unrealistic level of full automation. In this position paper, we discuss a novel research direction to address this challenge through a coherent integration of human intelligence. In particular, we identify the key questions to be answered in order to enable human intelligence to be leveraged in a seamless manner and without requiring explicit heavy human involvements. We illustrate our discussion through the preliminary design of a semi-automated <b>intrusion</b> <b>detection</b> <b>and</b> <b>response</b> system that incorporates reasonable human input to achieve higher levels of intrusion tolerance efficiency.

40|$|Modern {{intrusions}} {{are often}} across {{sites that are}} not under centralized control. Most of the successful intruders launch attacks by breaking into a chain of systems to hide their identity. That's why information sharing among such systems is vital if such attacks are to be identi ed, analyzed later and their source correctly traced back. Also data sharing and coordination is required to identify and respond to attacks in progress which are usually launched from unrelated domains, e. g., Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Although system administrators share information among themselves there hasn't been much work done {{in the area of}} automated cooperative ID&R (<b>Intrusion</b> <b>Detection</b> <b>and</b> <b>Response).</b> One of the primary factors behind this is that no frameworks exist for domains without a central administration to safely and conveniently share data that may be used to track distributed intrusions and respond to them.
