5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in the Unified Rules, referees often had differences in <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition {{and argued that}} elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
5|$|The Maya {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. The Maya had such a broad <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. The Maya interpretation of deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
5|$|The {{processes}} {{responsible for}} the exceptional preservational quality of the Burgess Shale fossils are far from clear. The <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is preserved depends partly on two issues that are interlinked: whether the animals were buried where they lived, or washed long distances by sediment flows; and whether the water at the burial sites was anoxic or provided enough oxygen to sustain animals. The traditional view is that soft bodies and organs could only be preserved in anoxic conditions, otherwise oxygen-breathing bacteria would have made decomposition too rapid for fossilization. This would imply that the sea-floor organisms could not have lived there. However, in 2006 Caron and Jackson concluded that the sea-floor animals were buried where they lived. One of their main reasons was that many fossils represented partially decayed soft-bodied animals such as polychaetes, which had already died shortly before the burial event, {{and would have been}} fragmented if they had been transported any significant distance by a storm of swirling sediment. Other evidence for burial where the animals had lived includes the presence of tubes and burrows, and of assemblies of animals preserved while they fed – such as a group of carnivorous priapulids clustered round a freshly moulted arthropod whose new cuticle would not yet have hardened. Fossilized swimming organisms were also buried immediately below where they lived.|$|E

25|$|Later {{examples}} of the Italianate style in England tend to {{take the form of}} Palladian-style building often enhanced by a belvedere tower complete with Renaissance-type balustrading at the roof level.

25|$|The Sangha is {{the third}} of the Three Jewels in Buddhism. Common over all schools is that the āryasaṅgha is the {{foremost}} form of this third jewel. As for recognizable current-life forms, the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is the Jewel depends on how a school defines Sangha. E.g. for many schools, monastic life is considered to provide the safest and most suitable environment for advancing toward enlightenment and liberation due to the temptations and vicissitudes {{of life in the}} world.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, Ireland has the {{greatest}} number of known sheela na gigs. At one time, they were mistakenly thought to be a uniquely Irish practice, however, scholars realized that the sheela na gig motif could be found all over western and central Europe. Accurate numbers of figures are difficult to reach, as the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is a sheela na gig will vary among scholars. For example, Freitag omits the Rochester figure from her list while Weir and Jerman include it. Concannon includes some worn figures that so far only she has identified as sheela na gigs. With renewed interest in the topic, scholars have recently identified previously unknown figures, so more could be discovered.|$|E

25|$|In September 2005, a {{petition}} was {{submitted to the}} towns of Queensbury and Fort Ann, citing taxes, unfair assessments, and callous indifference from officials of both towns as reasons for village incorporation. The map of the proposed village was deemed invalid, halting the incorporation process. In 2007, a second petition was submitted but ruled legally insufficient because certain petition signatures were not dated. In March 2009, a third petition was submitted and subsequently rejected because there weren't enough signatures from Fort Ann residents. Additionally, the town supervisors stated {{that a number of}} signatures appeared more than once or were improperly witnessed. It was noted that the petition did meet all of the requirements of the New York State Village Law, however, with respect to Queensbury's section of the proposed village. According to the Village Incorporation Committee spokesperson, a lawsuit was filed against the towns for the supervisors' refusal to approve the petition based on their <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> constitutes a 'resident'.|$|E
500|$|As the Libyan Civil War took place, Clinton's {{shift in}} favor of {{military}} intervention aligned her with Ambassador to the UN Susan Rice and National Security Council figure Samantha Power and was a key turning point in overcoming internal administration opposition from Defense Secretary Gates, security advisor Thomas E. Donilon and counterterrorism advisor John Brennan in gaining the backing for and Arab and U.N. approval of, the 2011 military intervention in Libya. Secretary Clinton testified to Congress that the administration did not need congressional authorization for its military intervention in Libya, despite objections from some members of both parties that the administration was violating the War Powers Resolution and the State Department's legal advisor argued the same when the Resolution's 60-day limit for unauthorized wars was passed (a view that prevailed in a legal debate within the Obama administration). Clinton later used U.S. allies and what she called [...] "convening power" [...] to promote unity among the Libyan rebels as they eventually overthrew the Gaddafi regime. The aftermath of the Libyan Civil War saw the country becoming a failed state, and {{the wisdom of the}} intervention and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> happened afterward would become the subject of considerable debate.|$|E
500|$|Lara Croft's 1996 debut {{is often}} cited as a {{catalyst}} for more female leads in video games. Kaiser Hwang of PlayStation Magazine commented that she [...] "brought girl power" [...] to video games. IGN argued that Croft helped redefine gender in video games by providing a different <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> women could do. Several publications have used her as the standard to which later female video game characters have been compared. Video game publications like PlayStation Magazine, IGN, Edge, and PlayStation: The Official Magazine have labelled the character a video game and cultural icon. Jeremy Smith credits Croft with exposing the Tomb Raider games and video games in general to a wider audience. Computer and Video Games commented that Croft's appearance on the cover of The Face signalled a change in the perception of video games from [...] "geeky" [...] to mainstream. The character is honoured in the British city Derby, previous home to Core Design. In 2007, Radleigh Homes placed a blue plaque for Croft at the site of Core Design's former offices, now a block of flats. The Derby City Council opened a public vote in 2009 to name its new ring road. The winning choice, with 89% of over 27,000 votes, was [...] "Lara Croft Way", and opened in July 2010.|$|E

[...] Second, the dissent emphasized the importance of political speech and the need to foster [...] "national debate about a serious issue".

2500|$|A {{schematic}} (non-quantitative) curve {{was used}} to represent temperature variations over the last 1000 years in chapter 7.

The section specifically states recent climate changes were in a range of probably less than 2°C. [...] The 1990 report noted that it was not clear whether all the fluctuations indicated were truly global (p 202). The graph had no clear source (but can be traced to publications by Hubert Lamb representing the Central England Temperature; those publications have no explicit calibration against instrumental data, [...] just Lamb’s qualitative judgement and <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he refers to as the ‘evidence’ [...] ), and disappeared from the 1992 supplementary report.|$|E
