40|$|There {{are various}} ways to {{estimate}} rock strength from geophysical borehole data. Most previous approaches require {{an understanding of}} the properties of the intact rock and of the defects within it. <b>Geophysical</b> <b>logs</b> can be used to estimate both of these properties. In this paper, we use two approaches based on the Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Self Organizing Maps (SOM) methods to estimate rock strength from the specialist nuclear SIROLOG (spectrometric natural gamma, Prompt Gamma Neutron Activation) and conventional <b>geophysical</b> <b>logs</b> in anticipation that better performance can be achieved. The RBF and SOM approaches do not depend on any pre-existing assumptions or models, but estimate the rock strength based on parameters and relationships derived from the internal structure and relationships within the <b>geophysical</b> <b>logging</b> data set. Our RBF and SOM methods can readily accommodate variations in rock characteristics; but their performance largely depends on the completeness of the range of lithologic variation in an available control data base.

30|$|Lithology {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} data in evaluating reservoir, and is mainly carried out by cores recovery in laboratory which is very expensive, and its interpretation is time consuming. Accurate identification of lithology is fundamentally crucial to evaluate reservoir from <b>geophysical</b> <b>log</b> data. Pattern recognition and statistical analysis have been proved to be the most powerful methods for constructing optimal model in lithology recognition. To address this issue, a fast and practical K-means clustering algorithm is proposed in order to better deal with lithology recognition from <b>geophysical</b> <b>log</b> data. Based on the traditional K-means clustering algorithm, Euclidean distance is replaced by Mahalanobis distance; the initial cluster centers are acquired from the average of characteristic values but not selected randomly, in addition, adding weight value in each characteristic value of the objective function, and thus a lithology recognition model named modified K-means clustering is established. The method is applied to identify the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Main Hole (CCSD-MH) metamorphic rocks. Compared with the traditional K-means clustering, the accurate rate of the modified K-means clustering in lithologic identification has improved for the same 45 samples, raised 11.11  %. According to the modified K-means cluster algorithm, nine kinds of lithology cluster centers are acquired from 45 samples. The classes of the samples can be determined by analyzing the hamming approach degree curves, which is calculated by the undetermined samples and 9 cluster centers. The predicted results and the core recovery are exactly the same by comparison. The hamming approach degree can identify the whole well of CCSD-MH lithology effectively and accurately. This model may be made applications to other areas.|$|E

40|$|This study {{documents}} the stratigraphic {{evolution of the}} Castagnola ponded turbidite mini-basin through analysis of a detailed base-to-top section measured in {{the central part of}} the basin. Vertical variations in facies characteristics, thickness ratio of mud cap vs. sandstone of event beds and net/gross are argued to be good proxies for pinpointing the stratigraphic transition from dominantly ponded deposition, where most of the flow is trapped by the confining topography, to a flow-stripping - dominated phase in which an increasingly large part of incoming flows can escape the basin by spilling over the enclosing topography. Thickness statistics of sandstones and mud caps of event beds from the case study show that in the initial stage of turbidite deposition only part of the mud of exceptionally large volume flows escaped the confining topography; as the basin was progressively infilled, nearly all inbound flows were affected by flow stripping, with part of the sand and most of the mud escaping the basin. In the latest recorded stage of deposition the abundance of by-pass features coupled with significant modification of the sandstone bed thickness population suggests that the turbidite system was no longer obstructed frontally, and could step forward onto a healed topography. In order to assess whether the documented trends of turbidite bed characteristics indicative of the 'fill to spill' transition could be recognised from wireline log data alone, synthetic logs were prepared by up-scaling the field data to resolutions typical of borehole <b>geophysical</b> <b>log</b> data.
