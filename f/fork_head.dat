5000|$|The <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> protein of Drosophila melanogaster, a {{transcription}} factor that promotes terminal rather than segmental development, contains neither homeodomains nor zinc-fingers characteristic of other {{transcription factor}}s. Instead, {{it contains a}} distinct type of DNA-binding region, containing around 100 amino acids, which has since been identified {{in a number of}} transcription factors (including D. melanogaster FD1-5, mammalian HNF3, human HTLF, Saccharomyces cerevisiae HCM1, etc.). This {{is referred to as the}} <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> domain but is also known as a [...] "winged helix". The <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> domain binds B-DNA as a monomer, but shows no similarity to previously identified DNA-binding motifs. Although the domain is found in several different transcription factors, a common function is their involvement in early developmental decisions of cell fates during embryogenesis. Members of the class O of forkhead box transcription factors (FoxO) have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance and probably lifespan.|$|E

50|$|FoxI1e/Xema {{belongs to}} the FoxI1 class of <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> {{transcription}} factor family, known to participate in mesoderm formation, eye development and ventral head specification. It has been proposed that Notch and/or NODAL, expressed in the vegetal/mesoderm region of the early blastula embryo, could potentially be the inhibitors of FoxI1e.|$|E
5000|$|The MBD domain forms a wedge and {{attaches}} to the methylated CpG sites on the DNA strands. The TRD region then reacts with SIN3A to recruit histone deacetylases (HDAC). [...] There are also unusual, repetitive sequences found at the carboxyl terminus. This region {{is closely related to}} the <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> family, at the amino acid level.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer {{factors can}} also {{actively}} affect transcription by directly opening up condensed chromatin in an ATP-independent process. This {{is a common}} trait of <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> factors as they contain a winged helix DNA-binding domain that mimics the DNA-binding domain of the linker H1 histone. [...] The similarity to histone H1 explains how {{it is able to}} bind chromatin by interacting with the major groove of only the one available side of DNA wrapped around a nucleosome. [...] <b>Fork</b> <b>head</b> domains also have a helix that confers sequence specificity unlike linker histone. [...] The C terminus is associated with higher mobility around the nucleosome than linker histone, displacing it and rearranging nucleosomal landscapes effectively. [...] This active re-arrangement of the nucleosomes allows for other transcription factors to bind the available DNA. In thyroid cell differentiation FoxE binds to compacted chromatin of the thyroid peroxidase promoter and opens it for NF1 binding.|$|E

50|$|FOXO3 {{belongs to}} the O {{subclass}} of the forkhead family of transcription factors which are characterized by a distinct <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> DNA-binding domain. There are three other FoxO family members in humans, FOXO1, FOXO4 and FOXO6. These transcription factors share {{the ability to be}} inhibited and translocated out of the nucleus on phosphorylation by proteins such as Akt/PKB in the PI3K signaling pathway (aside from FOXO6, which may be constitutively nuclear). Other post-translational modifications including acetylation and methylation are seen and can result in increased or altered FOXO3a activity.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer {{factors are}} {{transcription}} {{factors that can}} directly bind condensed chromatin. They can have positive and negative effects on transcription and are important in recruiting other transcription factors and histone modification enzymes as well as controlling DNA methylation. They were first discovered in 2002 as factors capable of binding to target sites on nucleosomal DNA in compacted chromatin and endowing competency for gene activity during hepatogenesis. [...] Pioneer factors are involved in initiating cell differentiation and activation of cell-specific genes. This property is observed in <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> box (FOX), Groucho TEL, and in Gal4 transcription factors.|$|E
5000|$|The {{correlation}} between pioneer factors and cancer {{has led to}} prospective therapeutic targeting. In knockdown studies in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line {{it was found that}} decreasing pioneer factors FoxA1 and AP2 decreased ER signalling. [...] Other <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> proteins have been associated with cancer, including FoxO3 and FoxM that repress the cell survival pathways Ras and PPI3K/AKT/IKK. [...] Drugs such as Paclitaxel, Imatinib, and doxorubicin which activate FoxO3a or its targets are being used. Modification to modulate related factors with pioneer activity is a topic of interest in the early stages as knocking down pioneer factors may have toxic effects through alteration of the lineage pathways of healthy cells.|$|E

50|$|FOXO1 {{belongs to}} the {{forkhead}} family of transcription factors that are characterized by a distinct <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> domain. The specific function of this gene {{has not yet been}} determined; however, it {{may play a role in}} myogenic growth and differentiation. FOXO1 is essential for the maintenance of human ESC pluripotency. This function is probably mediated through direct control by FOXO1 of OCT4 and SOX2 gene expression through occupation and activation of their respective promoters. In hepatic cells this transcription factor seems to increase the expression of PEPCK and glycogen-6-phosphatase (the same enzymes that are blocked via the metformin/AMPK/SHP pathway). Blocking this transcription factor offers an opportunity for novel therapies for diabetes mellitus. In pancreatic alpha-cells FOXO1 is important in regulating prepro-glucagon expression. In pancreatic beta cells FOXO1 mediates glucagon-like peptide-1 effects on pancreatic beta-cell mass.|$|E
50|$|Establishing body axes is a {{critical}} step in animal development. During mouse embryonic development, Nodal, a transforming growth factor-beta superfamily ligand, is a key gene involved in patterning both the anterior-posterior axis and the left-right axis of the early embryo. The Nodal gene contains two enhancers: the Proximal Epiblast Enhancer (PEE) and the Asymmetric Enhancer (ASE). The PEE is upstream of the Nodal gene and drives Nodal expression in {{the portion of the}} primitive streak that will differentiate into the node (also referred to as the primitive node). The PEE turns on Nodal expression in response to a combination of Wnt signaling plus a second, unknown signal; thus, a member of the LEF/TCF transcription factor family likely binds to a TCF binding site in the cells in the node. Diffusion of Nodal away from the node forms a gradient which then patterns the extending anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. The ASE is an intronic enhancer bound by the <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> domain transcription factor Fox1. Early in development, Fox1-driven Nodal expression establishes the visceral endoderm. Later in development, Fox1 binding to the ASE drives Nodal expression {{on the left side of}} the lateral plate mesoderm, thus establishing left-right asymmetry necessary for asymmetric organ development in the mesoderm.|$|E
40|$|The Drosophila <b>Fork</b> <b>head</b> protein {{participates in}} salivary gland formation, since salivary glands are missing in <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> embryos. Here {{we show that}} the <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> encoded protein binds to an {{upstream}} regulatory region of the larval salivary gland glue protein gene Sgs 3. Mobility shift assay {{in the presence of}} an anti-Fork head antibody demonstrated that the <b>Fork</b> <b>head</b> factor interacts with the TGTTTGC box shown to be involved in tissue-specific Sgs 3 expression. Experiments employing a set of oligonucleotide competitors revealed that <b>Fork</b> <b>head</b> binding was prevented by the same single base substitutions that were previously shown to interfere with the TGTTTGC element function in vivo. Furthermore, the anti-Fork head antibody bound to > 60 sites of polytene chromosomes, including the puffs of all Sgs genes and <b>Fork</b> <b>head</b> protein was detected in the nuclei of salivary glands of larvae of all examined stages. These data provide experimental evidence for the hypothesis that the protein encoded by the <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> gene is required initially for salivary gland formation and is utilized subsequently in the control of larval genes specifically expressed in this organ...|$|E
5000|$|In the Minas Basin area of Nova Scotia, {{digging for}} soft-shelled clams is usually {{done with a}} clam hack, a spading fork with its short handle bent perpendicularly away from the <b>fork's</b> <b>head.</b> A digger {{typically}} uses the hack by grasping {{the spine of the}} prongs in one hand and the handle of the fork in the other to push the hack down into the mud, clay, or sand and then pull it up and towards him/herself.

40|$|AbstractWe have {{isolated}} a novel mouse gene, MFH- 1 (mesenchyme <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> 1) that {{is related}} to the Drosophila <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> and rat HNF 3 genes. MFH- 1 encodes a distinct <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> domain that is classified into a distinct subfamily. A recombinant MFH- 1 protein could bind to the HNF 3 binding site. MFH- 1 is expressed temporally in developing embryos, first in the non-notochordal mesoderm and later in areas of mesenchymal condensation in the trunk, head, and limbs.

40|$|We have characterised orthologues of {{the genes}} <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> and goosecoid in the {{gastropod}} Patella vulgata. In this species, the anterior-posterior (AP) axis is determined just before gastrulation, and leads to the specification of two mesodermal components {{on each side of}} the presumptive endoderm, one anterior (ectomesoderm), and one posterior (endomesoderm). Both <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> and goosecoid are expressed from the time the AP axis is specified, up to the end of gastrulation. <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> mRNA is detected in the whole endoderm, as well as in the anterior mesoderm, whereas goosecoid is only expressed anteriorly, in the three germ layers. The two genes are thus coexpressed in the anterior mesoderm, suggesting the latter's homology with vertebrate prechordal mesoderm. In addition, since prechordal plate is known to belong to an anterior, so called "head organiser", and since its inductive role is dependent on the function of the vertebrate <b>fork</b> <b>head</b> and goosecoid orthologues, we further suggest that the anterior mesoderm may also have a role in anterior inductive patterning in Spiralia. Finally, we propose that a mode of axial development involving two organisers, one anterior and one posterior, is ancestral to the Bilateria, and that both organisers evolved from the single head organiser of a putative hydra-like ancestor...|$|E
