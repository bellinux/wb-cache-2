5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b> If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E

25|$|In {{a recent}} study (published May 1, 2013), it is {{suggested}} that the inflammation of the hypothalamus may be connected to our overall aging bodies. They focused on the activation of the protein complex NF-κB in mice test subjects, which showed increased activation as mice test subjects aged in the study.

The film notes that Bush's chief of staff Andrew Card had recently been head of the American Automobile Manufacturers Alliance in California and then joined the White House with Dick Cheney, Condoleezza Rice, and other federal officials who were former executives or board members of oil and auto companies.

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{a seminal}} case {{applying}} this principle is R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Venables (1997).

25|$|Back at St Mary's the {{following}} week, the Saints hosted current champions Manchester City in the return {{game of the}} opening match of the season. The game began relatively quickly, and within seven minutes the hosts had scored as Jason Puncheon took advantage of a mistake by Gareth Barry to cross in for Jay Rodriguez; the effort was saved, but Puncheon followed it up {{from the edge of}} the area to put Southampton 1–0 up. The home side continued the pressure on the visitors, and in the 22nd minute Steven Davis made it two when Joe Hart failed to catch a shot from Rickie Lambert with the midfielder running into the box for the tap-in. Rodriguez almost scored a third for Southampton, volleying narrowly wide, but City replied before the break with a counter-attack goal from Edin Džeko set up by Pablo Zabaleta. The half ended with a strong penalty call for Southampton, and after the break the Saints continued to play for a third goal; it came quickly, as Barry's bad fortunes continued when he turned Lambert's cross into his own net despite very little pressure on the ball to make it 3–1 to the 16th-placed side. Despite a change in personnel and tactics, City were unable to get back into the game <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>way,</b> giving Southampton their first win since 12 January to move up to 15th.|$|E

500|$|In medicine, {{consciousness}} is examined using {{a set of}} procedures known as neuropsychological assessment.

500|$|In {{contrast}} to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn {{argued that it}} was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself does not make it unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so [...] "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise." [...] While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b> As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.|$|E

500|$|The song {{begins with}} drummer Questlove's off-beat, cross-snare clicks {{on the two}} and four beat with a messy kick. Music critic Steve McPherson noted that its first two {{measures}} sound [...] "like a disaster", contrasting its solid groove. While most musical compositions rely on tension and release, which can be produced by factors such as soft verses and loud choruses, gradual buildup, sublte tension within verses or {{over the course of}} the bridge, or harmonic tension in chords that provides space for improvisation, D'Angelo's arrangements subdivide the tension into each moment of the song. According to McPherson, this results in [...] "no linear way to measure how far off things slide before they pull themselves back ... can't be measured in beats or fractions of beats <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>meaningful</b> <b>way.</b> For lack of a less cliched word, it's entirely 'feel'". Similar to most of the song's album, Voodoo, [...] "Untitled (How Does It Feel)" [...] has this syncopation style as its center. D'Angelo's casual vocal style follows the same concept, applying it to melody, harmony, and phrasing, and is accompanied by falsetto climbs and skittery phrasing similar to Prince's singing.|$|E

The Guardians Paul Rees expressed the opinion that asking forwards to take kicks at goal [...] "is demanding something not only unnatural but untried and it turned a rousing semi-final into a pantomime, an unnecessarily demeaning way of settling the issue."
