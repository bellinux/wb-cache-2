50|$|The R17, {{like many}} older New York City Subway cars {{built for the}} A Division, also {{features}} two sets of mid-carbody passenger windows on each side. Normally arranged in two pairs of three on the R15, on the R17 one set of windows on each side contains a rollsign {{in lieu of a}} third window. The sign contains three readings arranged vertically on its box - the top two being the train's terminals, and the bottom being the train's route. This window and signbox pattern, first appearing on the R16 became the blueprint for the later R21 and R22, the Redbirds, and even influenced the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> still in service today. The R32 fleet uses a similar rollsign design to that first found on the R16.|$|E
50|$|In {{his time}} at Fuore, Himmel {{made a lot of}} {{industrial}} design, too. Panasonic signed a strategic relationship with Fuore. Out of it, Himmel created such things as a cell-phone, an mp3-player, a home cinema system, a telephone, an air conditioner and other white goods for Panasonic. He also worked for companies such as LG and Samsung. Another field was transportation design, especially the exterior and interior <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains.</b> For example, Himmel developed the design of a new high-speed train for Talgo. He also designed interiors of airplanes. His ‘biggest’ project was a cruise liner for an American ocean carrier. Furthermore, he also did a lot of work in the motorcycle industry. He designed nearly every kind of size, from the scooter up to the superbike, including {{the development of a new}} design language for the world’s biggest motorcycle producer Honda. A great pleasure for him was the work for the luxury industry, especially for TAG Heuer. Moreover, he designed a bath ceramic series, for example for Roca.|$|E

In urban railways, capacity is determined by station stops, including the physical dimensions of trains and platforms, and the behaviour of passengers. Previous research has identified a range of factors which affect the rates at which passengers alight from, and board, trains, but train door width {{may not be as}} significant a factor as once thought. Using data from a worldwide set of operational surveys, this paper sets out a number of hypotheses to explain this, noting that other constraints (including difficulties in measuring passenger movement rates, the interior <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> and (crucially) the positioning of boarding passengers on platforms) may be more important...|$|E

40|$|Coupled {{systems of}} partial {{differential}} equations (PDE's) and differential-algebraic equations (DAE's) are of actual interest in various practical applications. From {{this point of}} view we have recently studied the interaction of pantograph and catenary in high speed trains [15]. To stimulate further research on this topic we formulate in the present paper a simplified model problem that reflects basic parts of the nonlinear dynamics in the technical system pantograph/catenary. Following the method of lines the equations of motion are semi-discretized in space using finite differences. For time discretization, typical DAE techniques are applied such as index reduction, projection steps and handling of systems with varying structure. 1 Introduction The increasing speed of modern high speed trains causes challenging problems in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains,</b> tracks, and catenaries.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research {{consisting of}} experiments {{and analysis of}} fire development in a passenger train carriage. The aim {{of this research is}} to use experiments, particularly a full-scale passenger train fire experiment, to increase understanding of fire behaviour in passenger trains and evaluate existing design fire estimation methods applied to passenger trains. A design fire represents a fire development scenario in terms of a heat release rate (HRR) vs time curve. The design fire is the most critical input affecting fire safety <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains,</b> tunnels and surrounding infrastructure. Large fires involving at least an entire carriage are rare but can result in severe consequences and require design consideration. Current understanding of fire development on passenger trains is limited. Very limited experimental research has been conducted, particularly full-scale HRR measurement of entire carriages. As a result, existing methods for design fire estimation applied to trains are based on crude assumptions and appropriate design fires for passenger trains are uncertain...|$|E
40|$|Trackside induced airflow {{velocities}} are {{an important}} criterion for the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains.</b> The maximum velocities are typically observed in the train wake and are caused by larger turbulent flow structures. The wake flow depends {{not only on the}} geometry of the train’s tail but also on the boundary layer. Due to the limited model size and different Reynolds numbers in model experiments, the wake flow may not be comparable to real trains. The idea is to control the thickness of the boundary layer using roughness elements independently from the model speed and lengths. High-speed particle image velocimetry is used to measure the flow velocities in a plane parallel to the ground at two different heights. As expected, the measured velocities vary greatly between the individual runs. Conditional sampling is used to analyze the size and dynamics of the flow fields at the time of maximum velocity. The results show, that the roughness elements in this setup affect the boundary layer and the flow structure at the lower height by increasing the average and maximum velocity. It remains to investigate, if an applicable setup of roughness elements can be found to create a realistic wake flow compared to real trains...|$|E

40|$|The European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has leaded to {{a change}} in the way the {{subjects}} are taught. One of the more important aspects of the EHEA is to support the autonomous study of the students. Taking into account this new approach, the virtual laboratory of the subject Mechanisms of the Aeronautical studies at the Technical University of Madrid is being migrated to an on-line scheme. This virtual laboratory consist on two practices: the design of cam-follower mechanisms and the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> of gears. Both practices are software applications that, in the current situation, need to be installed on each computer and the students carry out the practice at the computer classroom of the school under the supervision of a teacher. During this year the design of cam-follower mechanisms practice has been moved to a web application using Java and the Google Development Toolkit. In this practice the students has to design and study the running of a cam to perform a specific displacement diagram with a selected follower taking into account that the mechanism must be able to work properly at high speed regime. The practice has maintained its objectives in the new platform but {{to take advantage of the}} new methodology and try to avoid the inconveniences that the previous version had shown. Once the new practice has been ready, a pilot study has been carried out to compare both approaches: on-line and in-lab.

40|$|Through the EU-project REPID {{the railway}} {{industry}} {{takes a big}} leap forward, towards {{a solution to the}} issue of introducing Design for Environment (DfE) {{in the development of the}} future rolling stock. The REPID (Rail sector framework and tools for standardising and improving usability of Environmental Performance Indicators and Data formats) project is an implementation of the successful FP 5 -project RAVEL (RAil VEhicLe eco-efficient design). Both UIC and UNIFE are partners in REPID, with the aim to reach a practical agreement on a set of Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs), a practically useful and common material list, and an open data format for data exchange. The standardisation of EPIs and data format within the railway industry is a prerequisite to achieve meaningful and comparable measurement and communication of environmental performance. In the REPID project a design supportive software application is implemented by SEMCON Sweden. This application is used to analyse eco-efficiency of the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>trains</b> and train-components, in terms of the standard-EPIs. The application can be integrated with existing product management systems, which is a prerequisite to achieve a widespread acceptance of its use in the daily work. In the REPID project, integration with the CAD-tool CatiaV 5 has been used as a showcase. The basis in the REPID methodology is the common EPIs for communication and measurement of environmental performance. The common set of defined indicators is based on the policies of the rail operators and manufacturers. The EPIs provide support for both external communication of environmental requirements and performance between customers and suppliers, as well as internal communication between different functions within the company. For each design project, environmental targets expressed in terms of quantitative target values of the indicators are set for the product. These target values can then be compared to calculated values of the actual environmental performance for the design. The quantitative measurements of the environmental performance are based on the well-defined common material properties for all the materials in the standardised material list. These material properties are aggregated according to calculation rules that are specified for each indicator. The material list and material property definitions have been developed through a systematic procedure and data management process by the Department of Industrial Environmental Informatics (IMI) at Chalmers University of Technology. The material property data needed for the calculations have also been acquired in accordance with a data management process including documentation, review and quality assessment. IMI is also responsible for maintenance of the DfE-methodology. By using the standardised EPIs and data format the railway industry takes a giant leap towards better environmental performance and will continue to walk at the head of eco-efficient transportation...|$|E

To realize {{the benefits of}} DTB, generating and feeding back beamforming vector are very challenging tasks. Existing schemes have either enormous overhead or weak robustness in noisy channels. In this paper, we investigate the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> sequences and beamforming vector estimators in DTB systems. We consider an under-determined case, where the length <b>of</b> <b>training</b> sequence N sent from each node is smaller {{than the number of}} source nodes M. We derive the optimal estimation of the beamforming vector that maximizes the beamforming gain and show that it can be well approximated as the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimator. Based on the LMMSE estimator, we investigate the optimal <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>training</b> sequences and propose efficient DTB schemes. We analytically show that these schemes can achieve approximately N times increased SNR in uncorrelated channels, and even higher gain in correlated ones. We also propose a concatenated training scheme which optimally combines the training signals over multiple frames to obtain the beamforming vector. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DTB schemes can yield significant gains even at very low SNRs, with total feedback bits much less than those required in the existing schemes. 11 page(s...|$|R
