Since the large debris avalanche 4,800years ago, a number of more minor landslides have occurred at it, including one 1,100years ago and another event 500years ago. Both landslides ultimately blocked the Squamish River and created lakes upstream that lasted for a limited amount of time. In 1968 and 1983, a series of landslides took place that caused considerable damage to logging roads and forest stands, but did not result in any casualties. Future landslides from Mount Cayley and potential damming of the Squamish River are significant geological hazards to the general public, as well as to the economic development in the Squamish valley.|$|E

30|$|The LQS EWS {{demonstrated}} {{the importance of}} considering regional boundary conditions when implementing national laws. Butscher et al. (2010) presented a risk-oriented approach to the approval of BHE in the Canton of Basel-Landschaft, Switzerland. It is important to also consider local and specific risks during the approval process. Hence, all geological, hydrogeological, geotechnical, and anthropogenic hazards have to be identified. By integrating all factors into a geographic information system (GIS), authorities, drilling companies, and owners are able to estimate the hazard potential of each project. In most federal states, such a GIS has already been established (e.g. Ondreka et al. 2007). The “information system on shallow geothermal energy in Baden-Württemberg (ISONG)” launched by the LGRB is a successful example: the online map does not only show water protection areas, but also warns of confined aquifers as well as geological difficulties. The Leibniz Institute for Applied Geophysics is also setting up an internet-based information system of geothermal resources for the entire country (Schulz et al. 2007). Currently, this effort focusses on providing information about <b>geothermal</b> <b>potentials.</b> Possible risks are not yet displayed. The project “Shallow Geothermal Energy Planning, Assessment and Mapping Strategies in Central Europe (GeoPLASMA-CE)” generates a cross-national web-based platform, which provides tools to support decision making and enables a visualisation of <b>geothermal</b> <b>potentials</b> and risks of conflicts. Based on current projects, a platform for comprehensive information on potential geological risks {{is expected to be}} established in the future.|$|R

40|$|AbstractChemical and H- and O- isotopic {{compositions}} of 13 {{hot spring}} {{waters in the}} eastern part of Toyama Prefecture were analyzed to examine their chemical characteristics and to estimate the underground temperature for new geothermal exploration. On the basis of chemical and isotopic compositions, the hot spring waters can be divided into two groups: low and high salinities. The low salinity group is of meteoric origin and high one is a mixture of seawater and meteoric water with an oxygen isotopic shift. The latter may be geo-pressured fluid, which is characterized by high δD values of approximately - 20 and medium Cl concentrations of approximately 6, 000 mg/L, as reported elsewhere.
