The monastery had substantial income from its nearby spa so it established the <b>printing</b> <b>house.</b> Still, this income was insufficient for metal types.

30|$|Considering the strategy-making {{practice}} of the company under study, the next area of inquiry is the design and operation of the supply chain. In the present case, I will only examine a few components {{of the way in}} which the products (the books) of the publishing house are passed on to the consumers. I will highlight from what is the classical supply chain in this industry (publishing <b>house)</b> – <b>printing</b> <b>houses</b> – publishing house – wholesale/retail trade – customer and/or consumer, the relationship of the <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> and the publishing house. In this case, a <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> mediator (<b>printing</b> broker) has been intercalated between the <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> and the publishing house, which is not unusual in this industry, and he has become an important actor in the strategy-making process of the publishing house. At the time of the interviews, this co-operation had been in place for almost four years, and it had attained such degree of trust that the publishing house had handed over almost its entire <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> order stock and the related strategic and operative issues to the mediator. However, we cannot address questions of outsourcing because strategic decision-making has remained within the competence of the publishing house, albeit with the contribution of the <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> mediator. Strategic planning occurs with the involvement of the <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> mediator and through him, the <b>printing</b> <b>house</b> and, actually, the requirement of predictability and Foresight, with common planning based on transparency, reliability and trust, also came from the side of the <b>printing</b> <b>house.</b>|$|R
