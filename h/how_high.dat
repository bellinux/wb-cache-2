5|$|Michael Scott (Steve Carell) becomes {{frustrated}} when Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) {{refers to}} Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) as his boss. Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Gabe invite the office over to Gabe's {{house for a}} Glee viewing party. When the show starts, Michael and Gabe get into an argument over <b>how</b> <b>high</b> the volume should be. After taking turns raising and lowering the volume, Michael retreats to Gabe's bedroom, hoping that his employees will follow him there. Meanwhile, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) has been {{having a hard time}} with getting her daughter CeCe to go to sleep at night, so Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) picks her up to try to calm her down. Pam is stunned that CeCe becomes completely quiet in Dwight's hands.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of defamation suits brought by Government ministers and PAP MPs against critics, in particular political opponents, {{has been a}} cause for concern for organizations such as the International Bar Association and the United States Department of State. Amnesty International has referred to the use of civil defamation suits as a strategy by the government to inhibit the public activities of opposition politicians. This is due to <b>how</b> <b>high</b> awards of damages often cripple opposition politicians financially, causing them to become bankrupt and thus lose their parliamentary seats or become ineligible to run for elections. The resulting perception is that Singapore's leadership has a long-standing reputation for using defamation actions as a mechanism for removing opposition members from the Singapore Parliament or for inhibiting opposing political views.|$|E

25|$|Around {{this time}} Method Man began his acting career, along with close {{collaborator}} Redman, by {{starring in the}} stoner comedy film <b>How</b> <b>High.</b>|$|E
25|$|His first {{prominent}} role came in 1998 {{with the film}} Belly along with fellow rappers Nas and DMX. He has since added many credits to his name, including roles in the films Garden State, One Eight Seven, and many others, with starring roles in the feature films such as <b>How</b> <b>High</b> and Soul Plane. On March 27, 2007 Redman confirmed on BET's show Rap City that the sequel to <b>How</b> <b>High</b> was being written. The script for <b>How</b> <b>High</b> 2 is being written by Dustin Lee Abraham of CSI, who also wrote the first movie. In 2005, Method Man had a cameo in the horror movie Venom, where he played a deputy who is killed shortly into the movie. He also appeared in the 2008 movies The Wackness and Meet the Spartans.|$|E

40|$|Looking {{beyond the}} basic {{use of a}} {{traditional}} website, this paper aims to address the proposition of <b>how</b> <b>higher</b> education institutions could use social networks as an effective promotional tool. Research which examined the relationship that students have with social networks was carried out, and some suggestions have been provided as to <b>how</b> <b>higher</b> education institutions can use social networks to communicate with prospective as well as existing students. Empirical data was collected through a quantitative (online questionnaire) study, with 100 prospective and existing higher education students. The results show that students are heavy users of social networks, with a preference towards the use of Facebook. Prospective students also look for information about universities on social networks. Moreover, prospective students appear to use social networks for different reasons than existing students...|$|R
