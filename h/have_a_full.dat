5|$|Adults <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> moult after breeding, {{beginning}} between late May {{and the end}} of June, {{and completed}} by early October. Juvenile birds have a partial moult, replacing their head, body, and covert feathers; this is completed by October, although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{initially}} {{specified that}} the ship should be capable of , and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> set of sails for worldwide cruising range. Iron construction was chosen as it gave the best trade-off between speed and protection; an iron hull was lighter than a wooden one {{of the same size}} and shape, giving more capacity for guns, armour and engines.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, the Eden Academy Trust began {{a public}} {{consultation}} on reopening the former elementary {{school as a}} free special school in January 2015. Under the plans, it would be refurbished and open to 32 pupils, and would be gradually expanded to eventually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> intake of 140 pupils by September 2016. The school, named Pentland Field School, opened to its first intake of pupils on 12 January 2015, and was officially reopened by the Permanent Secretary for the Department for Education, Chris Wormald.|$|E

5|$|It {{was given}} the rank of full species (separate from the white-cheeked nuthatch) in 2005 in Pamela C. Rasmussen's Birds of South Asia. The Ripley Guide. Other {{authorities}} followed suit, but as of 2014, S. przewalskii does not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> threat-status evaluation by BirdLife International or the International Union for Conservation of Nature. A 2014 phylogenetic study of the species {{found it to be}} {{at the base of the}} nuthatch evolutionary tree out of 21 species examined, dispelling a hypothesis that S. przewalskii could belong to the same species as S. carolinensis.|$|E
5|$|The Carter {{administration}} {{years were}} difficult for Kennedy; {{he had been}} the most important Democrat in Washington ever since his brother Robert's death, but now Carter was, and Kennedy at first did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> committee chairmanship with which to wield influence. Carter in turn sometimes resented Kennedy's status as a political celebrity. Despite generally similar ideologies, their priorities were different. Kennedy expressed to reporters that he was content with his congressional role and viewed presidential ambitions as almost far-fetched.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and securely fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the perturbation theory used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
5|$|At {{a certain}} point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new {{daughter}} cells must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, attaching to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell. In many cells, the centrosome {{is located in the}} cytoplasm, outside the nucleus; the microtubules would be unable to attach to the chromatids {{in the presence of the}} nuclear envelope. Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in prophase and until around prometaphase, the nuclear membrane is dismantled. Likewise, during the same period, the nuclear lamina is also disassembled, a process regulated by phosphorylation of the lamins by protein kinases such as the CDC2 protein kinase. Towards the end of the cell cycle, the nuclear membrane is reformed, and around the same time, the nuclear lamina are reassembled by dephosphorylating the lamins.|$|E

25|$|The Turks did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> army in Trablusgarp (Libya). Many of the Ottoman {{officers}} {{had to travel}} there by their own means, often secretly, through Egypt, since the British would not allow Turkish troops to be transported en masse through Egypt. The Ottoman navy {{was too weak to}} transport troops by sea. The Turks organized local Arabs and Bedouins for the defence against the Italian invasion.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} common mtDNA tests are a {{sequence}} of HVR1 and HVR2 and a full sequence of the mitochondria. Some mtDNA tests may only analyze a partial range in these regions. Generally, testing only the HVRs has limited genealogical use so it is increasingly popular and accessible to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> sequence. The full sequence is still somewhat controversial because the coding region DNA may reveal medical information about the test-taker.|$|E
25|$|An {{intercept}} {{is performed}} by a defending player {{coming out of the}} defensive line in anticipation of a pass that can be prevented from reaching its targeted player. An intercept usually ends in a try because in achieving the interception, the player has passed through the opposition's line of players. The interceptor may or may not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> back to evade. Speed is a great asset in assuring the interceptor scores a try.|$|E
