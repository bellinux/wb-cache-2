5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the point-like particles of particle physics {{are replaced by}} one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E

Other organizational bodies include the Legal Committee and Financial Committee, and internal elections occur every three years.|$|E

25|$|In general relativity, a {{black hole}} {{is defined as a}} region of spacetime in which the {{gravitational}} field is so strong that no particle or radiation can escape. In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, black holes are thought to arise when massive stars undergo gravitational collapse, and many galaxies are thought to contain supermassive black holes at their centers. Black holes are also important for theoretical reasons, as they present profound challenges for theorists attempting to understand the quantum aspects of gravity. String theory has proved to be an important tool for investigating the theoretical properties of black holes because it provides a <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> theorists can study their thermodynamics.|$|E
25|$|This {{relationship}} between distance and intimacy, between imagery and sound, is {{also present in}} the opening sequence to The Wind Will Carry Us. Michael J. Anderson has argued that such a thematic application of this central concept of presence without presence, through using such techniques, and by often referring to characters which the viewer does not see and sometimes not hear directly affects the nature and concept of space in the geographical <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> the world is portrayed. Kiarostami's use of sound and imagery conveys a world beyond what is directly visible and/or audible, which Anderson believes emphasizes the interconnectedness and shrinking {{of time and space}} in the modern world of telecommunications.|$|E

25|$|Bartlett first {{formulated}} his revisionary methodology {{within a}} phenomenological <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> {{the concept of}} reference plays a logically primitive role; he later separated his approach to conceptual therapy from phenomenology. This {{took the form of}} a theoretically neutral metalogic of reference. Bartlett applied the resulting methodology to a group of conceptually basic concepts (for example, space, time, causality, consciousness, etc.) that both are relied upon in much ordinary thinking and are used in the formulation of scientific theories. Such applications, Bartlett sought to show, bring to light that many basic concepts, which tend to be routinely employed unquestioningly, are self-referentially inconsistent and stand in need of meaningful substitutes, for which he developed self-referentially consistent replacement concepts.|$|E

25|$|Ron Eyerman and Andrew Jamison, in Music and Social Movements: Mobilizing Tradition in the Twentieth Century (1998), {{take issue}} with what they {{consider}} Denisoff's reductive approach to the history and function of song (and particularly traditional song) in social movements. They point out that Denisoff had {{paid little attention to}} the song tunes of protest music, considered them strictly subordinate to the texts, a means to the message. It is true that in the highly text-oriented western European song tradition, tunes can be subordinate, interchangeable, and even limited in number (as in Portuguese fado, which only has 64 tunes), nevertheless, Eyerman and Jamison point out that some of the most effective protest songs gain power through their appropriation of tunes that are bearers of strong cultural traditions. They also note that:There is more to music and movements than can be captured within a functional perspective, such as Denisoff's, which focuses on the use made of music within already-existing movements. Music, and song, we suggest, can maintain a movement even when it no longer has a visible presence in the form of organizations, leaders, and demonstrations, and can be a vital force in preparing {{the emergence of a new}} movement. Here the role and place of music needs to be interpreted through a broader <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> tradition and ritual are understood as processes of identity and identification, as encoded and embodied forms of collective meaning and memory.|$|E
