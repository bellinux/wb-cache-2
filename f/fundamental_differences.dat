In her spare time, Ginsburg {{has appeared in}} several operas in non-speaking supernumerary roles such as Die Fledermaus (2003) and Ariadne auf Naxos (1994 with Scalia, and 2009), and spoke lines penned by her in The Daughter of the Regiment (2016).|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} not all {{indigenous}} units were disbanded {{at the end of}} the civil war period (31BC). Some of the more experienced units were kept in existence to complement the legions, and became the core of the standing auxiliary forces that developed in the Julio-Claudian period. During the early rule of Augustus (27BC onwards), the corps of regular Auxilia was created. It was clearly inspired by the Latin forces of the pre-Social War Republic, as a corps of non-citizen troops parallel to the legions. But there were <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences,</b> the same as between Republican and Augustan legions. The Latin forces of the Republic were made up of part-time conscripts in units that would be raised and disbanded for and after particular campaigns. The Augustan Auxilia were mainly volunteer professionals serving in permanent units.|$|E

The book met with sufficient success leading to it being revised and re-released the following year under the name The Bacon/Shakespeare Question Answered.|$|E

A stable marine aquarium requires more equipment than freshwater systems, and generally requires more stringent water quality monitoring. The inhabitants of a marine aquarium are often difficult to acquire and are usually more expensive than freshwater aquarium inhabitants. However, the inhabitants of saltwater aquariums are usually much more spectacular than freshwater aquarium fish.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{suggestions}} of surface level analogies, Buddhism and Christianity have inherent and <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> at the deepest levels, such as monotheism's {{place at the}} core of Christianity and Buddhism's orientation towards non-theism. The majority of modern scholars who have studied both Buddhism and Christianity hold that there is no direct historical evidence of any influence by Buddhism on early Christianity. Scholars generally consider any such influence implausible given that first century Jews are highly unlikely to have been open to far eastern concepts that appeared opposed to some of their basic beliefs.|$|E
25|$|In his tracts, Sanielevici {{suggests}} that the Romanian ethnicity and the Romanian Jewry are both racial conglomerates, not racial entities. He speaks about <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> occurring between people from the distinct Romanian historical regions—Moldavia, Wallachia, Transylvania etc.—with many hybrid individuals straddling the supposed divides. La Vie des mammifères... postulated that the Moldavians were Mousterian-Magdalenians originally feeding on fruit, fish and snails, whereas Wallachians (or, more restrictively, Muntenians) represented the Aurignacian-Solutrean mixture—horses in summer, and mainly onions in winter. In later writings, {{he argued that the}} whole of Wallachia's population, as well as some Moldavians, fit in with the Semitic and Mediterranean prototype.|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} that even for large spins $J$ the <b>fundamental</b> <b>difference</b> between integer and half-integer spins persists.

Magnetic moments for half-integer spin (Dy$^{ 3 +}$, $J= 15 / 2 $) and magnetic susceptibilities for integer spin (Ho$^{ 3 +}$, $J= 8 $) are calculated. Experiments are proposed to furnish evidence for the predicted <b>fundamental</b> <b>difference.</b> Comment: 4 pages RevTe...|$|R

25|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs), {{also called}} host defense peptides (HDPs) {{are part of}} the innate immune response found among all classes of life. <b>Fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> exist between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells that may represent targets for antimicrobial peptides. These peptides are potent, broad spectrum antibiotics which demonstrate potential as novel therapeutic agents. Antimicrobial peptides have been demonstrated to kill Gram negative and Gram positive bacteria, enveloped viruses, fungi and even transformed or cancerous cells. Unlike the majority of conventional antibiotics it appears as though antimicrobial peptides may also have the ability to enhance immunity by functioning as immunomodulators.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{creation}} of Hangul, people in Korea (known as Joseon at the time) primarily wrote using Classical Chinese alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate Hangul by hundreds of years, including idu, hyangchal, gugyeol, and gakpil. However, due to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> between the Korean and Chinese languages, and {{the large number of}} characters needed to be learned, there was much difficulty in learning how to write using Chinese characters for the lower classes, who often didn't have the privilege of education. To assuage this problem, King Sejong created the unique alphabet known as Hangul to promote literacy among the common people.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{earliest}} documented trophic cascades all occurred in lakes and streams led Donald Strong to speculate that <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> between aquatic and terrestrial food webs made trophic cascades primarily an aquatic phenomenon. Strong argued that trophic cascades were restricted to communities with relatively low species diversity, in which {{a small number of}} species could have overwhelming influence and the food web could operate as a linear food chain. Additionally, well documented trophic cascades {{at that point in time}} all occurred in food chains with algae as the primary producer. Trophic cascades, Strong argued, may only occur in communities with fast-growing producers which lack defenses against herbivory.|$|E

25|$|The {{asymmetric}} profile {{across a}} trench reflects <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> in materials and tectonic evolution. The outer trench wall and outer swell comprise seafloor that takes several million years {{to move from}} where subduction-related deformation begins to sinking beneath the overriding plate. In contrast, the inner trench wall is deformed by plate interactions for the entire life of the convergent margin. The forearc is continuously subjected to subduction-related deformation and earthquakes. This protracted deformation and shaking ensures that the inner trench slope {{is controlled by the}} angle of repose of whatever material comprises it. Because the inner slope of non-accretionary trenches are composed of igneous and metamorphic rocks instead of deformed sediments, these trenches have steeper inner walls than accretionary trenches.|$|E
25|$|Although the Tang dynasty (618–907) capital at Chang'an was {{the most}} {{thriving}} metropolis of China in its day, it was the city of Yangzhou—in proximity to the Grand Canal—that was the economic hub of the Tang era. Besides being the headquarters for the government salt monopoly and the largest pre-modern industrial production center of the empire, Yangzhou was also the geographical midpoint along the north-south trade axis, and so became the major center for southern goods shipped north. One of the greatest benefits of the canal system in the Tang dynasty—and subsequent dynasties—was that it reduced the cost of shipping grain that had been collected in taxes from the Yangtze River Delta to northern China. Minor additions to the canal were made after the Sui period {{to cut down on}} travel time, but overall no <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> existed between the Sui Grand Canal and the Tang Grand Canal.|$|E
25|$|Janowitz {{agreed with}} Huntington that, {{because of the}} <b>fundamental</b> <b>differences</b> between the {{civilian}} and military worlds, clashes would develop which would diminish the goal of civilian control of the military. His answer was to ensure that convergence occurred, thus ensuring that the military world would be imbued with the norms and expectations of the society that created it. He encouraged use of conscription, which would bring {{a wide variety of}} individuals into the military. He also encouraged the use of more Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs at colleges and universities to ensure that the military academies did not have a monopoly on the type of officer, particularly the senior general officer and flag officer leadership positions, in the military services. He specifically encouraged the development of ROTC programs in the more elite universities, so that the broader influences of society would be represented by the officer corps. The more such societal influences present within the military culture, the smaller the attitudinal differences between the two worlds and the greater the chance of civilians maintaining control over the military. Janowitz, like Huntington, believed that the civilian and military worlds were different from one another; while Huntington developed a theory to control the difference, Janowitz developed a theory to diminish the difference.|$|E
