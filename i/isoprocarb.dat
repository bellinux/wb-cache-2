40|$|The binding {{interaction}} of the pesticide <b>Isoprocarb</b> and its degradation product, sodium 2 -isopropylphenate, with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was studied by spectrofluorimetry under simulated physiological conditions. Both <b>Isoprocarb</b> and sodium 2 -isopropylphenate quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of BSA. This quenching proceeded via a static mechanism. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔH°, ΔS° and ΔG°) obtained from the fluorescence data measured at two different temperatures showed that the binding of <b>Isoprocarb</b> to BSA involved hydrogen bonds and that of sodium 2 -isopropylphenate to BSA involved hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy of the {{interaction of}} BSA with either <b>Isoprocarb</b> or sodium 2 -isopropylphenate showed that the molecular structure of the BSA was changed significantly, {{which is consistent with}} the known toxicity of the pesticide, i. e., the protein is denatured. The sodium 2 -isopropylphenate, was estimated to be about 4 – 5 times more toxic than its parent, <b>Isoprocarb.</b> Synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy and the resolution of the three-way excitation–emission fluorescence spectra by the PARAFAC method extracted the relative concentration profiles of BSA, Isoprocab and sodium 2 -isopropylphenate {{as a function of the}} added sodium 2 -isopropylphenate. These profiles showed that the degradation product, sodium 2 -isopropylphenate, displaced the pesticide in a competitive reaction with the BSA protein...|$|E

(Homoptera: Diaspididae) in sugarcane plantations.   The sugarcane scale, Aulacaspis tegalensis Zehntner,  is a new  serious pest of sugarcane in Lampung Province.   Over the years, most control practices against A. tegalensis  {{rely on the}} use of chemical insecticide.   A  field  study was conducted to assess  the  impact of  <b>isoprocarb</b> (carbamate-insecticide) on sugarcane scale pests  and  their natural predators in sugarcane  plantation.   The results indicated  that the application of  isoprocarb  (at recommended  concentration = 1. 25 mg/L) in sugarcane field failed to cause  a significant reduction on  scale pest  populations.   In contrast, the numbers of  predacious insects was significantly reduced  in isoprocarb-treated-field plots.      The  predacious insects  in association with scale pests in sugarcane fields were predominantly  coccinellids.   Four species of primary predacious coccinellids attacking scale pests were: Chilocorus melanophthalmus, Chilocorus sp.,  Scymnus sp, and Telsimia sp.   This field study indicated that the predacious species were more susceptible to <b>isoprocarb</b> than their prey...|$|E
40|$|Insecticides {{are widely}} used in SE Asian {{countries}} to control insect pests in rice, mainly stemborers (Chilo suppresallis) and brown plant hoppers (Nilaparvata lugens). The use of highly toxic insecticide compounds, however, is known to cause serious problem for fish culture in wet rice fields {{in many of these}} countries, particularly in Indonesia where this practice assumes a tremendous "house hold economic" importance, as well as being {{an essential part of the}} nation's inland aqua-culture production system. The laboratory and field experiments described were carried out to establish whether the application of five selected rice insecticides (fenobucarb, <b>isoprocarb,</b> buprofezin, diazinon and alphamethrin) would influence the growth and production of common carp fingerlings (Cyprinus carpio LINN.) raised in wet rice fields. Laboratory static toxicity tests revealed that the carbamate insecticides (fenobucarb and <b>isoprocarb)</b> were the least toxic insecticide compounds.

40|$|Different surfactant-modified solid sorbents {{have been}} {{comparatively}} investigated for retention of carbamate pesticides in aqueous solution. Three modified-sorbents, including {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} (SDS) treated alumina, cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) coated silica and CTAB coated zeolite, were created using different surfactant concentrations. The studied carbamate pesticides including oxamyl, methomyl, aldicarb, carbofuran, carbaryl, <b>isoprocarb,</b> methiocarb, promecarb and carbosulfan were analyzed by HPLC/UV. Adsorption of all carbamate pesticides (concentration range between 0. 5 - 5. 0 mg L- 1) onto surfactant-modified sorbents followed linear regressions with the correlation coefficients {{in the range of}} 0. 857 - 0. 995. CTAB-modified zeolite showed high uptake values for carbofuran, carbaryl, methiocarb and carbosulfan. SDS-modified alumina demonstrated high uptake values for carbaryl, <b>isoprocarb,</b> methiocarb, promecarb and carbosulfan. CTAB-modified silica gave high uptake values for methiocarb, promecarb and carbosulfan. Desorption of carbamate pesticides from surfactant-modified sorbents using methanol were better than that obtained from unmodified sorbents.

40|$|The {{influence}} of salt additive on cloud point extraction (CPE) of <b>isoprocarb</b> and promecarb insecticides is described. Types of salt (Na 2 CO 3, CaCl 2, MgSO 4, Na 2 SO 4, NaHCO 3 and NaCl) and concentra-tions were studied. The extracted target compounds {{were analyzed using}} reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Among the salts studied, Na 2 CO 3 {{was found to be}} the most effect-ive salt for salting out of both insecticides, resulting in high extrac-tion efficiency (> 95 %) and high enrichment factor of up to 18 compared to extraction without preconcentration. The optimum CPE conditions were 1. 5 % (w/v) Triton X- 114, 3. 0 % (w/v) Na 2 CO 3, and 20 -min equilibration at 458 C. Under the selected conditions, the linear range of 0. 05 to 3. 0 mg/L was found for both analytes. The limits of detection for <b>isoprocarb</b> and promecarb were 10 and 20 mg/L, re-spectively.

40|$|A high {{performance}} liquid chromatography with fluorescence (HPLC-F) detector was examined to simultaneous determination of airborne carbamates {{in the workplace}} of manufactory. The OVS- 2 air sampling tube filled with glass fiber filter or quartz fiber and combined filter/XAD- 2 were evaluated to collect nine commonly used carbamates (Carbofuran, <b>Isoprocarb,</b> Methomyl, Metolcarb, Thiodicarb, Carbaryl, Oxamyl, Methiocarb, and Prpoxur) from the air of manufactory in high humidity country. After being extracted with acetonitrile from sampling tubes, the carbamates were determined by {{high performance}} liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection posterior to on-line derivatization. The collection of carbamates and the recovery of extraction from glass wool fiber in several concentration levels, and from quartz filter were evaluated. The storage stability of carbamates was also tested. Results indicated that the HPLC-fluorescence method offers satisfactory resolution and sensitivity in carbamate analysis. With the glass fiber filter and combined filter/XAD- 2, the Carbofuran, <b>Isoprocarb,</b> Methomyl, Metolcarb, and Thiodicarb were stable for a 28 -day storage test, Carbaryl and Oxamyl for 14 days, and Methiocarb and Prpoxur for 7 days. All of these pesticides were with detection limit of 3 mug m(- 3). It is suited for environmental monitoring. The airborne carbamates in {{different areas of the}} manufactory were measured.

40|$|NADPH-cytochrome P 450 reductase (CPR) {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the cytochrome P 450 (CYP) -mediated metabolism of endogenous and exogenous substrates. CPR has been found to be associated with insecticide metabolism and resistance in many insects. However, information regarding CPR in the bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi, is unavailable. In the current study, a full-length cDNA (2, 476 bp) of CPR (RpCPR) encoding 681 amino acids was cloned from R. padi. Nucleotide sequence and deduced amino acid sequence analysis showed that RpCPR exhibits characteristics of classical CPRs and shares high identities with those of other insects, especially with the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. The mRNA of RpCPR was expressed at all developmental stages, with the highest expression level found in the second instar and the lowest in adult. Expression levels of RpCPR in isoprocarb-resistant and imidacloprid-resistant strains were 3. 74 - and 3. 53 -fold higher, respectively, than that of a susceptible strain. RpCPR expression could also be induced by low concentrations (LC 30) of <b>isoprocarb</b> and imidacloprid. Moreover, we sequenced the open reading frame (ORF) of RpCPR from 167 field samples collected in 11 geographical populations. Three hundred and thirty-four SNPs were detected, of which, 65 were found in more than two individuals. One hundred and ninety-four missense mutations were present in the amino acid sequence, of which, the P 484 S mutant had an allele frequency of 35. 1 %. The present results suggest that RpCPR may play an important role in the P 450 -mediated insecticide resistance of R. padi to <b>isoprocarb</b> and imidacloprid and possibly other insecticides. Meanwhile, RpCPRmaintains high genetic diversity in natural individuals, which provides the possibility of studying potential correlations between variants and certain special physiological characters...|$|E

Sample solution, after mixing with sodium chloride, was heated in a vial at 70 ℃, and an SPME fiber was exposed to the headspace of the vial. Immediately after the fiber was pulled out, the fiber needle was injected into the port of a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector. Recoveries were 0. 582 - 1. 87 % for whole blood, and 2. 97 - 20. 6 % for urine; it was highest for fenobucarb and lowest for carbofuran.

30|$|TiO 2 {{was used}} as an {{efficient}} and selective sorbent to recognize the phosphorylation moiety based on a strong chelation with phospho-moieties. The affinity of TiO 2 towards the phosphoric group is favorable for fast enrichment and detection of free organophosphate pesticides [19]. However, the wide band gap of TiO 2 (∼ 3.2 eV, anatase) allows it to absorb only the ultraviolet light (< 387 nm). To extend its photo response to the visible region and to promote the photoelectric conversion efficiency, many modification methods have been applied (e.g., dye sensitization, metal ion/nonmetal atom doping, semiconductor coupling, and noble metal deposition) [19, 66]. Of the abovementioned methods, by considering the high electron mobility of nanocrystals and the possibility of shifting the optical band gap to the visible light region using organic materials, the organic–inorganic heterojunction can produce a robust photoelectrochemical sensor. Zhou reported that graphene-modified TiO 2 nanotube arrays exhibit an excellent enrichment efficiency for carbamate pesticides including metolcarb, carbaryl, <b>isoprocarb,</b> and diethofencarb. The detection limits of these carbamate pesticides range from 2.27 to 3.26  μg L− 1. The method {{could be used as a}} faster and easier alternative procedure for routine analysis of carbamate pesticides [67]. Li et al. developed two photoelectrochemical sensors to detect dichlofenthion and chlorpyrifos pesticides. The sensors were based on a TiO 2 photocatalyst coupled with electrochemical detection, which is a derivative of an electrochemical sensor and sensitized TiO 2 [68, 69].|$|E
40|$|The authors {{describe}} {{a strategy for}} rapid and sensitive determination of phenyl carbamate pesticides in environmental samples. It consists of the following steps: (a) Enrichment and clean-up of the analytes using a C 18 microtip based procedure; (b) alkaline hydrolysis of the carbamates (carbofuran, <b>isoprocarb</b> and carbaryl) to form phenol derivatives; and (c) fast separation and amperometric detection in a microfluidic chip (MCs). The microchips were fabricated by using press-transferred carbon black nanoparticles (CB-NPs) as electrochemical sensing nanomaterial. The excellent electrochemical behavior of the CB-NPs coupled to the microchip warrants good separation and allows for the voltammetric determination (best at a working voltage of + 0. 70 V vs Ag/AgCl) of the carbamates within < 6 min. The authors also {{describe a}} rapid procedure for the clean-up and enrichment of the carbamates from real samples by using a C 18 microtip. The procedure allowed a 10 -fold enrichment of the analytes, and {{this led to a}} detection limits in ̴the 0. 7 to 1. 2 μM concentration range. The assay was applied to samples of river, lake and irrigation water that were spiked with carbamates at 50 and 100 μM levels. Recoveries are in the 87 to 108 % range, and RSDs (n = 3) in the 5 to 11 % range. The exploitation of the such nanomaterials coupled to microfluidics and microextraction procedures for real sample analysis in our preception represents a most viable tool for the analysis of complex real samples, for on-site environmental monitoring, and for rapid diagnosis.
