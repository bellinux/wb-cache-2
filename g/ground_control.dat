5|$|Similarly, {{communications}} between the Earth and spacecraft are not instantaneous. There {{is a brief}} delay from the source to the receiver, which becomes more noticeable as distances increase. This delay was significant for {{communications between}} <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> and Apollo 8 when it became the first manned spacecraft to orbit the Moon: for every question, the <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> station had to wait at least threeseconds for the answer to arrive. The communications delay between Earth and Mars can vary between five and twenty minutes depending upon the relative positions of the two planets. As a consequence of this, if a robot {{on the surface of}} Mars were to encounter a problem, its human controllers would not be aware of it until at least five minutes later, and possibly up to twenty minutes later; it would then take a further five to twenty minutes for instructions to travel from Earth to Mars.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a primary}} {{concern of the}} Sprint missile was high speed, the design was not {{optimized}} for maximum energy, but instead relied on the first stage (booster) to provide as much thrust as possible. This left the second stage (sustainer) lighter than optimal, to improve its maneuverability. Staging was under <b>ground</b> <b>control,</b> with the booster cut away from the missile body by explosives. The sustainer was not necessarily ignited immediately, depending on the flight profile. For control, the first stage used a system that injected Freon into the exhaust to cause thrust vectoring to control the flight. The second stage used small air vanes for control.|$|E
5|$|As Apollo 17 was {{the final}} lunar mission of the Apollo program, several {{different}} scientific objectives were identified {{in order to maximize}} the scientific productivity of the mission. Landing sites considered for previous missions, but were rejected were reconsidered. Taurus–Littrow was one of several potential landing sites considered for Apollo 17 along with Tycho crater, Copernicus crater, Tsiolkovskiy crater on the far side, among others. All but Taurus–Littrow were eventually eliminated for scientific and/or operational reasons. A landing at Tycho was thought to be too dangerous because of the rough terrain found there, a landing on the far side in Tsiolkovskiy would add the expense of communications satellites necessary to maintain contact between the crew and <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> during surface operations, and a landing in Copernicus was regarded as low priority.|$|E
5|$|On 3 November 1941 MacLachlan was {{promoted}} to squadron leader, and was given command of No. 1 Squadron at Redhill Aerodrome, equipped with the Hawker Hurricane Mk. IIc for night intruder operations over western Europe. MacLachlan was assigned his personal aircraft, Hurricane BD983/JX-Q. He painted an emblem showing a left arm with a cannon shell passing through it and the fingers giving the V sign. The squadron spent the winter, 1941–2 in intensive night fighter training with searchlight and <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> station. In February 1942 he attended the Searchlight School at Shrivenham. In his absence he missed the Channel Dash and subsequent air battle during which the squadron lost two pilots. The squadron scored its first success on 1 April—his 23rd birthday—when Karel Kuttelwascher—with whom he often flew—destroyed two Ju 88s.

There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. UAVs can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the Apache or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Blitz ended as the Luftwaffe {{moved its}} forces to support Operation Barbarossa and the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and air raids slackened. During the second half of 1941, small numbers of German aircraft made pinpoint attacks across Britain and German night fighters attempted intercept operations over England to disrupt RAF Bomber Commands bombing of Germany. On 23 June Braham claimed a probable against a He 111 which Royal Observer Corps personnel saw crash. But since he had lost contact with <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> (having wandered out of No. 29s area of operations) and fearing being lost or pursuing the He 111 too low into Barrage balloons, Braham ended the chase and claimed a probable.

5|$|A {{helmet-mounted sight}} (HMS) {{developed}} by Luoyang Electro-Optics Technology Development Centre of AVIC {{was developed in}} parallel with the JF-17; it was first tested on Prototype 04 in 2006. It was dubbed as EO HMS, (Electro-Optical Helmet Mounted Sight) and was first revealed {{to the public in}} 2008 at the 7th Zhuhai Airshow, where a partial mock-up was on display. The HMS tracks the pilot's head and eye movements to guide missiles towards the pilot's visual target. An externally carried day/night laser designator targeting pod may be integrated with the avionics to guide laser-guided bombs (LGBs). An extra hardpoint may be added under the starboard air intake, opposite the cannon, for such pods. To reduce the numbers of targeting pods required, the aircraft's tactical data link can transmit target data to other aircraft not equipped with targeting pods. The communication systems comprise two VHF/UHF radios; the VHF radio has the capacity for data linking for communication with <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> centres, airborne early warning and control aircraft and combat aircraft with compatible data links for network-centric warfare, and improved situation awareness.|$|E
5|$|On 2 November 1944, Welter was {{transferred}} to II. Gruppe/Nachtjagdgeschwader 11 (NJG11), a reformation of his former unit. Here he was given command of a special Kommando subordinate to II./NJG11, set up on 11 November 1944 at Erprobungsstelle Rechlin's southern Lärz airbase (2 November 1944 – 28 January 1945), and dedicated to performing nocturnal interception with the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter of RAF Mosquitos attacking the Berlin area. According to some sources, Oberleutnant Welter added a Lancaster to his growing list of Mosquitos {{on the night of}} 12 December 1944, the first night victory by a jet fighter. Other sources state that his first aerial victory flying the Me 262 was claimed either on the night of 2 January 1945 or 5 January 1945. On 28 January 1945, the unit initially known as Sonderkommando Stamp, named after its founder Major Gerhard Stamp and then Sonderkommando Welter, was re-designated 10. Staffel/NJG11 and transferred to the airfield at Burg near Magdeburg (28 January 1945 – 12 April 1945). The unit was equipped with Me 262 jet fighters, and tasked with intercepting Mosquito bomber aircraft of No. 8 Group RAF in the Berlin area. The Me 262 were not fitted with radar and used the aid of <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> and the searchlight defences, partially a Wilde Sau form of night combat. Welter had claimed three aerial victories while flying the Me 262 by early February 1945.|$|E
5|$|The raid of 2May {{marked the}} start of an upsurge in Japanese aerial {{activity}} over northern Australia. A detachment of six No.457 Squadron aircraft was deployed to Milingimbi Island on 9May after the airfield there was attacked. This detachment intercepted subsequent raids on 10 and 28May, shooting down four Japanese {{for the loss of}} three Spitfires. On 20June No.1 Wing intercepted two Japanese raids on Darwin. While the raiders bombed the suburb of Winnellie and RAAF Station Darwin, the Allied fighters shot down nine bombers and five fighters and damaged another ten aircraft for the loss of two Spitfires. This was the most successful engagement fought by the RAAF over Darwin up to that time, and General MacArthur sent a congratulatory message to the defenders. The battle also received positive media coverage which restored public confidence in No.1 Wing. The facilities which housed No.54 Squadron's photographic and parachute sections were badly damaged during the raid, but the unit's ground crew did not suffer any casualties. Several days after the engagement Group Captain Walters was posted to take command of No. 5 Service Flying Training School and Caldwell was appointed the wing's acting commanding officer. On 22June No.1 Wing was scrambled to intercept two large forces of incoming aircraft, but was subsequently directed by <b>ground</b> <b>control</b> to not engage them after it was determined that the Japanese force was made up only of fighters.|$|E

40|$|Alterations in immune {{function}} {{have been documented}} during or post-spaceflight and in ground based models of microgravity. Identification of immune parameters that are dysregulated during spaceflight {{is an important step}} in mitigating crew health risks during deep space missions. The in vitro analysis of leukocyte activity post-spaceflight in both human and animal species is primarily focused on lymphocytic function. This report completes a broader spectrum analysis of mouse lymphocyte and monocyte changes post 13 days orbital flight (mission STS- 135). Analysis includes an examination in surface markers for cell activation, and antigen presentation and co-stimulatory molecules. Cytokine production was measured after stimulation with T-cell mitogen or TLR- 2, TLR- 4, or TLR- 5 agonists. Splenocyte surface marker analysis immediate post-spaceflight and after in vitro culture demonstrated unique changes in phenotypic populations between the flight mice and matched treatment <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> Post-spaceflight splenocytes (flight splenocytes) had lower expression intensity of CD 4 +CD 25 + and CD 8 +CD 25 + cells, lower percentage of CD 11 c+MHC II+ cells, and higher percentage of CD 11 c+MHC I+ populations compared to <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> The flight splenocytes demonstrated an increase in phagocytic activity. Stimulation with ConA led to decrease in CD 4 + population but increased CD 4 +CD 25 + cells compared to <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> Culturing with TLR agonists led to a decrease in CD 11 c+ population in splenocytes isolated from flight mice compared to <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> Consequently, flight splenocytes with or without TLR-agonist stimulation showed a decrease in CD 11 c+MHC I+, CD 11 c+MHC II+, and CD 11 c+CD 86 + cells compared to <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> Production of IFN-γ was decreased and IL- 2 was increased from ConA stimulated flight splenocytes.

Starch grains from plants from both flights were on average 20 - 50 % smaller in diameter than <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> The ratio delta X/delta rho (delta X [...] difference of magnetic susceptibilities, delta rho [...] difference of densities between starch and water) of starch grains was ca. 15 % and 4 % higher for space-grown soybean cotyledons and potato tubers, respectively, than in corresponding <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> Since the densities of particles were similar for all samples (1. 36 to 1. 38 g/cm 3), the observed difference in delta X/delta rho {{was due to}} different magnetic susceptibilities and indicates modified composition of starch grains. In starch preparations from soybean cotyledons (BRIC- 03) subjected to controlled enzymatic degradation with alpha-amylase for 24 hours, 77 +/- 6 % of the starch from the flight cotyledons was degraded compared to 58 +/- 12 % in <b>ground</b> <b>controls.</b> The amylose content in starch was also higher in space-grown tissues. The good correlation between the amylose content and delta X/delta rho suggests, that the magnetic susceptibility of starch grains is related to their amylose content. Since the seedlings from the BRIC- 03 experiment showed elevated post-flight ethylene levels, material from another flight experiment (GENEX) which had normal levels of ethylene was examined and showed no difference to <b>ground</b> <b>controls</b> in size distribution, density, delta X/delta rho and amylose content. Therefore the role of ethylene {{appears to be more}} important for changes in starch metabolism than microgravity. c 2001 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|The {{experiment}} {{focuses on}} mineral deposition or calcification of cartilage. The experiments {{were used to}} compare the mineral formed in the microgravity of space with that formed on earth. Results of these experiments were anticipated to provide direct insight into how calcification in cartridge and bone may be controlled in space. In the C- 2 experiment (STS 66), we found that mineralization started later in the cartridges (both on the ground and in hypo-gravity) than in plastic, and that mineralization appeared to be retarded in hypo-gravity. The flight experiments also showed that the cells differentiated normally, but more slowly than the <b>ground</b> <b>controls,</b> and that the matrix produced was not different from that made on the ground. The purpose of the C- 5 experiment was to confirm these findings. The C- 5 experiment was flown on STS- 72. Because of a computer problem, cells received no gases and no nutrition. The C- 7 was flown on STS- 77. <b>Ground</b> <b>controls</b> were repeated a week later, however, because there was a problem with the temperature control during the flight, the concurrent <b>ground</b> <b>controls</b> were performed at a different temperature.
