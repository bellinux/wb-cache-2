50|$|Glaser Safety Slug is a <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> made by Cor-Bon/Glaser, a {{subsidiary}} of Dakota Ammo, an American ammunition company based in Sturgis, South Dakota. The Glaser Safety Slug was developed by Jack Canon in 1975, the same year the company was founded by Armin Glaser.|$|E
50|$|A <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> is {{one that}} is {{designed}} to disintegrate into tiny particles upon impact to minimize their penetration for reasons of range safety, to limit environmental impact, or to limit the danger behind the intended target.

50|$|Air marshals {{who provide}} {{security}} on private airplanes also carry machine pistols and may use speciality ammunition such as <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets,</b> which break apart when upon impact. <b>Frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> {{such as the}} Glaser Safety Slug are designed to ricochet less and {{be less likely to}} puncture the hull of an aircraft, which lessens the danger of decompression if the officer has to fire on an attacker.|$|R
50|$|<b>Frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> offer {{improved}} {{safety for}} specialized combat simulation training involving firing at {{an array of}} multiple steel targets in various directions encountered while moving through a maze. <b>Frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> are also used in reduced ricochet, limited penetration (RRLP) loads intended to reduce risk to friendly forces and innocent persons during close quarters military or police actions in urban areas, aboard ships, or in hazardous material environments like oil platforms and chemical or nuclear plants.|$|R

50|$|Most {{frangible}} bullets {{are subject}} to brittle failure upon striking a hard target. This mechanism {{has been used to}} minimize the tendency of malleable lead and copper bullets to ricochet from hard targets as large, cohesive particles. Brittle failure may occur at subsonic velocity. Attempting to crimp a brittle <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> into the cartridge case may break the bullet. Brittle frangible bullets may break during the self-loading cycle of semi-automatic firearms; and those fired from revolvers often break as the bullet encounters the barrel forcing cone after leaving the cylinder.|$|E
5000|$|Damage {{potential}} of ricochets, like bullets, {{is proportional to}} the mass of the bullet fragment and the square of the velocity of the bullet fragment. Ricochet velocity will be lower than collision velocity, but may be close to collision velocity for small angles of deflection. Ricochet mass may be similarly close to original bullet mass for full metal jacket bullets or green bullets replacing soft lead with solid copper or a steel core. Frangible bullets or lead core varmint hunting bullets are more susceptible to collision damage, and produce smaller ricochet fragments. Lower initial mass gives small fragment ricochets less damage potential, and distance of travel is reduced by more rapid loss of velocity from air resistance. Reduced ricochet range {{is one of the reasons}} the newer [...]17 HMR round with its <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> has gained popularity against the older non-fragmenting [...]22 WMR.|$|E
5000|$|The {{development}} of training target aircraft and specialized ammunition also increased the realisticness of the training. The {{idea was to}} have the students fire special bullets which had the same characteristics as a 30- or 50-caliber round but would splinter harmlessly on impact. Working with researchers at Duke University, the University of Michigan, and the Bakelite Corporation (one of the pioneering manufacturers of plastics), the Air Force came up with a <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> that was weighted with powdered lead to give it the proper weight and density. The Douglas A-20 Havoc was initially used as a target trainer with additional aluminum armor added. The A-20 was found not to be ideal, as the gunners would largely face much more maneuverable single-engined fighter aircraft, and the Bell P-63 Kingcobra replaced it. The P-63 met the fighter plane criteria and was also available in quantity, as it was being used for lend-lease exports and was not used as a combat aircraft by the Air Force. The aerial target version of the aircraft was designated as the [...] "RP-63 Pinball" [...] and was painted a bright orange, re-fitted with 1" [...] thick glass and carried more than a ton of armor covering the parts exposed to gunfire of the specialized bullets. Lights were used to record [...] "hits" [...] that flashed from the propeller hub, some also had lights that flashed from the wingtips, giving rise to the name [...] "Pinball". Unfortunately, the number of hits registered by the recording devices in the aircraft was usually disappointingly small; whether because of misses or a failure of the recording mechanisms was unclear. Beginning in mid-1944 RP-63 Pinballs would fly attack profiles against bombers with student gunners before they were assigned to a combat unit. Eventually, over 300 RP-63s operated both from Buckinghamm and from the Naples Army Auxiliary Air Field.B-24 Liberator aircraft were the primary aircraft used for the air-to-air gunnery phase of the training. The Liberator was not pressurized and had room in the fuselage to accommodate the trainees and their instructors. B-24s were modified with sealed bomb bays and could be used for both waist and turret training, carrying large amounts of ammunition and both the [...]30 and [...]50 caliber machine guns. A B-24 might have 12 student gunners each having 2,000 rounds of the special ammunition to fire at the RP-63 Pinballs.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> are {{intended}} to disintegrate into tiny particles upon target impact to minimize their penetration of other objects. Small particles are slowed more rapidly by non-target environments like air resistance, and {{are less likely to}} cause injury or damage to persons and objects distant from the point of bullet impact.|$|R
50|$|Hard targets may {{be damaged}} by <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets.</b> Extent of damage {{increases}} with velocity of bullet impact. Energy transfer {{at the point}} of impact may break brittle targets, and may temporarily soften and permanently deform malleable materials. Target crystalline structure may be changed to increase target damage by subsequent bullets. Steel targets designed to withstand rifle ammunition may be damaged by bullet velocities over 2700 ft per second; and lower velocity bullets may damage steel targets intended for pistol or rimfire ammunition.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{witnesses}} on {{the island}} {{were reported to have}} hidden in the undergrowth, and in lavatories, communicating by text message to avoid giving their positions away to the gunman. The mass shooting reportedly lasted for around an hour and a half, ending when a police special task force arrived and the gunman surrendered, despite having ammunition left, at 18:35. It is also reported that the shooter used hollow-point or <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> which increase tissue damage.

40|$|Abstract. The bullet is {{used for}} {{immobilize}} object. However it can harm the shooter {{because it can be}} ricochet. Thus it, we develop <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> which can be broken when hit the hard target. Conventional bullets are made of lead base material which poison. Therefore <b>frangible</b> <b>bullet</b> does not use lead as base material, so it is classified as green bullet. Green bullet is made by powder metallurgy method. Powder metallurgy process are measuring copper and tin powder, dry mixing, and compacting 600 Mpa in pressure for 10 minutes in holding time, and sintering at 300, 500, 700 ºC for 0, 5; 1; and 1, 5 hours in holding time. Then, measure the sinter density and analyze the sample by XRD and SEM-EDX. Based on experiment, we found that the bullet Cu- 10 %wt which sintering 500 ºC in temperature for 1 hour has the best frangibility. The highest theoretical density, compression strength, and hardness are 8. 8 gr/cm 3, 280. 45 MPa, 60. 67 HRF. The observer result by scanning electron microscope showed that the phase homogeneity at sintering temperature 500 ºC for 1 hour in holding times was better than the other variable. By observing phase formed, in XRD pattern show that identified new phase Cu 10 Sn 3 caused the material properties fragile...|$|E
50|$|The last {{category}} of expanding <b>bullets</b> is <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets.</b> These bullets {{are designed to}} break up on impact, which results in a huge increase in surface area. The most common of these bullets are made of small diameter lead pellets, placed in a thin copper shell and {{held in place by}} an epoxy or similar binding agent. On impact, the epoxy shatters and the copper shell opens up, much like a hollowpoint. The individual lead balls then spread out in a wide pattern, and due to their low mass to surface area ratio, stop very quickly. Similar bullets are made out of sintered metals, which turn to powder upon impact. These bullets are usually restricted to pistol cartridges, as the nonhomogenous cores tend to cause inaccuracies that, while acceptable at short pistol ranges, are not acceptable for the typical range at which rifles are used.|$|R
50|$|The {{mechanism}} of bullet disintegration {{varies with the}} energy transfer {{at the time of}} impact. With sufficient velocity, bullets may be vaporized upon impact. Few firearms can propel bullets at sufficient velocity to cause reliable vaporization at the target, and air resistance causes bullet velocity to decrease with increasing distance from the firing point; so <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> typically rely upon other mechanisms for disintegration at lower velocities. Target characteristics are an important aspect of interaction with the bullet. Energy available to initiate the disintegration mechanism is limited by {{the rate at which the}} target slows the bullet; so bullets may pass through flexible, fragile or low-density materials without slowing the bullet enough to cause disintegration. Bullets must resist disintegration during handling, loading, and firing to reliably hit the target; so high-velocity loads may require a non-frangible jacket to protect a frangible core from disintegration prior to target impact. The jacket may ricochet, but should have reduced range without the weight of the frangible core. <b>Frangible</b> hollow-point <b>bullets</b> may penetrate clothing, drywall, and light sheet metal; but often disintegrate upon striking glass.|$|R
50|$|The Gunnery Ranges {{were used}} to train gunners in air-to-air firing. Five target flight lines and two {{auxiliary}} landing fields were established within this range. Initially, gunnery trainees fired at targets towed along these target flight lines. This technique did not provide good training and other techniques were tried. One of the first was to place a gun camera on the machine gun and instead of firing bullets the camera would record the gunners sight picture whenever the trigger was pulled. In this situation, instead of aiming at a towed target sleeve, P-39 and P-63 aircraft were used as targets. Another technique tried involved the use of <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> which were fired at specially armored versions of the P-39 and P-63s. This was called Operation PINBALL.|$|R
5000|$|General Arnold on 29 June 1943 {{noted the}} [...] "serious lack of proper {{aircraft}} {{and equipment to}} support the training", and early gunnery training had used guntruck platforms with guns mounted on the beds of pickup trucks, e.g., for firing at clay targets (guntrucks at Las Vegas AAF were only used January & February 1942.) [...] In-flight training included firing at aircraft-towed targets, and camera guns in 1944-5 simulated fire at fighters flying mock attacks on the bombers. [...] Las Vegas was 1 of 7 USAAF schools that used <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> to fire at [...] "specially built Bell RP-63 aircraft that simulatied conventional fighter attacks against bombers", and the bullets splattered into powder when striking he RP-63, which had radiosonic equipment for a wing lamp to flash so the gunners could identify a hit.|$|R
5000|$|In some applications, {{preventing}} {{exit from}} the rear of the target is also desirable. A bullet that penetrates through-and-through tends to cause more profuse bleeding, allowing a game animal to be bloodtrailed more easily. On the other hand, a perforating bullet can then continue on (likely not coaxial to the original trajectory due to target deflection) and might cause unintended damage or injury. <b>Frangible</b> <b>bullets,</b> made of tiny fragments held together by a weak binding, are often sold as an [...] "ultimate" [...] expanding bullet, as they will increase their effective diameter by an order of magnitude. When they work, they work extremely well, causing massive trauma to the target. On the other hand, when they fail, it is due to underpenetration, and the damage to the target is superficial and leads to very slow incapacitation.|$|R
5000|$|This {{means that}} all the kinetic energy from the bullet is {{transferred}} into the target {{in a very short}} period of time. The most common application of this bullet is the shooting of small vermin, such as prairie dogs. The effect of these bullets is quite dramatic, often resulting in the animal being blown apart upon impact. However, on larger game fragmenting ammunition provides inadequate penetration of vital organs to ensure a clean kill; instead, a [...] "splash wound" [...] may result. This also limits practical use of these rounds to supersonic (rifle) rounds, which have a high enough kinetic energy to ensure a lethal hit. The two main advantages of this ammunition are that it is very humane, as a hit almost anywhere on most small vermin will ensure an instant kill, and that instead of dangerously and uncontrollably ricocheting off surfaces, the bullet harmlessly breaks apart. Fragmenting bullets should not be confused with <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> (see below).|$|R
5000|$|Shooting {{galleries}} appeared following {{development of}} rimfire ammunition in the 19th century. Small-caliber gallery guns {{could be easily}} reloaded, providing an opportunity for recreational shooting without the noise, painful recoil, and tiresome reloading procedure required with contemporary muzzleloaders. Shooting galleries became a common feature of Gilded Age amusement parks, and portable bullet traps were later constructed to allow this entertainment with traveling carnivals for locations including fairgrounds. Early shooting galleries typically included several shooting positions for pump-action [...]22 caliber rifles. Durable steel or cast iron targets indicated hits by tipping over or rotating around a horizontal mounting rod. Target distances were short enough to make such movement obvious—as little as 10 feet (3 meters) for portable carnival galleries. The muzzle of each rifle was often chained to a slightly down-range attachment to prevent the rifle from being aimed to miss the bullet trap and threaten bystanders. Injuries from molten lead bullet fragments or ricochets off metal targets or bullet traps encouraged development of <b>frangible</b> <b>bullets</b> in specialized gallery loads including Peters Krumble Ball, Remington Spatter-Less, Western Kant-Splash, and Winchester Spatterpruf. The risk of accidental injuries within crowded amusement parks and carnivals encouraged replacement of firearms by air guns during the late 20th century; and by the 21st century those were largely replaced by simulated firearms using thermographic camera or servomechanism target interactions.|$|R
5000|$|A new and {{increasingly}} popular rimfire, the 17 HMR {{is based on}} a [...]22 WMR casing with a smaller formed neck which accepts a [...]17 bullet. The advantages of the 17 HMR over [...]22 WMR and other rimfire cartridges are its much flatter trajectory, and its highly <b>frangible</b> hollow point <b>bullets</b> (often manufactured with plastic [...] "ballistic tips" [...] that improve the bullet's external ballistics). The [...]17 HM2 Mach 2 is based on the [...]22 Long Rifle and offers similar performance advantages over its parent cartridge, at a significantly higher cost. While [...]17 HM2 sells for about four times the cost of [...]22 Long Rifle ammunition (per box of 50 rounds), it is still significantly cheaper than most centerfire ammunition, and somewhat cheaper than the [...]17 HMR.|$|R
