Unfortunately, {{the use of}} free IONPs still faces major challenges such as poor tumor targetability, high variability {{in the amount of}} IONPs taken up by the tumor and the IONP leakage from dead cancer cells into the surrounding healthy tissues. The present work reports on electrospun <b>fiber</b> <b>webs,</b> heavily loaded with 50 nm sized IONPs. The high loading capacity of the fibers enables significant heating of the environment upon applying an alternating magnetic field. Furthermore, magnetic fibers can be repeatedly heated without loss of heating capacity or release of IONPs.

In Chapter 2 we proposed to label oral medicines, in particular tablet formulations, by using memofibers. This simple, inexpensive strategy makes the memofiber concept even more attractive for use in developing countries, especially where patients suffer or die from counterfeited medicines of inferior quality. In Chapter 3, the use of electrospun fibers for antiviral applications was looked into. The results point to the enormous potential these fibers have for intravaginal application as thin films as a possible means to counter HIV- 1 spreading.

40|$|International audienceSilica aerogels {{are highly}} porous and {{open-cell}} materials made of amorphous silica nanoparticles, interconnected in a 3 D random network. Silica aerogel-based materials {{have a great}} potential as thermal insulation in building thanks to their very low thermal conductivity. However, pure silica aerogels are fragile with low mechanical moduli. Making aerogel composite materials by combining fibers with a pre-gel mixture of a gel precursor or by impregnating a fiber network by such a mixture {{seems to be a}} promising way to enhance the mechanical properties of such materials. After drying, the resulting composite is called aerogel blanket. The aerogel blanket is mechanically strengthened, flexible and still has a very low thermal conductivity. Aerogel blankets are usually dried using supercritical process but it is considered as a main drawback for large scale industrialization. The present study uses an innovative micro wave drying. The purpose of this work is to analyze and characterize a handy, light, super-insulating aerogel blanket dried in ambient conditions and see if it could be suitable for building thermal insulation. Two types of blankets have been investigated: the first one with a glass <b>fiber</b> <b>web</b> and the second one with a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) <b>fiber</b> <b>web.</b> Hygro-thermal characterizations were done and show that the aerogel blankets have an excellent thermal conductivity (0. 015 W m− 1 K− 1) and a hydrophobic behavior.

40|$|Optimized by Nature for {{millions}} of years, silk {{is one of the}} strongest biomaterials with outstanding mechanical properties, it is both extensible and tough in order to ensure specific functions. In particular, protein-based Bombyx mori silkworm silk's stiffness is originated from the crystalline region of the semi-crystalline fibroin and the extensibility from the length hidden within the amorphous region. The silk fiber is coated with sericin which acts as a glue connecting fibers together and as a matrix in the three-dimensional nonwoven multi-layer composite structure of the cocoon. These properties can be engineered and enhanced with forced reeling silk: fast spun silks are stiffer and less extensible than slow reeled silk. For this study, two-dimensional single cocoon layer webs are created by silkworms and tested under an increasing wind load until failure, the deflections are recorded. To complement the experimental results, the web's structure is generated in two different models: straight <b>fiber</b> <b>web</b> and wavy <b>fiber</b> <b>web</b> models. Both models are studied under constant wind load for four type of fibers with different reeling speeds thus different mechanical properties. These tests indicate that the deflection increases with wind load for both the experiments and the simulations, but also that webs composed of fibers with different mechanical properties are not necessary stiffer and less extensible as the material they are composed of are stiffer and less extensible because of the high redundancy and randomness of the web structure. The divergence in results between the experiments and the simulations suggests the need to improve the models to be more in accordance with the real webs. by Isabelle Su. Thesis: M.

30|$|As {{mentioned}} in the Introduction, in this section we recapitulate the class of surrogate models developed in [1, 7, 8, 13, 15]. In the surrogate fiber lay-down models the paths of the deposited fibers (as images of arc-length parametrized curves) are described by simplified stochastic differential equations. For this purpose, distinctive process parameters that influence {{the form of the}} <b>fiber</b> <b>web</b> are incorporated. These are the typical throwing ranges of the fibers and their coiling behavior, whereas the deposition itself is perturbed by some random force which is affected by the entanglement of the fibers above the lay-down region. Other characteristics involve the fiber stiffness and the fiber orientation in space. Additionally, depending on the production process, different specifications can be handled using appropriate reference curves. In this work we restrict ourselves on the situation of a transversal spinning process, that means the fiber lay-down starting from fixed spinning positions onto a straight moving conveyor belt. Therein the belt velocity as well as the spinning speed are predetermined parameters given by the production process. The other parameters have to be appropriately estimated, see Section  3.|$|E

The resulting method proved to deliver very reliable information about the dewatering time and the transient speed of the sheet making process.

The first study compared the difference in formation and strength between softwood and hardwood fibers at three different drainage restrictions. The second study was performed to understand the effect of refining on dewatering time and the connection to resulting sheet properties. The results of both studies showed that at low grammages, the <b>fiber</b> <b>web</b> that was formed {{did not affect the}} dewatering time and speed regardless of the type of fibers or refining level. This meant that the drainage for low grammages sheets was solely controlled by the drainage restriction of the draining pipe on the sheet former.

40|$|Paper forming is {{the first}} step in the paper machine where a fiber {{suspension}} leaves the headbox and flows through a forming fabric. Complex physical phenomena occur as the paper forms, during which fibers, fillers, fines, and chemicals added to the suspension interact. Understanding this process is important for the development of improved paper products because the configuration of the fibers during this step greatly influences the final paper quality. Because the effective paper properties depend on the microstructure of the <b>fiber</b> <b>web,</b> a continuum model is inadequate to explain the process and the properties of each fiber need to be accounted for in simulations. This study describes a new framework for microstructure simulation of early paper forming.

The fibers were modeled with a finite element discretization of the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation in a co-rotational formulation.
