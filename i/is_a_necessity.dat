25|$|While {{commonly}} {{believed that}} lesbian sexual practices involve cunnilingus {{for all women}} {{who have sex with}} women, some lesbian or bisexual women dislike cunnilingus due to not liking the experience or due to psychological or social factors, such as finding it unclean. Other lesbian or bisexual women believe that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> or largely defines lesbian sexual activity. Lesbian couples are more likely to consider a woman's dislike of cunnilingus as a problem than heterosexual couples are, and it is common for them to seek therapy to overcome inhibitions regarding it.|$|E
25|$|Deadwood {{can also}} be an {{aesthetic}} choice for the grower. In bonsai being developed from trees free of dead wood, it may be aesthetically useful to create some deadwood elements to enhance the illusion of age, to hide defects (such as an overlarge or misplaced branch), or to disguise the original trunk after reducing {{the height of a}} tree that is too tall. Whether freely chosen, or forced on the bonsai designer, integrating dead wood into a tree's design <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> for a significant number of bonsai.|$|E

25|$|Regarded as a profuse {{class of}} minor female divinities, they were {{believed}} to inspire those that drank of their waters. Thus potamides, and nymphs in general, were conceived to be endowed with oracular power, to inspire men with the same prophetic gift, and to bestow upon them the natural talent of poetry. Hence, as water <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> to all the creation, the water nymphs, along with the gods Dionysus and Demeter, were also worshipped as providing life and blessings to all existing beings, and this attribute is manifested by a diversity of epithets.|$|E
25|$|While {{microscopy}} is {{a central}} tool in the documentation of biological specimens, it is, in general, insufficient to justify the description of a new species based on microscopic investigations alone. Often genetic and biochemical tests are necessary to confirm {{the discovery of a}} new species. A laboratory and access to academic literature <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity,</b> which is specialized and, in general, not available to amateurs. There is, however, one huge advantage that amateurs have above professionals: time to explore their surroundings. Often, advanced amateurs team up with professionals to validate their findings and (possibly) describe new species.|$|E
25|$|In {{commerce}} and manufacturing, {{there are many}} uses for refrigeration. Refrigeration is used to liquify gases - oxygen, nitrogen, propane and methane, for example. In compressed air purification, {{it is used to}} condense water vapor from compressed air to reduce its moisture content. In oil refineries, chemical plants, and petrochemical plants, refrigeration is used to maintain certain processes at their needed low temperatures (for example, in alkylation of butenes and butane to produce a high octane gasoline component). Metal workers use refrigeration to temper steel and cutlery. When transporting temperature-sensitive foodstuffs and other materials by trucks, trains, airplanes and seagoing vessels, refrigeration <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity.</b>|$|E

25|$|Unlike other organs, {{bone marrow}} cells can be frozen (cryopreserved) for {{prolonged}} periods without damaging too many cells. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> with autologous HSC because the cells must be harvested from the recipient {{months in advance}} of the transplant treatment. In the case of allogeneic transplants, fresh HSC are preferred in order to avoid cell loss that might occur during the freezing and thawing process. Allogeneic cord blood is stored frozen at a cord blood bank because it is only obtainable at the time of childbirth. To cryopreserve HSC, a preservative, DMSO, must be added, and the cells must be cooled very slowly in a controlled-rate freezer to prevent osmotic cellular injury during ice crystal formation. HSC may be stored for years in a cryofreezer, which typically uses liquid nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|Because salt <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> of life, {{the tax on}} it (often {{called the}} salt gabelle) had a broad base and could be set {{at a low rate}} and still {{be one of the most}} {{important}} sources of government revenue. In early times, governments gathered salt revenues by managing production and sales directly. After innovations in the mid-8th century, imperial bureaucracies reaped these revenues safely and indirectly by selling salt rights to merchants who then sold the salt in retail markets. Private salt trafficking persisted because monopoly salt was more expensive and of lower quality, while local bandits and rebel leaders thrived on salt smuggling. Over time, however, this basic system of bureaucratic oversight and private management yielded revenue second only to the land tax, and, with considerable regional variation and periodic reworking, remained in place until the mid-20th century.|$|E
25|$|Life without complex {{chemistry}} is unknown. Such chemistry requires metals, namely elements other than hydrogen or helium and thereby {{suggests that a}} planetary system rich in metals <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> for life. The absorption spectrum of a star reveals the presence of metals within, and studies of stellar spectra reveal that many, perhaps most, stars are poor in metals. Because heavy metals originate in supernova explosions, metallicity increases in the universe over time. Low metallicity characterizes the early universe: globular clusters and other stars that formed {{when the universe was}} young, stars in most galaxies other than large spirals, and stars in the outer regions of all galaxies. Metal-rich central stars capable of supporting complex life are therefore believed to be most common in the quiet suburbs of the larger spiral galaxies—where radiation also happens to be weak.|$|E

25|$|China has {{increasingly}} encouraged multinational corporations to create R centers in China. Chinese critics {{have argued that}} foreign owned R mainly benefits foreign companies and removes many talented Chinese researchers from indigenous companies and institutions. Chinese supporters {{have argued that the}} foreign R serves as a role model and encouragement for indigenous companies and creates skilled communities from which labor and knowledge can easily flow to indigenous companies. In 2010 there were 1,200 such R centers and 400 out the Fortune 500 corporations had created such R centers. Corporations have argued that this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> in order to adapt products for the local requirements of the Chinese market as well as it being essential for maintaining global competitiveness to make use the many available Chinese engineers and scientists. China is now ranked first when multinational corporations are asked in which nation future R centers {{are most likely to be}} located.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} {{suggest that}} these arguments are flawed, ignores history and more laws will {{do more harm than}} good. According to them, child labour is merely the symptom of a greater disease named poverty. If laws ban all lawful work that enables the poor to survive, informal economy, illicit operations and underground businesses will thrive. These will increase abuse of the children. In poor countries with very high incidence rates of child labour - such as Ethiopia, Chad, Niger and Nepal - schools are not available, and the few schools that exist offer poor quality education or are unaffordable. The alternatives for children who currently work, claim these studies, are worse: grinding subsistence farming, militia or prostitution. Child labour is not a choice, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity,</b> the only option for survival. It is currently the least undesirable of a set of very bad choices.|$|E
25|$|Polo saddles are English-style, close contact, {{similar to}} jumping saddles; {{although}} most polo saddles lack a flap under the billets. Some players {{will not use}} a saddle blanket. The saddle has a flat seat and no knee support; the rider adopting a forward-leaning seat and closed knees dissimilar to a classical dressage seat. A breastplate is added, usually attached to the front billet. A standing martingale must be used: so, a breastplate <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> for safety. The tie-down is usually supported by a neck strap. Many saddles also have an overgirth. The stirrup irons are heavier than most, and the stirrup leathers are wider and thicker, for added safety when the player stands in the stirrups. The legs of the pony are wrapped with polo wraps from below the knee to the fetlock to minimize pain. Jumping (open front) or gallop boots are sometimes used along with the polo wraps for added protection. Often, these wraps match the team colours. The pony's mane is most often roached (hogged), and its tail is docked or braided {{so that it will}} not snag the rider's mallet.|$|E

500|$|The {{preparations}} of Britain's {{skiers and}} snowboarders for the Games were {{hampered by the}} financial problems of the British Ski and Snowboard Federation (BSSF), operating under the name Snowsport GB, which was responsible for administering the lottery funds received through UK Sport. In August 2009 the BSFF was £300,000 in debt {{and a number of}} British skiers, including medal hope Chemmy Alcott, were forced to fund their own summer training camps in New Zealand and Chile. On 5 February 2010, just a week before the opening ceremony of the Games, it was announced that BSSF had entered administration after the Royal Bank of Scotland withdrew the organisation's overdraft facility. This put the participation of British skiers in doubt, as a governing body <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>necessity</b> for Olympic competition, [...] but the British Olympic Association (BOA) revived a subsidiary company to take over. The financial difficulties suffered by Alcott, {{partly as a result of}} the BSSF collapse, led her to consider her future in the sport at the end of the Games.|$|E
