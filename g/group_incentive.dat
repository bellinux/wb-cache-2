To further explore this issue this study examines whether the congruence between incentive system and locus of control (LoC) affects team performance. To reconcile opposite lines of argument in literature regarding the best incentive system for a team, this paper uses the social identity perspective and person-environment (P-E) fit theory to understand behavior in a group process.

40|$|<b>Group</b> <b>incentive</b> {{systems have}} to {{overcome}} the free rider or 1 /N problem, which gives workers an incentive to shirk, {{if they are to}} succeed. This paper uses new questions on responses to shirking from the General Social Survey and a special NBER survey of workers at over 300 worksites in 14 companies that have some form of <b>group</b> <b>incentive</b> pay to examine how well workers can monitor their peers and what they do when the peers are not working up to speed. The paper finds that: 1) most workers say that they can detect fellow employees who shirk; 2) many report that they would speak to the shirker or report the behavior or a supervisor, and many report that they did so in the past; 3) the proportion that takes action against shirkers is greatest among workers paid under <b>group</b> <b>incentive</b> systems, in smaller companies, and in companies with good employee-management relations; 4) group incentives interact with high-performance human resource policies such as employee involvement teams, training, task variety, low levels of supervision, and good fixed wages to induce more workers to act against shirking; 5) workers in workplaces where there is more anti-shirking behavior report that co-workers work harder, encourage other workers more, and report that their workplace facility is more effective in ways that should raise productivity and profits. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with three types of incentive programs. First, individual wage incentives that cause a worker's efforts {{to have a major}} effect on his pay. Second, <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> in which the pay of an individual is determined by the output of a group of workers-a group can be as small as a four member work team or as large as the whole firm. Finally, seniority based payment schemes in which the pay of a worker rises rapidly with his tenure with the firm. We show that these payment schemes have the effects in practice that we would predict from optimizing behavior by workers. We find that <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> tend to compress the productivity distribution of workers. This is because the relative performance of the most productive workers tends to fall, and the most and least productive workers have relatively high quit rates when workers are paid on <b>group</b> <b>incentives.</b> We also present evidence that suggests that the low quit rates in large Japanese firms may be due to steep wage-tenure profiles in those firms. ...|$|R

40|$|ForthcomingWe {{examine how}} {{incentive}} systems influence knowledge transfer between group members with equal or different status who solve an interdependent task. In our experiment, group members receive <b>group</b> or individual <b>incentives,</b> while status is manipulated by assigning job titles with corresponding role descriptions. Although all conditions require knowledge sharing to maximize payoffs, our {{results suggest that}} significantly more knowledge is shared under <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> relative to individual incentives when status differences are present, whereas the amount of knowledge shared does not differ across these incentive manipulations for equal-status groups.

Instead, <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> are required to induce cooperative behavior that mitigates the negative effects of status differences on knowledge sharing.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{agricultural}} nonpoint source pollution {{is emerging as}} a priority of state and national pollution control programs.

This study investigates the use of a <b>group</b> <b>incentive</b> contract to encourage adoption of BMPs. The idea behind the <b>group</b> <b>incentive</b> contract is to compensate farmers for actual damages due to adoption of BMPs while avoiding moral hazard problems and exploiting the correlated risks that farmers in a watershed face.

In addition, the relative performance of two types of <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> defined on the basis of group size is also analysed. At the firm level, the results generally confirm predictions from theory that productivity returns to centives are non-linear and concave in shape and that the effectiveness of incentives is decreasing in group size. I argue that the latter is most likely due to the lessening of the free-rider problem and the increased effectiveness of peer/mutual monitoring associated with smaller groups. The results also point to a negative relationship between the level of incentives and employment over time. Group Incentives; Compensation; Free Riding; Peer Monitoring; Trade Unions; India...|$|R

40|$|Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) {{legislation}} aims {{to create}} incentives for producers to design {{products that are}} easier to recycle. In this paper, we study whether a collective EPR implementation, which is common in practice due to its cost efficiency advantage, can achieve this goal. In particular, we look for cost allocation mechanisms in a collective system that provide at least as effective design incentives as those induced by an individual system benchmark, while ensuring voluntary participation of producers (i. e. satisfying <b>group</b> <b>incentive</b> compatibility). Based on a biform network game model, we show that a cost allocation mechanism that satisfies the above criteria exists only if the recycling infrastructure satisfies certain properties in terms of (i) how recycling costs change {{as a function of}} design choices and (ii) the processing capacity mix relative to the return volume. Otherwise, a cost allocation mechanism that leads to effective design incentives can only guarantee individual rationality but not <b>group</b> <b>incentive</b> compatibility. This indicates a critical tradeoff between producers' design incentives and their voluntary participation in a collective system. That is, participation by enforcement may be required for a policy maker to induce superior designs and maintain a stable collective implementation (and therefore realize its cost efficiency advantage). If this is not feasible, then one needs to accept collective implementations as enablers of cost-efficiency at the expense of inferior design incentives, and find other means (i. e., other forms of regulatory intervention) besides cost allocation to provide design incentives...|$|E

40|$|A crucial {{aspect of}} the {{innovation}} process is the exchange of ideas when several workers or teams explore new work methods in parallel. In such a setting, under-exploration may result as workers attempt to free-ride on the new ideas generated by co-workers. This paper studies optimal incentive schemes for innovation and shows that when workers can learn from each other's experience, incentives for innovation fundamentally differ from incentives for routine activities. Optimal incentives for routine activities {{take the form of}} standard pay-for-performance where only individual success determines compensation. In contrast, the optimal incentive scheme for parallel innovation tolerates early failure and provides workers with a combination of long-term individual and <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> for joint success. This result is in line with the empirical regularity documented in previous work that team compensation, profit sharing, employee ownership, and stock option plans are positively correlated with innovative activity. I further show that there exists a causal link between such incentives and innovation. When subjects in a controlled laboratory experiment are asked to perform a task that requires creativity and exploration, they attempt to free-ride on exploration if given standard pay-for-performance contracts. Innovation success and performance is highest when subjects receive a mix of individual and <b>group</b> <b>incentives</b> that reward long-term joint success...|$|R
