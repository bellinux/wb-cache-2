40|$|The {{disposition}} of flavodllol, a novel antihypertensive agent, {{was investigated in}} rats, rabbits, and dogs following iv or oral administra-lion of ‘ 4 C-flavodilol or unlabeled drug. Peak plasma levels occurred within 6 hours of an oral dose in all three species. Following an iv dose, plasma elimination half-lives of <b>flavodilol</b> in rats, rabbits, and dogs were 3. 0, 3. 0, and 4. 0 hr, respectively. Total body clearances were 0. 71 liter/hr/kg for the rat, 1. 89 liters/hr/kg for the rabbit, and 3. 07 liters/hr/kg for the dog. Renal clearances were {{a small fraction of}} total clearance at 0. 042, and 0. 114 liter/hr/kg for the rat and dog, respectively, suggesting extensive nonrenal clearance. The volumes of distribution of 3. 04 for the rat, 8. 10 for rabbit, and 18. 13 liters/kg for dog are large, suggesting significant extravascular distribution of <b>flavodilol.</b> Following 10 and 50 mg/kg po doses of ‘ 4 C-flavodilol In rats, recovery of total radioactivity after 79 hr was 100. 7 % and 88. 4 % of the dose, respectively, most of which was recovered in th...|$|E
