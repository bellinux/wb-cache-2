5|$|Gilbert de Lacy {{was the son}} of Roger de Lacy, who in {{turn was}} the son of Walter de Lacy who died in 1085. Roger de Lacy was banished from England in 1096, and his estates were confiscated. These lands, which {{included}} substantial holdings along the border with Wales, were given to Pain fitzJohn, Josce de Dinan and Miles of Gloucester. Roger de Lacy's lands in Normandy, however, were not confiscated, as they were held of the Bishop of Bayeux in <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
5|$|Walter {{was given}} the lordship of Weobley in Herefordshire after the Conquest. He is already attested in the Welsh Marches by 1069, when he is {{recorded}} stopping a Welsh attack and then raiding into Wales in retribution. Walter and Ilbert may have come to England in the household of Odo of Bayeux, the Bishop of Bayeux and half-brother of King William the Conqueror. Although some historians, such as W. E. Wightman, have argued that Walter was a follower of William fitzOsbern, others, including C. P. Lewis and K. S. B. Keats-Rohan, have argued that Walter was an independent agent in England. By the time of Walter's death, he held a block of lands in Herefordshire {{along the border with}} Wales. Another group of lands was centered on Ludlow in Shropshire. These two groupings of lands allowed Walter to help defend the border of England against Welsh raids. Walter also had other lands in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire, and Oxfordshire. Walter kept a large number of his manors in demesne, managing them directly rather than giving them as fiefs to his knightly followers. Some of these lands in Hereford, including Holme Lacy, were held of the Bishop of Hereford through <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure.</b> In total, Domesday Book records Walter's lands as being worth £423 in income per year and as comprising 163 manors in 7 different counties. He was one of 21 individuals with land valued at more than £400 {{at the time of the}} survey.|$|E

50|$|Isenburg-Grenzau, 1502-1664. After {{the death}} of Count Ernest in 1664 without direct heirs, his territories were claimed back as <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> by the Archbishoprics of Cologne and Trier, and the Abbey-principality of Fulda. The core territories {{including}} Isenburg were passed on by Fulda to the Counts of Walderdorff. They had to share them according to a later agreement with the Counts of Wied, by then a cadet branch of the Isenburgs.|$|R
50|$|The Vere lords held at Canfield by two <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> in Domesday Book: as tenant-in-chief of {{the crown}} for two hides and as tenant of Count Alan of Brittany, lord of Richmond for one hide. Over time, the Richmond lordship {{seems to have been}} {{forgotten}} and the Vere Earls of Oxford came to hold all three hides of the king. The estate's manor rolls survive from 14 December, 1346, into the 16th century.|$|R
60|$|This hard word {{is placed}} in the mouth of one of the aged tenants. In the old <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> the herezeld {{constituted}} the best horse or other animal on the vassals' lands, become the right of the superior. The only remnant of this custom is what is called the sasine, or a fee of certain estimated value, paid to the sheriff of the county, who gives possession to the vassals of the crown.|$|R
25|$|Sheridan {{was active}} in {{implementing}} long-needed changes in Scottish law, including the Abolition of <b>Feudal</b> <b>Tenure</b> etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 and the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001, which he introduced as bills in Holyrood on 6 December 2001.|$|E
25|$|The Abolition of <b>Feudal</b> <b>Tenure</b> etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 {{removed all}} the {{remaining}} {{aspects of the}} feudal baronial system, apart from the baronial titles themselves. The entire system whereby land was held by a vassal on perpetual tenure from a superior, was, on this appointed day, abolished.|$|E
25|$|Feu was {{previously}} {{the most common}} form of land tenure in Scotland, as conveyancing in Scots law was dominated by feudalism until the Scottish Parliament passed the Abolition of <b>Feudal</b> <b>Tenure</b> etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. The word is the Scots variant of fee. The English had in 1660 abolished these tenures, with An Act taking away the Court of Wards..., since 1948 known as the Tenures Abolition Act 1660.|$|E
5000|$|Heritable {{jurisdiction}}s were, {{in the law}} of Scotland, {{grants of}} jurisdiction made to {{a man and his}} heirs.They were a usual accompaniment to <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> and conferred power on great families. Both before and after the Union frequent attempts were made by statute to restrict them, since they were recognized as a source of danger to the state. All were finally abolished by the Heritable Jurisdictions Act in 1747, following the Jacobite uprising, with compensation available upon formal application by the dispossessed.---- ...|$|R
40|$|Land tenure {{refers to}} the bundle of rights and {{responsibilities}} under which land is held, used, transferred, and succeeded. This essay surveys land tenure arrangements throughout the world since the Roman Empire. Particular {{attention is paid to}} how six forms of land tenure emerge, function, and change. The six forms of land tenure analyzed are (1) owner cultivation of small, private lands; (2) squatting on public or private lands; (3) large estates or latifundia; (4) <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> with bound and unbound labor; (5) communal tenures; and (6) smallholder leasing from private landowners. ...|$|R
50|$|Apertura feudi, {{in ancient}} law books, denotes {{the loss of}} a <b>feudal</b> Land <b>tenure,</b> by default of issue to him, to whom the feud or fee was first granted.|$|R
25|$|For this reason, {{the family}} sought to acquire lands {{that would be}} classed as unmittelbar (immediate) or held without any {{intermediate}} <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure,</b> directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. During the early 17th century Karl I of Liechtenstein was made a Fürst (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias after siding {{with him in a}} political battle. Hans-Adam I was allowed to purchase the minuscule Herrschaft ("Lordship") of Schellenberg and county of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain Emperor.|$|E
25|$|The family, {{from which}} the principality takes its name, {{originally}} came from Liechtenstein Castle in Lower Austria which they had possessed from at least 1140 until the 13th century (and again from 1807 onwards). The Liechtensteins acquired land, predominantly in Moravia, Lower Austria, Silesia, and Styria. As these territories were all held in <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure</b> from more senior feudal lords, particularly various branches of the Habsburgs, the Liechtenstein dynasty was unable to meet a primary requirement {{to qualify for a}} seat in the Imperial diet (parliament), the Reichstag. Even though several Liechtenstein princes served several Habsburg rulers as close advisers, without any territory held directly from the Imperial throne, they held little power in the Holy Roman Empire.|$|E
25|$|In Scotland teinds {{were the}} tenths of certain produce {{of the land}} {{appropriated}} {{to the maintenance of}} the Church and clergy. At the Reformation most of the Church property was acquired by the Crown, nobles and landowners. In 1567 the Privy Council of Scotland provided that a third of the revenues of lands should be applied to paying the clergy of the reformed Church of Scotland. In 1925 the system was recast by statute and provision was made for the standardisation of stipends at a fixed value in money. The Court of Session acted as the Teind Court. Teinds were finally abolished by section 56 of the Abolition of <b>Feudal</b> <b>Tenure</b> etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.|$|E
5000|$|The Porowakara were a {{minority}} community of wood cutters from Sri Lanka. They {{were a part}} of the <b>feudal</b> land <b>tenure</b> system of Sri Lanka but eventually became absorbed into larger communities.|$|R
50|$|A {{complete}} {{reconstruction of}} the revenue system became necessary during the Restoration. The <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> and dues, with the prerogative rights of purveyance and pre-emption, could not be restored and careful inquiry showed that whilst, before the Civil War, the king's annual revenue amounted to just under £900,000, {{the needs of the}} restored monarchy would now be about £1,200,000 per annum. The commons therefore set about raising such a sum, an hereditary excise on beer and ale being voted in as compensation for the loss of old, feudal dues, whilst temporary excises on spirits, vinegar, coffee, chocolate and tea were put in place.|$|R
50|$|Maxwell-Lyte {{suggests}} that {{the production of the}} book was prompted by the Aid which was to be collected from King Edward I's tenants-in-chief for the marriage of his eldest daughter. The Aid was assessed on fees held by <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> of either knight service or serjeanty. As the Exchequer needed to initiate inquiries for the purpose of assessing and collecting the aid, it was desired that the various documents should be capable of consultation in a format facilitating quick reference. In 1303 many of the original rolls were lent to the officers in charge of making the assessment and collecting of the aid.|$|R
25|$|In 1973, a {{famine in}} Wollo killed an {{estimated}} 40,000 to 80,000, mostly of the marginalized Afar herders and Oromo tenant farmers, {{who suffered from}} the widespread confiscation of land by the wealthy classes and government of Emperor Haile Selassie. Despite attempts to suppress news of this famine, leaked reports contributed to the undermining of the government's legitimacy {{and served as a}} rallying point for dissidents, who complained that the wealthy classes and the Ethiopian government had ignored both the famine and the people who had died. Then in 1974, a group of Marxist soldiers known as the Derg overthrew Haile Selassie. The Derg addressed the Wollo famine by creating the Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) to examine the causes of the famine and prevent its recurrence, and then abolishing <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure</b> in March 1975. The RRC initially enjoyed more independence from the Derg than any other ministry, largely due to its close ties to foreign donors and the quality of some its senior staff. As a result, insurgencies began to spread into the country's administrative regions.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded clan chiefs do {{not emerge}} until the 17th century. According to tradition, they {{had held the}} land at Glen Noe for centuries, although subject to a <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure</b> converted to money rent in later years. [...] In 1806, however, the chief was forced to relinquish the tenancy of Glen Noe due to inability to meet the payments. [...] He and his family subsequently emigrated to the United States.|$|E
500|$|Once England {{had been}} conquered, the Normans faced many {{challenges}} in maintaining control. They were {{few in number}} compared to the native English population; including those {{from other parts of}} France, historians estimate the number of Norman landholders at around 8000. William's followers expected and received lands and titles in return for their service in the invasion, but William claimed ultimate possession of the land in England over which his armies had given him de facto control, and asserted the right to dispose of it as he saw fit. Henceforth, all land was [...] "held" [...] directly from the king in <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure</b> in return for military service. A Norman lord typically had properties located in a piecemeal fashion throughout England and Normandy, and not in a single geographic block.|$|E
5000|$|The feudal barony of Berkeley {{was created}} circa 1155, when King Henry II granted the royal castle of Berkeley to the Anglo-Saxon royal {{financier}} Robert Fitzharding under the <b>feudal</b> land <b>tenure</b> per baroniam.|$|R
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures,</b> particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied in size from the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|R
50|$|In 1857 {{there were}} about 70 'heritors' or feuholders in the barony. Today, of course, there are may more, all {{converted}} into freeholders with the abolition of <b>feudal</b> land <b>tenure</b> by the Scottish Parliament in November 2005.|$|R
2500|$|Takeshima Tōkai Yuraiki Bassho Hikae, {{written by}} Ōya Kyuemon, records that in 1618 the Tokugawa Shogunate granted fishing {{rights to the}} Ōya and Murakawa {{families}} of Yonago, and that in 1661 bestowed the <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure</b> of [...] "Takeshima", which was then referred to Ulleung-do. On the way to Ulleung-do, Japanese fishermen sometimes used islands called in Japanese [...] as an intermediate port of call. In 1677 a retainer {{by the name of}} Saito Hessen compiled the Onshu shicho goki ("Records on Observations in Oki Province"), a set of records based upon observations he had made under orders from the Daimyo of Izumo(Unshū).|$|E
2500|$|The Norman dynasty {{had a major}} political, {{cultural}} and military impact on medieval Europe and the Near East. The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their Catholic piety, becoming exponents of the Catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language of the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy of Normandy, which they formed by treaty with the French crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I of Normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in <b>feudal</b> <b>tenure.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Major revolts followed, which William {{suppressed}} before {{intervening in}} the north-east of England, establishing Norman control of York and devastating the region. Once England had been conquered, the Normans faced many challenges in maintaining control. They were {{few in number}} compared to the native English population; including those {{from other parts of}} France, historians estimate the number of Norman settlers at around 8,000.

50|$|In {{the reign}} of Elizabeth the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 and 1584 avoided {{fraudulent}} conveyances as against all parties and voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in {{the reign of}} Charles II the Tenures Abolition Act 1660 turned most <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> into tenure by {{free and common socage}} and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute of Frauds contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing. The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne. Devises (gifts by will) of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by the Charitable Uses Act of 1735. In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act, the Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801, was passed. In the reign of William IV fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted, and the laws of inheritance and dower were amended.|$|R
5000|$|A Spanish feudal barony {{was a form}} of <b>Feudal</b> land <b>tenure</b> in the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, namely per baroniam (Latin for [...] "by barony") {{under which}} the {{land-holder}} owed the service of being one of the king's barons.|$|R

5000|$|The term {{derives from}} German Lehen, [...] "fee" [...] (<b>feudal</b> land <b>tenure).</b> The term łan {{was also used}} to {{indicate}} an average size of a peasant's tenured farm. Łan was further subdivided into zagony ("belts") and further into skiby ("slices").|$|R
50|$|During the Wars of Scottish Independence, <b>feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> were {{introduced}} by Robert the Bruce that harnessed and controlled the prowess of clans by the award of charters for land {{in order to}} gain support in the national cause against the English. For example, the Clan MacDonald were elevated above the Clan MacDougall, two clans who shared a common descent from a great Norse-Gaelic warlord named Somerled of the 12th century. Clanship was thus not only a strong tie of local kinship but also of Feudalism to the Scottish Crown. It is this feudal component, reinforced by Scots law, that separates Scottish clanship from the tribalism that is found in aboriginal groups in Australasia, Africa and the Americas.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Feudal</b> <b>tenures</b> were {{originally}} {{divided into two}} great classes; those which were called the military tenures, or knight's service, and soccage. The first tenure was that which became oppressive in the progress of society. Soccage was of two kinds; free and villain. The first has an affinity to our own system, as connected with these leases; the last never existed among us at all. When the knight's service, or military tenures of England, were converted into free soccage, in the reign of Charles II., the concession was considered of a character so favorable to liberty as to be classed among the great measures of the time; {{one of which was}} the habeas corpus act! ...|$|R
