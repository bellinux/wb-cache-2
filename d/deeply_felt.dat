5|$|During this period, Ray {{composed}} {{films on}} the British Raj period (such as Devi), {{a documentary on}} Tagore, a comic film (Mahapurush) and his first film from an original screenplay (Kanchenjungha). He also {{made a series of}} films that, taken together, are considered by critics among the most <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> portrayals of Indian women on screen.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, The New York Times Book Review {{published}} a lengthy letter of hers {{in which she}} describes the origins of her <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> hatred of prostitution and pornography ("mass-produced, technologized prostitution") as her history of being violently inspected by prison doctors, and battered by her first husband and numerous other men.|$|E
5|$|In a {{fundraising}} {{speech on}} 5 October 1843 at the Manchester Athenaeum, Dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform, and realised {{in the days}} following that {{the most effective way to}} reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write a <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> Christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays.|$|E
60|$|He {{was ashamed}} to {{acknowledge}} how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> her rejection of his friendship, {{and the thought}} of not seeing her again gave him a sudden sense of weakness and loneliness.|$|R
60|$|How <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> and {{understood}} and sympathized she knew by the quivering pressure on her hand. Ah, {{if he had}} not! If {{he had failed to}} grasp the meaning of her purgatory.|$|R
60|$|The {{young man}} {{gazed at her}} anxious face {{in a way to}} show how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> the weight of the blow he was about to give. Then, after a pause he continued.|$|R
5|$|Narihira {{was not a}} {{profound}} poet. His surviving poems are mainly occasional, and even when the expression suggests <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> emotion, its worldly manner keeps his poetry from attaining {{the grandeur of the}} best Man'yōshū poems in the same vein. He is nevertheless of historical importance as one who maintained the traditions of the waka during the long night of the dominance of poetry in Chinese.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{history of the}} cannon between 1613 and 1795, when the Acehnese sent the Seri Rambai to Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor in return for his brother's services in a military campaign. The Selangor incident began in June 1871 when pirates commandeered a Penang junk, killing its thirty-four passengers and crew, and taking the vessel to Selangor. The British colonial government responded swiftly: a steamer and Royal Navy warship were dispatched to Selangor with instructions to arrest the pirates and recover the stolen junk. After a series of skirmishes {{and the arrival of}} support troops and artillery, the town was burned, the forts demolished and the Seri Rambai taken to Penang. The loss of the cannon was <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> in Selangor: a local prophecy maintains that only when the gun is returned will the town regain its former eminence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the series}} of {{paintings}} about wheat fields, Van Gogh expresses through symbolism and use of color his <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> spiritual beliefs, appreciation of manual laborers and connection to nature.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may find}} leisure to deepen the tints," [...] hastily {{interrupted}} his listener, though the emotion which trembled {{in his voice}} plainly denoted how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> the wound which was given by a world he affected to despise.|$|R
60|$|Ethel <b>felt</b> <b>deeply</b> the obduracy {{and pride}} of these answers; {{her eyes filled}} with tears, and her hopes failed.|$|R
50|$|Raousset-Boulbon {{arrived in}} San Francisco and <b>felt</b> <b>deeply</b> disillusioned after not {{receiving}} the treatment {{he thought was}} deserved for a Count.|$|R
25|$|As much {{as people}} need {{description}} of how language works and how people are using it, they also want instruction in how they ought {{to use it for}} particular purposes, mainly the niceties of standard written English for publication. Bryan Garner meets a <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> need, and he does so responsibly.|$|E
25|$|But it’s {{the depth}} and rich {{complexity}} of that score, presenting a <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> affair of the heart instead of extravagant exoticism, that makes Dr. Sun Yat-sen unique among all those distressing Western musical chronicles of broken-hearted Asians. Here, unconventionally, a happy ending arrives for the lovers and, one hopes, for the nation. Huang’s orchestra {{plays a major role}} in, well, orchestrating that action.|$|E
25|$|Olor Iscanus {{is filled}} with odd words and similes that beg for {{attention}} despite its dark and morbid cognitive appeal. The work is founded on crises felt in Vaughan's homeland, Brecknockshire. During the Civil War {{there was never a}} major battle fought on the ground of Brecknockshire, but the effects of the war were <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> by Vaughan and his community. The Puritan Parliament visited misfortune, ejecting many of their foes, the Anglicans and Royalists. This meant that Vaughan also lost his home at that time.|$|E
60|$|Grandma smiled, but {{something}} shone {{in her old}} eyes very like a tear, and sentimental Lotty <b>felt</b> <b>deeply</b> interested at this point.|$|R
60|$|Something of {{his former}} bleakness of aspect {{returned}} to the office-boy. Sally's question had opened up a subject on which he <b>felt</b> <b>deeply.</b>|$|R
60|$|Peterkin used {{to speak}} very {{strongly}} when talking on this subject, and I observed, from the unusual seriousness of his manner, that he <b>felt</b> <b>deeply</b> too.|$|R
25|$|Wyeth {{was born}} in Needham, Massachusetts. An ancestor, Nicholas Wyeth, a stonemason, came to Massachusetts from England in 1645. Later {{ancestors}} were prominent participants in the French and Indian Wars, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War, passing down rich oral histories and tradition to Wyeth and his family and providing subject matter for his art, which was <b>deeply</b> <b>felt.</b> His maternal ancestors came from Switzerland, and during his childhood, his mother was acquainted with literary giants Henry David Thoreau and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His literary appreciation and artistic talents appear {{to have come from}} her.|$|E
25|$|Anne {{returned}} to Thorp Green in January 1843 where she secured a position for Branwell. He {{was to take}} over as tutor to the Robinsons' son, Edmund, who was growing {{too old to be}} in Anne's care. Branwell did not live in the house as Anne did. Anne's vaunted calm appears to have been the result of hard-fought battles, balancing <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> emotions with careful thought, a sense of responsibility and resolute determination. All three Brontë sisters worked as governesses or teachers, and all experienced problems controlling their charges, gaining support from their employers, and coping with homesickness—but Anne {{was the only one who}} persevered and made a success of her work.|$|E
25|$|With {{the major}} {{demographic}} shifts {{occurring in the}} country in terms of the racial-ethnic composition of the population, the FCC has been criticized for ignoring the issue of decreasing racial-ethnic diversity of the media. This includes charges that the FCC has been watering down the limited affirmative action regulations it had on the books, including no longer requiring stations to make public their data on their minority staffing and hiring. In the second half of 2006, groups such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition, the National Latino Media Council, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the National Institute for Latino Policy, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and others held town hall meetings in California, New York and Texas on media diversity as its effects Latinos and minority communities. They documented widespread and <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> community concerns about the negative effects of media concentration and consolidation on racial-ethnic diversity in staffing and programming. At these Latino town hall meetings, the issue of the FCC's lax monitoring of obscene and pornographic material in Spanish-language radio and the lack of racial and national-origin diversity among Latino staff in Spanish-language television were other major themes.|$|E
30|$|This is {{important}} for a theory of decision and choice: in fact, choices are not only between ‘desires’ or attractive, desirable possible outcomes; we chose between desires, needs, practical things, duties,…; between harms or costs or threats; between plans, means, projects, programs,… not necessarily desirable in se’. Let’s go a bit more <b>deeply</b> on <b>felt</b> goals.|$|R
6000|$|His sympathies were {{thoroughly}} roused, and he determined Ikey should have, as he afterward explained, [...] "one square, out-and-out feed," [...] if no more. Three smoked herring, three seed-cakes, and a five-cent pie {{comprised the}} list of provisions Teddy brought back. That he was guilty of extravagance in purchasing these articles shows how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> for Ikey's sufferings.|$|R
6000|$|The Canon rose. [...] "Believe me, Edward, I sympathise <b>deeply.</b> I <b>felt</b> I had to warn you." [...] He {{held out}} his hand. [...] "Good-bye, my dear friend, do forgive me"; and he went out. In the hall an {{adventure}} befell him so plump, and awkward, that he could barely recite it to Mrs. Rushbourne that night.|$|R
500|$|Fleming {{compares the}} mass to Rossini's operas and early mass {{settings}} and finds restrained vocal lines, {{even in the}} melismas of the Agnus Dei, but observes his [...] "predilection for spicy harmonic twists". She summarizes his [...] "optimistic and <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> faith. Robert King, the conductor of The King's Consort, notes: [...] "It certainly is solennelle, for it is a heartfelt religious work which shows the extraordinary compositional capabilities of this astonishing man of the theatre: {{it is full of}} drama, pathos, colour and intensity." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Pretty Hurts" [...] {{topped the}} Associated Press' top songs of 2014 list, {{in which they}} complimented the track's [...] "heavy, <b>deeply</b> <b>felt,</b> emotional—but most important, beautiful" [...] qualities, and felt that Beyoncé's [...] "rising vocals" [...] brought Sia's words to life. In the 2013 Pazz and Jop Music Critics Poll, the song was ranked at number 424. The song won in the {{category}} for Best Song with a Social Message at the 2014 MTV Europe Music Awards. At the 2014 Soul Train Music Awards, [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] was nominated for The Ashford and Simpson Songwriter's Award.|$|E
500|$|Whitehead also {{described}} religion more technically as [...] "an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone." [...] In other words, religion takes <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> emotions and contextualizes them within {{a system of}} general truths about the world, helping people to identify their wider meaning and significance. [...] For Whitehead, religion served {{as a kind of}} bridge between philosophy and the emotions and purposes of a particular society. [...] It is the task of religion to make philosophy applicable to the everyday lives of ordinary people.|$|E
6000|$|... "An {{hundred pounds}} {{is an awful}} sight of money!" [...] exclaimed Jason, betraying by his countenance how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> the truth of this. [...] "If you have had money in such large sums, so much the more reason why you should set about doing suthin' to repay the old gentleman. Why not set up a school?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Knowing that Zulime {{had always}} been his {{intellectual}} comrade, and realizing how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> the separation which her growing interest in my affairs had brought about, I gave him my hand in silent renewal of a friendship into which something new and deeply significant had come. [...] "I hope she will never regret it," [...] was all I could say.|$|R
6000|$|I {{struggled}} violently {{to reach}} the dear lad, intent on throwing my arms around him {{in order to show}} how <b>deeply</b> I <b>felt</b> this devotion of his which had brought him back, perhaps, to a terrible death; but Master Sitz and Sergeant Corney remained silent and motionless until Jacob was well within the lodge. Then his father said, conveying reproach even in the whisper: ...|$|R
500|$|Franck's {{text was}} {{published}} in [...] in 1715. He included as the closing chorale the fourth stanza of the hymn [...] "" [...] (1611) by Christoph Knoll. Franck wrote a libretto full of biblical references, including (in the first movement) [...] "feeding on honey from the lion's mouth", based on [...] Dürr summarizes that Franck wrote [...] "a <b>deeply</b> <b>felt,</b> personal confession of longing for Jesus". The Bach scholar Richard D. P. Jones notes that the cantata is [...] "one of the most richly inspired of all Bach's Weimar cantatas", and sees the text {{as a part of}} the inspiration, with its [...] "mystical longing for union with Christ".|$|E
500|$|Traherne {{was among}} about twelve Anglican lyricists {{labelled}} by Samuel Johnson as [...] "the Metaphysical Poets." [...] While Johnson did not favour their work, and implied that their poetry was pretentious and obscure, the label has endured {{and has become}} respected {{as that of a}} school of poets. [...] Their poetry [...] "combined passionate feeling with intellectual rigor," [...] and [...] "sought to express <b>deeply</b> <b>felt</b> religious and secular experiences in the form of highly intellectual poems." [...] The metaphysical poets, Traherne included, exhibited an [...] "avid interest in science" [...] drawing upon [...] "imagery from all the new and exciting areas of scientific learning: astronomy, mathematics, geography, medicine" [...] in their works.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{observes that}} if [...] "we follow {{out all the}} {{implications}} of Eliot's evocation of Whitman's [...] "Lilacs" [...] at this critical moment in The Waste Land we might assume it has its origins, too, in a death, in a death <b>deeply</b> <b>felt,</b> {{the death of a}} beloved friend"..."But unlike the Whitman poem, Eliot's Waste Land has no retreat on the 'shores of the water,' no hermit thrush to sing its joyful carol of death." [...] He further adds that [...] "It seems unlikely that Eliot's long poem, in the form in which it was first conceived and written, would have been possible without the precedence of Whitman's own experiments in similar forms." ...|$|E
60|$|Governor Sharpe, of Maryland, {{appointed}} by the king commander-in-chief of all the forces engaged against the French, sought to secure his valuable services, and authorized Colonel Fitzhugh, whom he had placed in temporary command of the army, to write to him to that effect. The reply of Washington (15th Nov.) is full of dignity and spirit, and shows how <b>deeply</b> he <b>felt</b> his military degradation.|$|R
5000|$|The {{poet and}} {{director}} António Reis was the film's assistant director, and his {{influence can be}} <b>felt</b> <b>deeply</b> throughout it. (The film {{was included in the}} film program The School of Reis in 2012.) ...|$|R
