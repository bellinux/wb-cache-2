40|$|U. S. {{commercial}} banks {{continued to be}} highly profitable in 2004. Return on assets and return on equity declined moderately, but the economy's continued expansion and supportive financial conditions helped keep bank profits in the elevated range that has prevailed since the mid- 1990 s. Profits were trimmed a bit by a narrowing of banks' net interest margins as the yield curve flattened and competition put pressure on loan spreads. In addition, gains in non-interest income were less pronounced than in 2003, and non-interest expenses increased. However, the continued improvement in the overall credit quality of business and household loans allowed banks to reduce their provisioning for loan and lease losses, and delinquency and charge-off rates for all loan categories trended down. Bank balance sheets also expanded. A robust housing sector and generally low <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>supported</b> residential mortgage lending, and increases in demand along with an easing of lending standards and terms throughout the year boosted commercial and industrial loans. Banks also reported easing their standards and terms on commercial real estate loans, and such loans increased despite soft conditions in some markets. Still-low <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>supported</b> the continued growth of core deposits, but the greater rise in bank assets required banks to rely more heavily on managed liabilities, which rose strongly last year.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a new explanation for Gibson's Paradox [...] {{the observation that}} the price level and the nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> were positively correlated {{over long periods of}} economic history. We explain this phenomenon interms of the fundamental workings of a gold standard. Under a gold standard, the price level is the reciprocal of the real price of gold. Because gold is adurable asset, its relative price is systematically affected by fluctuations inthe real productivity of capital, which also determine real <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Our resolution of the Gibson Paradox seems more satisfactory than previous hypotheses. It explains why the paradox applied to real as well as nominal rates of return, its coincidence with the gold standard period, and the co-movement of <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> prices, and the stock of monetary gold during the gold standard period. Empirical evidence using contemporary data on gold prices and real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>supports</b> our theory. ...|$|R

The empirical analysis presented in the paper is based on the Life Cycle/Permanent-Income Hypothesis, including a standard model of consumption and incorporating credit supply. We first concluded that credit conditions have a significant impact on household consumption, and that consumption is acutely sensitive to disposable income. Our models further confirmed the acute effect real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have on household consumption.

Drawing on real <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> data for 18 OECD countries for the period 1985 - 2008, persistent deviations from the world <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> that cannot be explained by movements in the real exchange rate are documented. A theoretical mdoel predicts that these unexplained deviations capture foreign exchange rate risk premia. Using panel data techniques, we test the theoretical prediction that a rise in conditional consumption growth volatility relative {{to the rest of the}} world reduces the foreign exchange rate risk premia and, therefore, the real <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b> Our main result is that we find a robust and significant negative relation between the volatility in consumption growth and the level of real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> relatiev to the world <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>supporting</b> this hypothesis. We test the hypothesis that the empirical negative relation between the two variables captuers the relation between real <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and macroeconomic volatility, on the one hand, and macroeconomic volatility and the net foreign asset position, on the other hand.

40|$|We {{explore how}} house prices evolve under {{technological}} progress, when housing serves for consumption {{as well as}} store of value. Technological change leads to human capital substituting physical capital and manual labor. Reduced use of physical capital implies that firms have less tangible collateral to pledge for external finance. This results in lower business demand for credit {{and a decline in}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Over time, savings are redirected to mortgage credit, where houses serve as collateral. Under fixed land supply, house prices rise in real terms. The combination of growing wage inequality and mortgage credit leads to high household leverage for low-skill workers, increasing default rates and foreclosures. Restraining mortgage borrowing is more effective than subsidies to limit mortgage defaults, by containing both leverage and house price appreciation.

Monetary policy is endogenized in this framework and two different measures of monetary policy, viz. NBR and M 1, are investigated.
