500|$|By 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: [...] "Pinkertons great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I {{can tell}} that I was really going for it when I wrote and {{recorded}} {{a lot of those}} songs." [...] In 2010, Bell told The Aquarian Weekly: [...] "Pinkerton has definitely taken {{on a life of its}} own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it." [...] In 2015, following the Pinkerton reissue and the [...] "Memories" [...] tour, in which Weezer performed Blue and Pinkerton in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.|$|E
2500|$|Reuniting {{at their}} parents' {{suburban}} D.C. home, Marvin's brother Frankie discussed {{the events of}} his tenure at Vietnam, detailing experiences that sometimes left the two brothers consoling each other in tears. Then after Frankie explained witnessing violence and murder before he was to depart back to the states, he recalled Marvin sitting propped up in a bed {{with his hands in}} his face. Afterwards, Marvin told his brother, [...] "I didn't know how to fight before, but now I think I do. I <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it my way. I'm not a painter. I'm not a poet.

2500|$|With a new line-up in 1991 {{and a new}} {{recording}} label, Miller retired {{the name}} Game Theory and chose to call his new group The Loud Family. Rolling Stone described this name as both [...] "a hip allusion to the mid-Seventies PBS series An American Family" [...] and [...] "a clever way to describe the sound and feel of the band. Either way, it's a great hook—smart, funny and instantly memorable. All of which, appropriately enough, are qualities shared by Miller's songs." [...] Miller later described his intended reality-show metaphor: [...] "Going through life {{is a lot like}} having cameras on you and you have to perform, but there's no script; you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the normal kind of bumbling thing. Besides, it had the word 'loud' in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her loss in The Voice of the Philippines did {{not stop}} her career as Morissette went on with TV guestings, mall tours, and other {{activities}} together with her fellow Voice of the Philippines finalists. Despite her departure from the competition, comparisons between her and Sarah Geronimo, her mentor, continued to hound her. This was not helped {{by the fact that}} the two have a striking resemblance to each other, an observation which Sarah herself acknowledged during the blind audition, and was noticed as early as her 2010 audition for Talentadong Pinoy. Moreover, even at the outset two judges in the audition noted similarities in the vocal style of the two singers, which was unsurprising given that Amon has always acknowledged Geronimo as a major influence on her, to the point of calling Sarah as her [...] "idol". [...] In an interview, Amon clarified that in the beginning she felt hurt from the comparisons, but at present she considers it an honor. She further elaborated that she will <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> [...] "something different" [...] and find the means to break away from the shadow of her former mentor, and thus establish her own identity.|$|E
2500|$|After {{reducing}} Buemi's lead by 22 {{points in}} the preceding New York City ePrix, di Grassi stated that his team had to improve vastly in gaining any hope of winning the championship in Montreal and was feeling more confident that he previously been: [...] "With the experience that I have with Formula E, {{you know that it}} can go from hell to heaven any weekend, any race. We <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> our best, try and win both races and see how it goes." [...] Buemi, the pre-title favourite, missed the New York City races because of a World Endurance Championship commitment at the Nürburgring, but stated he would prepare for the Montreal events the same way as he would with any other ePrix: [...] "We will try to do the best possible. I hope we can finish this season in style and look forward to it." [...] He created controversy when he raised the issue of his crash with di Grassi at the 2016 London ePrix, saying: [...] "If [...] happens once more like this, what do you think people will think then? It will be very hard to explain for him. He can’t afford anything like that again for his reputation, can he?" [...] Di Grassi responded by noting Buemi lost the first season championship through a driver error and said Buemi had more pressure and another mistake would prevent him from reclaiming the championship: [...] "Everyone feels pressure in a different way of course. He has pressure big time this weekend, much more than me, this is because everyone will be waiting to see if those mistakes come again in Montreal." ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{originally}} did {{the backing}} track {{over the course}} of several days, but we came to the conclusion that it just wasn't good enough. So we did it again in one day flat and got it a lot better. Unfortunately nobody understood the desk properly and when we played it back we found that someone had switched the echo returns from monitors to tracks one and two. That affected the tom-toms and guitars and keyboards which were playing along at the time. There was no way of saving it, so we <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it yet again.

[...] "It is almost too terrible to talk about," [...] she continued after a minute. [...] "You see, for one thing, food isn't as plentiful {{as it is in}} the fall, and we just have to go wherever it is to be found. Those two-legged creatures know where those feeding-grounds are just as well as we do, and they hide there with their terrible guns just as they did when we were coming south. But it is much worse now, very much worse. You see, when we were going the other way, if we found them at one place we could go on to another, but when we are going north we cannot always do that. We cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does. Sometimes we are driven out of a place by the bang, bang of the terrible guns and go on, only to find that we have caught up with Jack Frost, and that the ponds and the rivers are still covered with ice. Then there is nothing to do but to turn back to where those terrible guns are waiting for us. We <b>just</b> <b>HAVE</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{had only}} been for five minutes, in the wing, amid jostling and {{shuffling}} and shoving, that they held this conference. Miriam, splendid in a brocaded anachronism, a false dress {{of the beginning of}} the century, and excited and appealing, imperious, reckless and good-humoured, full of exaggerated propositions, supreme determinations and comic irrelevancies, showed as radiant a young head as the stage had ever seen. Other people quickly surrounded her, and Peter saw that though, she wanted, as she said, a fresh ear and a fresh eye she was liable to rap out to those who possessed these advantages that they didn't know what they were talking about. It was rather hard for her victims--Basil Dashwood let him into this, wonderfully painted and in a dress even more beautiful than Miriam's, that of a young dandy under Charles the Second: if you were not in the business you were one kind of donkey and if you were in the business you were another kind. Peter noted with a certain chagrin that Gabriel Nash had failed; he preferred to base his annoyance on that ground when the girl, after the remark just quoted from Dashwood, laughing and saying that at any rate the thing would do because it would <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> thrust vindictively but familiarly into the young actor's face a magnificent feather fan. [...] "Isn't he too lovely," [...] she asked, [...] "and doesn't he know how to do it?" [...] Dashwood had the sense of costume even more than Peter had inferred or supposed he minded, inasmuch as it now appeared he had gone profoundly into the question of what the leading lady was to wear. He had drawn patterns and hunted up stuffs, had helped her to try on her clothes, had bristled with ideas and pins. It would not have been quite clear, Peter's ground for resenting Nash's cynical absence; it may even be thought singular he should have missed him. At any rate he flushed a little when their young woman, of whom he inquired whether she hadn't invited her oldest and dearest friend, made answer: [...] "Oh he says he doesn't like the kitchen-fire--he only wants the pudding!" [...] It would have taken the kitchen-fire to account at that point for the red of Sherringham's cheek; and he was indeed uncomfortably heated by helping to handle, as he phrased it, the saucepans.|$|E

If he had done istibra' before the ghusl, then he can assume that the liquid is urine he will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> repeat the ghusl; he <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> wudu for his salat. But, on the other hand, {{if he had not}} done istibra' before the ghusl, then he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> assume that it is the remnant of semen he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the ghusl again.|$|R
