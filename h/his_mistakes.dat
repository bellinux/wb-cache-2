5|$|Chuck Boyle (played by Roy Stuart) is Gomer's corporal. He often {{serves as}} Carter's {{conscience}} and sticks up for Gomer when Sergeant Carter is annoyed over <b>his</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Stuart debuted {{in the second}} season and left the show after the fourth season; Boyle was replaced by Duke Slater as corporal for the final season.|$|E
5|$|An {{analogy is}} also made between Gawain's {{trial and the}} Biblical test that Adam {{encounters}} in the Garden of Eden. Adam succumbs to Eve just as Gawain surrenders to Bertilak's wife by accepting the girdle. Although Gawain sins by putting his faith in the girdle and not confessing when he is caught, the Green Knight pardons him, thereby allowing {{him to become a}} better Christian by learning from <b>his</b> <b>mistakes.</b> Through the various games played and hardships endured, Gawain finds his place within the Christian world.|$|E

Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together because they have vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} <b>his</b> <b>mistakes</b> by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E

He {{repeated}} <b>his</b> <b>mistake</b> again when he stole a money worth 10000 php (pesos) from Tristan. After he apologized, Dory told him if he ever repeated <b>his</b> <b>mistake</b> again, she will abandon him.

5|$|Banks {{was given}} his first team debut by manager Doug Livingstone, {{at the expense}} of long-serving Ron Powell, in a Third Division game against Colchester United at Saltergate in November 1958. The game ended 2–2, and Banks kept his place against Norwich City in the {{following}} match; {{by the end of the}} 1958–59 season he had missed only three games, those owing to injury. With no goalkeeping coaching to speak of, Banks had to learn from <b>his</b> <b>mistakes</b> on the pitch, and he soon developed into a modern vocal goalkeeper who ordered the players in front of him into a more effective defence. Having just 23 league and three cup appearances to his name, it came as a surprise to Banks when Matt Gillies, manager of First Division club Leicester City, bought him from Chesterfield for £7,000 in July 1959; this also meant a wage increase to £15 a week.|$|E
5|$|In Luxerion, Lightning investigates {{a series}} of murders where all the victims match the {{physical}} description of the savior. During her journey, she is followed by Noel, who has become obsessed with a prophecy that he must kill Lightning to realize a better world and reunite with Yeul. The two briefly ally to rout the Children of Etro, responsible for the murders, then later do battle. Lightning uses Noel's rage to make him realize and accept <b>his</b> <b>mistakes,</b> lifting his burden. After this, she meets up with Vanille in the Order's cathedral. Vanille shows Lightning a place within the cathedral where {{the souls of the}} dead have gathered. Vanille is being prepared for a ritual to take place on the final day that will apparently purify the souls. She hopes to atone for past actions by doing so.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Villani's Cronica {{is divided}} into twelve books; the first six deal with the largely legendary history of Florence, {{starting}} at conventionally Biblical times to 1264. The second phase, in six books, covers the history from 1264 until his own time, {{all the way up}} to 1346. Villani outlines the events in his Cronica, not by theme, but through year-to-year accounts; for this, he has gained criticism over the years for writing in an episodic manner lacking a unifying theme or point of view. Villani's chronicles are intercut with historical episodes reported just as he heard them, with little interpretation; this often led to historical inaccuracies in his work, making most of <b>his</b> <b>mistakes</b> in the biographies of historical or contemporary people living outside of Florence (even with well-known monarchs). However, his description of such events as the Battle of Crécy in 1346 was fairly accurate according to historian Kelly De Vries. Both Bartlett and Green state that Villani's Cronica represented a departure from medieval chronicles in that a more modernistic approach was taken in describing events and statistics, yet still medieval in that Villani relied on divine providence to explain the outcome of events.|$|E

5|$|In the 1998 storyline {{where he}} fakes dissociative {{identity}} disorder (split personalities) to avoid a prison sentence for hostage and threat charges, he is given four personalities that represent his core being: A childlike personality named Tom, Italian playboy Rod, parental figure Miss Perkins, and the abusive Pete (the personality responsible for his worst misdeeds). The revelation that he is faking the personalities devastates Viki, who had actually suffered from the disorder; it also brings out remorse in Todd, and causes him to reflect on <b>his</b> <b>mistakes.</b> The storyline ends with the implication that the personalities {{may not have been}} as fabricated as Todd believed them to be. The writers also made it so that his difficulties are manifested in his nightmares, which give him insomnia and are designed as a look into his psyche; at multiple points within the series, Téa attempts to help Todd by encouraging him to open up to her about them, which he eventually does. His opinions on his enemies are conveyed clearly; he remains one step ahead of them, and consistently out-smarts police, family, and others he targets, sometimes using weapons.|$|E
5|$|Through such episodes as the {{deception}} of Derby at Gloucester, Edward acquired {{a reputation as}} untrustworthy. During the summer campaign, though, he began to learn from <b>his</b> <b>mistakes,</b> and acted {{in a way that}} gained the respect and admiration of his contemporaries. The war did not end with Montfort's death, and Edward participated in the continued campaigning. At Christmas, he came to terms with the younger Simon de Montfort and his associates at the Isle of Axholme in Lincolnshire, and in March he led a successful assault on the Cinque Ports. A contingent of rebels held out in the virtually impregnable Kenilworth Castle and did not surrender until the drafting of the conciliatory Dictum of Kenilworth. In April it seemed as if Gloucester would take up the cause of the reform movement, and civil war would resume, but after a renegotiation of the terms of the Dictum of Kenilworth, the parties came to an agreement. Edward, however, was little involved in the settlement negotiations following the wars; at this point his main focus was on planning his forthcoming crusade.|$|E
5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, {{what are we to}} make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It would be hard to have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while he did not have the technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed <b>his</b> <b>mistakes,</b> the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

He bought camps and timberland in Canada, then in the upper peninsula of Michigan and finally in Northern California.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the match}} began, many {{commentators}} believed that Carlsen had very strong chances of winning. However, many assumed that Anand {{had learned from}} <b>his</b> <b>mistakes</b> in 2013 and would be a stronger opponent this time around. These commentators were vindicated: Carlsen {{had to make a}} greater effort, winning the match with a ratio of wins to losses of 3:1 versus 3:0 in 2013. Commentators saw the match as more interesting precisely because Anand demonstrated himself as a much stronger player than he had done in 2013.|$|E
