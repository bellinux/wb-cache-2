40|$|An {{autosomal}} recessive syndrome characterized by congenital hypotrichosis and short life expectancy {{has been described}} in the <b>Birman</b> <b>cat</b> breed (Felis silvestris catus). We hypothesized that a FOXN 1 (forkhead box N 1) loss-of-function allele, associated with the nude phenotype in humans, mice and rats, {{may account for the}} syndrome observed in <b>Birman</b> <b>cats.</b> To the best of our knowledge, spontaneous mutations in FOXN 1 have never been described in non-human, non-rodent mammalian species. We identified a recessive c. 1030 _ 1033 delCTGT deletion in FOXN 1 in <b>Birman</b> <b>cats.</b> This 4 -bp deletion was associated with the syndrome when present in two copies. Percentage of healthy carriers in our French panel of genotyped <b>Birman</b> <b>cats</b> was estimated to be 3. 2 %. The deletion led to a frameshift and a premature stop codon at position 547 in the protein. In silico, the truncated FOXN 1 protein was predicted to lack the activation domain and critical parts of the forkhead DNA binding domain, both involved in the interaction between FOXN 1 and its targets, a mandatory step to promote normal hair and thymic epithelial development. Our results enlarge the panel of recessive FOXN 1 loss-of-function alleles described in mammals. A DNA test is available; it will help owners avoid matings at risk and should prevent the dissemination of this morbid mutation in domestic felines...|$|R

50|$|Birmans {{were almost}} wiped {{out as a}} breed during World War II. Only two cats were alive in Europe {{at the end of}} the war, a pair named Orloff and Xenia de Kaabaa, both {{belonging}} to Baudoin-Crevoisier. The foundation of the breed in postwar France were offspring of this pair. They had to be heavily outcrossed with long-hair breeds such as Persian and Siamese to rebuild the Birman breed. By the early 1950s, pure Birman litters were once again being produced. The restored breed was recognized in Britain in 1965 and by the CFA in 1966 The first <b>Birman</b> <b>cats</b> were seal point. The blue point colour was introduced in 1959 using blue Persian lines. New colours were later added by English breeders including chocolate, red, and tabby/lynx points. Birmans have also been used in the development of new breeds, notably including the Ragdoll.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess whether Holy <b>Birman</b> <b>cats</b> (HB) have a {{peculiar}} immune profile and a higher rate of infection by feline coronaviruses (FCoV). Leucocyte and lymphocyte subsets, antibody titers, α 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP), globulin fractions, IL- 4, IL- 12 and IFN-γ in blood and fecal FCoV excretion were determined in HB (n = 75) and in cats from other breeds (n = 94). Significantly higher CD 4 /CD 8 ratio, IFN-γ concentration and IL 12 /IL 4 ratio and significantly lower IL- 4 concentration and proportion of shedders were found in HB than in other breeds. No other differences were found. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence of peculiar immune profiles in HB, except for a prevalent Th 1 profile, that may explain why in our caseload the rate of shedders was lower in HB than in other breeds...|$|R
40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{case control study}} describes {{associations between}} feline urate urolithiasis and breed, age, gender, and urine composition. Data from cases of feline uroliths submitted to the Canadian Veterinary Urolith Centre (CVUC) between February 2, 1998 and July 7, 2007 were reviewed. There were 10 083 feline uroliths examined, including 385 ammonium urate, 13 uric acid, and 21 mixed struvite/urate uroliths. The Egyptian Mau, Birman, and Siamese breeds were significantly predisposed to urate urolithiasis [odds ratio (OR) = 118, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 38. 2 to 510, P < 0. 001], (OR = 9. 1, 95 % CI = 2. 0 to 32, P < 0. 001) and (OR = 3. 9, 95 % CI = 2. 5 to 5. 9, P < 0. 001), respectively. Urate urolithiasis was more frequent in younger cats (mean age 6. 3 versus 7. 1 y in cats with other uroliths, P < 0. 0001) and in male cats (P = 0. 024). The association between Egyptian Maus and urate urolithiasis was remarkable. The association in Siamese cats is consistent with prior reports, and the association with <b>Birman</b> <b>cats</b> requires further study...|$|R
40|$|International audienceFeline {{infectious}} peritonitis (FIP), {{caused by}} feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection, {{is a highly}} lethal disease without effective therapy and prevention. With an immune-mediated disease entity, host genetic variant was suggested to influence the occurrence of FIP. This study aimed at evaluating cytokine-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), i. e., tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), receptor-associated SNPs, i. e., C-type lectin DC-SIGN (CD 209), and the five FIP-associated SNPs identified from <b>Birman</b> <b>cats</b> of USA and Denmark origins and their associations with the outcome of FCoV infection in 71 FIP cats and 93 FCoV infected non-FIP cats in a genetically more diverse cat populations. A promoter variant, fTNFA - 421  T, {{was found to be}} a disease-resistance allele. One SNP was identified in the extracellular domain (ECD) of fCD 209 at position + 1900, a G to A substitution, and the A allele was associated with FIP susceptibility. Three SNPs located in the introns of fCD 209, at positions + 2276, + 2392, and + 2713, were identified {{to be associated with the}} outcome of FCoV infection, with statistical relevance. In contrast, among the five Birman FIP cat-associated SNPs, no genotype or allele showed significant differences between our FIP and non-FIP groups. As disease resistance is multifactorial and several other host genes could involve in the development of FIP, the five genetic traits identified in this study should facilitate in the future breeding of the disease-resistant animal to reduce the occurrence of cats succumbing to FIP...|$|R
40|$|Case summary A 6 -year-old female spayed <b>Birman</b> <b>cat</b> {{presented}} {{with a history of}} weight loss, stiff and short-strided gait in the pelvic limbs and reluctance to jump, progressing to non-ambulatory tetraparesis over 6 weeks. Poor body condition, dehydration and generalised muscle wastage were evident on general examination. Neurological examination revealed mildly depressed mental status, non-ambulatory flaccid tetraparesis and severely decreased proprioception and spinal reflexes in all four limbs. The neuroanatomical localisation was to the peripheral nervous system. Haematology, feline immunodeficiency virus/feline leukaemia virus serology, serum biochemistry, including creatine kinase and thyroxine, thoracic radiographs and abdominal ultrasound did not reveal significant abnormalities. Electromyography revealed fibrillation potentials and positive sharp waves in axial and appendicular muscles. Decreased motor conduction velocities and compound muscle action potential amplitudes were detected in ulnar and sciatic–tibial nerves. Residual latency was increased in the sciatic–tibial nerve. Histologically, several intramuscular nerve branches were depleted of myelinated fibres and a few showed mononuclear infiltrations. Toxoplasma gondii serology titres were compatible with active toxoplasmosis. Four days after treatment initiation with oral clindamycin the cat recovered the ability to walk. T gondii serology titres and neurological examination were normal after 11 and 16 weeks, respectively. Clindamycin was discontinued after 16 weeks. One year after presentation the cat showed mild relapse of clinical signs and seroconversion, which again resolved following treatment with clindamycin. Relevance and novel information To our knowledge, this is the first report of distal polyneuropathy associated with toxoplasmosis in a cat. This case suggests the inclusion of toxoplasmosis as a possible differential diagnosis for acquired polyneuropathies in cats...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUveitis is {{a common}} cause of {{blindness}} in feline patients as incorrectly treated or its chronicization can lead to formation of pre-iridal fibrovascular membranes, pupillary block and secondary glaucoma. The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the causes of uveitis in cats diagnosed at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Bucharest between 2012 and 2015. Medical records were reviewed and cats were considered if complete diagnostic work-up, clinical examination and imaging studies were performed. All the feline cases were serologically tested for at least two of the common infectious causes: feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, feline coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii, and Bartonella spp. Ninety-six cats with a mean age of 5. 42 years, ranging from 1 month to 17 years old, with a male to female ratio of 1. 33 / 1 were diagnosed with uveitis. The European domestic cat was overrepresented at 76 % followed by <b>Birman</b> <b>cat</b> (6. 3 %), Persian cat (4. 2 %), Russian blue (4. 2 %), Norwegian cat (2 %), British Short Hair (1 %), Sphynx (1 %) and Cornish Rex (1 %). Infectious diseases were the cause of uveitis in 31 cases (32. 3 %), neoplasia was diagnosed in 22 cases (22. 9 %), uveitis secondary to septic keratitis in 8 cases (8. 3 %) and uveitis secondary to direct ocular trauma in 6 cases (6. 3 %). Twenty-nine cats (30. 2 %) with a mean age of 4. 33 years old were diagnosed with idiopathic or immune-mediated uveitis, less than previously reported. Aqueous flare occurred in 91 cats and keratic precipitates were noted in 39 cats. The most common infectious cause of uveitis in this study was Toxoplasma gondii (n= 18). Infectious diseases remain the most common cause of feline uveitis, therefore systemic evaluation and serological investigations should be performed in all cats with uveitis, cataract and glaucoma...|$|R
40|$|Debate. Published online: 02 July 2016. The {{release of}} new DNA-based {{diagnostic}} tools has increased tremendously in companion animals. Over 70 different DNA variants are now {{known for the}} cat, including DNA variants in disease-associated genes and genes causing aesthetically interesting traits. The impact genetic tests have on animal breeding and health management is significant because {{of the ability to}} control the breeding of domestic cats, especially breed cats. If used properly, genetic testing can prevent the production of diseased animals, causing the reduction of the frequency of the causal variant in the population, and, potentially, the eventual eradication of the disease. However, testing of some identified DNA variants may be unwarranted and cause undo strife within the cat breeding community and unnecessary reduction of gene pools and availability of breeding animals. Testing for mucopolysaccharidosis Type VI (MPS VI) in cats, specifically the genetic testing of the L 476 P (c. 1427 T>C) and the D 520 N (c. 1558 G>A) variants in arylsulfatase B (ARSB), has come under scrutiny. No health problems are associated with the D 520 N (c. 1558 G>A) variant, however, breeders that obtain positive results for this variant are speculating as to possible correlation with health concerns. <b>Birman</b> <b>cats</b> already have a markedly reduced gene pool and have a high frequency of the MPS VI D 520 N variant. Further reduction of the gene pool by eliminating cats that are heterozygous or homozygous for only the MPS VI D 520 N variant could lead to more inbreeding depression effects on the breed population. Herein is debated the genetic testing of the MPS VI D 520 N variant in cats. Surveys from different laboratories suggest the L 476 P (c. 1427 T>C) disease-associated variant should be monitored in the cat breed populations, particularly breeds with Siamese derivations and outcrosses. However, the D 520 N has no evidence of association with disease in cats and testing is not recommended in the absence of L 476 P genotyping. Selection against the D 520 N is not warranted in cat populations. More rigorous guidelines may be required to support the genetic testing of DNA variants in all animal species. Leslie A. Lyons, Robert A. Grahn, Francesca Genova, Michela Beccaglia, John J. Hopwood and Maria Longer...|$|R
50|$|In the 1960's, {{a regular}} non pedigreed white {{domestic}} longhaired cat named Josephine produced several litters of typical cats. Josephine {{was of a}} Persian/Angora type and had litters sired by several unknown male <b>Birman</b> or Burmese-like <b>cats,</b> one of which had the Siamese point coloration. Josephine later produced kittens with a docile, placid temperament, affectionate nature, and a tendency to go limp and relaxed when picked up. When a subsequent litter produced more of the same, Ann Baker purchased several kittens from the owner who lived behind her and, believing that she had something special, set out to create what {{is now known as}} the ragdoll. The breed was selectively bred over many years for desirable traits, such as large size, gentle demeanor, and a tendency to go limp when picked up, as well as the striking pointed coloration.|$|R
