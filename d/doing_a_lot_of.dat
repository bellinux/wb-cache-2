"Yeah 3x" [...] (pronounced [...] "Yeah three times" [...] or [...] "Yeah Yeah Yeah"; {{sometimes}} stylized as [...] "Yeah 3X") {{is a song}} by American {{recording artist}} Chris Brown, released as the lead single from his fourth studio album F.A.M.E. on October 25, 2010. It was written by Brown, DJ Frank E, Kevin McCall, Amber Streeter and Calvin Harris, and was produced by DJ Frank E. Brown recorded the song for his pop audience {{as he had been}} <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> mixtapes and urban records. [...] "Yeah 3x" [...] is an uptempo dance-pop, Europop, and electro house song; it uses a video game-type beat and features a thick bassline and big synth chords. The song uses elements of Harris' 2009 single [...] "I'm Not Alone".|$|E

His comings-and-goings {{from time to time}} throughout the years, even though the role of Todd had been re-cast with St. John, were greeted with anticipation, excitement, and speculation from the fans. At one point in 2000, Howarth returned for a week, accompanied by significant fanfare, in order to assist with the departure of Florencia Lozano (Teá). During the ten years he was on the show, rumors of his departures were reported sometimes weekly by the soap opera press.|$|E

The line [...] "Daddy, I'm so sorry, I'm so s-s-sorry, yeah", according to Gaga, was inspired by [...] "rich kids" [...] in the area who she would hear calling their parents for money to buy drugs with.

500|$|Moore doubletracked his vocals, but {{apart from}} {{occasional}} use of delay did not use any effects on his vocals. He used an Elektron Monomachine and a Minimoog Voyager with computer software to produce the keyboard sounds on the album. Matheos detuned his guitars to C# and sometimes B instead of using a seven-string guitar because he prefers {{the sound of a}} detuned guitar: [...] "To me, they sound totally different if you have those nice loose, floppy strings," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real bitch to keep them in tune, stopping every couple measures, retuning and punching back in. Especially for [...] song that's in B, or even C# is a problem sometimes, especially if you're <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fast moving around or high up on the neck.

500|$|Conversely, IGN's Ramsey Isler {{viewed the}} episode more positively, and rated it 7.9/10.

Despite however finding Walter less entertaining {{than the previous}} season, and believing {{the first half of}} the episode moved too slowly and resembled [...] "an ordinary procedural crime show," [...] Isler enjoyed the ending for [...] " [...] it all together and [...] the previous 90% worthwhile". After watching the episode, MTV columnist Josh Wigler [...] "declared [...] fondness" [...] for Joshua Jackson, stating the actor had [...] "won [...] over thanks to Peter's central role in these first few episodes of Fringes" [...] second season". Wigler continued that it was [...] "an excellent mystery-of-the-week episode to be sure, though I'm really itching for more details on the alternate reality. Luckily, that's supposed to come next week with the return of Nimoy's William Bell, which makes tonight's less mythology-oriented outing easier to swallow. Plus, the end reveal with the Observer was pretty spicy, to say the least." ...|$|E

500|$|Davies {{believed}} that Lee's film did not overcome [...] "the {{problem of the}} guys who get the girls not seeming quite good enough", and set out {{to try to find a}} way of making them into heroes in his script. He said that Austen should have made the reader feel that Edward was worthy of Elinor and explained how Marianne falls in love with Colonel Brandon, after having her heart broken by Willoughby. The writer increased the male roles, so they could be turned into stronger characters. Davies told Hill that the team [...] "worked very hard" [...] on the men. Brandon is seen rescuing people and <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> fast horse riding, while Edward was given a wood-chopping scene where he vents his frustrations about his engagement. Davies also made the Dashwood sisters younger and [...] "more vulnerable" [...] than how they were portrayed in Lee's film. Hattie Morahan, who portrayed Elinor in the drama, stated, [...] "We are trying to play the story as it was written. In the novel the girls are 19 and 17, so these romantic relationships are real rites of passage for them." ...|$|E
500|$|Brown {{said the}} song was {{given to him by}} DJ Frank E {{while he was in the}} studio writing songs for other artists and himself.

It’s not anything too over the top; it’s just right where it needs to be." [...] During a chat with fans on Ustream.tv on September 27, 2010, Brown said that {{the song was}} written in 15minutes; [...] "We actually got the beat and we did it in no time. It was effortless. It was fun. It was sort of like when we wrote 'Forever', so I hope you guys like that record. It's more of a pop record, in the club record." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{buying the}} rights to the film, Katzenberg quickly put it in active {{development}} in November 1995. Steven Spielberg had thought about making a traditionally animated film adaption of the book before, when he bought {{the rights to}} the book in 1991 before the founding of DreamWorks, where Bill Murray would play Shrek and Steve Martin would play Donkey. In the beginning of production, co-director Andrew Adamson refused to be intimidated by Katzenberg and had an argument with him how much should the film appeal to adults. Katzenberg wanted both audiences, but he deemed some of Adamson's ideas, such as adding sexual jokes and Guns N' Roses music to the soundtrack, to be too outrageous. Adamson and Kelly Asbury joined in 1997 to co-direct the film. However, Asbury left a year later for work on the 2002 film , and was replaced with story artist Vicky Jenson. Both Adamson and Jenson decided to work on the film in half, so the crew could at least know who to go to with specific detail questions about the film's sequences; [...] "We both ended up <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> everything," [...] Adamson said. [...] "We're both kinda control freaks, and we both wanted to do everything." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{spent five}} months at Sounds Interchange Studios in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, writing and {{recording}} {{what would become}} Never Say Die!.

Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day." [...] The album was released in September 1978, reaching number twelve in the UK, and number 69 in the US. Press response was unfavourable and did not improve over time with Eduardo Rivadavia of AllMusic stating two decades after its release that the album's [...] "unfocused songs perfectly reflected the band's tense personnel problems and drug abuse." [...] The album featured the singles [...] "Never Say Die" [...] and [...] "Hard Road", both of which cracked the top 40 in the UK. The band also made their second appearance on Top of the Pops, performing [...] "Never Say Die". It took nearly 20 years for the album to be certified Gold in the US.|$|E
500|$|Though Pink Floyd {{turned down}} a {{contract}} worth £136million for a final tour, Waters did not rule out more performances, suggesting {{it ought to be}} for a charity event only.

Pink Floyd the brand is dissolved, finished, definitely deceased." [...] Asked about the future of Pink Floyd, Gilmour responded: [...] "It's over... I've had enough. I'm 60 years old...it is much more comfortable to work on my own." [...] Gilmour and Waters repeatedly said that they had no plans to reunite with the surviving former members.|$|E
