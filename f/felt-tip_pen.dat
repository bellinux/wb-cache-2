5|$|In the past, the Doctor {{arrives at}} da Vinci's home but is {{captured}} by Captain Tancredi, who appears identical to Count Scarlioni. Tancredi reveals {{he is really}} Scaroth, {{a member of the}} Jagaroth race. They had arrived on Earth 400 million years ago, but due an explosion in their craft, all of the others died and his own body was fragmented across time. Collectively, the fragments of Scaroth have manipulated humanity so that by the 20th century, they will have technology that will enable him to go back in time to stop the explosion. Tancredi is currently employing da Vinci to create copies of the Mona Lisa as to finance Scarlioni's work. After Tancredi leaves, the Doctor knocks out his captor, marks the blank canvases with a <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen,</b> and leaves a message to da Vinci to paint over his writing before returning to the present.|$|E

25|$|A marker pen, marking pen, <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen,</b> or marker, is a pen {{which has}} its own colored ink-source, and usually a tip made of a porous material, such as felt or nylon. Sidney Rosenthal, from Richmond Hill, New York, is {{credited}} with inventing the marker in 1953.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} part of his career, Adams' pencils were embellished by inkers such as Whilce Portacio, Dick Giordano and Terry Austin. When Adams {{attempted}} to ink his own work before becoming a professional, he initially used a Croquille pen, but after meeting Mike Mignola, he was spurred to switch to a brush, which he used for approximately a year before returning to a Croquille. He eventually began to ink his own work, which he prefers to do. Beginning in the late 1990s, he began using the Staedtler Pigment Liner, a <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen.</b> He prefers pens to brushes because pens feel [...] "looser", and cited this as his reason for using felt-tip pens when he inked [...] "Jonni Future".|$|E

Schaffner did as requested, then quietly asked to see the bomb. Cooper cracked open his briefcase long {{enough for her to}} glimpse eight red cylinders ("four on top of four") attached to wires coated with red insulation, and a large cylindrical battery. After closing the briefcase, he dictated his demands: $200,000 in [...] "negotiable American currency"; four parachutes (two primary and two reserve); and a fuel truck standing by in Seattle to refuel the aircraft upon arrival. Schaffner conveyed Cooper's instructions to the pilots in the cockpit: when she returned, he was wearing dark sunglasses.|$|E
2500|$|On September 27, 1969, Pacific Union College {{students}} Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard were picnicking at Lake Berryessa on a {{small island}} connected by a sand spit to Twin Oak Ridge. A white man, about 5'11" [...] weighting more than 170 lbs with combed greasy brown hair, approached them wearing a black executioner's-type hood with clip-on sunglasses over the eye-holes and a bib-like device on his chest that had a white 3"x3" [...] cross-circle symbol on it. He approached them with a gun, which Hartnell {{believed to be a}} [...]45. The hooded man claimed to be an escaped convict from a 2 words jail of either Colorado or Montana (police officer estimated he meant Deer Lodge, Montana), where he had killed a guard and stolen a car, explaining that he needed their car and money to go to Mexico. He had brought precut lengths of plastic clothesline and told Shepard to tie up Hartnell, before he tied her up. The killer checked, and tightened Hartnell's bonds after discovering Shepard had bound Hartnell's hands loosely. Hartnell initially believed it to be a weird robbery, but the man drew a knife and stabbed them both repeatedly. The killer then hiked 500 yards back up to Knoxville Road, drew the cross-circle symbol on Hartnell's car door with a black <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen,</b> and wrote beneath it: [...] "Vallejo/12-20-68/7-4-69/Sept 27–69–6:30/by knife." ...|$|E

Marker pens and highlighters, both similar to felt pens, have become popular in recent times.|$|R
50|$|Kenojuak Ashevak {{became one}} of the first Inuit women in Cape Dorset to begin drawing. She worked in graphite, {{coloured}} pencils and <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pens,</b> and occasionally used poster paints, watercolours or acrylics. She created many carvings from soapstone and thousands of drawings, etchings, stonecut prints and prints — all sought after by museums and collectors. She designed several drawings for Canadian stamps and coins, and in 2004 she created the first Inuit-designed stained-glass window for the John Bell Chapel in Oakville, Ontario.|$|R

50|$|Kurts Fridrihsons {{is known}} as one of the most {{exquisite}} draughtsman in the second half of 20th century Latvia. His most preferred technique was watercolour and later <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen.</b> Main themes of his art was Latvian folklore, ancient legends, literature and art of the world. In 1960s, he was called an abstractionist. Later he intensified metaphorically imaginative accent, exquisite colouring and elegance of a line. Since 1974 he mostly worked in <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen</b> technique.|$|E
50|$|The base {{material}} consists of thin, flexible polystyrene plastic (#6) sheets.Prior to heating, the plastic sheets can be colored with <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pens,</b> acrylic paint, colored pencils, etc. {{and cut into}} shapes. However, oily or waxy substances (such as cheap colored pencils, crayons, or oil paint) are not suitable because they melt or burn in high heat. When heated with the Easy-Bake Oven, a conventional oven, or a heat gun, the plastic s by about five-eighths and becomes thicker and more rigid, while retaining the colored design.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} multi-analytical {{study on the}} {{formulation}} of commercial <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pens,</b> introduced {{in the second half}} of the 20 th century and commonly used by modern and contemporary artists. These media of both drawing and writing have not yet been fully investigated, but the degradation processes they might undergo, such as fading, are well-known and rather apparent. Twelve water-based <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pens</b> were investigated by the joint use of complementary analytical techniques, such as Thin Layer Chromatography, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Fourier transformed Infrared spectroscopy, X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometry and Pyrolysis-Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry. The obtained results provided crucial, preliminary data for the identification of dyes, solvents and additives present in the inks' formulations. Numerous synthetic food colouring agents and pigments were identified, such as Acid yellow 23, Acid Red 18, Acid Blue 9, Pigment Blue 15. In addition, glycols, fatty acids, 2 -phenoxyethanol, colophony, benzotriazole derivatives and other solvents and additives were detected in the manufactured inks. Furthermore, the effects of photo-degradation on one emblematic ink sample were studied, highlighting in particular visual and aesthetical changes due to discolouration. This study demonstrates a methodology based upon the use of an integrated analytical approach for the characterisation of commercial ink-based artistic media and their viable degradation patterns, which aims to develop suitable conservation treatments to assess modern and contemporary drawings and writings...|$|R
50|$|Vector {{graphics}} can {{be created}} in form using a pen plotter, a special type of printer that uses a series of ballpoint and <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pens</b> on a servo-driven mount that moves horizontally across the paper, with the plotter moving the paper {{back and forth through}} its paper path for vertical movement. Although a typical plot might easily require a few thousand paper motions, back and forth, the paper doesn't slip. In a tiny roll-fed plotter made by Alps in Japan, teeth on thin sprockets indented the paper near its edges on the first pass, and maintained registration on subsequent passes.|$|R

5000|$|Public toilets {{have long}} been {{associated}} with graffiti, often of a transgressive, gossippy, or low-brow humorous nature (cf. toilet humour). The word latrinalia—from latrine (toilet) and -alia (a collection)—was coined to describe this kind of graffiti. [...] A famous example of such artwork was featured on the album cover of the satirical Tony Award Broadway musical Urinetown, using <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pen</b> scribblings.|$|E
5000|$|Because a CD's {{reflective}} {{metal layer}} and data layer are both directly beneath the thin lacquer {{surface of the}} label, data can be destroyed by even a small scratch {{on the top of}} a CD. The instrument used to label CDs should be seriously considered. Pens or markers with hard tips, or with solvents that can affect the protective layers, can scratch or damage the data layer; water-based <b>felt-tip</b> <b>pens</b> are safest. [...] The data layer of a double-sided DVD is in the middle of the disc, surrounded by the substrate on both sides so scratches to either side are equivalent.|$|R

At first glance it looks as if he has drawn himself selling goods on the street, the hat apparently incidental. But his explanation is different. The box contains rotten fruit, he says. He is wearing a hat to hide his face because he is ashamed to be seen eating such a bad food. 2 This anecdote is an object lesson in both attitudes to street children and the interpretation of information about them. It is a common assumption that children who live and work on the street either have no moral values o...|$|R
