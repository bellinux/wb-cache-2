40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Many of the approximately 100, 000 {{people who did not}} evacuate before Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005 lacked access to a vehicle. In the aftermath of the storm, questions were raised about how well federal, state, and local governments were prepared to evacuate such transportation-disadvantaged populations. Hurricane Katrina, which ultimately resulted in over 1, 300 deaths, also demonstrated difficulties for evacuating hospital patients and nursing home residents and raised questions {{about the role of the}} federal government in assisting in such evacuations. While responding to disasters and managing evacuations is largely a state and local <b>responsibility,</b> <b>the</b> federal government can provide assistance when state and local governments are overwhelmed. The federal government also provides grants and technical assistance for disaster preparedness. In January 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) released the National Response Framework (NRF) [...] replacing the National Response Plan. Its annexes <b>detail</b> <b>the</b> roles and <b>responsibilities</b> of local, state, and federal agencies during emergencies.

The federal government can provide medical resources, such as emergency medical care and the evacuation of hospital patients during disasters, through the National Disaster Medical System (NDMS), a partnership of DHS, the Department of Defense, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and HHS. Recently, Congress expressed concerns about the extent to which GAO's recommendations have been implemented and asked us to assess the progress these agencies have made in doing so. ...|$|R
