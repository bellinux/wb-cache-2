25|$|Approximately 205 million pregnancies occur {{each year}} worldwide. Over a third are {{unintended}} {{and about a}} fifth end in induced abortion. Most abortions result from unintended pregnancies. In the United Kingdom, 1 to 2% of abortions are done due to genetic problems in the fetus. A pregnancy can be intentionally aborted in several ways. The manner selected often depends upon the gestational age of the embryo or fetus, which increases in size as the pregnancy progresses. Specific procedures may also be selected due to legality, regional availability, and <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> woman's personal preference.|$|E
25|$|In transcribing {{directly}} for a <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> group of physicians, there are specific formats and report types used, dependent on that doctor's speciality of practice, although history and physical exams or consults are mainly utilized. In {{most of the}} off-hospital sites, independent medical practices perform consultations as a second opinion, pre-surgical exams, and as IMEs (Independent Medical Examinations) for liability insurance or disability claims. Some private practice family doctors choose not to utilize a medical transcriptionist, preferring to keep their patient's records in a handwritten format, although {{this is not true}} of all family practitioners.|$|E

25|$|Some countries, {{including}} the Czech Republic, require that an alien {{who needs a}} visa on entry be {{in possession of a}} valid visa upon exit. To satisfy this formal requirement, exit visas sometimes need to be issued. Russia requires an exit visa if a visitor stays past the expiration date of their visa. They must then extend their visa or apply for an exit visa and are not allowed to leave the country until they show a valid visa or have a permissible excuse for overstaying their visa (e.g., a note from a <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> hospital explaining an illness, missed flight, lost or stolen visa). In some cases, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs can issue a Return-Home certificate that is valid for ten days from the embassy of the visitor's native country, thus eliminating the need for an exit visa.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{utilitarian}} rationalization {{for research}} on human beings is the ends justify the means. This means that any sort of research on a human being is justified {{by the possibility of}} successfully saving others. For example, all cancer research would be justified by the possibility of finding a cure for cancer, which would inevitably save the life of many others. The utilitarian argument focuses on the greatest good for the greatest number of people or the greater good. Under the utilitarian justification it is a person's duty to sacrifice himself or herself if it would save others as long as the individual person's societal worth is less than the combined societal worth of the others. Therefore, if either a <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> homeless person must die to save the lives of many others, the homeless person must sacrifice himself since he is worth less to society than the doctor.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum {{aspiration}} in {{the first}} trimester is the safest method of surgical abortion, and can be performed in a primary care office, abortion clinic, or hospital. Complications are rare and can include uterine perforation, pelvic infection, and retained products of conception requiring a second procedure to evacuate. Infections account for one-third of abortion-related deaths in the United States. The rate of complications of vacuum aspiration abortion {{in the first}} trimester is similar {{regardless of whether the}} procedure is performed in a hospital, surgical center, or office. Preventive antibiotics (such as doxycycline or metronidazole) are typically given before elective abortion, as they are believed to substantially reduce the risk of postoperative uterine infection. The rate of failed procedures does not appear to vary significantly depending on whether the abortion is performed by a <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> mid-level practitioner. Complications after second-trimester abortion are similar to those after first-trimester abortion, and depend somewhat on the method chosen. Second-trimester abortions are generally well-tolerated.|$|E

25|$|In these countries, abortions {{after the}} general gestational age limit are allowed only under {{restricted}} circumstances, which include, depending on country, {{risk to the}} woman's life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy {{was the result of}} rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman’s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime. Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks. Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a <b>doctor</b> <b>or</b> <b>a</b> special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.|$|E

It is also sometimes used by J.D. holders in academic situations.
