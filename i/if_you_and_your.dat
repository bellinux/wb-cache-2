You will have up The United Irishman before twelve of your Lordship's lion-and-unicorn tradesmen who are privileged to supply some minor matters {{for the vice}} regal establishment? Will you do this, and carry your {{conviction}} with a high hand? I think you will, nay, I think you must, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> nation mean to go on making even a show of governing here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nothing. It has no {{connection}} with this hideous business to-night. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> friend will sit down, I will tell you all I can.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to turn the river here, if we can; and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> companions choose to join us, we will give you good wages." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ain't nobody cookin' up nothin'," [...] growled the man. [...] "I {{know what}} I'm talkin' about. You'd better get busy <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know when you're well off. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> don't, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> uncle gets wind of this--well, good-night for you!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it surely}} won't kill me," [...] she replied; [...] "and, <b>if</b> it makes <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> brother happy, I'm {{willing to take}} some chances." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Believe it <b>if</b> <b>you</b> like, <b>and</b> keep <b>your</b> {{own little}} wings as bright and beautiful, only don't fly {{away for a}} long time yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Beckendorff never takes {{anything}} {{after his}} noon meal, sir; but I {{am sure that}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> friend are hungry, sir, I hope there is never a want in this house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} am of your opinion, colonel," [...] the French major said; [...] "and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> {{men will}} join us, I {{have no doubt}} that we shall be able to clear the village." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{lieutenant}} and I {{count on}} leaving the fort shortly before midnight. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> friends have {{any desire to}} see us set out, {{go down to the}} new works at about that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How can I do that? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> are true, <b>and</b> <b>your</b> offer real, my only {{feelings}} to {{you must be}} gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture." ...|$|R
5000|$|If {{your job}} offers an FSA (also {{known as a}} Dependent Care Account), you can put aside up to $5,000 in per-tax dollars to pay for child care expenses. <b>If</b> both <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> spouse have an FSA, the family limit is $5,000 -- but you could {{get as much as}} $2,000 in tax savings if your {{combined}} contributions reach the maximum.|$|R
6000|$|... "It can’t tell lies," [...] {{said her}} husband confidently, [...] "and now, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> go <b>and</b> put <b>your</b> bonnet on, we’ll drop in at the theatre for half an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fire {{you right}} now. Go {{along to the}} pay-clerk and give him your time. I don't know if that's all we ought to do; but we'll be {{satisfied}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> partner get off this camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are good, indeed, sir," [...] Mrs. Conyers said gratefully; [...] "but I {{could not}} think of {{allowing}} you to do that, and shall indeed be pleased, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> officers will take up your residence here as my guests." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have and}} I will again," [...] Hamel declared. [...] "To-morrow morning I leave this house, but before I go I mean {{to have the}} affair of this man Dunster cleared up.

I should like to be your friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mr. Thrall," [...] Cyril {{answered}} for us, [...] "we {{will sit}} down here, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please; <b>and</b> as <b>your</b> ladies {{are not used}} to business, we will not ask you to disturb them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exiturus (sic) to saluto! The tender carries {{you this}} message of good-bye. Simply speaking, I hate leaving South Africa. And {{of all my}} memories, the last will live the longest.

60|$|Her ladyship and {{the ward}} of the FIZ-ZISH-UN send their best loves, in which I heartily join. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> dear husband come to town before we bring out Bulwer's comedy, I think {{we must have a}} snug reading of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "A little later," [...] Crawshay announced, [...] "either {{just before}} your luncheon or dinner hour, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> friends would {{meet me in}} the smoking room, I should be delighted to {{remember}} in the customary fashion that I have won a rather considerable wager." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heart of my soul, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> compatriots {{distrust}} {{the honesty}} and intelligence of an interested motive {{why is it}} that in your own courts of law, as you describe them, no private citizen can institute a civil action to right the wrongs of anybody but himself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dorcas," [...] he said, [...] "do {{what you}} will. Stay here <b>if</b> <b>you</b> wish, <b>and</b> enjoy <b>your</b> money <b>and</b> <b>your</b> luxuries. I sail {{on the first}} of next month for Africa. Because you are weak, do I cease to be strong?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Overhaul <b>your</b> ranges, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will, <b>and</b> get <b>your</b> anchors clear, {{with all}} my heart.

6000|$|... "Otter," [...] Leonard said quickly, as he {{drew his}} sword, [...] "guard my back, for when I have killed this one the rest will spring. For you, young lady, reach the bridge <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can. Soa <b>and</b> <b>your</b> people are there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{travelling}} together, just we two. We {{are wandering}} {{about the south}} of England {{on our way to}} Falmouth.

6000|$|... "If {{you have}} an hour to spare," [...] Duncombe said, [...] "it {{would give me a}} great deal of {{pleasure}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> daughter would walk down and have a look over my place.

6000|$|... "On your father's authority, {{backed by}} your signature, I imagine that I can do so. But I will not answer as a certainty.

60|$|I wish to {{know how}} it went off at the second reading, and whether any one has had the grace to give it a glance of approbation. I have seen no paper but Perry's and two Sunday ones. Perry is severe, and the others silent. <b>If,</b> however, <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> Committee are not now {{dissatisfied}} with your own judgments, I shall not much embarrass myself about the brilliant remarks of the journals. My own opinion upon it is what it always was, perhaps pretty near that of the public.|$|R
5000|$|When {{you stop}} for refreshment, choose some spring or rivulet <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, <b>and</b> dispose <b>your</b> party {{so as not}} to be surprised, posting proper guards and sentries at a due distance, and let a small party waylay the path you came in, lest the enemy should be pursuing.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{am trying}} to tell you all this while!"

6000|$|... "I cannot {{deny that}} she has spoken {{to me on the}} subject," [...] he answered, [...] "I being a lawyer.

6000|$|... "There {{are other}} {{difficulties}} in the way," [...] continued the young princes. [...] "But is not this enough? Ah, brave Jason, turn back {{before it is too}} late. It would grieve us to the heart, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> nine-and-forty brave companions should be eaten up, at fifty mouthfuls, by this execrable dragon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You stchewpids!' he began. 'There {{is nothing}} to fuss for. Of course, your eyes will smart and be red to-morrow. You will look as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> wives had drunk too much, but {{in a little while}} you will see again as well as before. I tell you this, and I--I am Pirolo. Victor Pirolo!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot even command yourself, Ongoloo, to be a Christian. How, then, can you command others?

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} {{thinking}} about the extension of your telegraph line," [...] said the manager of the mica mine, [...] "and have talked it over with our people. They agree with me {{that it would be a}} good thing, and we have determined, <b>if</b> it suits <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>your</b> company, that we will advance the money necessary to carry out the scheme." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Get {{your breath}} again!" [...] he shouted. [...] "We are over the worse now and shall soon be in calmer water. Get your feet well {{out in front}} of <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, <b>and</b> dig <b>your</b> heels into the mud, then you will act as a {{buttress}} to me and help me to keep my feet." ...|$|R
