By 1981 there were 50artists at Utopia creating batik works; 88 artists participated in a major <b>design</b> <b>project</b> supported by the Central Australian Aboriginal Media Association. Although several sources comment that artistic activity at Utopia began with batik and only later moved to painting, they do not state whether or not Minnie was a textile artist before she took up the brush. The National Gallery of Victoria's brief biography suggests {{that she did not}} participate in the making of batik, but she was aware of it.|$|E

A recent report entitled Educating Engineers for the 21 st Century[9] stresses that engineering courses need to adapt to the changing needs of businesses and to place a greater emphasis on real-life problems by working in collaboration with industrial partners. An initial investigation of <b>design</b> <b>projects</b> across four engineering disciplines was carried out to understand the breadth and depth of <b>design</b> <b>projects.</b> This included identifying key characteristics of the <b>design</b> <b>projects,</b> analysis of learning and teaching activities with respect to constructive alignment and investigation of assessment practices in these <b>design</b> <b>projects.</b> This research also examines the type of students’ experiences.

40|$|In {{conjunction}} with the NSF-funded Foundation Coalition at the University of Alabama selected engineering freshman {{students are required to}} study, analyze and suggest solutions for several engineering <b>design</b> <b>projects.</b> These projects were contributed by engineering faculty from various disciplines. This was to ensure that entering students were exposed to a broad range of engineering discipline material. These projects emphasized teaming, creativity, engineering proactive and communication. Initially these projects were presented to the students on paper and responses were primarily paper-based. This study investigated the creation of a multimedia framework for such engineering <b>design</b> <b>projects.</b> It was found by examining the structure and composition of these <b>design</b> <b>projects</b> that much commonality existed. Based on these findings a suggested general methodology was developed for the production of multimedia versions of present and future freshman engineering <b>design</b> <b>projects.</b> This paper describes the process followed in developing a suggested general methodology for the production of multimedia-based engineering <b>design</b> <b>projects.</b> Several multimedia versions are described and illustrated...|$|R

25|$|The {{construction}} of the capital began {{in what is now}} North Canberra and South Canberra. The pace of building work was slower than expected because of the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and a dispute between Griffin and various Commonwealth bureaucrats. In 1917, a Royal Commission determined that these individuals had undermined Griffin's authority by supplying false data to him, which he had used in carrying out his work. Ultimately, Griffin resigned from the Canberra <b>design</b> <b>project</b> in 1920, when he discovered that several of these same people had been appointed to the Federal Capital Advisory Committee formed to oversee Canberra's construction.|$|E

25|$|Based on this experience, the Soviet naval {{high command}} {{initiated}} a transport submarine program. A first project (Project 605) envisaged a sub that would {{function as a}} barge, towed by a standard sub. The idea was discarded due to towing difficulties. Later, a small cargo submarine <b>design</b> (<b>Project</b> 607) with a capacity of 250-300 tons of solid cargo and two folding cargo cranes was proposed. No weapons beyond two deck guns were envisaged, and the design borrowed many existing parts from the earlier VI and VI-bis submarine series to simplify construction. However, by 1943 the strategic situation had changed, and the plans were not executed.|$|E
25|$|The pace of {{building}} was slower than expected, {{partly because of}} a lack of funds and partly because of a dispute between Griffin and Federal government bureaucrats. Many of Griffin's design ideas were attacked by both the architectural profession and the press. In 1917 a Royal Commission determined that they had undermined Griffin's authority by supplying him with false data which he had used to carry out his work. Ultimately, Griffin resigned from the Canberra <b>design</b> <b>project</b> in December 1920 when he discovered that several of these bureaucrats had been appointed to an agency that would oversee Canberra's construction. The Commonwealth Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Hughes had removed Griffin as director of construction at Canberra after disagreements over his supervisory role, and in 1921 created the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, with John Sulman as chair. Griffin was offered membership, but declined and withdrew from further activity in Canberra.|$|E
25|$|In January 1913, the Corps of Engineers {{reported}} that enough funds were {{left over from}} salvage of the Maine to permit construction of the Arlington National Cemetery Memorial. The following month, shortly before the commemoration ceremonies at the Maine Memorial at Arlington, President Taft announced his preference {{for the establishment of}} the memorial in the field of the Maine dead rather than another location in the cemetery. Secretary of War Lindley Miller Garrison then placed the <b>design</b> <b>project</b> on hold to allow the CFA to consider placement of the memorial in relation to three other projects also approved for construction: The Arlington Memorial Bridge (which included a new drive to a new ceremonial gateway to the cemetery), Arlington Memorial Amphitheater, and a receiving vault and chapel. After discussions about the proposed location for the memorial, Wyeth submitted three designs to the CFA. In executive session, the commission made a recommendation to the Secretary of War. Acting Quartermaster General Henry Granville Sharpe recommended that Secretary of War Garrison accept Wyeth's design, and he did by June 30, 1913.|$|E

25|$|The {{anthology}} film Rogue One {{focuses on}} a band of Rebels stealing {{the plans for the}} first Death Star prior to the events of A New Hope. The Death Star project was overseen by Orson Krennic, the Director of Advanced Weapons Research for the Imperial Military. Under Krennic's supervision, the project was beset by constant delays, and he forcibly recruited weapons designer Galen Erso (the father of Jyn Erso, the movie's main protagonist) to complete the design; nevertheless, it was another fifteen years before the Death Star was operational. The Death Star's primary laser was powered by kyber crystals mined from the desert moon of Jedha, and is first used to destroy Jedha City both as a response to a violent insurgency on the planet, and as a display of the Death Star's operational status to restore the Empire's confidence in the project. Grand Moff Tarkin assumes control over the Death Star while Krennic investigates security breaches in the <b>design</b> <b>project.</b> It is subsequently revealed that Galen discreetly sabotaged the design by building a vulnerability into the reactor. This is the same vulnerability that Luke Skywalker takes advantage of during the events of A New Hope. After the Death Star plans are stolen from the Scarif vault, Tarkin fires the Death Star laser on the base killing Krennic, as well as Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.|$|E

500|$|Gill Sans remains popular, {{although}} a trend {{away from it}} towards grotesque and neo-grotesque typefaces took place around the 1950s and 1960s {{under the influence of}} continental and American design. Typefaces that became popular around this time included original early [...] "grotesque" [...] sans-serifs, as well as new and more elegant designs in the same style such as Helvetica and Univers. Mosley has commented that in 1960 [...] "orders unexpectedly revived" [...] for the old Monotype Grotesque design: [...] " [...] represents, even more evocatively than Univers, the fresh revolutionary breeze that began to blow through typography in the early sixties." [...] He added in 2007 [...] "its rather clumsy design seems to {{have been one of the}} chief attractions to iconoclastic designers tired of the... prettiness of Gill Sans". As an example of this trend, Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert's corporate rebranding of BR as British Rail in 1965 introduced Helvetica and Univers for printed matter and the custom but very similar Rail Alphabet for signage, and abandoned the classical, all caps signage style with which Gill Sans is often associated. Kinneir and Calvert's road signage redesign used a similar approach. Linotype and its designer Hermann Zapf, who had begun development on a planned Gill Sans competitor in 1955, first considered redrawing some letters to make it more like these fonts before abandoning the <b>design</b> <b>project</b> (now named [...] "Magnus") around 1962-3.|$|E

On 2 December 2011, Rosmorport and St. Petersburg-based Baltiysky Zavod signed a contract, worth RUB 7.94 billion of which 30% was paid in advance, for the construction of the 25-megawatt line icebreaker. The keel-laying ceremony, attended by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, was held on 10 October 2012. The construction of the 2,500-ton deckhouse was subcontracted to Nordic Yards in Germany. The ship was initially expected to enter service in the Gulf of Finland in December 2015 and replace two older icebreakers, the 1974-built Ermak and the 1977-built Kapitan Sorokin.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} {{compiling}} the world's knowledge {{in a single}} location {{dates back to the}} ancient Libraries of Alexandria and Pergamum, but the modern concept of a general-purpose, widely distributed, printed encyclopedia originated with Denis Diderot and the 18th-century French encyclopedists. The idea of using automated machinery beyond the printing press to build a more useful encyclopedia can be traced to Paul Otlet's 1934 book Traité de documentation; Otlet also founded the Mundaneum, an institution dedicated to indexing the world's knowledge, in 1910. This concept of a machine-assisted encyclopedia was further expanded in H. G. Wells' book of essays World Brain (1938) and Vannevar Bush's future vision of the microfilm-based Memex in his essay [...] "As We May Think" [...] (1945). Another milestone was Ted Nelson's hypertext <b>design</b> <b>Project</b> Xanadu, which was begun in 1960.|$|E

At {{the same time as the}} Chevette project was being considered in America, Vauxhall Motors publicised a new <b>design</b> <b>project,</b> provisionally referred to as the 'Baby R', but this was not used. Instead a common design was chosen for all markets based upon an existing vehicle, the Opel Kadett. The car was first launched in Brazil in 1973 as a slightly restyled Kadett with a hatchback added to the model range. This hatchback was launched in the U.S. and Britain in 1975 with restyled front ends. [...] Initial production was at Vauxhall's Luton, Bedfordshire factory, then Chevette assembly was moved to the Ellesmere Port plant in Cheshire to allow production of the larger Cavalier and Carlton models to be moved to Luton from Opel plants in Belgium and Germany.|$|E
