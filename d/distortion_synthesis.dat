40|$|Texture-plus-depth ” {{has become}} a popular coding format for mul-tiview image compression, where a decoder can {{synthesize}} images at intermediate viewpoints using encoded texture and depth maps of closest captured view locations via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). As in other resource-constrained scenarios, limited avail-able bits must be optimally distributed among captured texture and depth maps to minimize the expected signal distortion at the decoder. A specific challenge of multiview image compression for DIBR is that the encoder must allocate bits without the knowledge of how many and which specific virtual views will be synthesized at the decoder for viewing. In this paper, we derive a cubic synthesized view distortion model to describe the visual quality of an interpo-lated view {{as a function of}} the view’s location. Given the model, one can easily find the virtual view location between two coded views where the maximum synthesized distortion occurs. Using a multi-view image codec based on shape-adaptive wavelet transform, we show how optimal bit allocation can be performed to minimize the maximum view <b>synthesis</b> <b>distortion</b> at any intermediate viewpoint.

40|$|A depth image {{provides}} partial geometric {{information of}} a 3 D scene, namely {{the shapes of}} physical objects as observed from a particular viewpoint. This information is important when synthesizing images of different virtual camera viewpoints via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR). It {{has been shown that}} depth images can be efficiently coded using contour-adaptive codecs that preserve edge sharpness, resulting in visually pleasing DIBR-synthesized images. However, contours are typically losslessly coded as side information (SI), which is expensive if the object shapes are complex. In this paper, we pursue a new paradigm in depth image coding for color-plus-depth representation of a 3 D scene: we pro-actively simplify object shapes in a depth and color image pair to reduce depth coding cost, at a penalty of a slight increase in synthesized view distortion. Specifically, we first mathematically derive a distortion upper-bound proxy for 3 DSwIM [...] -a quality metric tailored for DIBR-synthesized images. This proxy reduces interdependency among pixel rows in a block to ease optimization. We then approximate object contours via a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm to optimally trade off coding cost of contours using arithmetic edge coding (AEC) with our proposed view <b>synthesis</b> <b>distortion</b> proxy. We modify the depth and color images according to the approximated object contours in an inter-view consistent manner. These are then coded respectively using a contour-adaptive image codec based on graph Fourier transform (GFT) for edge preservation and HEVC intra. Experimental results show that by maintaining sharp but simplified object contours during contour-adaptive coding, for the same visual quality of DIBR-synthesized virtual views, our proposal can reduce depth image coding rate by up to 22 % compared to alternative coding strategies such as HEVC intra.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} provide the line of-sight {{blockage}} of the engine face for an advanced Uninhabited Combat Air Vehicle(UCAV), a highly curved serpentine inlet is proposed and experimentally studied. Based on the static pressure distribut ion measurement along the wall, the flow separation is found at the top wall of the second S duct for the baseline inlet design, which yields a high flow distortion at the exit plane. To improve the flow uniformity, a single array of vortex generators (VGs) is employed within the inlet. In this experimental study, the effects of mass flow ratio, free stream Mach number, angle of attack and yaw {{on the performance of}} a serpentine inlet instrumented with VGs are obtained. Results indicate: (1) Compared with the baseline serpentine design without flow control the application of the VGs promotes the mixing of core flow and the low momentum flow in the boundary layer and thus prevents the flow separation. Under the design condition, the exit flow distortion () decreases from 11. 7 % to 2. 3 % by using the VGs. (2) With the descent of the free stream Mach number the total pressure loss decreases. How ever, the circular total pressure distortion increases. When the angle of attack rises from - 4 ° to 8 °, the total pressure recovery and the circular total pressure distortion both go down. In addition, with the increase of yaw the total pressure recovery is fairly constant, while the circular total pressure distortion ascends gradually. (3) When Ma 0 = 0. 6 - 0. 8, α= − 4 °- 8 ° and β= 0 °- 6 °, the total pressure recovery varies between 0. 936 and 0. 961, the circular total pressure distortion coefficient varies between 1. 4 % and 5. 4 % and the <b>synthesis</b> <b>distortion</b> coefficient has a ranges from 3. 8 % to 7. 0 %.
