5|$|In 2013, Lundgren starred {{alongside}} Steve Austin <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Package.</b> Directed by Jesse Johnson, principal photography {{wrapped in}} March 2012, {{and the film}} was released on February 9, 2013. For a direct-to-DVD film, The Package was not a financial success. In its first week of release, the film debuted at no. 81; grossing $1,469 at the domestic box office. He starred {{in a number of}} other films later that year, including Legendary: Tomb of the Dragon, Battle of the Damned, Ambushed, Blood of Redemption, and the uncompleted comedy-western A Man Will Rise.|$|E
5|$|The {{compilation}} was one {{of several}} ideas Rare considered to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Inspired by fans, upcoming Xbox One backward compatibility features, and a desire to link Rare's past and future, the company sorted through 120 games to choose titles that best represented its oeuvre. It prioritized games with characters and environments original to the company. Rare incorporated six hardware emulators <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package,</b> and worked with its parent company, Microsoft, to use its unannounced Xbox 360 emulation. Rare Replay released worldwide as an Xbox One exclusive on August 4, 2015.|$|E

25|$|Patients with variant {{forms of}} the gene CYP2D6 (also called simply 2D6) may not receive full benefit from {{tamoxifen}} because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites.

25|$|Another {{phenomenon}} {{noted by}} economists {{is that a}} price point for a product (such as $4.99) remains stable {{for a long period}} of time, with companies slowly reducing the quantity of product <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> until consumers begin to notice. At this time, the price will increase marginally (to $5.05) and then within an exceptionally short time will increase to the next price point ($5.99, for example).|$|E
25|$|After the {{opposition}} parties deadlocked the 2007 presidential election by boycotting the parliament, the ruling AKP proposed a constitutional reform package. The reform package was first vetoed by President Sezer. Then he applied to the Turkish constitutional court about the reform package, because the president is unable to veto amendments for the second time. The court {{did not find any}} problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> and 69% of the voters supported the constitutional changes.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the legal}} {{analysis}} and claims contained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> have been thoroughly discredited, some persons who purchase this or similar packages {{have used it}} {{in an attempt to}} justify their decision to stop paying federal income taxes. Hughes made that choice. He failed to file his 2000 through 2002, and 2004 federal tax returns, despite having more than $300,000 in income over that period. In addition to his failure to file returns, Hughes also took affirmative steps to avoid having federal tax withheld from his income, including the filing of fraudulent forms.|$|E
25|$|Many other cartoonists {{paid tribute}} to Peanuts and Schulz by homages in their own strips, {{appearing}} on February 13, 2000, or in the week beforehand. The comic was reprinted the day after that, but only had the farewell letter. After Peanuts ended, United Feature Syndicate began offering the newspapers that ran it a package of reprinted strips under the title Classic Peanuts. The syndicate limited the choices to either strips from the 1960s or from the 1990s, although a newspaper was also given the option to carry both reprint packages if it desired. All Sunday strips <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package,</b> however, come from the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The Sansa Express is a flash-based {{digital audio}} player in {{capacities}} of 1GB and 2GB.

It is also able to record FM radio and voice on its internal memory. This player is not considered as a descendant of the c200 series, as it only plays audio. It is more similar to the m200 series and maintains much of its design and internal software structure. It is the world's first known cable-less flash-based digital audio player, though a USB cable is included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> if one is required to be used.|$|E

25|$|The NFL {{considered}} CBS's bid to be {{the most}} attractive, owing to the network's overall ratings stature (CBS had been the highest-rated broadcast network in the U.S. since the 2005-06 television season), a commitment to aggressively promote the Thursday games across its properties, and its plans to utilize CBS Sports' top NFL talent and production staff across all of the games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> to ensure a major improvement in quality over the previous, in-house productions. CBS staff also cited experience with its joint coverage of the NCAA Men's basketball tournament with Turner Sports as an advantage in its collaboration with NFL Network staff, as talent from both networks collaborate on pre-game, halftime and post-game coverage. During the games, a distinct graphics package co-branded with both CBS and NFL Network logos is used, certain players on each team wear microphones, and 4K cameras are used to allow zoom-in shots during instant replays.|$|E
25|$|Heinz Heydrich was an Obersturmführer (lieutenant), {{journalist}} {{and publisher of}} the soldiers' newspaper, Die Panzerfaust. He was at first a fervent admirer of Hitler. But before Reinhard Heydrich’s State funeral in Berlin in June 1942, Heinz Heydrich had been given a large packet containing his brother’s files, released from his strongbox at Gestapo Headquarters, 8 Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, Berlin. Heinz had shut himself away in his room with the papers. Next morning his wife noticed that her husband had sat up all night burning the documents from the package. Heinz, on leave from the front, could not be engaged in conversation, his wife remembered; he seemed to be elsewhere mentally, and like stone. The files <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> were probably Reinhard Heydrich’s personal files, from which Heinz Heydrich understood {{for the first time in}} all its enormity the systematic extermination of the Jews, the so-called Final Solution. Thereafter, Heinz Heydrich helped many Jews escape by forging identity documents and printing them on Die Panzerfaust presses.|$|E
25|$|On February 5, 2014, the NFL {{announced}} that CBS had acquired the partial rights to Thursday Night Football for the 2014 season. Under the agreement, {{all of the}} Thursday Night Football telecasts would be produced by CBS Sports and called by the network's primary announcing team of Jim Nantz and Phil Simms. The first eight {{games of the season}} were simulcast nationally on NFL Network and CBS; the remaining games <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>package</b> only aired nationally on NFL Network, but per league broadcast polices, were simulcast on local stations in the participating teams' markets. CBS affiliates were given right of first refusal to air the local simulcast before it is offered to another station (as had occurred in Cincinnati, Ohio where the market's NBC affiliate WLWT aired a game between the Bengals and the Cleveland Browns instead of CBS affiliate WKRC-TV). A Saturday doubleheader was also added on Week 16: NFL Network aired the early game, while CBS aired the second, prime time game.|$|E
