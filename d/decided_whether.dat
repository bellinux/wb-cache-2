This ambivalent state of affairs would last until 1954, when the civil liberties faction prevailed, leading to the resignation of most of the anti-Communist leaders.|$|E

There are no regular planar graphs of degree greater than 5. 1 Introduction Regular graphs have been extensively studied from a structural point of view (e. g., [1]) but negligible {{research has been done}} on <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a given graph contains, as a subgraph (not necessarily induced), a regular subgraph of some degree different from 3 : the only case studied in the past is that where the regular subgraph should have degree 3 (i. e., it should be cubic). The result that <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a graph contains a cubic subgraph is NP-complete was attributed to Chv`atal in [5], and was expanded upon in [6], where it was shown that the problem of <b>deciding</b> <b>whether</b> a planar graph of degree at most 7 has a cubic subgraph is [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In {{her work}} How Kantian Ethics Should Treat Pregnancy and Abortion, Susan Feldman argues that {{abortion}} should be defended according to Kantian ethics. She proposed {{that a woman}} {{should be treated as}} a dignified autonomous person, with control over their body, as Kant suggested. She believes that the free choice of women would be paramount in Kantian ethics, requiring abortion to be the mother's decision. Dean Harris has noted that, if Kantian ethics is {{to be used in the}} discussion of abortion, it must be <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> a fetus is an autonomous person. Kantian ethicist Carl Cohen argues that the potential to be rational or participation in a generally rational species is the relevant distinction between humans and inanimate objects or irrational animals. Cohen believes that even when humans are not rational because of age (such as babies or fetuses) or mental disability, agents are still morally obligated to treat them as an ends in themselves, equivalent to a rational adult such as a mother seeking an abortion.|$|E
5|$|The SS Medical Corps were {{initially}} {{known as the}} Sanitätsstaffel (sanitary units). After 1931, the SS formed the headquarters office AmtV as the central office for SS medical units. An SS medical academy was established in Berlin in 1938 to train Waffen-SS physicians. SS medical personnel did not often provide actual medical care; their primary responsibility was medicalized genocide. At Auschwitz, about three-quarters of new arrivals, including almost all children, women with small children, all the elderly, and all those who appeared on brief and superficial inspection by an SS doctor not to be completely fit were killed within hours of arrival. In their role as Desinfektoren (disinfectors), SS doctors also made selections among existing prisoners as to their fitness to work, and supervised the killing of those deemed unfit. Inmates in deteriorating health were examined by SS doctors, who <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> or not {{they would be able}} to recover in less than two weeks. Those too ill or injured to recover in that time frame were killed.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} {{team had}} access to Codemasters' full audio library, which was composed of sound assets dating from the first Colin McRae Rally (1998) up to Grid 2 (2013). On a case-by-case basis, they <b>decided</b> <b>whether</b> to reuse existing sounds or update them. The result {{was a combination of}} audio from various games; suspensions sounds were taken from Dirt 3, wind, gearbox and mechanical samples from Colin McRae Rally 2005, garage sounds from , and music from Colin McRae Rally 04. One aspect of the audio that was kept intact was the original pacenotes read by professional co-driver Nicky Grist. The team did not want to disrupt the timing and delivery of critical track information so they opted to use the original recordings in this case. Support for custom soundtracks was added so that players could listen to their own music in-game.|$|E

The decision was made to rebuild and in 1930 she was rebuilt at the Buffalo Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, New York. During this refit some improvements were made to William S. Grattan. One improvement was that her boilers were converted from burning coal to burning oil. The engines were rebuilt and her firefighting system was updated and could now handle foam fire retardant. Also, the pilot house was raised to the upper boat deck level and a fixed turret tower with a fire monitor was constructed on the stern of the ship. A fourth fire monitor was added {{to the top of the}} pilot house of the ship as well. As part of her acceptance ceremony she participated in a race against the harbor tug Kentucky, which was considered to be one of the fastest tugs on the Great Lakes.|$|E
