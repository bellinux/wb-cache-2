5|$|The {{ecological}} {{conservation of}} seamounts is {{hurt by the}} simple lack of information available. Seamounts are very poorly studied, with only 350 of the estimated 100,000 seamounts in the world having received sampling, and fewer than 100 in depth. Much of this lack of information {{can be attributed to}} a lack of technology, and to the <b>daunting</b> <b>task</b> of reaching these underwater structures; the technology to fully explore them has only been around the last few decades. Before consistent conservation efforts can begin, the seamounts of the world must first be mapped, a task that is still in progress.|$|E
5|$|This is not {{the place}} to pass judgements, but perhaps I may say that, as it seems to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the <b>daunting</b> <b>task</b> of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more <b>daunting</b> <b>task</b> than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms had a much more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E

5|$|Their {{high energy}} and drive make these dogs {{ideally suited to}} a number of {{different}} dog sports such as flyball or agility. Obedience classes are also recommended to potential owners, as Jack Russells can be stubborn at times and aggressive towards other animals and humans if not properly socialized. Despite their small size, these dogs are not recommended for the condominium or apartment dweller unless the owner is ready to take on the <b>daunting</b> <b>task</b> of providing the dog with the necessary amount of exercise and stimulation. They have a tremendous amount of energy for their size, a fact which can sometimes lead to trouble involving larger animals. They may seem never to tire and will still be energetic after their owner has called it a day. While socialised members of the breed are friendly towards children, they will not tolerate abuse even if it is unintentional.|$|E
5|$|In the {{qualifier}} round, in atrocious {{conditions the}} Crusaders defeated the Highlanders 17-0. The game was notable for the Crusaders defence, which kept the highly-talented Highlanders scoreless. The Crusaders then defeated the Chiefs comfortably 27-13, repaying earlier playoff losses to the team. The Crusaders faced the Lions in the final, and {{owing to the}} Lions holding home advantage, had to fly nearly 12,000km. The Crusaders confronted a <b>daunting</b> <b>task</b> to win the 2017 title. The Crusaders would have to battle a formidable Lions team, altitude and 61,000 Lions fans in the fortress of Ellis Park Stadium. The Crusaders started strongly with two tries, jumping out to a 12-0 lead. In the 38th minute Kwagga Smith took out David Havili in the air, causing Havili to fall dangerously. Smith was given a red card. At half time the Crusaders led 15-3. Kieran Read scored a try immediately after half time to extend the lead to 22-3. However, the travel, altitude and fast pace of the game took a toll on the Crusaders. The attacking Lions scored two tries {{to reduce the deficit}} to 25-17. But the defence of the Crusaders held out giving the Crusaders a record eighth title 25-17, while avenging last years result.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} season, Russell {{scored a}} career-high 18.9 {{points per game}}, accompanied by 23.6 rebounds per game. While his rival Chamberlain had a record-breaking season of 50.4 points per game and a 100-point game, the Celtics became {{the first team to}} win 60 games in a season, and Russell was voted as the NBA's Most Valuable Player. In the post-season, the Celtics met the Philadelphia Warriors of Chamberlain, and Russell did his best to slow down the 50-points-per-game scoring Warriors center. In the pivotal Game 7, Russell managed to hold Chamberlain to only 22 points (28 below his season average) while scoring 19 himself. The game was tied with two seconds left when Sam Jones sank a clutch shot that won the Celtics the series. In the 1962 NBA Finals, the Celtics met the Los Angeles Lakers of star forward Elgin Baylor and star guard Jerry West. The teams split the first six games, and Game 7 was tied one second before the end of regular time when Lakers guard Rod Hundley faked a shot and instead passed out to Frank Selvy, who missed an open eight-foot last-second shot that would have won L.A. the title. Though the game was tied, Russell had the <b>daunting</b> <b>task</b> of defending against Baylor with little frontline help, as the three best Celtics forwards, Loscutoff, Heinsohn and Tom Sanders, had fouled out. In overtime, Baylor fouled out the fourth forward, Frank Ramsey, so Russell was completely robbed of his usual four-men wing rotation. But Russell and little-used fifth forward Gene Guarilia successfully pressured Baylor into missed shots. Russell finished with a clutch performance, scoring 30 points and tying his own NBA Finals record with 40 rebounds in a 110–107 overtime win.|$|E

5000|$|One of {{the most}} <b>daunting</b> <b>tasks</b> {{involved}} in studying parasitic relationships from the past is supporting the assertion {{that the relationship between}} two organisms is indeed parasitic. [...] Organisms living in [...] "close association" [...] with each other may exhibit one of several different types of trophic relationships, such as parasitism, mutualism, and commensalism. Demonstration of true parasitism between existing species typically involves observing the harmful effects of parasites on a presumed host. Experimental infection of the presumed host, followed by recovery of viable parasites from that host also supports any claim of true parasitism. Obviously such experiments are not possible with specimens of extinct organisms found in paleontological contexts.|$|R

40|$|Access, maintenance, and {{distribution}} of clean water are <b>daunting</b> <b>tasks</b> for developing nations. Efforts to provide clean drinking water have often fallen short, which has prompted the World Bank to advocate for privatization.

Analysis of attempts to privatize water in the Philippines, with the establishment of the Metropolitan Waterworks Sewerage System (MWSS), shows mixed results. Between 1997 and 2003, citizens with access to water increased from 58 percent to 84 percent, yet water became five times costlier due to privatization. Advocates may applaud the efficiency of the model, but developing nations must emphasize accessibility and affordability of the resource.

40|$|Message-Driven Programming style {{avoids the}} use of {{blocking}} receives and allows overlap of computation and communication by scheduling processes (or objects) depending on availability of messages.

However, many parallel objectbased applications require the object to coordinate the sequencing of the execution of their methods. Structured Dagger is a coordination language built on top of Charm that supports such applications by facilitating a clear expression {{of the flow of}} control within the object without losing the performance benefits of adaptive message-driven execution. 1 Introduction One of the <b>daunting</b> <b>tasks</b> for parallel programmers is to tolerate message l [...] ...|$|R
