5|$|Earlier on I {{tried to}} include people {{as much as}} possible. Then I {{realised}} the magic is me really prying stuff {{out of my head}} and getting it on to tape, and that stuff doesn't happen unless I'm completely alone. Sometimes it's about the right amount of blood sugar, just slightly hungover. And I'm really affected by the weather. If it's too nice outside it's insane <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> concept of being inside. Everybody talks about this whole technology versus nature thing and if it's anything that is it: look who my best friends are, a bunch of plastic and circuitry and electricity, when I should be running around getting chased by bumblebees.|$|E

25|$|In particular, I {{shall never}} forget the Barbarians game at Cardiff Arms Park to end our Grand Slam tour of 1984. We weren't in such good shape – our {{discipline}} had surrendered to celebration after beating Scotland and we knew {{this was to be}} Europe's game of retribution against us. We seemed to be constantly counter-attacking to get out of trouble and then Campese struck. He made a break from within his own half, the defence came at him and he stepped left and right with remarkable speed. And in the twinkling of an eye, the try line was his. But he had one defender to beat, the Welsh centre Robert Ackerman. Ackerman, unfortunately, had criticised the Australian victory after our crushing victory in the Test against Wales and Campo didn't have the words to retaliate then. But he retaliated now, with his feet and hands. He turned Ackerman inside out, threatening to go past, then changing direction, offering himself to be tackled then accelerating away until the crowd erupted, first in disbelief, then in sheer amusement and joy at what they were seeing. One yard from the line, Campo passed to Michael Hawker, and I'm sure, to this day, the pass was forward, but the referee knew he had seen artistry of incomparable dimension at work and the only reward he could offer was a try, which he duly did. It's an image I'll always associate with Campese. It remains <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> metaphor of his career.|$|E

[...] The NME described the album's final track, [...] "A Wolf at the Door (It Girl. Rag Doll.)" [...] as [...] "a pretty song, with a sinister monologue {{over the top of}} it"; Greenwood likened its lyrics to a Grimms' fairy tale. Yorke described the song's placement {{at the end of the}} album as [...] "sort of like waking you up at the end... it's all been a nightmare and you need to go and get a glass of water now." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Andrew Hanson, The A.V. Club's Noel Murray {{called the}} {{introduction}} of the First People [...] "a masterstroke {{on the part of the}} Fringe writers".

[...] Ever cautious about going beyond the constitutional limits of the vice-presidency or of encroaching upon presidential prerogative, Adams often ended up lamenting what he viewed as the [...] "complete insignificance" [...] of his situation. To his wife Abigail he wrote, [...] "My country has in its wisdom contrived <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> most insignificant office that ever the invention of man [...] [...] [...] or his imagination contrived or his imagination conceived; and as I can do neither good nor evil, I must be borne away by others and met the common fate." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{documentary}} crew put wireless microphones {{on several}} of the actors and crew and followed them through the conception, pre-production, filming, editing, screening and reception of [...] "Subway". Many people involved with the show found the process extremely disruptive. In particular, Fleder said that he hates to be photographed and found the camera crew distracting and stressful. Fleder, who agreed to interviews for the documentary but refused to wear a microphone on the set, said of the crew, [...] "To pull off a show like this, a seven-day shoot with this much dialogue and this many shots per day, {{you have to be}} really, really focused, and <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> thing with the documentary crew kept pulling away from the focus." ...|$|E
500|$|Fordham {{described}} Mehldau's compositions as [...] "miniature tapestries of taut lyricism {{and surprising}} turns". Mehldau himself indicated {{that some of}} his compositions address a specific need, such as integrating a particular rhythm into his trio, while others emerge from something he has played while improvising. In the latter case, Mehldau likened the difficulty of the composition process to that of a game of chess: [...] "The opening is always easy <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>the</b> middle gets more difficult, more of an intellectual process, more trial and error at work, and the end is always difficult for me." [...] These struggles to find satisfactory endings stem from the tension between needing to close a piece and his desire to leave a sense of open-endedness – [...] "an escape duct of possibility".|$|E
500|$|After the song's bridge, one of {{the women}} makes plans of reuniting with her former boyfriend, but is stopped by Lipa, who gives her the advice she {{received}} {{at the beginning of the}} visual. After this, the group perform a choreography in front of the pool, in which they pull [...] "each other in closer, in an unbreakable ring of limbs". This is Lipa and Scholfield's favorite scene, with the latter stating, [...] "That wrapped up the whole story <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>The</b> viewer is on the outside, but that choreography pulls you into them, and makes you a part of that connection, too." [...] The video ends with the women standing in front of the pool, with the camera turning upside-down and then showing a group of flamingos at the same location.|$|E
