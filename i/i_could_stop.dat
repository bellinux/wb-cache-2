[...] He went on to say: [...] "We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad... but I have such respect for Cambridge... with a lighter crew we've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history." [...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. I just wish <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart".

The following track [...] "Alive Again" [...] {{is described as a}} [...] "trance anthem", and its lyrics revolve around Cher singing about the [...] "broken world of a dissolved relationship". [...] "I only wanna learn to feel the rain/Then maybe <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> the leaves from falling/I only wanna learn to freeze the flame/I know I'll be alive again", she sings during the chorus. Third song [...] "Song for the Lonely" [...] lyrically [...] "evokes September 11", and addresses subjects such as heroism, longing, bravery and perseverance over a disco beat. Musically, it abandons electronic instruments in favor of a more pure and impassioned performance. The following track, [...] "A Different Kind of Love Song" [...] lyrically alludes to themes of tragedy, heroism and brotherhood, while musically it has [...] "cloud-scrapping chorus, breezy melody, and a kitschy production tics", including Cher's heavily processed vocals by Auto-Tune.|$|E
500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt I had come to a point where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>stop</b> searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed it, that she has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E
