2500|$|The DH.77 {{was a small}} low-winged {{lightweight}} monoplane, {{of mixed}} metal-and-wood construction, powered by a 300hp (224kW) Napier Rapier air-cooled <b>H-engine,</b> which offered very low frontal area to minimise drag. [...] The wing was braced with distinctive bracing struts above the wing, while the aircraft had a wide-track fixed tailwheel undercarriage. It was fitted with large span ailerons and a stabilator to give good control characteristics and spin recovery. Armament was the normal pair of synchronised Vickers machine guns, mounted {{on each side of}} the cockpit.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 EMD {{introduced}} the four-stroke sixteen cylinder 265H-Engine, at [...] {{the most powerful}} engine ever produced by EMD, used as the prime mover in the EMD SD90MAC-H locomotive. Instead of completely replacing the 710 series engine, the <b>H-engine</b> was concurrently produced alongside EMD's two stroke engines, although mainly for export. [...] Acceptance of the 265H was limited over reliability issues. As a historical note, the 265H was the first four-stroke engine offered to the market by EMD or its ancestral companies since the Winton 201A {{introduced the}}ir breakthrough in two-stroke Diesel power in 1933.|$|E
2500|$|Based on his {{experience}} with the Albatross, Geoffrey de Havilland believed that a bomber with a good aerodynamic design and smooth, minimal skin area, would exceed the P.13/36 specification. Furthermore, adapting the Albatross principles could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin-powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules (radial engine) and Napier Sabre (<b>H-engine)</b> as alternatives. On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of aluminium and steel but supplies of wood-based products were [...] "adequate." [...] Although inferior in Tension (physics), the strength to weight ratio of wood is equal to or better than light alloys or steel, hence this approach was feasible.|$|E

50|$|The final {{developments}} of the aircraft piston engine were the horizontally-opposed <b>H-engines</b> such as the Rolls-Royce Eagle and the Napier Sabre. These compact engines were tightly packed and, unlike the previous V engines, there was no access to the crankshaft or its bearings once {{the two halves of}} the crankcase were assembled. Accordingly long through-studs were used, passing right through the engine {{from one side to the}} other. On the Sabre, some of these studs were short and served only to clamp the crankcase halves together. The others passed between cylinder heads on each side. The entire tensile force across the engine was taken on these studs, with no tension being placed on the crankcase.|$|R

50|$|The EMD 1010 or EMD 265 {{is a line}} of {{four-stroke}} {{diesel engines}} manufactured by Electro-Motive Diesel. The precursor to the 1010 was introduced c. 1998 as the 265H or <b>H-Engine,</b> The <b>H-engine</b> was initially designed {{for use as a}} 6300 hp 16 cylinder engine in the EMD SD90MAC; however, the early engines were found to be unreliable, and unsuccessful in the market, with the proven EMD 710 2-stroke design being preferred. The EMD four-stroke engine was resurrected in 2015 to meet EPA Tier 4 emissions regulations.|$|E
50|$|The <b>H-engine</b> ended {{production}} {{with the}} 1st Generation Saab 9-5 in 2009 when the intellectual property {{was transferred to}} BAIC. Starting in 2003 with the 9-3 Sport Sedan, Saab began utilizing the L850 engine Ecotec. Beginning in 2010 with the 2nd generation 9-5, all Saabs utilized the Ecotec. There were some technologies carried over into the Ecotec line from the Saab <b>H-engine,</b> {{but for the most}} part there is very little similarity between the two engine families. Saab continues to use its Trionic engine management system with the Ecotec.|$|E
50|$|As of January 2005, the SD90MAC is {{no longer}} in {{production}} due to the Environmental Protection Agency's Tier 2 locomotive emission regulations, although EMD {{may be able to get}} the <b>H-engine</b> approved at some later date. However, the People's Republic of China recently announced an order for 300 JT56ACe locomotives, which also use the <b>H-Engine</b> as its prime mover. A portion of the locomotives will be assembled in kit form by China's own Dalian Locomotive Works. These units were reportedly capable of meeting the EPA's strict regulations and began delivery in the latter half of 2007.|$|E
5000|$|In 1996, Electro-Motive Diesel entered full {{production}} on their , 16-cylinder <b>H-engine,</b> and all SD90MACs made {{from then on}} used that for its prime mover. Locomotives fitted with this engine are {{sometimes referred to as}} SD90MAC-H locomotives. Later versions of the SD90MAC-H feature a Phase II cab, with a new nose which offers higher visibility from the cab than the old nose. The SD90MAC-H did not prove popular with railroads and less than 70 were built, including Electro-Motive Diesel demonstrator units. Since the SD90MAC-H had such a large prime mover, it didn't offer the same operational flexibility as smaller units, limiting its possible customer base to only the largest railroads. Also, since the <b>H-engine</b> was a new design it hadn't reached the same level of reliability as EMD's previous engine. The low reliability on such a large engine was an especially bad combination since the loss of one engine in a train meant the loss of a larger percentage of pulling power than had a smaller engine failed. In the end the SD90MAC-H was only delivered to two railroads, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Canadian Pacific Railway. [...] The Canadian Pacific locomotives were part of an earlier order for 710-engine equipped SD90MAC locomotives that was still in production when Electro-Motive Diesel switched over to the <b>H-engine.</b>|$|E
50|$|The China Railways HXN3 (EMD {{classification}} JT56ACe) is a 6000 horsepower (4.5 MW) {{diesel-electric locomotive}} designed by Electro-Motive Diesel for export to China. All JT56ACe locomotives use AC traction motor technology {{and use the}} EMD <b>H-Engine</b> as their prime mover. The locomotives are capable of meeting the EPA's Tier 2 emissions regulations.|$|E
5000|$|Development of the <b>H-engine</b> was {{announced}} in 1994 as a railway locomotive specific engine - the design {{was influenced by the}} transition to AC traction motors, which had increased adhesion and tractive effort characteristics, allowing an increase in usable power to be usefully converted traction - thus the new design was to have [...] available for traction - a 6000 hp locomotive design would allow one to replace two of the very common 3000 hp SD40-2 locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998 EMD {{introduced}} the four-stroke sixteen cylinder 265H-Engine, at [...] {{the most powerful}} engine ever produced by EMD, used as the prime mover in the EMD SD90MAC-H locomotive. Instead of completely replacing the 710 series engine, the <b>H-engine</b> was concurrently produced alongside EMD's two stroke engines, although mainly for export.

50|$|For 1981 the B-engine was re-designed as the H engine, {{which was}} used through to 1993 (and 1994 cabriolets). Unlike the earlier version, the <b>H-engine</b> is very durable. Saab used Bosch-made {{mechanical}} K-Jetronic continuous fuel injection in the fuel injected and 8-valve turbocharged versions, and the Bosch LH 2.2, 2.4 and 2.4.2 and Lucas Automotive electronic fuel injection systems {{were used in the}} 16-valve versions. The 2.1 L inline-four 16-valve engine used the Bosch LH 2.4.2 EZK electronic ignition system with knock sensor. 1981 was also the first year that the Turbo was available with an automatic transmission. The four-speed manual option disappeared after this year.|$|E
50|$|Initial {{orders for}} the 265H engine powered {{locomotives}} were delivered powered by 4300 hp EMD 710 engines (referred to as SD9043MAC), intended to be converted to the 4 stroke design later once the engine's teething troubles were resolved. Canadian Pacific, Union Pacific and lessor CIT Group acquired this locomotive type. Only CP and UP operated <b>H-engine</b> powered units (SD90MAC-H). UP's fleet was returned to EMD after the lease expired. Considered unsuccessful in the domestic market due to reliability issues and limited operational flexibility of the 6000 horsepower engine, all 265H-powered versions in North America and Australia have been retrofitted with 4300 horsepower 16V710G engines or scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The {{new engine}} was {{designed}} using modern techniques, including 3D modelling, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, and other simulations, {{as well as}} using real world fatigue and other testing. The initial locomotive designed to use the <b>H-engine</b> was the SD90MAC. The crankcase design switched to Ductile cast iron from welded steel (in the 2 stroke series); like the 2-stroke designs the new engine incorporated unitized power assemblies. The V connecting rods switched from fork and blade to side by side and electronic fuel injection replaced mechanical fuel injection. Each engine incorporated two turbochargers, one per cylinder bank. Eight engines were produced and tested at the Transportation Technology Center of the Association of American Railroads in Pueblo, Colorado.|$|E
5000|$|The SD90MAC was {{introduced}} in 1995, along with the SD80MAC locomotives. The SD90MAC was designed to utilize the new 16-cylinder <b>H-engine,</b> while the SD80MAC was designed to use the 20-cylinder version of the existing 710G engine. However, technical problems with the [...] engine resulted in the first locomotives being shipped with [...] 16-cylinder 710G engines, making them similar to the SD70MACs. These locomotives were given the informal model designation SD9043MAC by railroads that purchased them with the option to re-engine them with [...] engines when they became available. [...] This upgrade program, however, was never taken advantage of by SD90MAC buyers due to reliability issues with the newer engine. Over 400 SD90MAC locomotives fitted with the [...] 710 engine were built.|$|E
50|$|Geoffrey de Havilland also {{believed}} a bomber with an aerodynamic design, with minimal skin area, {{was better than}} the P.13/36 specification. He thought that adapting the Albatross to meet the RAF's requirements could save time. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced for a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin-powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules (radial engine) and Napier Sabre (<b>H-engine)</b> as alternatives. On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote to Air Marshal Wilfrid Freeman, the Air Council's member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in war there would be shortages of duralumin and steel but there should be plenty of wood. Although inferior torsionally, the strength to weight ratio of wood was as good as duralumin or steel, and a different approach to a high-speed bomber was possible.|$|E
5000|$|The {{units that}} will be rebuilt are all ex-Union Pacific EMD SD90MAC locomotives. The SD90MAC was {{introduced}} in 1995 and was designed {{to use the new}} 16-cylinder, 6,000-horsepower (4,500 kW) <b>H-engine.</b> However, technical problems with the 265 engine resulted in the locomotives being delivered with the 4,300 hp (3,210 kW) 16-cylinder 710G used in EMD's SD70MAC. UP referred to these locomotives as SD9043MACs, and EMD planned to offer customers the option to upgrade them to the 6,000 hp (4,470 kW) 265 engine at a later date. EMD's upgrade program, however, was never carried out due to unresolved reliability issues with the 265. Over 400 SD90MAC locomotives fitted with the 4,300 hp (3,210 kW) 710 engine were built. 100 units originally ordered by Union Pacific were sold to Norfolk Southern as part of the SD70ACu rebuild program. EMD is responsible for delivering the locomotives, and as of November 2015, all units have been delivered. They are numbered 7229-7328. In July 2016, Norfolk Southern acquired another 10 SD90MAC locomotives from CIT Financial and the Indiana Railroad for the SD70ACu program. They will be numbered 7329-7338.|$|E

Despite the low power of the Rapier (which gave only 60% of the power of the Rolls-Royce Kestrel which powered the competing Hawker Hornet), the DH.77 demonstrated excellent performance, reaching 204 mph (328 km/h) (although performance carrying a full military load was less, reaching 185 mph (298 km/h)). It was delivered to Martlesham Heath for evaluation by the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment on 12 December 1929. Although the prototype was purchased by the Air Ministry, no production followed, the orders going to the heavier and more powerful Hawker Fury, the production version of the Hornet. The DH.77 continued in use at Martlesham until 1934.|$|E
