40|$|According to {{the minimal}} {{version of the}} {{traditional}} analysis of knowledge, there are (at least) three necessary components to knowledge, that is, justified and true belief. In this paper we will argue that even in a global sceptical scenario, all three conditions minimally necessary for knowledge can be satisfied. In particular, we {{will focus on the}} justification requirement and analyse two “traditional” theories of justification, i. e., coherentism and foundationalism, as well as a more “innovative” one, i. e., reliabilism. Then, we will conclude that if we want to continue claiming that, in a global sceptical scenario, a cognitive subject does not know (almost) anything, we should recognise that she may still have justified true beliefs, and we should, therefore, look elsewhere <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>she</b> lacks knowledge...|$|E

50|$|Someone like You is a 2001 {{romantic comedy}} film, based on Laura Zigman's novel Animal Husbandry which {{tells of a}} heartbroken woman who is looking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> was dumped. <b>The</b> film stars Ashley Judd, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Marisa Tomei and Ellen Barkin and was {{directed}} by Tony Goldwyn.|$|R

5000|$|Hebe Heath {{promptly}} {{grabs the}} bottle of bourbon and throws it off the balcony, narrowly avoiding killing any passers-by in the street below. When the police ask her <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> produces one -- [...] "Oh," [...] she cried softly, [...] "it was an ungovernment impulse!" [...] But when it's suggested that she disposed of the bottle because she had put poison in it, her self-protective instinct outweighs her impulses -- [...] "Put something in the bottle? Don't be a damn fool!".|$|R
50|$|Five {{years later}} at the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships in Budapest, Hungary she won the title again only to fail <b>the</b> drug test <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason.</b> <b>She</b> was again {{stripped}} of her title and banned from athletics for life.|$|R
50|$|In September 2007 she was {{reported}} to have left the Iraqi National List <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> refused her ambassadorship to Egypt, grouping in the Council of Representatives, complaining that Allawi was highhanded and had many former Baathists amongst his ranks.|$|R
5000|$|Mackenzie Pearson, {{a student}} at Clemson University, claims to have invented the term. Pearson {{routinely}} posted essays on her Odyssey account and soon started making them humorous.

My roommate and another {{one of my friends}} were in a group called ourselves the 'dad bod squad' and I thought it would be funny to elaborate on what a dad bod was. A lot of guys at my school looked like it so I just built it based off my guy friends and what they did. Originally it was a joke for my circle of friends".|$|R
60|$|Burke {{could not}} forget {{the look in his}} wife's eyes. She was right. It would have been pleasanter if she had stayed with him. They had been married several years, but his love for her had not grown less. Perhaps <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> {{dominated}} him.|$|R

60|$|The pen went scrape, scrape, but Tommy did not weary, {{though he}} often sighed, {{because his mother}} would never read aloud to him what she wrote. The Thrums people never {{answered}} her letters, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason,</b> <b>she</b> said, that those she wrote to could not write, which seemed to simple Tommy to be a sufficient explanation. So {{he had never heard}} the inside of a letter talking, though a postman lived in the house, and even Shovel's old girl got letters; once when her uncle died she got a telegram, which Shovel proudly wheeled {{up and down the street}} in a barrow, other blokes keeping guard at the side. To give a letter to a woman who had been cruel to you struck Tommy as the height of nobility.|$|R
60|$|The smile {{he managed}} to answer, but, noticing that he avoided her eyes, she {{composed}} her lips and lowered her gaze. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> hastened {{to speak to him}} in a tone of indifference, which she put on without effort, as if she had grown adept in duplicity since sunrise.|$|R
50|$|Klüger resists narrating {{her story}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> {{does not want}} her {{audience}} to derive a moral from the Holocaust as a whole. She defends her view, saying (of her time at Auschwitz), “you learned nothing there, and least of all humanity and tolerance.” This undermining perspective appears often {{in the form of}} interjected philosophical asides.|$|R

[...] She also cited the Superstar, Nora Aunor as her inspiration, but she admitted she doesn't want to be compared with Aunor who originally showcased Domingo's latest theater role, Bona. She also cited <b>the</b> Philippines Star <b>For</b> All Season, Vilma Santos as one of her idols. She also parodied some of the famous dialogues and looks of Santos in various films such as D' Lucky Ones. Domingo also announced admiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Philippine actress, Maricel Soriano who is dubbed as [...] "The Diamond Star". She likes how she handled her career and all the issues being thrown at her and she was impressed by her class and elegance.|$|R
50|$|To the professor's annoyance, {{no one has}} {{retained}} any memory of being a Stone-Age person. He had hoped to learn how the human psyche has evolved after 40,000 years.

Helena admits the cave-wife expressed feelings of jealousy and vengeance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reasons</b> <b>she</b> would. Bergman ruminates if man ever will change...|$|R
50|$|Dagny {{chose to}} {{continue}} her studies in Berlin, possibly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> could be with Munch, who had travelled there {{in the autumn of}} 1892, after the Union of Berlin Artists had invited him to stage a November exhibition of his work. The scandal that resulted from the exhibition made Munch a notable figure in Berlin, and he decided to stay there.|$|R
50|$|The Brunsvik family {{increased}} {{the pressure to}} terminate the relationship. She could not contemplate marrying Beethoven, a commoner, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> simple <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> would have lost the guardianship of her aristocratic children.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{her adult}} life Rich was {{employed}} as a temporary office worker, which allowed her flexibility to set her own schedule. She gained a teaching certificate in education, but preferred {{to work as a}} substitute teacher or tutor <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason.</b> <b>She</b> continued working with the NAACP, George W.

50|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, {{despite her}} loss, we see that Claire finally gets the STOP sign she asked <b>for</b> (and was <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> decided to run for town council after the council himself {{rejected}} her proposal).

60|$|Being ignorant, however, {{and still}} {{very young and}} untaught of life, {{she could not be}} {{expected}} to take these large views, or to guess at the Hand of Mercy which holds the cup of human woes. She saw her mother fading away because of her father's obstinacy and self-seeking, and it was inconceivable to her that such an unnecessary thing could be allowed by a gentle and loving Providence. Therefore, she turned her back on Providence, as many a strong soul has done before her, rejecting it <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> could not understand.|$|R
60|$|Later on {{the same}} morning, when she woke, the lady took a sudden turn, and got {{seemingly}} a great deal better. I was not let in again to see her, no more was <b>the</b> housemaid, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> {{was not to be}} disturbed by strangers. What I heard of her being better was through my master. He was in wonderful good spirits about the change, and looked in at the kitchen window from the garden, with his great big curly-brimmed white hat on, to go out.|$|R
40|$|Emmy Noether is my {{role model}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>reasons.</b> <b>She</b> {{is one of}} the most important mathematician and physicists of the 20 century; She fought to be a scientist in times where women were not allowed to be one; She was a leader that gathered around her a large school of students and collaborators. In <b>the</b> lecture these <b>reasons</b> will be substantiated with historical facts.

50|$|Eventually Heather {{agreed to}} do the show. She was taught the seven {{mandatory}} poses and told to put a routine together to music. On competition day she was so nervous that she wore shades on stage so she wouldn't see anyone in the crowd and she demanded they dim <b>the</b> house lights <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason.</b> <b>She</b> placed second in the heavyweight class and managed {{to do so without}} lighting a single weight prior to the competition. She turned pro at the 2000 NPC Nationals in New York.|$|R
6000|$|George Laird {{had plenty}} of cool courage, {{invaluable}} in men who have to inflict {{as well as to}} alleviate pain, but he did not like his mission [...] "a little bit" [...] as he would have said; and he proposed a walk because he dreaded a scene. Noel accepted <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason.</b> <b>She</b> liked George, and with the disinterested detachment of a sister-in-law, and the shrewdness of extreme youth, knew him perhaps better than did his wife. She was sure, at all events, of being neither condemned nor sympathised with.|$|R
60|$|She {{was in his}} room; not in her own. I felt, of course, {{that she}} had taken to occupy it, in remembrance of him; and that the many tokens of his old sports and accomplishments, by which she was surrounded, {{remained}} there, {{just as he had}} left them, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason.</b> <b>She</b> murmured, however, even in her reception of me, that she was out of her own chamber because its aspect was unsuited to her infirmity; and with her stately look repelled the least suspicion of the truth.|$|R

6000|$|Her glowing cheeks, {{her pretty}} dress, {{made her a}} shining mark, and the men began at once to improve their {{opportunity}} by asking, [...] "Where's Lize?" [...] And this embarrassed her, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> did not care {{to go into the}} cause of her mother's temporary absence, and, perceiving her confusion, one of them passed to coarse compliment. [...] "There's nothing the matter with you," [...] he said, with a leer. Others, though coarse, were kindly in their familiarity, and Sifton, with gentle face, remained to help her bear the jests of the more uncouth and indelicate of her admirers.|$|R
50|$|Nadine {{is shocked}} to learn that Mio and Arlyn are a couple, and chooses to leave for America. After Arlyn and Mio's wedding plans fall apart, Nadine returns to the Philippines and tries her best to cheer Mio up. They grow closer, but Nadine's ex-boyfriend Harry arrives to take her back. Mio becomes jealous of Nadine's {{closeness}} with Harry. Nadine and Mio grow closer to {{what they used to}} be, but just as he is about to confess his feelings for Nadine Arlyn asks Mio <b>for</b> forgiveness. <b>The</b> <b>reason</b> <b>she</b> did not continue with the wedding was because she was dying and did not want Mio to suffer.|$|R
50|$|Nair's writings, both {{creative}} and critical, are taught on courses at universities such as Chicago, Toronto Kent, Oxford and Washington, and she contends that she writes poetry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same <b>reason</b> that <b>she</b> does research in cognitive linguistics - {{to discover the}} limits of language. Her great ambition is simply to continue to write and research.|$|R

That's how she got to be senator from New York. We keep forgetting it. She didn't win there on her merit." [...] The comments were criticized as unfair by such diverse media figures as Bill O'Reilly, Joy Behar and Gloria Steinem, and led to protests outside NBC's Washington, D.C. studios, {{as well as a}} joint letter of complaint to NBC from <b>the</b> National Organization <b>for</b> Women, Feminist Majority and the National Women's Political Caucus.
