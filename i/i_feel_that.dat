5|$|<b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> {{talking about}} it trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga is the closest thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|I'll be {{offering}} my vision when my campaign begins. And {{it will be}} comprehensive and sweeping. And I {{hope that it will}} be compelling enough to draw people toward it. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> it will be. But it will emerge from my dialogue with the American people. I've traveled to every part of this country during the last six years. During my service in the United States Congress, I took the initiative in creating the Internet. I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth and environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I felt any emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

5|$|As {{you long}} ago wrote me, {{and told me}} personally, nay predicted, Jackson has thrown me overboard; he is not only unwilling to give me employment, as he promised after I {{declined}} a reelection to Congress, but has in every single instance refused office to my friends, and even respectful consideration to my letters of recommendation to others. Nor does he stop here. I am at this moment enduring the whole weight of the opposition to him, his friends, and the power and patronage of his government to break down myself and my friends in Virginia, and to prevent my reelection to the office I now fill. Without having much reputation for political matters, I have read those folks at Washington thoroughly... I am not of a temper to pocket insult, neglect, or injury. I have, my dear friend, determined on my course. I can be as silent and patient as any of my aboriginal ancestors, and like them <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> vengeance would be sweet, but when the day of retribution shall come, it will be marked by {{the effects of the}} tomahawk. You must know that notwithstanding all efforts to prevent it I calculate on a reelection. Then I will begin to formulate a message in which, as you know, my own principles will be maintained.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Admiral Wright is {{extremely}} well qualified {{to perform the}} duties of Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic. Admiral Wright has extensive background and naval command experience in positions of vital importance and he is an officer of outstanding character and ability. Admiral Wright has served as Deputy U.S. Representative to the Standing Group of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is thoroughly cognizant of the duties and responsibilities of SACLANT. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> Admiral Wright will uphold and carry forward the fine traditions and worthy objectives sought by all the NATO nations. I have every confidence that Admiral Wright can make an outstanding contribution to our common defense effort.|$|E
25|$|I {{felt that}} air {{was forced into}} my mouth, I could not speak and I could not close my mouth. I could {{understand}} well everything said to me. Other times <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> there is food in my mouth {{and there is also}} a lot of salivation. I cannot speak.|$|E

25|$|In {{common with}} the great {{majority}} of Americans, you have, no doubt, made up your mind as to what country should be held responsible for this tragedy, but these papers may be found useful for reference, and because they contain the incontrovertible facts, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> you will probably welcome them in this form.|$|E
25|$|Your letters {{give off}} good {{vibrations}} {{of work and}} happiness. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> all our growing pains concerning publicity and personalities of the Wicca, are beginning to bear fruit.

25|$|Your honor, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I {{have been}} convicted of violating an unjust statute. I will {{continue}} in the future, as I have in the past, to oppose this law in any way I can. Any other action would be in violation of my ideal of academic freedom—that is, to teach the truth as guaranteed in our constitution, of personal and religious freedom. I think the fine is unjust.|$|E

25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> {{the energy of}} the city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there. It was great.|$|E
25|$|Crews {{was born}} in {{suburban}} Philadelphia in 1933. Both of his parents were avid readers and were tremendously influential in his life, said Crews; “They had both been raised in considerable poverty, and books had been extremely important to them personally, in shaping them. My mother was very literary; my father was very scientific. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> I got a little something of both sides.” In high school, Crews was co-captain of the tennis team, and for decades he remained an avid skier, hiker, swimmer, and runner. Crews lives in Berkeley with his wife of 57 years, Elizabeth Crews, a photographer who {{was born and raised}} in Berkeley, California. They have two daughters and four grandchildren.|$|E

25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> in some way I did get something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
25|$|Radio 816 / Lisbon 14-Dec.1961: You {{understand}} the bitterness with which I send you this message. It is horrible {{to think that}} this may mean total sacrifice, but I believe that sacrifice is the only way for us to keep up to the highest traditions and provide service {{to the future of the}} Nation. Do not expect the possibility of truce or of Portuguese prisoners, as there will be no surrender rendered because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> our soldiers and sailors can be either victorious or dead. These words could, by their seriousness, be directed only to a soldier of higher duties fully prepared to fulfill them. God will not allow you to be the last Governor of the State of India.|$|E
500|$|They [...] have a {{great deal}} of very precise data on words and the effects {{produced}} by words – a real science of communication.

500|$|In 2014, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe {{asked for}} {{understanding}} of Japanese dolphin hunting {{in a small}} town (Taiji) in western Japan responding to U.S. Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy.

[...] In 1899, members of the Household again insisted that Karim not accompany the royal party when the Queen took her annual holiday at Cimiez. The Queen duly had Karim remain at Windsor, then when the party had settled into the Excelsior Regina hotel, wired Karim to come and join them.|$|E
