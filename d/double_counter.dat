40|$|The {{present study}} {{explored}} {{the effects of}} the <b>double</b> <b>counter</b> twisted tapes on heat transfer and fluid friction characteristics in a heat exchanger tube. The <b>double</b> <b>counter</b> twisted tapes were used as counter-swirl flow generators in the test section. The experiments were performed with <b>double</b> <b>counter</b> twisted tapes of four different twist ratios (y = 1. 95, 3. 85, 5. 92 and 7. 75) using air as the testing fluid in a circular tube turbulent flow regime where the Reynolds number was varied from 6950 to 50, 050. The experimental results demonstrated that the Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement efficiency were increased with decreasing twist ratio. The results also revealed that the heat transfer rate in the tube fitted with <b>double</b> <b>counter</b> twisted tape was significantly increased with corresponding increase in pressure drop. In the range of the present work, heat transfer rate and friction factor were obtained to be around 60 to 240 % and 91 to 286 % higher than those of the plain tube values, respectively. The maximum thermal enhancement efficiency of 1. 34 was achieved by the use of <b>double</b> <b>counter</b> twisted tapes at constant blower power. In addition, the empirical correlations for the Nusselt number, friction factor and thermal enhancement efficiency were also developed, based on the experimental data...|$|E

A potential approach would be to optimise the existing platforms in order to cope with their increasing mission requirements (e. g. mass, volume, etc.). In this article, the idea of combining the energy storage and attitude control systems is presented based on the flywheel technology, (combined energy and attitude control system, CEACS). Such a system consists of a <b>double</b> <b>counter</b> rotating flywheel assembly serving simultaneously for the satellite energy and attitude management. First, numerical treatments are conducted for the CEACS rotor to determine a failure free operational speed corresponding to the rotor stresses and natural frequencies. Then, the mathematical model describing the energy and attitude control is established, and the CEACS onboard architecture is implemented. Further, numerical simulations for the developed architecture are performed for the ideal and non-ideal test cases. This end-to-end system demonstration indicates that the CEACS is judiciously feasible, and is a potential subsystem for the future small satellites...|$|E

Methodology: Steady state 0 - 12 hour pharmacokinetic sampling was performed in new influenza A (H 1 N 1) infected children treated with oseltamivir while on ECMO support. Cmax, Cmin and AUC 0 - 12 hwere calculated. The age-specific oseltamivir dosage was <b>doubled</b> to <b>counter</b> expected decreased plasma drug concentrations due to increased volume of distribution on ECMO support. Principal Findings: Three patients were enrolled aged 15, 6 and 14 years in this pharmacokinetic case series. For two children the OC plasma concentrations were higher than those found in children and adults not on ECMO. These increased plasma concentrations related to the increased oseltamivir dosage and decreased kidney function.
