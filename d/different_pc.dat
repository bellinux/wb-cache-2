25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three <b>different</b> <b>PC</b> keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Effect of {{polycarboxylate}} superplasticizer (<b>PCs)</b> with <b>different</b> {{bond between}} side chain and truck chain on hydration of cement in early period was studied. The performance of PCs in concrete was investigated by setting time, TGA and SEM. PC-based superplasticizer with ester bonding between side chain and truck chain. Although {{they had the}} proximate structure parameters in density of side chain and absorption group (carboxyl groups), the setting time of cement paste was significantly <b>different</b> when <b>different</b> <b>PCs</b> were employed {{in the preparation of}} cement. Decomposing of this bond in alkali environment may lead to a shorter setting time. On the other hand, same difference in hydration production was observed in early period hydration of cement paste when two <b>different</b> <b>PCs</b> was incorporated, which indicated that the different bond structure in PCs affected the hydration of cement in a different manner. The result of SEM indicated that the morphological phase of hydrated product was <b>different</b> when <b>PC</b> was applied, this may be related with the different result in the TG and TGA...|$|R
40|$|Conventional gene {{selection}} methods {{based on}} {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) use only the first principal component (PC) of PCA or sparse PCA to select characteristic genes. These methods indeed assume that the first PC plays a dominant role in gene selection. However, {{in a number of}} cases this assumption is not satisfied, so the conventional PCA-based methods usually provide poor selection results. In order to improve the performance of the PCA-based gene selection method, we put forward the gene selection method via weighting PCs by singular values (WPCS). Because <b>different</b> <b>PCs</b> have <b>different</b> importance, the singular values are exploited as the weights to represent the influence on gene selection of <b>different</b> <b>PCs.</b> The ROC curves and AUC statistics on artificial data show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, experimental results on real gene expression data sets show that our method can extract more characteristic genes in response to abiotic stresses than conventional gene selection methods...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMonochlorobimane {{was used}} as a model {{xenobiotic}} for Arabidopsis to directly monitor the compartmentation of glutathione-bimane conjugates in situ and to quantify degradation intermediates in vitro. Vacuolar sequestration of the conjugate was very fast and outcompeted carboxypeptidation to the γ-glutamylcysteine-bimane intermediate (γ-EC-B) by phytochelatin synthase (PCS) in the cytosol. Following vacuolar sequestration, degradation proceeded to cysteine-bimane without intermediate. Only co-infiltration of monochlorobimane with Cd 2 + and Cu 2 + increased γ-EC-B formation to 4 % and 25 %, respectively, within 60 min. The role of PCS under simultaneous heavy metal stress was confirmed by investigation of <b>different</b> <b>pcs</b> 1 null-mutants. In the absence of elevated heavy metal concentrations glutathione-conjugates are therefore first sequestered to the vacuole and subsequently degraded with the initial breakdown step being rate-limiting...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} popular BBS {{applications}} for the TI-99/4A in the early to mid 1980s was aptly named TIBBS (Texas Instruments Bulletin Board System). TIBBS was purported to be the first BBS written to run on the TI-99/4A microcomputer. Its author, Ralph Fowler of Atlanta, Georgia, began the program because he was told by TI's engineers that the machine was not powerful enough to support a BBS. Approximately 200 copies of the application were officially licensed by Fowler and many TIBBS systems popped up around the World. Operators ranged from teenagers to one sysop in Sacramento, California who was over 70 years old. After Texas Instruments ceased producing the 99/4A, its enthusiasts became even more supportive of each other and TIBBS continued into the late 1980s. Eventually Fowler made the program public domain and moved to a <b>different</b> <b>PC</b> platform.|$|E
