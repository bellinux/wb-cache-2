5|$|Croton oil (tiglium oil) {{is pressed}} from {{the seeds of}} Croton tiglium. Highly toxic, it was {{formerly}} used as a <b>drastic</b> purgative.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the main}} cause of <b>drastic</b> {{reduction}} of the species is likely caused by the Allee effect.|$|E
5|$|Reign in Blood was {{recorded}} and produced in Los Angeles with Rubin. The album was the label boss' first professional experience with heavy metal, and his fresh perspective {{led to a}} <b>drastic</b> makeover of Slayer's sound. Steve Huey of AllMusic believed Rubin drew tighter and faster songs from the band, and delivered a cleanly produced sound that contrasted sharply with their previous recordings. This resulted in <b>drastic</b> changes to Slayer's sound, and changed audiences' perception of the band. Araya has since stated their two previous releases were not up to par production-wise.|$|E
5|$|A. b. lelwel (Heuglin, 1877) : Known as the Lelwel hartebeest. Formerly {{found in}} {{northern}} and northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo; southeastern and southwestern Sudan; and the northwestern extreme of Tanzania. <b>Drastic</b> population decrease since the 1980s has confined most individuals to protected areas {{inside and outside}} its range.|$|E
5|$|Freitas {{considers}} {{that even if}} an extraterrestrial being were to be afforded legal personhood, problems of nationality and immigration would arise. An extraterrestrial being {{would not have a}} legally recognized earthly citizenship, and <b>drastic</b> legal measures might be required in order to account for the technically illegal immigration of extraterrestrial individuals.|$|E
5|$|From March to April 1999, there arose a huge {{groundswell of}} public dissent {{in the media}} over the National Library building's fate, {{as well as the}} <b>drastic</b> {{physical}} alterations of its environs. A number of featured columns by journalists touched on gradually disappearing heritage landmarks, as well as shared memories of Singaporeans.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008, without {{knowledge}} of the township council, New Jersey Transit announced further and <b>drastic</b> service cuts at Great Notch. The only train to serve outbound customers was a train leaving for Hoboken Terminal in the morning, and two trains from Hoboken would serve the station at night.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} 1776, a number of events led to a <b>drastic</b> change in the diet of the American colonists. As {{they could no longer}} depend on British and West Indian imports, {{agricultural}} practices of the colonists began to focus on becoming completely self-sufficient.|$|E
5|$|Manage Lake Okeechobee as an {{ecological}} resource {{to avoid the}} <b>drastic</b> {{rise and fall of}} water levels in the lake that are harmful to aquatic plant and animal life and disturb the lake sediments.|$|E
5|$|The 1857 Mutiny, which quickly led to <b>drastic</b> {{changes in}} the Bengal and Bombay armies, {{had no effect on}} the Madras Army. In 1895, the {{presidency}} armies were finally merged and the Madras regiments came under the direct control of the Commander-in-chief of British India.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} this <b>drastic</b> {{population}} reduction {{are thought to be}} due to agricultural improvements, abandonment of extensive management, and deforestation. As the area of the Gentiana cruciata, the food plant that the P. rebeli depends on, decreases, the P. rebeli population also decreases.|$|E
5|$|According to French Senate's Comité des Prix de Revient des {{fabrications}} d'Armement (CPRA) {{cited by}} the daily La Tribune, {{the total cost of}} the AASM program including development costs and the delivery of 2348 kits is €846m. On that basis the per-weapon cost is $300,000 or twelve times the cost of the comparable American JDAM, although the latter has been manufactured in much larger quantities (~250,000 kits) and would be reasonable to expect a <b>drastic</b> reduction of the price of the French munition if larger contracts are signed and economies of scale are achieved.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a <b>drastic</b> reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|An {{enduring}} theme {{during and}} after the oil boom has been a reluctance among Texans to relinquish their identity and a stubbornness in maintaining their cultural heritage in the face of <b>drastic</b> changes to the state brought by the sudden wealth. Despite its growth and industrialization, Texas culture in the mid-20th century remained distinct from the other industrial centers of the nation.|$|E
5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{sometimes}} made sudden, <b>drastic</b> {{changes to}} the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test. Lalich sees this as {{a way that they}} increased their students' devotion, ensuring that their commitment became irrespective of what they saw. Members became desperate for Applewhite's approval, which he used to control them.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had <b>drastic</b> consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. The negotiators for Armenia were from the ARF.|$|E
5|$|By 2000 the {{percentage}} of nuclear families had decreased by 40%, {{while the number of}} other family types had increased by 51%. The percentage of single households has also steadily increased. In 1970, only 17% of households consisted of singles. In 2000 that figure had increased by 50% with singles constituting 25.5% of households. The most <b>drastic</b> increase was among {{the percentage}} of households made up of single males, which nearly doubled from 5.6% in 1970 to 10.7% in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Climate is {{a measure}} of the {{long-term}} trends in the weather. Various factors are known to influence the climate, including ocean currents, surface albedo, greenhouse gases, variations in the solar luminosity, and changes to the Earth's orbit. Based on historical records, the Earth is known to have undergone <b>drastic</b> climate changes in the past, including ice ages.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other <b>drastic</b> change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E
5|$|For the 2007–08 season, Bayern made <b>drastic</b> squad {{changes to}} help rebuild. They signed {{a total of}} eight new players and sold, {{released}} or loaned out nine of their players. Among new signings were 2006 World Cup stars such as Franck Ribéry, Miroslav Klose and Luca Toni. Bayern {{went on to win}} the Bundesliga, being on top of the standings on every single week of play, and the DFB-Pokal against Borussia Dortmund.|$|E
5|$|Further {{analysis}} shows that several processes were in {{progress in the}} late Cretaceous seas and partially overlapped in time, then ended with the abrupt mass extinction. The diversity of marine life decreased when the climate near the K-T boundary increased in temperature. The temperature increased about three to four degrees very rapidly between 65.4 and 65.2 million years ago, which is {{around the time of}} the extinction event. Not only did the climate temperature increase, but the water temperature decreased causing a <b>drastic</b> decrease in marine diversity.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010s, Russia's economy {{suffered}} from a financial crisis, depressed oil prices, and international sanctions put into place during the Ukrainian crisis. With less disposable income to spend, citizens were forced to take <b>drastic</b> measures. In 2017, for instance, {{approximately half of the}} country's population was growing fruits and vegetables to supplement their diet, caused in part by a doubling in food prices in the preceding two years.|$|E
5|$|Jason Wilkes (portrayed by Reggie Austin) is a {{scientist}} for Isodyne, {{the only company}} willing to hire him as a black man, who informs Carter of the company's Zero Matter discovery. He is rendered invisible and intangible following exposure to the substance, and under its influence he attempts to take <b>drastic</b> steps to gain power. He expresses remorse for his actions after the Zero Matter is eventually purged from his body and he regains tangibility.|$|E
5|$|The Chilean {{government}} delayed their naval plans after {{a financial}} depression {{brought on by}} the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake and a <b>drastic</b> fall in the nitrate market in 1907, but these economic problems were not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina. While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to Peruvian military acquisitions.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor sneaks {{out to get}} the TARDIS but finds Jex's crashed {{ship and}} discovers {{he was one of}} several {{scientists}} that did inhumane experiments to create cyborgs on their war-torn homeworld. The Gunslinger arrives, and confirms the Doctor's theory that he is one of Jex's experiments. He has sought vengeance and killed all but Jex. Though he cannot harm innocents by his programming, the Gunslinger warns that Jex must be brought to him or he will take more <b>drastic</b> measures.|$|E
5|$|The HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} in Malawi {{has been characterized}} by <b>drastic</b> declines {{in the number of}} health workers available to provide treatment and care and increasing strain on health services: {{more than half of all}} hospital admissions in Malawi are related to HIV/AIDS. However, Malawi currently faces a significant deficit in human resources: only 159 doctors were practicing in Malawi in 2007. The World Health Organization's Essential Health Package recommends placing at least three health workers at every health facility in the country, but the vast majority of Malawi's health facilities fail to meet this standard.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet era saw <b>drastic</b> {{industrialization}} and militarization of the peninsula. In 1925–1926, significant deposits of apatite {{were discovered in}} the Khibiny Mountains, and the first apatite batch was shipped {{only a few years}} later, in 1929. In 1930, sulfide deposits were discovered in the Moncha area; in 1932–1933 iron ore deposits were found near the upper streams of the Iona River; and in 1935, significant deposits of titanium ores were discovered in the area of modern Afrikanda.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African {{wild dogs}} and hyenas and predation {{is the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a <b>drastic</b> decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, <b>drastic</b> declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E
5|$|The {{corncrake}} {{can be seen}} at {{the bridge}} of Banagher in the summer. Once a common summer visitor to Ireland, corncrakes have suffered <b>drastic</b> population declines over the last few decades and are threatened with global extinction. Conservation efforts have focused on changing harvesting times to avoid the nesting season, May to August. The hay meadows of the callows support large numbers of these birds – {{one of the few places}} in the world where this globally threatened species is still common.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} scrutiny being {{imposed by}} the FCC regarding local marketing, shared services, and joint sales agreements have led to more <b>drastic</b> measures by broadcasting companies attempting to use them in acquisitions; in 2014, two broadcasting companies declared intents to shut acquired stations down entirely and consolidate their programming onto existing stations through multicasting, rather than attempting to use sidecars and sharing agreements or selling them to other parties that would assume full responsibility of their day-to-day operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{president}} effected <b>drastic</b> cuts to {{the military}} budget, and privatized military factories. Menem appointed Lt. Gen. Martín Balza, who had performed well during the repression of Seineldín's mutiny, as the Army's General Chief of Staff (head of the military hierarchy). The death of a conscript soldier in 1994, victim of abuses by his superiors, led to the abolition of conscription in the country. The following year, Balza voiced the first institutional self-criticism {{of the armed forces}} during the Dirty War, saying that obedience did not justify the actions committed in those years.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} {{and use of}} lithium underwent several <b>drastic</b> changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature lithium greases for aircraft engines and similar applications in World War II and shortly after. This use {{was supported by the}} fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} special {{agents of the}} FBI who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, when rubbings from the spaceship resurface the FBI hides its investigation from the X-Files. Meanwhile, Scully is forced to take <b>drastic</b> measures when she discovers a threat to William.|$|E
5|$|We {{could have}} played on, {{but it was a}} Test match and we just had to win. I {{realised}} something <b>drastic</b> had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball. I complained of the people moving about, the light, and, in fact, anything, {{in an effort to get}} the appeal upheld. Hammond and Yardley were inspecting the wet pitch. I knew there was a chance of losing valuable wickets so I just kept on appealing until the umpires answered me.|$|E
5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, the threat posed by the German nuclear energy project was taken very seriously. Consideration was given to issuing a public warning of the danger of a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood of this to be sufficiently remote that he rejected the notion of taking so <b>drastic</b> a step.|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{recognised}} Indonesia's independence on 27 December1949, {{following a}} several month-long {{conference in the}} Hague, Soegijapranata returned to Semarang. The post-revolution period was marked by a <b>drastic</b> increase in enrolment at the nation's seminary; the 100th native Indonesian clergyman was ordained in 1956. The government, however, enacted several laws that limited the Church's ability to expand. In 1953 the Ministry for Religion decreed that no foreign missionaries would be allowed into the country, and a subsequent law prohibited those already in Indonesia from teaching. In response, Soegijapranata encouraged eligible clergy to apply for Indonesian citizenship, circumventing the new laws.|$|E
