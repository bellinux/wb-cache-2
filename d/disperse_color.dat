50|$|According to Newton, refracted light must appear colored. With the {{achromatic}} refractor, however, {{this is not}} the case. Newtonians {{explain this}} by saying that the achromatic refractor's crown glass and flint glass refract light as a whole with equal intensity but <b>disperse</b> individual <b>colors</b> differently. According to Schopenhauer, achromatism results when refraction occurs in one direction in the concave lens and in another direction in the convex lens. A blue band then overlaps an orange band while a violet edge covers the yellow. The qualitatively divided retina (color) is thus reunited in full activity, resulting in achromatism (the absence of color).|$|R

40|$|In present study, the dyeing {{behaviour}} of unmodified {{and modified}} polyamide 6. 6 fibers of {{different levels of}} fineness was investigated. The color strength of all the dyeings {{as well as their}} color fastness properties were studied. The obtained results revealed that with the use of acid or <b>disperse</b> dyes, <b>color</b> strength of dyeings decreased for microfibers compared to conventional fibers. Thus, the unmodified microfibers appeared to be more accessible to dyes than conventional ones, especially when small dye molecules were used. Both microfibers and conventional polyamide 6. 6 fibers were modified with acrylic acid monomer using the free radical polymerization method. The dyeability of both modified fibers with basic dyes was significantly improved due to the incorporation of carboxylic groups. The consequences were an increase of color strength and an improvement of light fastness properties of basic dyeings by increasing the percent of graftings...|$|R
50|$|This {{paper was}} made by {{dragging}} {{a piece of paper}} through a fermented flour paste mixed with various colors, creating a free and irregular design. A second type was made with a paste prepared from honey locust pods, mixed with croton oil, and thinned with water. Presumably both black and colored inks were employed. Ginger, possibly {{in the form of an}} oil or extract, was used to <b>disperse</b> the <b>colors,</b> or “scatter” them, according to the interpretation given by T.H. Tsien. The colors were said to gather together when a hair-brush was beaten over the design, as dandruff particles was applied to the design by beating a hairbrush over top. The finished designs, which were thought to resemble human figures, clouds, or flying birds, were then transferred to the surface of a sheet of paper. An example of paper decorated with floating ink has never been found in China. Whether or not the above methods employed floating colors remains to be determined (Tsien 94-5).|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransparent WO 3 {{films were}} {{successively}} prepared by sol–gel casting method. Their optical and structural properties were studied at various molecular weight of polyethylene glycol (PEG) containing {{in the film}} as a <b>dispersing</b> agent. The <b>color</b> contrast (ΔC) during film exposed to UV light represents the optical property. The WO 3 film contained PEG (MW 2, 000) exhibited the optimal photochromic performance which ΔC between colored and bleached state was 70. This optical property of WO 3 films is promising higher color contrast {{and it is an}} important candidate for smart window application. Moreover, the structural properties of WO 3 films were analyzed with x-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R
50|$|Certain {{accessories}} for {{a flashlight}} allow {{the color of}} the light to be altered or allow light to be <b>dispersed</b> differently. Translucent <b>colored</b> plastic cones slipped over the lens of a flashlight increase the visibility when looking {{at the side of the}} light. Such marshalling wands are frequently used for directing automobiles or aircraft at night. Colored lenses placed over the end of the flashlight are used for signalling, for example, in railway yards. Colored light is occasionally useful for hunters tracking wounded game after dusk, or for forensic examination of an area. A red filter helps preserve night vision after the flashlight is turned off, and can be useful to observe animals (such as nesting Loggerhead sea turtles) without disturbing them.|$|R
50|$|German-British {{astronomer}} Sir William Herschel {{is credited}} {{with the discovery of}} infrared in 1800. He made an instrument called a spectrometer to measure the magnitude of radiant power at different wavelengths. This instrument was made from three pieces. The first was a prism to catch the sunlight and direct and <b>disperse</b> the <b>colors</b> down onto a table, the second was a small panel of cardboard with a slit wide enough for only a single color to pass through it and finally, three mercury-in-glass thermometers. Through his experiment Herschel found that red light had the highest degree of temperature change in the light spectrum, however, infrared heating was not commonly used until World War II. During World War II infrared heating became more widely used and recognized. The main applications were in the metal finishing fields, particularly in the curing and drying of paints and lacquers on military equipment. Banks of lamp bulbs were used very successfully but by today's standards, the power intensities were very low. The technique offered much faster drying times than the fuel convection ovens of the time. Production bottlenecks were mitigated and military supplies to the armed forces were maintained. After World War II the adoption of infrared heating techniques continued but on a much slower basis. In the mid 1950s the motor vehicle industry began to show interest in the capabilities of infrared for paint curing and a number of production line infrared tunnels came into use.|$|R

The cap cuticle is thin, and can be readily peeled off the surface to {{a distance of about}} halfway towards the cap center.The gills are white to cream colored, and fairly crowded together; they are mostly free from attachment to the stipe. Gills are interconnected at their bases by veins. The stipe is cylindrical, white, and of variable height, up to 8 cm tall and 4 cm wide; it is roughly the same thickness at both the top and the base. The top portion of the stipe may be farinose—covered with a white, mealy powder. It may turn slightly brown with age, or when it is injured or bruised from handling. Like other mushrooms in the Russulales, the flesh is brittle, owing to the sphaerocyst cytoarchitecture—cylindrical cells that contrast with the typical fibrous, filamentous hyphae present in other orders of the basidiomycota.The spores of R. virescens are elliptical or ellipsoid with warts, translucent (hyaline), and produce a white, pale or pale yellow spore print; the spore dimensions are 6-9 by 5-7 µm. A partial reticulum (net-like pattern of ridges) interconnects the warts. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped and have dimensions of 24-33 by 6-7.5 µm; they are colorless, and each hold from two to four spores. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are 40-85 by 6-8 µm and end abruptly in a sharp point.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we revise the {{relationship}} between ages and metallicities of LMC star clusters and their integrated UBV colors. The study stands on the catalog of UBV colors of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) clusters by Bica et al. (1994; BCDSP) and the photometric models of single stellar populations (SSP) calculated by Bertelli et al. (1994). These photometric models nicely describe the color distribution of LMC clusters in the (U – B) vs. (B – V) plane together with the observed dispersion of the colors {{and the existence of}} a gap in a certain region of this diagram. In the case of blue clusters, most of the dispersion in the colors can be accounted for by the presence of stochastic effects on the mass distribution of stars, whereas for the red ones additional dispersion's of ~ 0. 2 dex in metallicity and of ~ 0. 05 mag in color excess are needed. From comparing the observed distribution of integrated colors in the (U – B) vs. (B – V) diagram with the theoretical models, it turns out that: 1) The data are consistent with the presence of a gap (period of quiescence) in the history of cluster formation. If the age-metallicity relation (AMR) for the LMC obeys the simple model of chemical evolution, the gap is well evident and corresponds to the age interval ~ 3 Gyr to (12 - 15) Gyr. On the contrary, if the chemical enrichment has been much slower than in the simple model, so that intermediate age clusters are less metal rich, the gap is expected to occur over a much narrower color range and to be hidden by effects of color dispersion. 2) The bimodal distribution of B – V colors can be reproduced by a sequence of clusters almost evenly distributed in the logarithm of the age, whose metallicity is governed by a normal AMR. No need is found of the so-called phase transitions in the integrated colors of a cluster taking place at suitable ages (Renzini & Buzzoni 1986). 3) The gap noticed by BCDSP in the (U – B) vs. (B – V) plane {{can be explained by the}} particular direction along which cluster <b>colors</b> are <b>dispersed</b> in that part of the (U – B) vs. (B – V) diagram. Also in this case, no sudden changes in the integrated properties of clusters must be invoked. The results of this analysis are used to revise the empirical method proposed by Elson & Fall (1985, EF 85) to attribute ages to LMC clusters according to their integrated UBV colors. We show that the EF 85 method does not provide the correct relation between ages and colors for clusters of low metallicity and hence its inability to date the old clusters. We propose two modifications to the definition of the parameter 8 of EF 85 such that the age sequence of red clusters is suitably described, and the intrinsic errors on ages caused by the heavy presence of various effects <b>dispersing</b> the <b>colors</b> are reduced to a minimum. The age sequence is calibrated on 24 template clusters for which ages were independently derived from recent color-magnitude diagrams (CMD). Finally, we attribute ages to all clusters present in BCDSP catalog, and derive the global age distribution function (ADF) for LMC clusters. The ADF presents new features that were not clear in previous analyses of UBV data, but were already suggested by a number of independent observational studies. The features in question are periods of enhanced cluster formation at ~ 100 Myr and 1 – 2 Gyr, and a gap in the cluster formation history between ~ 3 and (12 – 15) Gyr. The peaks observed in the distribution of B – V colors are found to be sensítíve to the presence of these periods of enhanced cluster formatíon and the lack of extremely red clusters caused by the age gap between íntermediate-age and old clusters...|$|R
