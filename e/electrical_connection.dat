5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, {{the caller is}} connected to the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when the caller dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

25|$|On 19 September 2008, during initial testing, {{a faulty}} <b>{{electric}}al</b> <b>connection</b> {{led to a}} magnet quench (the sudden loss of a superconducting magnet's superconducting ability due to warming or electric field effects). Six tonnes of supercooled liquid helium—used to cool the magnets—escaped, with sufficient force to break 10-ton magnets nearby from their mountings, and caused considerable damage and contamination of the vacuum tube (see 2008 quench incident); repairs and safety checks caused a delay of around 14 months.|$|E
25|$|Magnets {{wobbling}} on a cantilever {{are sensitive}} to even small vibrations and generate microcurrents by moving relative to conductors due to Faraday's law of induction.

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{incident}} CERN reported that the most likely {{cause of the problem}} was a faulty <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> between two magnets, and that– due to the time needed to warm up the affected sectors and then cool them back down to operating temperature– it would take at least two months to fix. CERN released an interim technical report and preliminary analysis of the incident on 15 and 16 October 2008 respectively, and a more detailed report on 5 December 2008. The analysis of the incident by CERN confirmed that an electrical fault had indeed been the cause. The faulty <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> had led (correctly) to a failsafe power abort of the electrical systems powering the superconducting magnets, but had also caused an electric arc (or discharge) which damaged the integrity of the supercooled helium's enclosure and vacuum insulation, causing the coolant's temperature and pressure to rapidly rise beyond the ability of the safety systems to contain it, and leading to a temperature rise of about 100 degrees Celsius in some of the affected magnets. Energy stored in the superconducting magnets and electrical noise induced in other quench detectors also {{played a role in the}} rapid heating. Around two tonnes of liquid helium escaped explosively before detectors triggered an emergency stop, and a further four tonnes leaked at lower pressure in the aftermath. A total of 53 magnets were damaged in the incident and were repaired or replaced during the winter shutdown. This accident was thoroughly discussed in a 22February 2010 Superconductor Science and Technology article by CERN physicist Lucio Rossi.|$|E
25|$|Fluorescent lamps can be {{illuminated}} by means {{other than a}} proper <b>electrical</b> <b>connection.</b> These other methods, however, result in very dim or very short-lived illumination, and so are seen mostly in science demonstrations. Static electricity or a Van de Graaff generator will cause a lamp to flash momentarily as it discharges a high voltage capacitance. A Tesla coil will pass high-frequency current through the tube, and since it has a high voltage as well, the gases within the tube will ionize and emit light. Capacitive coupling with high-voltage power lines can light a lamp continuously at low intensity, depending on {{the intensity of the}} electrostatic field, as shown in the image on the right.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the most}} common and {{effective}} catalyst, platinum, is extremely expensive, alternative processing is necessary to maximize surface area and minimize loading. Deposition of nanosized Pt particles onto carbon powder (Pt/C) provides a large Pt surface area while the carbon allows for <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> between the catalyst {{and the rest of the}} cell. Platinum is so effective because it has high activity and bonds to the hydrogen just strongly enough to facilitate electron transfer but not inhibit the hydrogen from continuing to move around the cell. However, platinum is less active in the cathode oxygen reduction reaction. This necessitates the use of more platinum, increasing the cell’s expense and thus feasibility. Many potential catalyst choices are ruled out because of the extreme acidity of the cell.|$|E
25|$|The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, {{located in}} the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings {{to the rest of}} the ISS. In late 2011 MBSU-1, while still routing power correctly, ceased {{responding}} to commands or sending data confirming its health, and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. In each MBSU, two power channels feed 160V DC from the arrays to two DC-to-DC power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. A spare MBSU was already on board, but 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> was secured. The loss of MBSU-1 limits the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressed.|$|E
25|$|Generally {{the plug}} is the movable {{connector}} attached to an electrically operated device's mains cable, and the socket is fixed on equipment or a building structure {{and connected to}} an energised electrical circuit. The plug has protruding pins or, in US terminology, blades (referred to as male) that fit into matching slots or holes (called female) in the sockets. A plug is defined in IEC 60050 as an accessory having pins designed to engage with the contacts of a socket-outlet, also incorporating means for the <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> and mechanical retention of flexible cables or cords; a plug does not contain components which modify the electrical output from the electrical input (except where a switch and/or fuse is provided {{as a means of}} disconnecting the output from input). There is an erroneous tendency to refer to power conversion devices with incorporated plug pins as plugs, but IEC 60050 refers to these as 'direct plug-in equipment', defined as equipment in which the mains plug forms {{an integral part of the}} equipment enclosure so that the equipment is supported by the mains socket-outlet. In this article, the term 'plug' is used in the sense defined by IEC 60050. Sockets are designed to prevent exposure of bare energised contacts. Sockets may also have protruding exposed contacts, but these are used exclusively for grounding (earthing).|$|E
