40|$|The current {{through the}} L-type calcium channel is {{inhibited}} and stimulated by distinct dihydropyridines {{at very low}} concentrations. The molecular determinants for the high affinity block and stimulation were investigated using chimeras between the class C and E calcium channels. Mutation of three amino acids in the last putative transmembrane segment (IVS 6) of the alpha 1 C subunit decreased the affinity for (+) isradipine 100 -fold without significantly affecting the basic properties of the expressed channel. Mutation of two of these three amino acids completely abolished the stimulatory effect of the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644. These mutations only slightly affected the blocking efficacy of mibefradil and the phenylalkylamine <b>devapamil.</b> Three distinct but adjacently located amino acids mediated the high affinity block by <b>devapamil.</b> These {{results suggest that the}} IVS 6 segment of the alpha 1 C subunit is critical for the high affinity interaction between the L-type calcium channel and the calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644 and the two antagonists isradipine and <b>devapamil...</b>|$|E
40|$|Phenylalkylamines (PAAs), a major {{class of}} L-type calcium channel (LTCC) blockers, have two {{aromatic}} rings {{connected by a}} flexible chain with a nitrile substituent. Structural aspects of ligand-channel interactions remain unclear. We have built a KvAP-based model of LTCC and used Monte Carlo energy minimizations to dock <b>devapamil,</b> verapamil, gallopamil, and other PAAs. The PAA-LTCC models have the following common features: (i) the meta-methoxy group in ring A, which is proximal to the nitrile group, accepts an H-bond from a PAA-sensing Tyr_IIIS 6; (ii) the meta-methoxy group in ring B accepts an H-bond from a PAA-sensing Tyr_IVS 6; (iii) the ammonium group is stabilized at the focus of P-helices; and (iv) the nitrile group binds to a Ca 2 + ion coordinated by the selectivity filter glutamates in repeats III and IV. The latter feature can explain Ca 2 + potentiation of PAA action {{and the presence of}} an electronegative atom at a similar position of potent PAA analogs. Tyr substitution of a Thr in IIIS 5 is known to enhance action of <b>devapamil</b> and verapamil. Our models predict that the para-methoxy group in ring A of <b>devapamil</b> and verapamil accepts an H-bond from this engineered Tyr. The model explains structure-activity relationships of PAAs, effects of LTCC mutations on PAA potency, data on PAA access to LTCC, and Ca 2 + potentiation of PAA action. Common and class-specific aspects of action of PAAs, dihydropyridines, and benzothiazepines are discussed in view of the repeat interface concept...|$|E
40|$|The pore-forming alpha 1 subunit of L-type calcium (Ca 2 +) {{channels}} is {{the molecular}} target of Ca 2 + channel blockers such as phenylalkylamines (PAAs). Association and dissociation rates of (-) <b>devapamil</b> were compared for a highly PAA-sensitive L-type Ca 2 + channel chimera (Lh) and various class A Ca 2 + channel mutants. These mutants carry the high-affinity determinants of the PAA receptor site {{in a class}} A sequence environment. Apparent drug association and dissociation rate constants were significantly affected by the sequence environment (class A or L-type) of the PAA receptor site. Single point mutations affecting the high-affinity determinants in segments IVS 6 of the PAA receptor site, introduced into a class A environment, reduced the apparent drug association rates. Mutation I 1811 M in transmembrane segment IVS 6 (mutant AL 25 /-I) had the highest impact and decreased the apparent association rate for (-) <b>devapamil</b> by approximately 30 -fold, suggesting that this pore-lining isoleucine in transmembrane segment IVS 6 {{plays a key role}} in the formation of the PAA receptor site. In contrast, apparent drug dissociation rates of Ca 2 + channels in the resting state were almost unaffected by point mutations of the PAA receptor site...|$|E
40|$|Inhibitory {{effect of}} calcium channel {{blockers}} on human mesangial cell growth: Evidence for actions independent of L-type Ca 2 + channels. Calcium channel blockers (CCB) {{are known to}} affect the outcome of glomerulosclerosis in vivo and to suppress mesangial cell proliferation and cytokine production in vitro. It is uncertain, however, whether (i) human adult mesangial cells (HMC) express L-type Ca 2 + channels and (ii) whether the effect of CCB on HMC is mediated by inhibition of L-type Ca 2 + channels. In single cell preparations of HMC, the L-type Ca 2 + channel agonist Bay K 8644 and K+-depolarization of the cell membrane caused a transient increase of cytosolic free Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) in 60 to 80 % of the cells. The CCB verapamil and nifedipine partially inhibited the effect of Bay K 8644 and K+-depolarization on [Ca 2 +]i. Binding experiments confirmed these functional studies by showing specific binding at the phenylalkylamine binding site of L-type Ca 2 + channels. Quiescent HMC were stimulated with fetal calf serum (FCS) or growth factors (platelet derived growth factor A/B, epidermal growth factor, angiotensin II, endothelin 1) {{in the presence of}} various concentrations (10 − 10 to 10 − 5 M) of different CCB: either (R) -verapamil, (S) -verapamil or the raceme of verapamil, and nifedipine or diltiazem, respectively. In addition the enantiomers of <b>devapamil</b> were studied, because their action on the L-type Ca 2 + channel is more stereoselective than that of the enantiomers of verapamil. At high concentrations (10 − 6 to 10 − 5 M) (R,S) -verapamil decreased cell numbers in cultures of quiescent HMC, increased LDH in the supernatant, and caused loss of trypan blue exclusion (cytotoxicity). At lower concentrations (R,S) -verapamil showed no cytotoxicity, but had two effects: (1.) concentration dependent (down to 10 − 8 M) inhibition of indices of cell proliferation, that is, (i) stimulated (FCS or growth factor) 3 H-thymidine incorporation and (ii) increment in cell number; and (2.) inhibition of indices of cell or matrix protein synthesis, that is, (i) stimulated 3 H-methionine incorporation and (ii) 3 H-proline incorporation. At equimolar concentrations the dihydropyridine nifedipine was equipotent with verapamil, whereas the benzodiazepine diltiazem was conspicously less effective. Even at the lowest effective concentration (10 − 8 M) comparison of (R) - and (S) -verapamil showed {{no significant difference between the}} enantiomer with weak or with strong effect on L-type Ca 2 + channels, and this was true even when the more stereoselective enantiomers of <b>devapamil</b> were tested. These observations argue against the notion that effects of CCB result from specific interaction with L-type Ca 2 + channels. The data are more consistent with the idea that interactions with targets other than L-type Ca 2 + channels are involved...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 + {{channels}} play crucial {{roles in}} cellular signal transduction and are important targets of pharmacological agents. They are {{also associated with}} auxiliary subunits exhibiting functions that are still incompletely resolved. Skeletal muscle L-type Ca 2 + channels (dihydropyridine receptors, DHPRs) are specialized for the remote voltage control of type 1 ryanodine receptors (RyR 1) to release stored Ca 2 +. The skeletal muscle-specific γ subunit of the DHPR (γ 1) down-modulates availability by altering its steady state voltage dependence. The effect resembles the action of certain Ca 2 + antagonistic drugs that are thought to stabilize inactivated states of the DHPR. In the present study we investigated the cross influence of γ 1 and Ca 2 + antagonists by using wild-type (γ+/+) and γ 1 knockout (γ−/−) mice. We studied voltage-dependent gating of both L-type Ca 2 + current and Ca 2 + release and the allosteric modulation of drug binding. We found that 10 μM diltiazem, a benzothiazepine drug, more than compensated for the reduction in high-affinity binding of the dihydropyridine agent isradipine caused by γ 1 elimination; 5 μM <b>devapamil</b> [(−) D 888], a phenylalkylamine Ca 2 + antagonist, approximately reversed the right-shifted voltage dependence of availability and the accelerated recovery kinetics of Ca 2 + current and Ca 2 + release. Moreover, the presence of γ 1 altered the effect of D 888 on availability and strongly enhanced its impact on recovery kinetics demonstrating that γ 1 and the drug do not act independently of each other. We propose that the γ 1 subunit of the DHPR functions as an endogenous Ca 2 + antagonist whose task may be to minimize Ca 2 + entry and Ca 2 + release under stress-induced conditions favoring plasmalemma depolarization...|$|E
