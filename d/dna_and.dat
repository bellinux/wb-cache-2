5|$|All cells, {{and many}} viruses, produce {{proteins}} that are enzymes called DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase which make new copies of <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> RNA. A virus's polymerase enzymes are often {{much more efficient}} at making <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> RNA than the host cell's. However, RNA polymerase enzymes often make mistakes, {{and this is one}} of the reasons why RNA viruses often mutate to form new strains.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence.

5|$|Cancer is {{a change}} in the {{cellular}} processes that cause a tumour to grow out of control. Cancerous cells sometimes have mutations in oncogenes, such as KRAS and CTNNB1 (β-catenin). Analysing the molecular signature of cancerous cellsthe <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> its levels of expression via messenger RNAenables physicians to characterise the cancer and to choose the best therapy for their patients. As of 2010, assays that incorporate an array of antibodies against specific protein marker molecules are an emerging technology; there are hopes for these multiplex assays that could measure many markers at once. Other potential future biomarkers include micro RNA molecules, which cancerous cells express more of than healthy ones.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is found}} as linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. A chromosome is an organized structure consisting of <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> histones. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} and any other hereditary information found in the mitochondria, chloroplasts, or other locations is collectively known as a cell's genome. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is localized in the cell nucleus, or with small amounts in mitochondria and chloroplasts. In prokaryotes, the DNA is held within an irregularly shaped body in the cytoplasm called the nucleoid. The genetic information in a genome is held within genes, and the complete assemblage of this information in an organism is called its genotype.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{sequence}} specific recognitions between <b>DNAs</b> <b>and</b> proteins play {{important roles}} in many biological functions. The use of double-stranded DNA arrays (ds-DNA arrays) for studying sequence specific recognition between <b>DNAs</b> <b>and</b> proteins is a promising method. Here we report {{the use of a}} ds-DNA probe with multi operation sites of restriction proteins in the middle sequence to investigate DNA-protein sequence-specific interactions including methylation. We arranged EcoR I site and Rsa I site on the same duplex DNA probe to fabricate ds-DNA arrays. We used the ds-DNA arrays to study DNA-restriction enzyme reactions before <b>and</b> after duplex <b>DNA</b> methylation under different probe concentration and reaction time conditions. Our results indicated that the ds-DNA arrays can be further biochemically modified and made accessible for interactions between <b>DNAs</b> <b>and</b> proteins in complex multi-step gene-regulation processes...|$|R

5|$|DNA {{nanotechnology}} {{uses the}} unique molecular recognition properties of <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> other nucleic acids to create self-assembling branched DNA complexes with useful properties. DNA is thus {{used as a}} structural material {{rather than as a}} carrier of biological information. This has {{led to the creation of}} two-dimensional periodic lattices (both tile-based and using the DNA origami method) and three-dimensional structures in the shapes of polyhedra. Nanomechanical devices and algorithmic self-assembly have also been demonstrated, and these DNA structures have been used to template the arrangement of other molecules such as gold nanoparticles and streptavidin proteins.|$|E
5|$|DNA usually {{occurs as}} linear {{chromosomes}} in eukaryotes, and circular chromosomes in prokaryotes. The set of chromosomes {{in a cell}} makes up its genome; the human genome has approximately 3 billion base pairs of DNA arranged into 46 chromosomes. The information carried by DNA is held in the sequence of pieces of DNA called genes. Transmission of genetic information in genes is achieved via complementary base pairing. For example, in transcription, when a cell uses the information in a gene, the DNA sequence is copied into a complementary RNA sequence through the attraction between the <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> the correct RNA nucleotides. Usually, this RNA copy is then {{used to make a}} matching protein sequence in a process called translation, which depends on the same interaction between RNA nucleotides. In alternative fashion, a cell may simply copy its genetic information in a process called DNA replication. The details of these functions are covered in other articles; here {{the focus is on the}} interactions between <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> other molecules that mediate the function of the genome.|$|E
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's <b>DNA</b> <b>and</b> RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses with larger genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY—DNA {{polymerase}} activity <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis in 4 outgrowth {{lines of}} preneoplastic nodules (HAN) of BALBIc and C 3 H mouse mammary gland were determined. The rate of 3 H-thymidine triphosphate (1 - 1 -dTTP) incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble material in vitro {{was used as}} a measure of DNA polymerase (DNA nucleotidyl transferase) activity in the postmicrosomal supernatant fraction of the HAN tissues. Incorporation of 1 - 1 -thymidine into DNA after a single intraperitoneal injection of the DNA pre-cursor {{was used as a}} measure of DNA synthesis in the HAN cells in vivo. Both <b>DNA</b> polymerase <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis in MTV-free and MTV-positive D 1 nodule outgrowths of BALB/c mice were low. A relatively higher <b>DNA</b> polymerase activity <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis were observed in the high tumor-producing, MTV-free D 8 nodule of BALB/c mice. The highest level of <b>DNA</b> polymerase activity <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis was in the high tumor-producing, MTV-positive CH 33 nodule outgrowth line of C 3 H mice. Unlike the normal mouse mammary cells, both <b>DNA</b> polymerase activity <b>and</b> <b>DNA</b> synthesis in the preneoplastic lesions were independent of the ovarian hormones.
