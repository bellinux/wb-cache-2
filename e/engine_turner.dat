50|$|Turner then invited Ken Kohrs, {{vice-president}} of development, to visit Ford’s longtime partner, the automotive company Cosworth, {{where they were}} presented a project developed on Cosworth’s own initiative, the YAA engine. This was a twin cam, 16-valve engine based on Ford’s own T88 engine block, {{better known as the}} Pinto. This prototype proved an almost ideal basis for the <b>engine</b> <b>Turner</b> needed to power his Group A winner.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after being}} {{appointed}} Managing Director (Chief Executive) of BSA's Automotive Division in 1956, Edward Turner {{was asked to}} design a saloon car powered by a V8 <b>engine.</b> <b>Turner</b> and his design engineer Jack Wickes began considering the initial concept of their new engine by examining the manual and spare parts list of a Cadillac V8 engine.Using a pushrod overhead valve system kept down design, development and production costs and allowed Turner to base {{the design of the}} cylinder head on those he developed for Triumph motorcycles including the use of hemispherical combustion chambers. Adapting the Triumph head design for use in a saloon car engine required much work in reducing friction and improving timing.Much of the development of the prototype engine was carried out by Dr. J. N. H. Tait. Tait had been involved with Donald Healey in the early post war years, working successfully on modified Riley 2½-litre Big Four engines, the final incarnation of which was used in 1953 Zethrin Rennsport prototype, delivering close to 200 bhp with surprising tractability.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, an {{official}} {{request for a}} turbocharged version (designated Cosworth YBB) capable of 180 HP {{on the street and}} 300 HP in race trim, was placed. Cosworth answered positively, but they put up two conditions: the engine would produce not less than 150 kW (204 HP) in the street version, and Ford had to accept no fewer than 15,000 <b>engines.</b> <b>Turner’s</b> project would only need about 5,000 engines, but Ford nevertheless accepted the conditions. The extra 10,000 engines would later become one of the reasons Ford also chose to develop a four door, second generation Sierra RS Cosworth.|$|R
50|$|In {{conducting}} {{experiments with}} a single bank of Edward <b>Turner's</b> square four <b>engine</b> design, <b>Turner</b> and his supervisor, Ariel chief engineer Val Page both saw potential in the straight-twin as a motorcycle engine. From the experiments, it was shown that a 360° crank angle was better suited {{to the use of}} a single carburettor than a 180° crank angle.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Turner's</b> <b>engine</b> {{produced}} a conservative [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] of torque at 3,200 rpm. By comparison a Jaguar Mark X also claimed 220hp but used a different scale of measurement.|$|R
25|$|Another work, Jim Beam - J.B. <b>Turner</b> <b>Engine</b> (1986) {{is based}} on a commemorative, {{collectible}} in bottle {{in the form of a}} locomotive that was created by Jim Beam; however, Koons appropriated this model and had it cast in gleaming stainless-steel. The train model cast in steel titled Jim Beam - Baggage Car (1986) even contains Jim Beam bourbon.|$|R
50|$|In {{efforts to}} keep up with the growth of NASCAR, the Wood Brothers {{continued}} to add more employees, and assigned some personnel as shop employees and others as race-day crew members. The additions of team members like Bennie Belcher, Butch Mitchell, and outside <b>engine</b> builder Tommy <b>Turner</b> were bringing the team online with others in NASCAR.|$|R
50|$|Sangster seized another {{business}} opportunity in 1936 {{when he bought}} the financially struggling Triumph Cycles company, naming the new business Triumph Engineering Co. He brought-in Edward Turner from Ariel to improve Triumph's product range. The Triumph Speed Twin with a parallel-twin <b>engine</b> designed by <b>Turner</b> was introduced in 1938, being {{the basis of a}} line of successful Triumph motorcycles until the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|In July 1937, Turner {{introduced}} the 500 cc Speed Twin, selling at £75. It was smaller and weighed five pounds {{less than the}} £70 Tiger 90, and proved very successful. The 5T Speed Twin (some say based on the <b>engine</b> design of <b>Turner's</b> Riley Nine car) became the standard by which other twins were judged, and its descendants continued in production until the 1980s. The original 27 bhp parallel-twin was capable of exceeding 90 mph (145 km/h) and weighed 361 lb (166 kg).|$|R
50|$|For much of 1935, Turner publicized many {{products}} and causes, including Boeing Model 80, United Airlines, Heinz foods, Camel cigarettes, Motor Glide scooters, Macmillan Oil, and the National Safety Council. He entered the Bendix Trophy race with his Model 44 (NR61Y, race number 57). On August 31, 1935, after flying from Burbank to Cleveland, he finished just 23.5 {{seconds after the}} winner Ben Howard in his Howard DGA-6 named Mr Mulligan. On September 2, 1935, in the Thompson Trophy race, his Model 44 suffered <b>engine</b> failure, but <b>Turner</b> made a safe dead-stick landing.|$|R
50|$|For 1914 a {{completely}} new and more coventional light car was shown at the 1913 London Motor Show with a four-cylinder 1130 cc <b>engine</b> made by <b>Turner</b> but this was soon replaced by a 1286 cc water cooled side valve engine made by themselves. The engine was designed by W L Adams of the Laxtonia Engineering Works of Peterborough who also designed a World War I aero engine. The car had semi elliptic leraf springs, rear wheel only brakes and a wheelbase of 7 feet 9 inches (2362mm) and a track of 3 feet 9 inches (1143mm). Drive was to the rear axle through a cone clutch, separate three speed gearbox and torque tube.|$|R
50|$|Herb Thomas {{started on}} the pole for the 1953 Wilkes 200 with his record-setting {{qualifying}} speed of 78.424 mph on the dirt surface. Outside pole sitter Tim Flock led the first 100 laps before experiencing <b>engine</b> problems. Curtis <b>Turner</b> took the lead on Lap 101 and continued the lead until his car also succumbed to engine troubles nine laps later. Thomas in his Number 92 Hudson Hornet only lead 18 laps in the race but ended the race by taking his third consecutive win at North Wilkesboro. Starting from the third spot, Dick Rathmann led 70 laps and finished behind Herb Thomas. Fonty Flock managed to work his way up from the fourth starting position {{to the front and}} led three laps before dropping back and finishing third.|$|R
2500|$|On February 2, 2007, Michael Govan, with Koons, {{revealed}} {{plans for}} a -tall Koons sculpture featuring an operational 1940s locomotive suspended from a crane. The sculpture would be located at the entrance on Wilshire Boulevard, between the Ahmanson Building and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. By 2011, after [...] "the fundraising climate soured and Koons’ California fabricator, Carlson & Co, {{went out of business}} after completing a $2.3-million feasibility study" [...] and a $25 million estimated cost, Govan said [...] "We don't have a final method of construction, and I don't have a final fundraising plan." [...] Koons said they are now working with the German fabricator Arnold, outside of Frankfurt, to do an additional engineering study, and Govan says he has committed to spending half a million dollars for that study. The museum has J.B. <b>Turner</b> <b>Engine</b> [...] (1986), a small Koons piece which was shown in the 2006–2007 “Magritte and Contemporary Art: The Treachery of Images" [...] exhibition.|$|R
5000|$|First {{shown in}} Koons' eponymous {{exhibitions}} at the short-lived International With Monument Gallery, New York, and at Daniel Weinberg Gallery, Los Angeles, in 1986, the Luxury and Degradation series {{is a group}} of works thematically centered on alcohol. This group included a stainless steel travel cocktail cabinet, a Baccarat crystal decanter and other hand-made renderings of alcohol-related paraphernalia, as well as reprinted and framed ads for drinks such as Gordon's Gin ("I Could Go for Something Gordon's"), Hennessy ("Hennessy, The Civilized Way to Lay Down the Law"), Bacardi ("Aquí... el gran sabor del ron Bacardi"), Dewars ("The Empire State of Scotch"), Martell ("I Assume You Drink Martell") and Frangelico ("Stay in Tonight" [...] and [...] "Find a Quiet Table") in seductively intensified colors on canvas [...] Koons appropriated these advertisements and revalued them by recontextualizing them into artworks. They [...] "deliver a critique of traditional advertising that supports Baudrillard's censorious view of the obscene promiscuity of consumer signs".Another work, Jim Beam - J.B. <b>Turner</b> <b>Engine</b> (1986) is based on a commemorative, collectible in bottle {{in the form of a}} locomotive that was created by Jim Beam; however, Koons appropriated this model and had it cast in gleaming stainless-steel. The train model cast in steel titled Jim Beam - Baggage Car (1986) even contains Jim Beam bourbon.With the Luxury and Degradation series Koons interfered into the realms of the social. He created an artificial and gleaming surface which represented a proletarian luxury. It was interpreted as seduction by simulation because it was faked luxury. Being the producer of this deception brought him to a kind of leadership, as he commented himself.|$|R
