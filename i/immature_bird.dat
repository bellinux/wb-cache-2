5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon in some respects, it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an <b>immature</b> <b>bird,</b> as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E
25|$|Room 1, a 5m square {{room was}} also excavated. The upper levels {{revealed}} ceramic sherds, cloth fragments, and domestic refuse suggesting a mixed use during occupation. A small central hearth was found beneath. One {{of the rooms}} had two short pillars or columns conjoined to opposite walls. A skeleton of an <b>immature</b> <b>bird,</b> small fish vertebrae, and crab were found as well. A large quantity of bird guano, avian skeletal material, and feathers {{were found in the}} lower layers but no associated remains of nesting boxes or other structures indicating aviculture. However, the abundance does indicate that birds were important at this site in either a ritual, production or consumption context. Other artifacts found in this room also included cotton, wool, needles and nine adobe bricks. The mix of artifact types suggests multiple activity patterns.|$|E
500|$|The {{back and}} the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate grey with indistinct darker barring (see [...] "Subspecies" [...] below); the wingtips are black. The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. The tail, {{coloured}} like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end. The {{top of the head}} and a [...] "moustache" [...] along the cheeks are black, contrasting sharply with the pale sides of the neck and white throat. The cere is yellow, as are the feet, and the beak and claws are black. The upper beak is notched near the tip, an adaptation which enables falcons to kill prey by severing the spinal column at the neck. The <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> is much browner with streaked, rather than barred, underparts, and has a pale bluish cere and orbital ring.|$|E

50|$|The female {{lacks the}} purple and {{glittering}} green colours on the head, and the <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> has rufous fringes to its upperpart plumage and a dusky throat.|$|E
50|$|Small nestlings are pale grey with buffy {{down on the}} neck, and a black crown. At {{fledging}} age, the <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> {{is identical}} to the adult except for a feathered forehead, much lesser iridescence on feathers, and much longer and fluffier feathers on the neck.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are similar, but <b>immature</b> <b>birds</b> have uniform pale brown upperparts, {{lack the}} dark head and have white to pale buff underparts.|$|R
50|$|Both {{species have}} white-cheeked black heads and thick bills. The sexes are similar, but <b>immature</b> <b>birds</b> have brown upperparts and paler brown underparts and cheeks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> have light-tipped remiges (pinions), {{hardly any}} blue on the neck, and lack the naked crown stripe. Hatchlings have black skin and grey down.|$|R
50|$|The inland {{dotterel}} was first documented in 1840 after Captain Charles Sturt collected an <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> {{on one of}} his expeditions to the Australian interior and sent it to John Gould. Gould initially named it Eudromias australis (from the Greek eu, good, and dromos, runner, and australis, of the southern continent).|$|E
50|$|The female {{is similar}} to the male, but has a smaller throat patch. <b>Immature</b> <b>bird</b> have rufous fringes to the upperpart plumage, and little or no violet behind the eyes. The song is a {{vigorous}} repetition of the chit call, and is delivered by up to several dozen breeding males in loose leks.|$|E
50|$|The sexes are similar, but {{the male}} is {{slightly}} larger. Most males, but only 10% of females, have a hooked upper mandible. The <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> has brown upperparts {{and a dark}} grey head and underparts. Its bill is greenish yellow, and its feet and legs are dull red. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.|$|E
50|$|The female is duller {{than the}} male, and <b>immature</b> <b>birds</b> are greyish-brown, very dull, with pale barring. The species' call {{is a deep}} soft oo-ah-oo.|$|R
50|$|<b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> are paler grey {{with only}} the throat white, and often have a reddish colour on the underparts. Chicks are {{typically}} covered with grey down.|$|R
50|$|Chicks have {{dark brown}} down, with pied morph having patches of paler down. <b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> are a dull blackish brown, with pied morph birds having paler underparts.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} found in Mexico, in {{mountains}} 1800 - 3500 m above sea level. Its habitat is mostly ravines of pine and pine-oak forests. The Aztec thrush is a vagrant in western Texas and southeastern Arizona. The first record in the United States was an <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> observed in 1977 in Big Bend National Park, Texas.|$|E
50|$|Immature birds stay on {{the edges}} of the colony. They may even make a nest but they will not breed until they are four or five years old. Some birds of this age will occupy empty nests that they will aggressively defend if they have sat on them for two or three days. If an {{apparently}} empty nest has an owner the <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> will abandon it without putting up a struggle when the owner arrives to claim the nest.|$|E
50|$|This eagle is {{a fairly}} large species, though mid-sized {{as a member of}} the Aquila genus. It is mainly dark brown to black, with paler undersides to its flight {{feathers}} and a rounded tail. Its body length is 74 - 86 cm with a wingspan of between 1.65 and 1.9 m. One <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> reportedly weighed 3.06 kg. Females are larger than males. Its wings are held level when gliding. It feeds on mammals (such as cuscuses), reptiles, fish, and birds.|$|E
50|$|<b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> are grey {{instead of}} black and have a {{markedly}} sandy hue on the wings, with light feather fringes appearing as a whitish line in flight.|$|R
50|$|The sexes {{are alike}} in color, but the female is larger. <b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> have pale edges on the upperwing coverts and some brownish-grey {{feathers}} on the back.|$|R
50|$|Both sexes are similar. <b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> have brown upperparts {{and pale}} brown underparts, and a plain head. Very young birds {{have a black}} beak with a pink base.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} male is 31 - 36 cm long, and the nonbreeding {{male and}} the female are 14 - 15 cm long. Females have been measured to weigh approximately 19.5 g. The breeding male has long tail feathers with rounded tips. It has a chestnut-orange patch on its nape. The nonbreeding male's underparts are buffy, and its upperparts are grey-brown, with streaks. There are black and white stripes on its head. The female {{is similar to the}} nonbreeding male. The <b>immature</b> <b>bird</b> resembles the female, but some of its feathers have buffy edges, and its patterns are less distinct.|$|E

50|$|Males {{and females}} look alike. <b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> {{do not have}} a {{distinct}} plumage, while the nestlings are covered with down feathers, grey above and whitish on the belly.|$|R
50|$|The female is similar, but has an {{all black}} beak and less {{green on the}} face than the male. <b>Immature</b> <b>birds</b> are mainly green, with an orange bill.|$|R
50|$|Sexes are similar, but <b>immature</b> <b>birds</b> have white-streaked grey upperparts and dark-streaked whitish underparts. They {{lack the}} rufous wing patch. The call of plumbeous kite is a whistled si-see-oo.|$|R
