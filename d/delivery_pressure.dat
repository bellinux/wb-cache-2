25|$|Gas {{flow rates}} are usually {{controlled}} by an industrial gas regulator on the cylinder, {{and may be}} measured by an industrial flow meter. Measurement of flow rate can be a substitute for analysis of the mixed gas, but is generally less accurate in predicting the delivered mixture due to variations in temperature and gas delivery efficiency of the compressor, which may vary as the <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> changes.|$|E
25|$|Free flow helmets {{generally}} {{require a}} considerably higher compressor delivery than demand helmets, as the flow is continuous, and should never drop below peak inhalation {{rate of the}} diver. Flow rates up to 1500 litres per minute surface equivalent are quoted for the Divex AH-5 helmet at 50 metres sea water for heavy work. <b>Delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> at the AH-5 helmet is recommended at 3.5 bar above ambient.|$|E
25|$|In a {{multi-stage}} compressor, at {{the high}} pressure stages, axial velocity is very small. Stalling value decreases with a small deviation from the design point causing stall near the hub and tip regions whose size increases with decreasing flow rates. They grow larger at very low flow rate and affect the entire blade height. <b>Delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> significantly drops with large stalling {{which can lead to}} flow reversal. The stage efficiency drops with higher losses.|$|E

25|$|The supply {{pressure}} {{must be in}} excess of minimum functional pressure for the regulator {{to be enough to}} get air to the diver. In practice a <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> of about 20 bar is commonly used. The manufacturer of the helmet or full-face mask will specify a pressure range which will deliver sufficient air for a given dive depth, which is usually from 6 to 10 bar more than the ambient pressure due to depth.|$|E
25|$|A {{pressure}} reduction regulator {{is used to}} control the <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> of the gas supplied to a free-flow helmet, in which the flow is continuous, to maintain the downstream pressure which {{is provided by the}} ambient pressure of the exhaust and the flow resistance of the delivery system - mainly the umbilical - and not influenced by the breathing of the diver. Gas reclaim systems use a third kind of regulator to control the flow of exhaled gas to the return hose. Rebreather systems may also use regulators to control the flow of fresh gas, and demand valves, known as automatic diluent valves, to maintain the volume in the breathing loop during descent.|$|E

Death, disability, or injury of a family wage earner due to road traffic injury, in addition to causing emotional pain and suffering, creates economic hardship for the injured worker and family members that may persist well beyond the event itself.|$|R
50|$|Good {{resistance}} against corrosion by acids and oxygen makes Monel a good {{material for the}} chemical industry. Even corrosive fluorides can be handled within Monel apparatus; this was done in an extensive way in the enrichment of uranium in the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Here most of the larger diameter tubing for the uranium hexafluoride was made from Monel. Regulators for reactive cylinder gases like hydrogen chloride form another example, where PTFE is not a suitable option when high <b>delivery</b> <b>pressures</b> are required. These will sometimes include a Monel manifold and taps prior to the regulator that allow the regulator to be flushed with a dry, inert gas after use to further protect the equipment.|$|R
25|$|The {{benefit of}} such a system is that the helium <b>delivery</b> tank <b>{{pressure}}</b> need not {{be as high as}} that used in the partial pressure method of blending and residual gas can be 'topped up' to best mix after the dive.

50|$|A low {{pressure}} diving air compressor usually has a <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> {{of up to}} 30 bar, which is regulated to suit {{the depth of the}} dive.A high pressure diving compressor has a <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> which is usually over 150 bar, and is commonly between 200 and 300 bar. The pressure is limited by an overpressure valve which may be adjustable.|$|E
50|$|Low {{pressure}} diving compressors {{are usually}} single stage compressors as the <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> is relatively low.|$|E
50|$|In the {{compressor}} at high pressure stages if there occurs a deviation from design point (at which compressor {{is designed to}} operate) the angle of attack exceeds its stalling value and stall cells (which are the regions where fluid starts to whirl at a particular location and doesn't move forward) to form at hub and tip of the blade. The size of these cells increases with decreasing flow rate. If the flow rate is further reduced these cells grow larger and it affects the whole blade height and this causes significant drop in the <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure</b> and at very low flow rate, flow reversal takes place which is known as surge. It also results in drop in stage efficiency of {{the compressor}} and its <b>delivery</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|E
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the effects of piston-excited pressure waves in the plain induction pipe of a small, high-speed, single-cylinder air compressor. For a range of pipe lengths and diameters, compressor speeds and <b>delivery</b> <b>pressures,</b> the observed compressor throughput and driving torque are compared with those obtained with no intake pipe fitted. Based on classical laws of wave motion but using an experimentally obtained steady-flow characteristic for the inlet valve, a theoretical treatment is developed to describe the pressure pulsations in the inlet port and cylinder and to predict the change in airflow resulting from the fitting of any particular intake pipe. Experimentally recorded indicator diagrams compare satisfactorily with those predicted theoretically and similar agreement is obtained between the experimental and theoretical values of airflow. An 18 per cent increase in airflow is reported...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOxygen (O 2) {{production}} {{is a major}} part of the energy consumption and capital cost of power stations and industrial processes using oxy-combustion and pre-combustion gasification of fossil fuels with carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture.

O 2 is currently produced by cryogenic distillation of air in efficient optimized plants. A new process for O 2 production under development uses a mixed metal oxide ceramic membrane (ITM or OTM) operating at temperatures above 700 oC integrated with a high temperature and pressure air source such as a gas turbine. Reducing conditions on the permeate side of the membrane allow the production of hydrogen plus carbon monoxide (H 2 +CO) gas at elevated pressure...|$|R

40|$|A {{single-stage}} {{axial fan}} was built and {{tested in the}} shop of the propeller-research tunnel of the NACA. The fan comprised a simple 24 -blade rotor having a diameter of 21 inches and a solidity of 0. 86 {{and a set of}} 37 contravanes having a solidity of 1. 33.

40|$|LectureOwing {{to their}} {{impressive}} properties reciprocating positive displacement pumps {{are used in}} many applications. Pumping fluids at high <b>delivery</b> <b>pressures</b> and metering are the areas of frequent use. The design of reciprocating pumps requires an exact knowledge of the appearing phenomena such as unacceptable pipeline pulsation and harmful cavitation. But cavitation in reciprocating positive displacement pumps is still an insufficiently understood problem. For {{a better understanding of}} the effects of incipient, partial and full cavitation in reciprocating positive displacement pumps high-speed camera measurements were done under real operating conditions using a horizontal single-acting plunger pump. Inspection windows were placed to capture all cavitation phenomena. Exemplarily the cavitation phenomena and their erosive potential are to be described on the basis of high-speed sequences for selected cavitation conditions. Also the mechanism of the incipient cavitation and the opening of the self acting valves could be clearly investigated with this experimental setup. Standards and guidelines were discussed concerning the economical operating of reciprocating positive displacement pumps...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the past}} decade {{surgical}} training in the United Kingdom (UK) has seen radical overhaul {{with the introduction of}} formal training curricula, competency based assessment, and a new Core Surgical Training programme. Despite this, and in common with many other countries, numerous threats remain to sustaining high-quality surgical training and education in the modern working environment. These include service <b>delivery</b> <b>pressures</b> and the reduction in working hours. There are numerous areas for potential improvement and dissemination of best training practice, from incentivising training within the National Health Service (NHS) through top-down government initiatives, to individualised information and feedback for trainees at the front-line. This document sets out the current structure of surgical training in the UK, and describes the contribution to the current debate by the Association of Surgeons in Training. Highlighting areas for improvement at national, regional, local and individual levels, the Association proposes 34 action points to enhance surgical training and education. Adoption of these will ensure future practice continues to improve on, and learn from, the longstanding history of training provided under the guidance of the Royal Surgical Colleges...|$|R
