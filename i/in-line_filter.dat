5000|$|If {{it is not}} {{practical}} to run new cables, it is often still possible to split the telephone line {{at the point of}} entry in some cases. If Category 3 cable, Category 4 cable, or Category 5 cable was used to wire the premises and at least one pair of wires in the cable is unused, a [...] "whole house" [...] DSL filter can be installed at the point of entry, usually a Network Interface Device (NID) box. Although an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> could be used for this purpose, special whole-house filters are available to make the installation easier. The wire pair that connects to telephones and fax machines is connected to the telephone company feed through the filter, while the wire pair that connects to the DSL modem is connected directly to the telephone company feed, unfiltered. At the wall jack where the DSL modem is installed a commercial 2-line splitter adapter is used that puts each line of the cable on its own jack port, connected as Line 1. The telephone, if any, is plugged into the Line 1 jack and the DSL modem is plugged into the Line 2 jack of the adapter, but is fed through the Line 1 contacts in that jack location. Due to the self-shielding nature of twisted wire pairs, this cable sharing technique works well for Category 4 and 5 cables, Since old-style Category 3 cables contain four parallel strands of wire, there is crosstalk and ADSL signal degradation between pairs, so cable sharing should be limited to 20 meters (65 ft), or so. This approach saves considerable money and labor, as the only changes to the premise wiring may occur at the NID and the only additional equipment needed is a 2-line splitter adapter. If the Line 2 wire pair was originally not connected at the wall jack where the DSL modem is to be used, {{it may be necessary to}} complete this step as well.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} whether an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> {{inserted in the}} syringe pump infusion line assembly influences start-up times and flow irregularities during vertical pump displacement at low infusion rates. METHODS: Fluid delivery after syringe pump start-up and after vertical displacement of the syringe pump by - 50 cm was determined gravimetrically at flow rates of 0. 5, 1. 0 and 2. 0 ml h(- 1). Measurements were repeated for each flow rate four times with two different syringe pumps with and without an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> incorporated. Data are shown as median and range. RESULTS: Start-up times were reduced by an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> at 0. 5 ml h(- 1) flow rate from 355. 5 s (0 - 660) to 115 s (0 - 320), whereas the effect was attenuated at higher flow rates. Pooling of fluid into the infusion system after lowering the infusion syringe pump was halved in all flow rates tested. Amount of infusion bolus after elevating the syringe pump by 50 cm was not affected by an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter.</b> CONCLUSION: In the evaluated model in-line filters help to reduce flow irregularities and delay in drug delivery of syringe pumps at low flow rates and represent an option to optimize continuous administration of highly concentrated short-acting drugs at very small infusion rates...|$|E
40|$|Background: Bacterial {{contamination}} of spirometers {{has been documented}} in water-sealed devices, mouthpieces, and connection tubes. Little information is available about bacterial {{contamination of}} flow-based apparatuses such as turbine-type spirometers and pneumotachographs. Inspiration through contaminated equipment is a potential source of cross infection. To investigate bacteria mobilization (ie, bacteria detachment and aerosolization from the instrument) during routine spirometric testing, 2 types of flowbased spirometers were used. Bacteria mobilization during artificial inspiration through <b>in-line</b> <b>filters</b> or cardboard mouthpieces was evaluated. Methods: Nine hundred workers undergoing periodic spirometric testing were enrolled at the occupational physician office in 30 sessions of 30 subjects each. The {{participants were asked to}} perform a forced vital capacity test in a turbine-type spirometer and in an unheated pneumotachograph fitted with disposable <b>in-line</b> <b>filters</b> or cardboard mouthpieces. To evaluate bacterial mobilization, an artificial inspiration was performed and bacterial growth determined. The bacterial growth analysis was assessed after the first and the thirtieth spirometric tests of each session without disinfecting the instruments between tests. In addition, instrument bacterial contamination was evaluated. Results: No significant bacterial mobilization and instrument contamination were found in spirometric tests executed with <b>in-line</b> <b>filters.</b> Conversely, a significant bacterial mobilization and instrument contamination were observed in tests performed with cardboard mouthpieces. Differences between the 2 spirometers were not significant. Conclusion: <b>In-line</b> <b>filters</b> may effectively reduce the risk of bacterial cross infection. Inspiration through flow-based spirometers fitted with disposable cardboard mouthpieces is completely safe when combined with spirometer disinfection/sterilization between subjects...|$|R

40|$|The {{survival}} and multiplication of Enterobacter agglomerans, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 0. 45 - and 0. 22 -micrometer <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> sets during simulated infusions were studied {{to evaluate the}} ability of each filter type to prevent infusions of these bacteria into patients. Bacteria were found to proliferate in the upstream compartment of sets housing both filter porosities. None of the 0. 22 -micrometer in-line filters were penetrated by the test bacteria. In contrast, P. aeruginosa was observed to penetrate each 0. 45 -micrometer <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> examined within 12 h of continuous infusion. Tribe Klebsielleae organisms penetrated a proportion of the 0. 45 -micrometer filters usually between 48 and 72 h of infusion. In addition, the elution of endotoxin from gram-negative bacteria trapped in the filter set during infusion is reported. Collected infusion filtrate exhibited a trend of increasing endotoxin-like activity with an increasing duration of infusion. In the case of E. agglomerans, mean peak levels of approximately 65 pg of Escherichia coli endotoxin per ml were attained after 72 h. Other bacteria produced similar results, except mean peak levels ranged from 5 to 30 pg/ml. It was noted that endotoxin-like activity was not detected in filtrate eluted from contaminated filter sets during the initial 24 h of infusion. We conclude that to avoid potential hazards of bacterial penetration and endotoxin production during continuous use of <b>in-line</b> <b>filter</b> sets, the 0. 22 -micrometer filter type must be employed and replaced every 24 h...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Numerical {{optimization}} {{is performed}} of the 40 -Gb/s dispersion-managed (DM) soliton transmission system with in-line synchronous intensity modulation. Stability of DM soliton transmission {{results from a}} combined action of dispersion, nonlin-earity, <b>in-line</b> <b>filtering,</b> and modulation through effective periodic bandwidth management of carrier pulses. Therefore, analysis of the multiparametric problem is typically required. A two-stage time-saving numerical optimization procedure is applied. At the first step, the regions of the stable carrier propagation are determined using theoretical models available for DM solitons, and system parameters are optimized. At the second stage, full numerical simulations are undertaken in order to verify the tol-erance of optimal transmission regimes.

This difference may be explained by the result of Carbone-Traber and Shanks study (Carbone-Traber and Shanks 1986), which found {{that it is important to}} aspirate fluid into a syringe slowly and by a low pressure injection method when using not only a filter needle syringe but also a side shooting to an infusion set with an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter.</b> Our study did not use any specific method to slowly aspirate ampules, and may have used a faster speed of aspiration resulting in increased aspiration pressure compared with prior studies. This is an important point, as many nurses will be aspirating at a rapid speed in a busy clinical environment. Further research for the optimal speed, amount, and pressure of aspiration to minimize particle contamination from glass ampules may be needed.|$|E

This research aimed to study the difference in glass particle contamination from ampules with different intravenous administration methods commonly used in clinical practice. Four methods were studied: IV bolus injection directly after immediate aspiration, IV bolus injection directly after 2  min’ delayed aspiration, IV bolus injection directly after aspiration with a filter needle, and side shooting to an infusion set with an <b>in-line</b> <b>filter.</b> 45 ampules per method {{for a total of}} 180 ampules were used.

The side shooting group also showed the smallest number of glass particles, but it was statistically insignificant. Using a filter needle syringe and 2  min’ delayed aspiration, which are frequently recommended to minimize contamination, may not be as effective as commonly believed, unless combined with a slow and low pressure aspiration method.

40|$|Neonatal {{infections are}} an {{important}} cause of morbidity in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Prematurity or very low birth weight is an important predisposing factor for neonatal infection. In addition, preterm infants have a compromized immune system and they often require invasive procedures that provide a portal of entry. The epidemiology of sepsis since 1978 on our NICU showed a decrease in incidence of early-onset sepsis. Group B streptococci and, less frequent, Escherichia coli {{were the most important}} microorganisms during the years, causing early-onset sepsis. The incidence of late-onset sepsis caused by Coagulase Negative Staphylococci (CoNS) and S. aureus increased significantly over the years. The increase of the use of central venous and arterial catheters probably contributed to the increase in infections in neonates. In contrary to studies in the USA, infections due to gram-negative microorganisms and fungi or yeasts were rare on our unit (incidence < 0. 3 %). The use of antibiotics is high on the NICU. We showed that 85 - 90 % of all admitted infants was treated with antibiotics, whereas the incidence of proven early-, and late-onset sepsis was much lower (range 1. 2 - 2. 4 % and 7. 1 - 14 %, respectively). However, a significant decrease in length of antibiotic treatment was noted over the period for the most frequently used antibiotics. The results of this study emphasize that correct identification of infants with sepsis is difficult and remains a major challenge in attempts to further reduce antibiotic use and postpone the emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Prevention of neonatal sepsis is a major challenge. The use of <b>in-line</b> <b>filters</b> in the intravenous administration (IV) sets in neonates was randomly studied. This study showed that <b>in-line</b> <b>filters</b> did not result in a significant decrease in nosocomial sepsis. However, a more continuous administration of intravenous medication (especially cardio-inotropics) and parenteral nutrition was guaranteed, while {{there was no difference in}} costs of materials. For the purpose of patient safety the use of <b>in-line</b> <b>filters</b> in all IV administration systems may be recommended in neonatal intensive care units. In a retrospective and a prospective study on percutaneously inserted central venous catheter (PCVC) -removal and its relationship with sepsis, we showed that besides indwelling PCVC as a risk factor for late-onset sepsis also removal of a PCVC is a risk factor. Administration of antibiotics targeted at the time of removal of the catheter significantly reduced the incidence of sepsis. Very important in the prevention of late-onset sepsis in neonates is the adherence to hygienic rules. In varies studies it is shown that it is very difficult for medical and nursing healthcare workers to adhere to hygienic rules and hand hygiene. Multimodal intervention programs have been proven to be effective in the adherence to hygienic rules.
