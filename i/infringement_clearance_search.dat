50|$|A <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> is {{a search}} of issued patents {{to see if a}} given product or process violates someone else's {{existing}} patent. If so, then a validity search may be done to try to find prior art that would invalidate the patent. A <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> is a search targeting patents being in force and may be limited to a particular country and group of countries, or a specific market.|$|R
50|$|Should a {{software}} developer hire a patent attorney {{to perform a}} <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> and provide a clearance opinion, {{there is no guarantee}} that the search could be complete. Different patents and published patent applications may use different words to describe the same concepts and thus patents that cover different aspects of the invention may not show up in a search. The cost of a <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> may not prove to be cost effective to businesses with smaller budgets or individual inventors.|$|R
50|$|A <b>clearance</b> <b>search,</b> {{also called}} freedom-to-operate (FTO) search or {{infringement}} search, is a search done on issued patents or on pending patent applications {{to determine if}} a product or process infringes any of the claims of the issued patents or pending patent applications. A <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> may also include expired art that acts as a 'safe harbor' permitting the product or process to be used based on patents in the public domain. These searches are often performed by one or more professional patent searchers who are under the direction of one or more patent attorneys.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Clearance</b> <b>search.</b> A {{standard}} practice is {{to perform a}} <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> for patents or pending patent applications that cover important features of a potential product, before its initial development or commercial introduction. For example, a search by Thomas Edison uncovered a prior patent by two Canadian inventors, Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans for carbon filament in a non-oxidizing environment, (...) , the type of light bulb Edison wanted to develop. Edison bought the patent for US$5,000 ($ in present-day terms) to eliminate {{the possibility of a}} later challenge by Woodward and Evans.|$|R
25|$|On 13 June, around midday, Clayton was {{performing}} the routine forenoon <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> {{of the area}} south of the Falkland Sound. Two Argentine Daggers of Gaucho flight spotted Clayton's Lynx and jettisoned their external fuel tanks in preparation to engage. They began strafing the helicopter with their cannons, but Clayton evaded the attacks and managed to escape. The Daggers returned home empty-handed, their original mission had been to attack British positions on Mount Longdon with retarded bombs. After the initial Argentine surrender, Clayton flew the OC of 40 Commando, Lt Col Malcolm Hunt, to Port Howard to accept the surrender of the Argentine garrison stationed there. In recognition of his service during the war, Clayton was awarded a Mention in Dispatches.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>clearance</b> <b>search</b> can be {{followed}} by a clearance opinion, i.e. a legal opinion provided by one or more patent attorneys as to whether a given product or process infringes the claims of one or more issued patents or pending patent applications. Clearance opinions may be done in combination with a [...] "validity and enforceability" [...] opinion. A validity and enforceability opinion is a legal opinion as to whether a given patent is valid and/or enforceable. In other words, a validity opinion is a legal opinion or letter in which a patent attorney or patent agent analyzes an issued patent and provides an opinion on how a court might rule on its validity or enforceability. [...] Validity opinions are often sought before litigation related to a patent. The average cost of a validity opinion (according to one 2007 survey) is over $15,000, with an infringement analysis adding $13,000.|$|R
40|$|TO THE EDITOR—We {{read the}} article by Seto et al [1] with interest. The authors {{investigated}} the correlation of HLA-DP and interleukin 28 B (IL- 28 B) polymor-phisms with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seroclearance in hepatitis B virus (HBV) patients, and found that IL- 28 B haplotype CG (rs 12979860 /rs 8099917) was associated with HBsAg clearance. The role of IL- 28 B polymorphisms in HBV has been increasingly explored, but till now only conflicting results have been achieved. Recently we reviewed current studies delving into IL- 28 B and spontaneous HBV <b>clearance</b> and <b>searched</b> database...|$|R
40|$|LFV is Sweden‟s major {{provider}} of air navigation service. The organisation continuously strives towards providing better and safer air traffic control, and to minimize its part in {{incidents and accidents}} occurring. One part of the safety work is analysis of statistics, concerning different types of safety performance indicators; in other words, statistical analysis of occurrences. The numbers of occurrences in the investigated and monitored safety performance indicators are rising, and LFV therefore wants {{to find a way}} to use statistical analysis in a proactive way, instead of reactive as the use is today. We have identified the way LFV uses statistical analysis today, and compared it to alternative approaches. We will give suggestions to LFV on different approaches of statistical analysis, which can be used in a more proactive way compared with today. The information is collected through investigations of regulations, and of procedures at the organisations concerned by the Swedish occurrence reporting system. Experts from LFV have also been interviewed. We have, after discussions with LFV‟s experts, come up with an alternate approach to perform statistical analysis. The new approach is named 24 Hour Approach, and it sets the average statistics from a specific safety performance indicator for a specified period, in relation to the average amount of traffic for the same period. The occurrences are divided between the hours they took place during the day. We have also investigated the Alarm Model, an approach used by Transportstyrelsen. We discuss the Human Factors Analysing and Classification System (HFACS) as a proposal to future development. It is an approach towards the reports for the occurrences. By classifying the reports with the human factors involved with the occurrences, statistical analyses can be made on the causal factors involved. LFV have started to introduce human factors in LFV‟s occurrence reporting system, which will give the possibly to combine different occurrences (runway incursion, airspace <b>infringement,</b> <b>clearance</b> bust, etc.) within the same safety performance indicator, thus performing statistical analyses on causal factors instead of occurrences. We conclude and recommend LFV to use the provided 24 Hour Approach on its statistics. LFV is also recommended to keep up the on-going work with integrating human factors into the Synergi system, and to adapt the Risk Analysis Tool provided by EUROCONTROL...|$|R

30|$|Slight decline was {{observed}} in forest cover by 23.1 % (28.8  ha/y) while the highest was in grazing lands by 75.65 % (600  ha/year) between 2004 and 2014 (Table  4). These shrinkages were evident because some areas gained from other LULC classes were not adequate to compensate the losses from their initial extent (Table  8). Decline in forest cover was largely attributed to its conversion into farmland and settlement by about 43.5 % (543.3  ha) and shrubs by about 8.5 % (106.4  ha) despite some area gain from the classes of shrubs by 10.7 % (102.6  ha), and farmland and settlement by 26.1 % (250  ha). In this study period, various levels of vegetation <b>clearance</b> in <b>search</b> for farmlands and household consumption have possibly transformed the original forest cover into farmlands and shrubs. Similarly, reduction in grassland covers were mostly caused by conversion of its initial extent into shrubs by about 42 % (3377.97  ha), and farmland and settlement by about 41.1 % (3259.98  ha) despite some gains from other LULC classes. This was possibly associated to land encroachment for agriculture and land restoration which was not suitable for grazing into shrubs.|$|R
40|$|Background: Impaired mucociliary {{clearance}} characterises {{lung disease}} in cystic fibrosis (CF). Hypertonic saline (HS) enhances mucociliary clearance in vitro and may lessen the destructive inflammatory {{process in the}} airways. Objectives: To investigate the effects of nebulised HS in CF compared to placebo or other treatments for mucociliary <b>clearance.</b> <b>Search</b> strategy: We searched the Cochrane CF and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches, handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search: 31 July 2008. Selection criteria: Controlled trials assessing HS compared to placebo or other mucolytic therapy, for any duration or dose regimen in people with CF (any age or disease severity). Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently reviewed all identified trials and data; and assessed trial quality. Main results: Twelve trials (442 participants, aged 6 to 46 years) were included; five excluded and two await classification. In two placebo-controlled trials, HS (3 % to 7 %, 10 ml twice-a-day) significantly increased forced expiratory volume at one second (FEV₁) at four weeks, mean difference (MD) 4. 15 (95 % CI 1. 14 to 7. 16); but not significantly after 48 weeks, MD 2. 31 (95 % CI - 2. 72 to 7. 34). Two trials compared a similar dose of HS to recombinant deoxyribonuclease (RhDNAse). One three-week trial showed a non-significant difference,MD 1. 60 (95 % CI- 7. 96 to 11. 16). However, in the second trial, after 12 weeks, RhDNAse led to a greater increase in FEV₁ than HS (5 ml twice-daily), in participants with moderate to severe lung disease, MD 8. 00 (95 % CI 2. 00 to 14. 00). One 48 -week placebo-controlled trial showed significant improvements in frequency of antibiotic use and quality of life; also that HS did not increase the concentration of Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Staphylococcus aureus. Authors’ conclusions: Treatment with 7 % HS for 48 weeks showed a small improvement in FEV₁ at four weeks; however, this was not sustained at 48 weeks (primary outcome measure of the only long-term trial). Unlike RhDNAse, HS can’t, in the long term, be said to improve lung function. However, it did improve {{quality of life and}} reduce pulmonary exacerbations. Delivered following a bronchodilator, HS appears inexpensive and safe with no increased infection risk. We believe there is sufficient evidence to recommend using HS in CF; qualifying this we highlight that the only long-term trial failed to demonstrate a significant difference in its primary outcome (lung function) with improvements only in secondary outcomes...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and subsequent removal of land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) from {{many developing countries}} are slow, expensive, and dangerous tasks, but {{have the potential to}} improve the well-being of millions of people. Consequently, those involved with humanitarian mine and UXO <b>clearance</b> are actively <b>searching</b> for new and more efficient detection technologies. Remote explosive scent tracing (REST) using trained dogs {{has the potential to be}} one such technology. However, details regarding how best to train, test, and deploy dogs in this role have never been made publicly available.

30|$|Shrinkages {{were evident}} in forest cover 52.6 % (97  ha/year) and shrubs 61.63 % (408.6  ha/year) despite some area gains were {{observed}} from other LULC classes (Tables  4, 6). It {{was because the}} area gained from other LULC classes could not satisfy the losses or conversions from their original extent. The dominant reasons that largely contributed to the reduction of forest cover were conversion of its initial extent into farmlands and settlement by about 47.37 % (960.98  ha), and shrubs by about 19.26 % (390.8  ha) despite some gains from farmland and settlement. It was partly attributed to forced resettlement program between 1987 and 1991. This {{could be due to}} forest clearing in search for additional farmlands and new settlement units in socialist regime, particularly during rural resettlement program. The demand for local construction material and fuel wood, and civil war between 1990 and 1991 were the other reasons for forestland decrease. Shrubs have also been diminished as a result of conversion of its initial extent largely into grasslands by about 27 % (1975.4  ha) and farmland and settlement by about 53.8 % (3925.9  ha) despite some gains in farmland and settlement. It was partly related to political instability and change of political structure of the country, which led to the clearance of shrubs for expansion of farmlands and new settlement centers. These revealed that further vegetation <b>clearance</b> in <b>search</b> for additional farmlands, new settlement units and grazing could eventually transform the initial extents of shrubs.|$|R
40|$|The patent {{documentation}} {{system of the}} USSR comprise collections at four levels: the very comprehensive collections of the All-Union Patent-Technical Library (VPTB); industry branch oriented files; regional files; and local files of organization and factories. The files of VPTB {{form the basis for}} producing abstracts in Russian of foreign inventions, for microfilming industrial designs and utility models of several countries and for issuing various reference and information retrieval publications. The other three categories of files serve, as their names suggest, the needs of specific branches or organizations or are all-purpose files serving a whole region. The system of patent files is continuously upgraded as regards its functions and the services offered. The philosophy governing this as well as techniques for selecting patent documents to be required are described in the article. As in many other countries, there are no libraries in the USSR which exclusively collect files of patent documents (with the exception of the libraries of patent and invention offices). Until recently the All-Union Patent-Technical Library (VPTB) has been practically the sole establishment of this kind. In the early sixties, however, the facilities and collections of VPTB proved to be insufficient to satisfy the public requirements for {{patent documentation}}, rapidly growing in this country. This period was marked by efforts directed towards the creation of regional and sectorial files ofm patent documents for the specialists in industry and science. When these files were created the nature, purpose and peculiar features of industrial property documents was fully taken into account. At the same time, important decisions were taken, concerning the setting up of the State system of patent documentation files, the problems of controlling the process of forming the files became highly important. In the system of patent documentation being established, the industry branch oriented and regional files collected within the central bodies of scientific and technical information (STI) have become the major components. They provide facilities for conducting thorough patent searches to specialists of the industrial ministries and organizations of the country, irrespective of where the enterprise or organization is located. At the present stage, the structural arrangement of the patent documentation system is represented by collections at four levels: The first or higher level [...] VPTB. The collections here comprehensively represent the files of domestic and foreign patent documents over an unlimited period of time. The second level [...] industry branch oriented files; they cover exhaustively their respective industry sectors, mainly backlogged over the period of renewal of industrial products; they are primarily represented by patent documents of the countries where the industry sector of interest is highly developed. The third level [...] regional files, of all-purpose character. They are compiled of patent documentation of the major industrially or economically developed nations and offer facilities for conducting various comprehensive patent-related studies, including patent <b>clearance</b> <b>searches.</b> The fourth level [...] local files of organizations and factories compiled according to their specific needs; the period, fields and countries covered [...] all this is determined in accordance with the general layout of the respective branch-oriented file; local files are thus the source of specialized scientific and technical information of the organization or factory concerned. ...|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Baird {{was awarded}} the Medal for Gallantry for his actions in a <b>search</b> and <b>clearance</b> {{operation}} of a Taliban stronghold.For gallantry in action during close quarters combat in Afghanistan on Operation SLIPPER.Lance Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird {{was part of a}} Commando Company mission assigned for <b>clearance</b> and <b>search</b> of a Taliban stronghold in November 2007. During the initial phase of the clearance, Lance Corporal Baird's Platoon came under heavy fire and during the ensuing close-range fire-fight, a member of his team was mortally wounded. Displaying complete disregard for his own safety, Lance Corporal Baird led other members of his team forward under heavy fire from machine guns and assault rifles to recover the wounded team member back to a position of cover.He then re-entered the compound and continued to engage the enemy. Even though under constant fire, Lance Corporal Baird continually moved amongst his team members coordinating their fire, and throwing grenades to neutralise the enemy machine gun positions. Once the close quarter battle had been won, Lance Corporal Baird again led his team forward and began room-to-room clearance, where he was again engaged by several enemies. Lance Corporal Baird continued to lead the fight, killing several enemies and successfully completing the clearance.Throughout the action, Lance Corporal Baird displayed conspicuous gallantry, composure and superior leadership under fire. He was personally responsible for killing several enemy combatants during the clearance, ensuring the momentum of the assault was maintained, and undoubtedly preventing further members of his section from becoming casualties. His performance and his actions were of the highest order and were in the finest traditions of the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force.|$|R

Much of the work of the 75 Field Engineers deployed with each contingent was area <b>search,</b> <b>clearance</b> of exposed mines, marking minefields and route clearance. Colonel John Crocker, the Commander of the 2nd Contingent wrote that [...] "For {{the first time since the}} Vietnam War, Australian Sappers hand cleared their way into live minefields on seven separate occasions to destroy exposed mines. Similar mines killed several civilians and many animals during the mission. Field engineers of the contingent destroyed over 5,000 items of unexploded ordnance (UXO) ranging from artillery shells, through RPG rockets to grenades. UXO, a legacy of the 20-year Bush War, posed a major hazard to local inhabitants in the northern provinces and to UNTAG personnel in that area".|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of various search strategies, methods and tools for searching catalysts comprising hydrides, coordination complexes or organic compounds. These are also commonly referred to as "homogeneous catalysts", in contradistinction to true heterogeneous metal or metal oxide catalysts, typically on an inorganic support. The characteristic material and search aspects are illustrated by way of exemplary patent applications for catalysts/systems that find use in industrially important reactions such as hydroformylation, hydrocyanation, (asymmetric) hydrogenation, olefin metathesis, cross-coupling or come from emerging fields (e. g. C-H activation, "green chemistry"). EPO internal, commercial, as well as some freeware tools are explained, including an evaluation of strengths and weaknesses. Emphasis is placed on how these catalysts are searched at the European Patent Office, i. e. patentability searches of patent applications. Nevertheless, the information and evaluations provided herein should enable the reader to set up a strategy for any specific search problem in this field, including high precision ("quick") and high recall <b>clearance</b> or validity <b>searches.</b> Additionally, much insight is provided on search methods at the EPO, databases etc, which can be of wider interest than catalyst searches alone. The paper is divided into two parts. This part (part 1) deals with terminology and the basics of patent searching, whereas part 2 in the next issue of this journal will deal with non-patent literature searching and the overall conclusions.
