5|$|The {{island is}} formed of Carboniferous Limestone {{and is often}} {{described}} as geologically a continuation of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of the}} Carboniferous Period, 300million years ago.|$|E

5|$|A flight {{behaviour}} {{in which}} a bird rapidly descends with a zig-zagging, side-slipping motion. During whiffling, some birds invert the aerodynamic mechanics of their body that normally provide lift—flying by turning their bodies upside down but with their necks twisted 180 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> keep their heads in a normal flying position—resulting in a rapid plummet, before a quick arrest of the fall by resuming a normal flying orientation.|$|E
5|$|An {{agreement}} in principle was reached in December 2015 between the landlord of the stadium site (Cardiff Athletic Club) and its tenant (Cardiff Blues) to give the club a 150-year lease on the stadium site. This could see the redevelopment of the Arms Park, including a new 15,000 seater stadium at 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the existing stadium costing between £20 million and £30 million and surrounded by new offices and apartments.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the first drop, the train banks a few <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the right and climbs the first air-time hill and descends. Following this, the train climbs up to a hairpin 180-degree hammerhead turn to the left. The train descends from the height of the turn to travel up and over three more air-time hills. After the hills, the train climbs up a steep slope into the mid-course brake run.|$|E

5|$|From 1882 to 1886, Glentoran used Ormeau Park {{as their}} home ground. They moved to Westbourne in Ballymacarrett {{for six years}} until 1892. They then moved to The Oval. Initially it was on Dee Street, however in 1903 The Oval's pitch was rotated 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> its current location. During the early 20th century, the land on which The Oval stood was given in {{perpetuity}} to Glentoran by the Lord Mayor of Belfast, Daniel Dixon.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, the Naval Academy {{received}} accreditation as {{an approved}} technological institution. In 1933, {{a new law}} enabled the Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies to award bachelor of science degrees, and the class of 1933 {{was the first to}} receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, the superintendent of the Naval Academy was granted the authority to award bachelor of science <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> all living graduates.|$|E

5|$|Rongorongo glyphs {{were written}} in reverse boustrophedon, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom {{left-hand}} corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> continue on the next line.

5|$|The French Lodges of Adoption which {{spread through}} Continental Europe {{during the second}} half of the 18th century {{admitted}} Masons and their female relatives to a system of degrees parallel, but unrelated to the original rite.

5|$|Trees provide {{benefits}} such as absorbing carbon dioxide, {{and other}} pollutants. Trees also provide shade and reduce ozone emissions from vehicles. By having many trees, we can cool the city heat by approximately 10 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> 20 degrees, which will help reducing ozone and helping communities that are mostly affected by the {{effects of climate change}} and urban heat islands.|$|E
5|$|Uranus (19.2AU), at 14 Earth masses, is {{the lightest}} {{of the outer}} planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the ecliptic. It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma would generate extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E

5|$|At 10:29, Captain Aoki {{ordered the}} ship's {{magazines}} flooded. The forward magazines were promptly flooded, but the aft magazines were {{not due to}} valve damage, likely caused by the near miss aft. The ship's main water pump also {{appears to have been}} damaged, greatly hindering fire fighting efforts. On the upper hangar deck, at 10:32 damage control teams attempted to control the spreading fires by employing the one-shot CO2 fire-suppression system. Whether the system functioned or not is unclear, but the burning aviation fuel proved impossible to control, and serious fires began to advance deeper into the interior of the ship. At 10:40, additional damage caused by the near-miss aft made itself known when the ship's rudder jammed 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> starboard during an evasive maneuver.|$|E
5|$|At {{the shorter}} orbital period extreme, Encke's Comet has an orbit {{that does not}} reach the orbit of Jupiter, and is known as an Encke-type comet. Short-period comets with orbital periods less than 20 years and low inclinations (up to 30 <b>degrees)</b> <b>to</b> the {{ecliptic}} are called Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Those like Halley, with orbital periods of between 20 and 200 years and inclinations extending from zero to more than 90 degrees, are called Halley-type comets (HTCs). , only 87 HTCs have been observed, compared with 567 identified JFCs.|$|E
