50|$|Saint-Gobain {{experienced}} significant {{success in}} the early 20th century. In 1918 the company expanded its manufacturing to bottles, jars, tableware and <b>domestic</b> <b>glassware.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1962 the company's {{name was}} changed back to Whitefriars Glass Ltd. The firm {{specialised}} in freeform <b>domestic</b> <b>glassware</b> until its purchase in 1981 by Caithness Glass.|$|E
5000|$|The {{many other}} types of glass which are {{generally}} made in factories are usually referred to by their individual names; for example; Float glass (for windows) and [...] "Glass Packaging" [...] (bottles, jars, and containers) and <b>domestic</b> <b>Glassware.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The oxides B2O3, SiO2, GeO2, As2O3 and Sb2O3 readily form glasses. TeO2 forms a glass {{but this}} {{requires}} a [...] "heroic quench rate" [...] or {{the addition of}} an impurity; otherwise the crystalline form results. These compounds are used in chemical, <b>domestic</b> and industrial <b>glassware</b> and optics. Boron trioxide {{is used as a}} glass fibre additive, and is also a component of borosilicate glass, widely used for laboratory <b>glassware</b> and <b>domestic</b> ovenware for its low thermal expansion. Most ordinary glassware is made from silicon dioxide. Germanium dioxide is used as a glass fibre additive, as well as in infrared optical systems. Arsenic trioxide is used in the glass industry as a decolourizing and fining agent (for the removal of bubbles), as is antimony trioxide. Tellurium dioxide finds application in laser and nonlinear optics.|$|R

Moore is committed to exploring clay as a vehicle for new forms, textures, and surfaces that are unrealizable in glass but complementary to his <b>domestic</b> <b>glassware.</b> Both sculptural and commercial, his handdipped, high-fired stoneware ranges are conceived as interchangeable with the glass...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{problem with}} the waste from {{electric}} and electronic equipment (WEEE), consisting of about 80 % of television sets and computers containing a cathode ray tube (CRT) have just begun to deal with. Cathode ray tubes (CRTs) are the video display components of televisions and computer monitors (EPA, 1995). Arising problem related with recovery and recycling of CRT glass stimulates examinations aimed at making cullet-based ceramic materials of reinforced mechanical strength. Glasses as cone and neck contain principally different lead contents another dangerous elements instead panel glass has other heavy metals (Ba, Sr, etc.) that forbid their recycling in the glass industry {{for the production of}} containers, <b>domestic</b> <b>glassware</b> and glass fiber. As it is well known concrete is an excellent material for immobilization of these metals, what was the reason to undertake this research. The use of CRT (Cathode Ray tube) waste glasses in concrete has attracted a lot of interest worldwide due to the increased disposal costs and environmental concerns. Because of silica large quantities CRT glass in the theory is a pozzolanic in nature, thus it {{can be used as a}} sand replacement in light concrete. The research was performed with use of concrete mortars. As a reference concrete mortar a mix of cement, sand, expanded clay aggregate and water was used. The purpose of this work was to investigate the influence of additives e. g. CRT glass cullet as an aggregate, and fluidized fly ash on concrete properties. Based on obtained results both CRT glass cullet and fluidize fly ash improved compressive and flexural strength in respect of standard concrete mortar without these additives. The use of CRT glass as a sand replacement caused the increased of compressive strength of concrete mortar of about 16 % and its flexural strength of about 14 %...|$|E
