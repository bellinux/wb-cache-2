25|$|Particles can deposit in the nose, mouth, pharynx and larynx (the head airways region), deeper {{within the}} {{respiratory}} tract (from the trachea {{to the terminal}} bronchioles), or in the alveolar region. The location of deposition of aerosol particles within the respiratory system strongly determines {{the health effects of}} exposure to such aerosols. This phenomenon led people to invent aerosol samplers that select a subset of the aerosol particles that reach certain parts of the respiratory system. Examples of these subsets of the particle-size distribution of an aerosol, important in occupational health, include the inhalable, thoracic, and respirable fractions. The fraction that can enter each part of the respiratory system depends on the deposition of particles in the upper parts of the airway. The <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> of particles, defined as the proportion of particles originally in the air that can enter the nose or mouth, depends on external wind speed and direction and on the particle-size distribution by aerodynamic diameter. The thoracic fraction is the proportion of the particles in ambient aerosol that can reach the thorax or chest region. The respirable fraction is the proportion of particles in the air that can reach the alveolar region. To measure the respirable fraction of particles in air, a pre-collector is used with a sampling filter. The pre-collector excludes particles as the airways remove particles from inhaled air. The sampling filter collects the particles for measurement. It is common to use cyclonic separation for the pre-collector, but other techniques include impactors, horizontal elutriators, and large pore membrane filters.|$|E
40|$|Background: Occupational {{exposure}} to wood dust can {{be responsible for}} many different harmful health effects, especially in workers employed in the wood industry. The assessment of wood dust adverse effects to humans, {{as well as the}} interpretation of its concentration measurements carried out to assess potential occupational exposure are very difficult. First of all, it is due to possible occurrence of different kind of wood dust in the workplace air, namely wood dust from dozens of species of trees belonging to 2 kinds of botanical gymnosperms and angiosperms, as well as to its different chemical composition. Material and Methods: Total dust and respirable wood dust in the workplace air in the furniture industry was determined using the filtration-gravimetric method in accordance with Polish Standards PN-Z- 04030 - 05 : 1991 and PN-Z- 04030 - 06 : 1991. Air samples were collected based on the principles of individual dosimetry. Results: Total dust concentrations were 0. 84 – 13. 92 mg/m 3 and <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> concentrations, obtained after the conversion of total dust by applying a conversion factor of 1. 59, were 1. 34 – 22. 13 mg/m 3. Respirable fraction concentrations were 0. 38 – 4. 04 mg/m 3, which makes approx. 25 % of the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> on average. The highest concentrations occurred in grinding and the lowest during milling processes of materials used in the manufacture of furniture. Conclusions: The results indicate that the share of respirable fraction in the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> of wood dust is considerable. Due to the determination of the threshold limit value (TLV) for the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> of wood dust, it is necessary to replace the previously used samplers for total dust with samplers that provide quantitative separation of wood dust inhalable fractions in accordance with the convention of this fraction as defined in PN-EN 481 : 1998.

Airborne levels of inhalable dust, endotoxin and soluble protein, and the respirable, thoracic and <b>inhalable</b> <b>fractions</b> of fungal, bacterial and actinomycete contamination were measured in the personal breathing zone of exposed workers. Inhalable dust, endotoxin, fungal and bacterial contamination all exceeded levels found in similar vegetable fibre processing factor-ies, since inhalable dust levels ranged from 10. 4 to 79. 8 mg/m 3 and inhalable bacterial levels between 4. 7 and 190 xl 06 cfu/m 3.

Andersen sampling gave an indication of background microbe levels, although no attempt was made to identify the spe-cific microorganisms as all plates were significantly overgrown.

40|$|In 2004, {{a review}} by the Institute of Environment and Health (IEH) made {{recommendations}} on occupational exposure limits (OELs) for manganese and its inorganic compounds for <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>fractions</b> respectively. These OELs {{were based on a}} detailed comprehensive evaluation of all the scientific data available at that time. Since then, more published studies have become available and a number of occupational standard-setting committees (EU SCOEL, US ACGIH-TLV, and German MAK) have proposed OEL’s for manganese and its inorganic compounds that are somewhat lower that those proposed in the 2004 review. Based on current understanding, the key toxicological and human health issues that are likely to influence a health-based recommendation relate to: neurotoxicology; reproductive and developmental toxicology; and mutagenicity/carcinogenicity. Of these, it is generally considered that neurotoxicity presents the most sensitive endpoint. As such, many of the studies that have been reported since the IEH review have sought to use those neurofunctional tests that appear to be particularly sensitive at identifying the subtle neurological changes thought to associate with manganese toxicity. These recent studies have, however, continued to be limited to a significant extent by reliance on cross-sectional designs and also by use of unreliable exposure estimation methods. Consequently the strength of the potential association between manganese exposure and these subtle subclinical cognitive or neuromotor changes is still poorly characterised and the relevance of these minor differences in terms of either their clinical or quality of life consequences remains unknown. Based upon the overall evidence, it is concluded that the 8 -h time weighted averages (TWA) for respirable (0. 05 mg/m 3 as Mn) and inhalable (0. 2 mg/m 3 as Mn) fractions as recommended by the SCOEL in 2011 are the most methodologically-sound, as they are based on the best available studies, most suited to the development of health-based OELs for both respirable and <b>inhalable</b> <b>fractions.</b> The dose-response characterisation informed by the examined studies used can be considered to establish a true human NOAEL for all the neurofunctional endpoints examined within the selected studies...|$|R

Material and Methods: To collect thoracic fractions of sulfuric acid(VI) Parallel Particle Impactor (PPI) was used. To isolate <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> of sulfuric acid(VI) from the air we used a sampler developed at the Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM), United Kingdom. Parallel Particle Impactor and IOM samplers worked with pumps at a flow of 2 l/min. For the chromatographic determination of the inhalable and thoracic fraction of sulfuric acid(VI) in workplace the ion chromatography with conductometric detection was used. Results: Depending on the sampling place the concentration of thoracic fraction of sulfuric acid(VI) was: 0. 0015 – 0. 01 mg/m 3 in workplace A, 0. 0019 – 0. 25 mg/m 3 in workplace B, and 0. 002 – 0. 01 mg/m 3 in workplace C. Of 22 tested workstations in workplace B only 7 exceeded the threshold limit value (TLV) for the concentration of thoracic fraction of sulfuric acid(VI).

40|$|Six {{types of}} aerosol {{samplers}} were evaluated experimentally {{in a test}} chamber with polydisperse fly ash. The Andersen sampler overestimates the mass of small particles due to particle bounce between stages and therefore provides a conservative estimate of respirable particulate mass and thoracic particulate mass. The TSP sampler provides an unbiased estimate of total particulate mass. TSP/CCM provides no information below ESD 2 ????m and therefore underestimates respirable particulate mass. The PM 10 sampler provides a reasonable estimate of the thoracic particulate fraction. The RespiCon sampler provides an unbiased estimate of respirable, thoracic, and <b>inhalable</b> <b>fractions.</b> DustTrak and SidePak monitors provide relative particle concentrations instead of absolute concentrations because {{it could not be}} calibrated for absolute particle concentrations with varying particle shape, composition, and density. Six sampler technologies were used to evaluate airborne dust concentrations released from oilfield pipe rattling operations. The task sampled was the removal of scale deposited on the inner wall of the pipe before it was removed from service in a producing well. The measured mass concentrations of the aerosol samplers show that a Gaussian plume model is applicable to the data of pipe rattling operations for finding an attainment area. It is estimated that workers who remain within 1 m of the machine centerline and directly downwind have an 8 -hour TWA exposure opportunity of (13. 3 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Mud Lake pipe scale and (11. 4 ???? 9. 7) mg/m 3 for the Lake Sand pipe scale at 95 % confidence. At distances more than 4 m downwind from the machine centerline, dust concentrations are below the TWA-TLV of 10 mg/m 3 for the worker in both scales. At positions crosswind or upwind from the machine centerline there is no measurable exposure. Available data suggest that the attainment area for the public starts at about 9 m downwind from the machine centerline in both scales, as 24 hour average concentrations at these distances are smaller than the 0. 15 mg/m 3, the NAAQS for unrestricted public access.

40|$|Airborne {{exposure}} to inflammation-inducing substances from Bioaerosols in both human medicine and veterinary medicine {{is associated with}} a wide range of symptoms and lung impairments. Currently for the quantification of such airborne {{exposure to}} inflammationinducing substances the LAL-Test is basically used to determine endotoxins. In addition to LAL-Test, test systems are used, which depend on releasing of proinflammatoric mediators from different cell systems. In contrast to the LAL-Test, these tests detect not only endotoxins, but also other proinflammatoric active substances, such as Glucans. One of these test systems is for example the so called Human Whole Blood Test. In this test, effective proinflammatoric substances are incubated with whole blood, then the releasing interleukin 1 ß from blood monocytes is quantified. In the present work, the LAL Test and the Human Whole Blood Test were compared for their quantification of inflammation-inducing substances in airborne dust fractions from animal houses. For this, the <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>fraction,</b> the respirable dust fraction, the PM 10 dust fraction and PM 1. 0 dust fraction were collected with standard filtration methods in different animal houses. Then the concentration of endotoxins and proinflammatoric substances in the samples was determined by using the above mentioned test systems. Furthermore, the obtained data were used for assessing whether endotoxins and proinflammatoric active substances may accumulate in one of the investigated dust fractions. In all dust fractions that were investigated in this work, a significant correlation between the endotoxic activity through LAL-Test and the proinflammatoric activity through Whole Blood Test could be detected. Thus, summarized it can be concluded, even though LAL-Test detects only endotoxins, it is also suitable to describe the airborne exposure to inflammation-inducing substances in animal stables. This result should be based on the fact, that endotoxins represent quantitatively and qualitatively the strongest inflammationinducing component in the air of animal houses. Furthermore the results of here carried out investigations indicate, that there is no specific accumulation of endotoxins and proinflammatoric active substances in anyone of the investigated dust fractions. A comparison of the volume-related proinflammatoric and endotoxic activity of in this work investigated dust fractions indicates, that the major part of the endotoxic and proinflammatoric activity is in the <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>fraction</b> and associated with particles, which are already deposited in the upper regions of the respiratory tract. Dust reduction measures in animal stables which, for example the nebulizing of oil, are especially effective in removing larger particles from the airborne state, should also contribute to a significant reduction in the total exposure to airborne endotoxins and inflammation-causing substances by both work staff and animals...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to assess whether}} urinary {{germanium}} concentration {{can be used as}} a biomarker of inhalation exposure to airborne dust from metallic germanium (Ge) or GeO 2 in the occupational setting. A novel hydride generation-based method coupled with fow-injection graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry (HG/FI-GFAAS) was developed for the determination of urinary germanium. It was found that urinary germanium concentration could be reliably determined by a standard additions method after thorough digestion of the urine and careful pH adjustment of the digest. The limit of detection (LOD) in urine for the HG/FI-GFAAS method was 0. 25 microg Ge L(- 1). In Belgian control male subjects, the urinary germanium concentration was below this LOD. In 75 workers currently exposed to inorganic germanium compounds, respirable and inhalable concentrations of germanium in the aerosols were measured on Monday and Friday at the job sites using personal air samplers. Spot-urine samples were collected on the same days before and after the work shift. The germanium concentrations of respirable dust correlated very well with those of inhalable dust and represented 20 % of the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction.</b> Workers exposed to metallic Ge dust were on average ten times less exposed to germanium than those whose exposure involved GeO 2 (3. 4 versus 33. 8 microg Ge m(- 3)). This difference was reflected in the urinary germanium concentrations (3. 4 versus 23. 4 microg Ge g(- 1) creatinine). Regression analysis showed that the concentration of germanium in the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> explained 42 % of the post-shift urinary germanium concentration either on Monday or on Friday, whereas in a subgroup of 52 workers mainly exposed to metallic germanium dust 57 % (r = 0. 76) of the Monday post-shift urinary germanium was explained. Urinary elimination kinetics were studied in seven workers exposed to airborne dust of either metallic Ge or GeO 2. The urinary elimination rate of germanium was characterised by half-times ranging from 8. 2 to 18. 1 h (on average 12 h 46 min). The present study did not allow discrimination between the germanium species to which the workers were exposed, but it showed fast urinary elimination kinetics for inhalation exposure to dust of metallic Ge and GeO 2.

METHODS: Cross-shift changes in lung function and nasal congestion, {{as well as in}} respiratory and systemic symptoms of 56 exposed workers and 36 referents, were recorded on the same day as full-shift exposure to the <b>inhalable</b> aerosol <b>fraction</b> was assessed. Exposure-response associations were investigated by regression analysis. RESULTS: The workers were exposed on average to 1. 0  mg/m(3) of grain dust, 440  EU/m(3) of endotoxin, 6  µg/m(3) of β- 1, 3 -glucans, 17 × 10 (4) /m(3) of bacteria and 4 × 10 (4) /m(3) of fungal spores during work. The exposure was associated with higher prevalence of self-reported eye and airway symptoms, which were related to the individual microbial components in a complex manner. Fatigue and nose symptoms were strongest associated with fungal spores, cough with or without phlegm was associated with grain dust and fungal spores equally strong and wheeze/tight chest/dyspnoea was strongest associated with grain dust. Bioaerosol exposure did not lead to cross-shift lung function decline, but several microbial components had influence on nose congestion. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to fungal spores and dust showed stronger associations with respiratory symptoms and fatigue than endotoxin exposure.

We collected samples of suspended particulate matter, or the <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>fraction,</b> inside, upwind and downwind of buildings holding poultry infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza virus, and tested them for the presence of endotoxins and influenza virus to characterize the potential impact of airborne influenza virus transmission during outbreaks at commercial poultry farms. Influenza viruses were detected by RT-PCR in filter-rinse fluids collected up to 60 meters downwind from the barns, but virus isolation did not yield any isolates. Viral loads in the air samples were low and beyond the limit of RT-PCR quantification except for one in-barn measurement showing a virus concentration of 8. 48 x 10 (4) genome copies/m(3). Air samples taken outside poultry barns had endotoxin concentrations of ~ 50 EU/m(3) that declined with increasing distance from the barn. Atmospheric dispersion modeling of particulate matter, using location-specific meteorological data for the sampling days, demonstrated a positive correlation between endotoxin measurements and modeled particulate matter concentrations, with an R(2) varying from 0. 59 to 0. 88. Our data suggest that areas at high risk for human or animal exposure to airborne influenza viruses can be modeled during an outbreak to allow directed interventions following targeted surveillance...|$|R
40|$|The 1991 Gulf Crisis had the {{potential}} to enhance atmospheric metal concentrations and {{this study was designed to}} investigate this probability. Total suspended (TSP) and inhalable (PM 10) particulate were collected and analyzed for lead, titanium and zinc which were determined in aliquot samples using an inductively coupled argon plasma analyzer (ICAP). Significant (P < 0. 01) daily variations were found for lead, titanium and zinc concentrations (expressed as ng m- 3) in air particulate. Concentrations of lead in the TSP samples were higher than in the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> (PM 10). The maximum mean concentration of lead was found in TSP samples collected during June 1991, which gradually decreased through December 1991, and spiked again during June 1992. The distributions of zinc and titanium in the air particulate samples were similar to that of lead. Lack of statistically significant differences in lead, titanium and zinc concentrations between 1991 and 1992 suggest limited inputs of these metals from the Kuwait oil fires, to the air particulate in Dhahran. A yearly mean of 282 +/- 144 ng of lead M- 3 air was calculated from the data for inhalable particulate collected in Dhahran. Lead poisoning is a chronic problem and automobil...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEpidemiological {{studies in}} urban areas have linked {{increasing}} respiratory and cardiovascular pathologies with atmospheric particulate matter (PM) from anthropic activities. However, the biological fate of metal-rich PM industrial emissions {{in urban areas}} of developed countries remains understudied. Lead toxicity and bioaccessibility assessments were therefore performed on emissions from a lead recycling plant, using complementary chemical acellular tests and toxicological assays, {{as a function of}} PM size (PM(10 - 2. 5), PM(2. 5 - 1) and PM(1)) and origin (furnace, refining and channeled emissions). Process PM displayed differences in metal content, granulometry, and percentage of <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction</b> as a function of their origin. Lead gastric bioaccessibility was relatively low (maximum 25 %) versus previous studies; although, because of high total lead concentrations, significant metal quantities were solubilized in simulated gastrointestinal fluids. Regardless of origin, the finest PM 1 particles induced the most significant pro-inflammatory response in human bronchial epithelial cells. Moreover, this biological response correlated with pro-oxidant potential assay results, suggesting some biological predictive value for acellular tests. Pulmonary effects from lead-rich PM could be driven by thiol complexation with either lead ions or directly on the particulate surface. Finally, health concern of PM was discussed on the basis of pro-inflammatory effects, accellular test results, and PM size distribution...|$|E
40|$|Exposure {{to large}} {{airborne}} organic aerosols may cause respiratory and skin symptoms. The use of human exposure chambers permits safe mechanistic {{studies of the}} effect of inhalation or dermal deposition of such particles. The performance of a dynamic and continuous whole-body human exposure chamber using turbulent air mixing during exposure to these organic aerosols of humans and of a new heated mannequin was evaluated. Variability of temporal and spatial distribution of the airborne particle concentration, and aerodynamic aerosol size distribution of the <b>inhalable</b> <b>fraction,</b> were evaluated. The temporal and spatial distribution of these aerosols close to the breathing zone during an exposure session was typically < 10 %, which is low for airborne particles of this size. In a larger section around a human, only slightly higher spatial variation was found. Variability between exposure sessions was also low (< 10 %). Only limited effect of relative humidity for the organic aerosols was observed. The aerodynamic particle size distribution curves differed slightly, but some were comparable to those in occupational envi-ronments. The outcome of the performance tests as measured with the heated mannequin was almost the same as with humans, indicating that the mannequin could be used in preparatory tests in this type of chamber...|$|E
40|$|The {{investigation}} of harmful semi {{volatile organic compounds}} (SVOC) in the indoor environment is important because on average people spend over 90 % of their time indoors. Lindane, an SVOC which was widely used in the UK until 2004, adsorbs to house dust. House dust acts as a reservoir for such contaminants which are remitted by desorption into the air over time. A method for measuring Lindane air concentrations in a vial using SPME {{without the use of}} water or any solvent was developed in order to carry out Lindane adsorption and desorption tests. Dynamic tests were carried out to determine adsorption and desorption coefficients as well as equilibrium time. Adsorption and desorption constants (k 1 and k 2 respectively) were determined by fitting results from the dynamic adsorption tests to an existing two compartment model described in chapter 2, using the statistical analysis software SPSS (vs 16). These dynamic tests were carried out for two size fractions (45 µm 45 µm to 45 µm 45 µm< 63 µm fraction, suggests that Lindane adsorbs more strongly to smaller dust size particles. This is significant because it means that the <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>fractions</b> which fall within the < 20 µm fraction, will have higher concentrations and therefore could potentially be more harmful as the get into the lungs. A possible explanation for the higher Ka value for the whole dust fraction over the two other smaller fractions could be because whole dust is a more complex mixture containing more fibrous substances that may have stronger affinities for Lindane than dust e. g. carpet fibres...|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of airborne endotoxins and microorganisms in livestock buildings (cattle, pig, poultry) was surveyed in four European countries (England, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany). Measurements were {{made during the}} day and night. The endotoxin concentrations were determined from dust samples separated into <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>fractions.</b> Airborne microorganisms were classified as total bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and total fungi. The lowest endotoxin concentrations were found in cattle houses. The highest concentrations of endotoxin were measured in poultry houses, especially percheries, with an overall mean of 692 and 49 ng/m 3 for <b>inhalable</b> and respirable <b>fractions,</b> respectively. Endotoxin concentration was usually higher in the day than at night. These concentrations give cause for concern for the health of stockmen working in such buildings. The corresponding mean emission rates from poultry houses were 678 and 43 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively, 51 and 6 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from pig buildings and 9 and 1 μg/h (500 kg) liveweight from cattle houses. A new automated bioaerosol sampler was developed, which allows remote, independent sampling of airborne microorganisms. Its principle of operation is similar to a slit sampler: airborne microbes are collected by impaction on an agar surface. Most measurements of airborne microorganisms were made in Germany. The indoor {{concentration of}} total bacteria was 6. 43 log colony-forming units (cfu) /m 3 in broiler houses, 5. 1 log cfu/m 3 in pig buildings and 4. 3 log cfu/m 3 in cattle buildings. During the day, the overall concentration of Enterobacteriaceae ranged between 3 and 4 log cfu/m 3. The mean fungi concentration for cattle was 3. 8, for pigs 3. 7 and for poultry 4. 0 log cfu/m 3 during the day. Slightly lower concentrations were measured at night. No significant correlation was found between the concentrations of endotoxin and Enterobacteriaceae. The highest emission rate of total bacteria and fungi was measured for broilers, i. e. 9. 5 and 7. 7 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight, respectively. Buildings for laying hens had the highest mean emission rate of 7. 1 log cfu/h (500 kg) liveweight for Enter obacteriaceae...|$|R
40|$|Existing {{samplers}} for {{the collection}} of bioaerosols have been designed {{with the aim of}} maintaining biological stability of the collected material, and in general do not select particles in accordance with international conventions for aerosol sampling. Many have uncharacterised sampling eciencies and few are designed as personal samplers. If standard personal dust samplers are used for bioaerosols the viability of collected microorganisms may be compromised by dehydration. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate a novel personal bioaerosol sampler designed to collect the <b>inhalable</b> dust <b>fraction</b> and further subdivide the sample into thoracic and respirable fractions. The new sampler was tested to see whether it enhanced the survival of the collected microorganisms, and was assessed for ease of use in the field and in subsequent laboratory analyses. A number of occupation-related field sites were selected where large concentrations of bioaerosols were to be expected. The prototype sampler was found to be simple to use. Analysis could be carried out with similar eciency either with all three fractions together for a total count, or separately for size selective data. The sampler performed at least as well as the standard IOM filter method but with the added advantage of size fractionation. The field trials showed that for sampling periods lasting several hours, microorganism survival within the sampler was adequate for culture and identification of the organisms present. This new sampler is now commercially available. In addition to bioaerosol sampling, the principle of size selective sampling using porous foams can be applied to other occupational hygiene problems, and also to indoor air monitoring of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations [...] Crown Copyright # 1999 Publishe...|$|R
