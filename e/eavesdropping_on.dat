Rather than report this to Omnitouch, Marge becomes obsessed with <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> private calls. Eventually Bart and Milhouse play a prank on Marge by making her think that an escaped convict {{was attempting to}} break into the house. When Milhouse opens the front door and tries to tell Marge that it was just a prank, Marge smashes the baby monitor on Milhouse's head and knocks him out and Bart rebukes that it was a fair punishment for eavesdropping, to which Marge reluctantly agrees.|$|E

5|$|Black and the FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Shortly afterwards, a {{group of}} monkeys kidnap Mowgli and take him to their leader, King Louie the orangutan. King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli {{does not know how}} to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is {{demolished}} to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.|$|E
5|$|Japan's air {{defenses}} {{were unable to}} stop the Allied air attacks. Owing to the short range of the country's land-based radar, and Allied attacks on IJN picket ships, the defenders typically had only about an hour to respond to incoming B-29s once they had been detected. Japanese signals intelligence units could provide longer warning times of incoming raids by <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> the bombers' radio communications, but were unable to predict {{the target of the}} attack. As a result, fighter units did not have enough time to scramble and reach the bombers' cruising altitude before they arrived over their target, and most raids were intercepted by only small numbers of aircraft. Moreover, the American bombers were capable of flying faster at high altitude than many Japanese fighters. Even when the fighters managed to close within gun range, the well-built B-29s were often able to sustain large amounts of damage. Due to the difficulty of intercepting and downing B-29s, the Japanese fighter pilots increasingly perceived their efforts as being futile. From August 1944 Japanese aircraft occasionally conducted suicide ramming attacks on B-29s, and several specialized kamikaze fighter units were established in October; {{by the end of the}} war, ramming tactics had destroyed nine B-29s and damaged another 13 for the loss of 21 fighters.|$|E

In general, measuring an unknown quantum state changes that state in some way.

25|$|Privacy {{amplification}} is {{a method}} for reducing (and effectively eliminating) Eve's partial information about Alice and Bob's key. This partial information could have been gained both by <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> the quantum channel during key transmission (thus introducing detectable errors), and on the public channel during information reconciliation (where it is assumed Eve gains all possible parity information). Privacy amplification uses Alice and Bob's key to produce a new, shorter key, {{in such a way}} that Eve has only negligible information about the new key. This can be done using a universal hash function, chosen at random from a publicly known set of such functions, which takes as its input a binary string of length equal to the key and outputs a binary string of a chosen shorter length. The amount by which this new key is shortened is calculated, based on how much information Eve could have gained about the old key (which is known due to the errors this would introduce), in order to reduce the probability of Eve having any knowledge of the new key to a very low value.|$|E
25|$|The Silverman {{trial was}} unusual in many aspects, namely the rare {{combination}} of a mother/son team {{and the fact that}} no body was ever recovered. Nonetheless, the jury was unanimous in voting to convict them not only of murder but of 117 other charges including robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> their first poll on the subject. The judge also took the unusual step of ordering Kimes not to speak to the media even after the jury had been sequestered {{as a result of her}} passing a note to New York Times reporter David Rhode in court. The judge threatened to have Kimes handcuffed during further court appearances if she persisted and restricted her telephone access to calls to her lawyers. The judge contended that Kimes was attempting to influence the jury as they may have seen or heard any such interviews, and that there would be no cross-examination as there would be in court. Kimes had earlier chosen to not take the stand in her own defense after the judge ruled that prosecutors could question her about the previous conviction on slavery charges.|$|E

On the night the article was published Jagger appeared on the Eamonn Andrews chat show and announced that he was filing a writ for libel against the News of the World.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, digital {{cordless}} phones in the 900 MHz frequency range were introduced. Digital signals allowed the phones {{to be more}} secure and decreased eavesdropping—it was relatively easy to <b>eavesdrop</b> <b>on</b> analog cordless phone conversations. In 1995, digital spread spectrum (DSS) was introduced for {{cordless phones}}. This technology enabled the digital information to spread in pieces among multiple frequencies between the receiver and the base, thereby making {{it almost impossible to}} <b>eavesdrop</b> <b>on</b> the cordless conversations.|$|R

500|$|The first {{read-through}} of {{the episode}} was held on January 23, 1991, the same night the second season premiered. [...] "The Statue" [...] was filmed {{in front of a}} live audience six days later. A few scenes were changed prior to filming; in an early draft of the script Elaine sat next to George <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> Jerry and Ray's conversation. She would wear a floppy hat to look inconspicuous and would complain about it, stating that she looks like one of the Cowsills, a singing group that was active between the 1960s and 1970s. The same scene initially featured George admitting that he spied on Ray a day earlier, showing Ray pictures of him in a bar. Ray would reply that it was his day off and asks why George is not at work, to which George replies that he should be getting back and leaves. In the original script, Elaine and Rava would argue over who is a better person: Jerry or Ray.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} opening couch gag shows a pastiche of {{the cover}} collage from The Beatles' 1967 album Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which was first used {{earlier in the season}} for [...] "Bart After Dark".

500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{authored}} {{the majority}} opinion. He cited {{a line of}} cases dating {{back as far as}} 1886 to argue that a physical intrusion, or trespass, into a constitutionally-protected area – in an attempt to find something or to obtain information – was the basis, historically, for determining whether a [...] "search" [...] had occurred under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. [...] Scalia conceded that in the years following Katz v. United States (1967) – in which electronic <b>eavesdropping</b> <b>on</b> a public telephone booth was held to be a search – the vast majority of search and seizure case law has shifted away from that approach founded on property rights, and towards an approach based on a person's [...] "expectation of privacy". However, he cited a number of post-Katz cases including Alderman v. United States and Soldal v. Cook County to argue that the trespassory approach had not been abandoned by the Court. In response to criticisms within Alito's concurrence, Scalia emphasized that the Fourth Amendment must provide, at a minimum, the level of protection as it did when it was adopted. [...] Furthermore, a trespassory test need not exclude a test of the expectation of privacy, which may be appropriate to consider in situations where there was no governmental trespass.|$|E
