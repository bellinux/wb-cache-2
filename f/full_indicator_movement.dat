40|$|In {{the earth}} sciences, and {{particularly}} in the mining of precious metals, data distributions are often strongly positively skewed. When making decisions on the potential profitability of a gold mine, for example, the high values of the distribution are of particular importance. Indicator kriging provides estimates of cumulative distribution functions from which grade tonnage curves may be calculated. Multiple or <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging requires a semivariogram to be modelled and a kriging system of equations to be solved for each cut off. This can be time consuming and modelling indicator semivariograms at high cut-offs may be difficult because of the low number of data above the cut off. One way to avoid these problems is to use median indicator kriging. Median indicator kriging uses the same semivariogram model at each cut off and may not perform as well as <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging. This thesis presents comparisons of median <b>indicator</b> kriging and <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging in the analysis of three suites of data for which the assumptions of median indicator kriging are only approximately satisfied. The distributions of the sample data sets have different degrees of skewness and sparseness. Two of the data suites represent highly skewed gold mineralisations and grade tonnage curves are obtained from the results of both indicator kriging methods. The third suite consists of approximately normally distributed air permeability data. The results from the two methods are compared with reality and show that median indicator kriging performs as well as <b>full</b> <b>indicator</b> kriging in each case...|$|R

40|$|Reports and {{profiles}} {{aimed at}} comparing the well-being and living conditions of children {{within and across}} countries are based on child indicators which measure the children’s current lives. These reports, which {{are part of the}} child <b>indicators</b> <b>movement,</b> have become popular because they serve as useful monitoring and goal-setting tools for policymakers. Researchers focus on empirical discussions regarding how to measure well-being more accurately and how to increase the transferability of data to policy and put less effort into questioning underlying conceptualizations of children in detail. Quantitative studies focus on the main changes in the child <b>indicators</b> <b>movement</b> described as shifts “from negative to positive” or “from well-becoming to well-being”. There are no complementary qualitative in-depth analyses of the underlying assumptions about children and childhood. From a childhood studies perspective this is relevant because the unspoken representations not only show the changed adults’ views of children, they also shape the lives of children. Therefore, in national and international reporting systems the dominant conceptualizations of children are emphasized, and whether and how the described major shifts in the child <b>indicators</b> <b>movement</b> have occurred is questioned. A discourse analysis approach is used to examine three influential reporting systems: the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) report (2007), the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report (2009), and the KIDS COUNT report (2011). The findings show a great variety in the realization of the shifts and also indicate consensus on still conceptualizing children as becomings and future adults. (DIPF/Orig. ...|$|R

The data set is sparse, irregularly spaced and has a highly skewed distribution. An enlarged data set, used for the variography, was obtained by including exploration data from 20 m above and 20 m below the bench.

One is scale discordance, a term used to recognize that the territorial base of an individual's subjective evaluation may not coincide with the boundaries of the unites used for the collection of objective data. Using data from a metropolitan area study, relationships between objective measures of crime and respondents' feelings of safety are examined for people whose perceptions of neighborhoods vary in size.

Of particular interest is the structure of co-variability between mechanical degrees-of-freedom (e. g., joints) within the movement system’s entirety when undergoing a skill transition. Exemplar data from golf are presented, demonstrating the link between movement variability and mental effort as an important feature of automaticity, and thus intervention design throughout the different stages of refinement. Movement variability was shown to reduce when mental effort directed towards an individual aspect of the skill was high (target variable). The opposite pattern was apparent for variables unrelated to the technical refinement. Therefore, two related <b>indicators,</b> <b>movement</b> variability and mental effort, are offered as a basis through which the evaluation of automaticity during technical refinements may be made...|$|R

All three {{were members of}} the International Society for Quality of Life Studies (ISQOLS) as were most {{of the members of the}} editorial board. The journal has roots in the social <b>indicator</b> <b>movement</b> and emerged as a split-off from the successful journal of “ Social Indicators Research” that got ever more submissions on happiness. Alex Michalos was at that time the editor in chief of “Social Indicators Research,” which he established in 1973.

Ruut Veenhoven was founder of the World Database of Happiness and as such central in the field. The publishing house was Kluwer Academic in the Netherlands, the same publisher of Social Indicators Research. Kluwer Academic became part of Springer Publishers, which now hosts several more scientific journals on well-being, such as “Quality of life Research” since 1997, “Applied Research in Quality of Life” since 2003, and “Psychology of Well-Being” since 2011.

In this response paper, we join in the discussion by highlighting five issues—progress, paradigms, puzzles, promise, and potential research directions of social indicators research. In terms of progress, while we have accomplished many tasks proposed by Solomon et al. (The quality of life, Sage, London 1980), some of them are yet to be achieved. Regarding research paradigms surrounding social indicators, researchers have primarily used positivistic or post-positivistic orientation to conduct and interpret social indicators research, with relatively fewer studies using interpretive, constructionist or critical theory perspective. There are also several puzzles deserving consideration. These include (a) the use of “other types of evidence”, particularly qualitative data; (b) evaluation of social programs; (c) feasibility of assessing “social progress”; (d) choice of social indicators; (e) interpretation of findings; (f) methodological debates; and (g) explanations for social change. Finally, the promise of social indicators research to promote quality of life and potential future research directions of social indicators research are discussed.

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via: [URL] {{of the purposes of}} social indicators is to inform policy, so that policymakers can respond to emerging trends and changing needs. Many policy responses are resource-based – that is, they involve changes in expenditure, and the size and purpose of public expenditure is an important indicator of policy effort. This article shows that between the 1980 s and the mid- 2000 s, successive Australian governments increased expenditure on children {{to a greater extent than}} they did on elderly Australians. They also increasingly focused public expenditure on younger children, and on poorer children. Since the mid- 2000 s, while the focus of public expenditure on younger and poorer children appears to continue, the size of the public expenditure budget for children is no longer increasing greatly, suggesting that policy prioritisation of children overall may have come to an end. Yet even while public expenditure on children was increasing, a review of available indicators suggests that trends in Australian children’s outcomes were not uniformly positive. In particular there is little substantive evidence that disparities in outcomes between children from lower and higher socio-economic backgrounds fell substantially. This raises questions of how the efficacy of public expenditure should be measured, and how the child <b>indicators</b> <b>movement</b> can rise to this challenge...|$|R
