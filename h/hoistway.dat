5000|$|In {{different}} parts of the country the agitation to secure legislation regulating the hours of labour became aggressive again in 1870 and the years immediately following, there being a constant repetition of attempts to secure the Factory [...] enactment of a ten-hours law, but in Massachusetts legisia- [...] ? tion, /877 [...] all the petitions failed till 1874, when the legislature of that commonwealth established the hours of labour at sixty per week not only for children under eighteen, but for women, the law providing that no minor under eighteen and no woman over that age should be employed by any person, firm or corporation in any manufacturing establishment more than ten hours in any one day. In 1876 Massachusetts reconstructed its laws relating to the employment of children, although it did not abrogate the principles involved in earlier legislation, while in 1877 the commonwealth passed Factory Acts covering the general provisions of the British laws. It provided for the general inspection of factories and public buildings, the provisions of the law relating to dangerous machinery, such as belting, shafting, gearing, drums, &c., which the legislature insisted must be securely guarded, and that no machinery other than steam engines should be cleaned while running. The question of ventilation and cleanliness was also attended to. Dangers connected with <b>hoistways,</b> elevators and well-holes were minimized by their protection by sufficient trap-doors, while fire-escapes were made obligatory on all establishments of three or more storeys in height. All main doors, both inside and outside, of manufacturing establishments, as well as those of churches, school-rooms, town halls, theatres and every building used for public assemblies, should open outwardly whenever the factory inspectors of the commonwealth deemed it necessary. These provisions remain in the laws of Massachusetts, and other states have found it wise to follow them.|$|R
5000|$|... (A) The {{first class}} {{includes}} factory and workshop acts, laws relating to hours of labour, work on Sundays and holidays, {{the payment of}} wages, the liability of employers for injuries to their employees, &c. Factory acts have been passed by Factory [...] nearly all {{the states of the}} Union. These may be and work- [...] considered in two groups - first, laws which relate to conditions of employment and affect only children, young persons and women; and second, laws which relate to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and to the safety of employees generally. The states adopting such laws have usually made provision for factory inspectors, whose duties are to enforce these laws and who have power to enter and inspect factories and workshops. The most common provisions of the factory acts in the various states are those which fix an age limit below which employment is unlawful. All but five states have enacted such provisions, and these five states have practically no manufacturing industries. In some states the laws fixing an age limit are restricted in their application to factories, while in others they extend also to workshops, bakeries, mercantile establishments and other work places where children are employed. The prescribed age limit varies from ten to fourteen years. Provisions concerning the education of children in factories and workshops may be considered in two groups, those relating to apprenticeship and those requiring a certain educational qualification as a prerequisite to employment. Apprenticeship laws are numerous, but they do not now have great force, because of the practical abrogation of the apprenticeship system through the operation of modern methods of production. Most states have provisions prohibiting illiterates under a specified age, usually sixteen, from being employed in factories and workshops. The provisions of the factory acts relating to hours of labour and night work generally affect only the employment of women and young persons. Most of the states have enacted such provisions, those limiting the hours of children occurring more frequently than those limiting the hours of women. The hour limit for work in such cases ranges from six per day to sixty-six per week. Where the working time of children is restricted, the minimum age prescribed for such children ranges from twelve to twenty-one years. In some cases the restriction of the hours of labour of women and children is general, while in others it applies only to employment in one or more classes of industries. Other provisions of law for the protection of women and children, but not usually confined in their operation to factories and workshops, are such as require seats for females and separate toilet facilities for the sexes, and prohibit employment in certain occupations as in mines, places where intoxicants are manufactured or sold, in cleaning or operating dangerous machinery, &c. Provisions of factory acts relating to the sanitary condition of factories and workshops and the safety of employees have been enacted in nearly all the manufacturing states of the Union. They prohibit overcrowding, and require proper ventilation, sufficient light and heat, the lime-washing or painting of walls and ceilings, the provision of exhaust fans and blowers in places where dust or dangerous fumes are generated, guards on machinery, mechanical belts and gearing shifters, guards on elevators and <b>hoistways,</b> hand-rails on stairs, fire-escapes, &c.|$|R

5000|$|Emergency {{elevator}} service: {{activation of}} automatic initiating devices associated with elevator operation {{are used to}} initiate emergency elevator functions, such as recall of associated elevator cab(s). The recall will cause the elevator cabs {{to return to the}} ground level for use by fire service response teams and to ensure that cabs do not return to the floor of fire incidence, in addition to prevent people from becoming trapped in the elevators. Phases of operation include primary recall (typically the ground level), alternate/secondary recall (typically a floor adjacent to the ground level - used when the initiation occurred on the primary level), illumination of the [...] "fire hat" [...] indicator when an alarm occurs in the elevator <b>hoistway</b> or associated control room, and in some cases shunt trip (disconnect) of elevator power (generally used where the control room or <b>hoistway</b> is protected by fire sprinklers).|$|E
50|$|Inspection {{service is}} {{designed}} to provide access to the <b>hoistway</b> and car top for inspection and maintenance purposes by qualified elevator mechanics. It is first activated by a key switch on the car operating panel usually labeled 'Inspection', 'Car Top', 'Access Enable' or 'HWENAB'. When this switch is activated the elevator will come to a stop if moving, car calls will be canceled (and the buttons disabled), and hall calls will be assigned to other elevator cars in the group (or canceled in a single elevator configuration). The elevator can now only be moved by the corresponding 'Access' key switches, usually located at the highest (to access the top of the car) and lowest (to access the elevator pit) landings. The access key switches will allow the car to move at reduced inspection speed with the <b>hoistway</b> door open. This speed can range from anywhere up to 60% of normal operating speed on most controllers, and is usually defined by local safety codes.|$|E

50|$|Some {{types of}} {{residential}} elevators {{do not use}} a traditional elevator shaft, machine room, and elevator <b>hoistway.</b> This allows an elevator to be installed where a traditional elevator may not fit, and simplifies installation. The ASME board first approved machine-room-less systems in a revision of the ASME A17.1 in 2007. Machine-room-less elevators have been available commercially since the mid 1990s, however cost and overall size prevented their adoption to the residential elevator market until around 2010.|$|E
50|$|Elevators {{have a car}} top {{inspection}} station that allows the car to be operated by a mechanic {{in order to move}} it through the <b>hoistway.</b> Generally, there are three buttons: UP, RUN, and DOWN. Both the RUN and a direction button must be held to move the car in that direction, and the elevator will stop moving as soon as the buttons are released. Most other elevators have an up/down toggle switch and a RUN button. The inspection panel also has standard power outlets for work lamps and powered tools.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, Antti Herlin, the {{great-grandson}} of the company's founder, {{was appointed}} KONE CEO and deputy {{chairman of the}} board of the company that he had now inherited. The company introduced new technology such as the KONE EcoDisc hoisting machine and the KONE MonoSpace elevator technology concept in 1996. KONE was one of the first to introduce machine-room-less (MRL) construction in elevators. KONE's MRL designs significantly reduced the size of elevator machinery and its lift mechanism by using permanent-magnet electric motors (PMM). The use of these mechanisms enabled all of the elevator's equipment and its inner workings to be confined to the space above the elevator shaft, known as the <b>hoistway</b> overhead, instead of needing an entire room dedicated to machinery. At the beginning of the 21st Century, due to the apparent benefits of KONE's pioneering elevator systems, rival companies began competitively marketing machine-room-less elevators of their own.|$|E

40|$|Background. It is {{estimated}} that hospitals spend between 28 and 33 billion dollars per year {{as a result of}} hospital-acquired infections. (Scott, 2009) The costs continue to rise despite the guidance and controls provided by hospital infection control staff to reduce patient exposures to fungal spores and other infectious agents. With all processes and controls in place, the vented elevator shaft represents an unprotected opening {{from the top of the}} building to the lower floors. The hypothesis for this prospective study is that there is a positive correlation between the number of Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spores, Cladosporium, ascospores, basidiospores in spores/m 3 as individual spore categories found in the <b>hoistway</b> vent of an elevator shaft and the levels of the same spores, sampled near-simultaneously in the outdoor intake of the elevator shaft. Specific aims of this study include determining if external Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spores are entering the healthcare facility via the elevator shaft and <b>hoistway</b> vents. Additional aims include determining levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spores outdoors, in the elevator shafts, and indoors in areas possibly affected by elevator shaft air; and, finally, to evaluate whether any effect is observed due to the installation of a <b>hoistway</b> vent damper, installed serendipitously during this study. ^ Methods. Between April 2010 and September 2010, a total of 3, 521 air samples were collected, including 363 spore trap samples analyzed microscopically for seven spore types, and polymerase chain reaction analyses on 254 air samples. 2178 particle count measurements, 363 temperature readings and 363 relative humidity readings were also obtained from 7 different locations potentially related to the path of air travel inside and near a centrally-located and representative elevator shaft. ^ Results. Mean Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spore values were higher outside the building (530 spores/m 3 of air) than inside the <b>hoistway</b> (22. 8 spores/m 3) during the six month study. Mean values inside the hospital were lower than outside throughout the study, ranging from 15 to 73 spores/m 3 of air. Mean Penicillium/Aspergillus-like spore counts inside the <b>hoistway</b> decreased from 40. 1 spores/m 3 of air to 9 spores/m 3 of air following the installation of a back draft damper between the outside air and the elevator shaft. Comparison of samples collected outside the building and inside the <b>hoistway</b> vent prior to installing the damper indicated a strong positive correlation (Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s Rho= 0. 8008, p= 0. 0001). The similar comparison following the damper installation indicated a moderate non-significant inverse correlation (Spearman 2 ̆ 7 s rho = − 0. 2795, p= 0. 1347). ^ Conclusion. Elevator shafts are one pathway for mold spores to enter a healthcare facility. A significant correlation was detected between spores and particle counts inside the <b>hoistway</b> and outside prior to changes in the ventilation system. The insertion of the back draft damper appeared to lower the spore counts inside the <b>hoistway</b> and inside the building. The mold spore counts in air outside the study building were higher in the period following the damper installation while the levels inside the <b>hoistway</b> and hospital decreased. Cladosporium and Penicillium/Aspergillus -like spores provided a method for evaluating indoor air quality as a natural tracer from outside the building to inside the building. Ascospores and basidiospores were not a valuable tracer due to low levels of detection during this study. ^ Installation of a back draft damper provides additional protection for the indoor environment of a hospital or healthcare facility, including in particular patients who may be immunocompromised. Current design standards and references do not require the installation of a back draft damper, but evaluation of adding language to relevant building codes should be considered. The data indicate a reduction in levels of Penicillium/Aspergillus -like spores, particle counts and a reduction in relative humidity inside of the elevator shaft after damper installation. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} effects that occur when a high-speed lift travels through the <b>hoistway</b> involve {{a range of}} diverse phenomena that lead to excessive vibrations of the sling-car assembly and noise inside the <b>hoistway</b> and the car. Noise and vibration may then be transmitted to the building structure. Thus, a good understanding and prediction of aerodynamic phenomena occurring in high-speed lift installations is essential to design a system which satisfies ever more demanding ride quality criteria. This paper discusses the fluid-structure interactions taking place in high-rise applications and {{presents the results of}} a study to develop a computational model to predict the aerodynamic interactions in high-speed lift systems using Multibody Dynamics (MBD) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques.

40|$|Traditional cable driven {{elevators}} perform {{poorly in}} high-rise buildings because {{the weight of}} the cable limits the payload, and its elasticity degrades control performance. Further, it is not mechanically possible to include several elevator cars in the same <b>hoistway</b> because of the cable. However such multi-car elevator systems are desirable since they reduce passenger waiting time and reduce the space requirements of the elevator system. A promising solution is to use long armature linear motors spanning the <b>hoistway</b> to directly drive elevator cages. In such applications, the mover position sensing method must be explicitly addressed since most active position sensing methods require traveling cables, which are also an obstacle for multi-car elevator systems. In this paper, the linear-motor active position sensing method is formally introduced and the principle of operation, design and real-time operation methods are presented. The proposed method is used to measure the position of the mover of a long armature permanent magnet linear synchronous motor requiring no active components on the mover, thus traveling cables are eliminated. The principle of operation is inspired by linear variable differential transformer: A magnetic shunt positioned at a fixed distance ahead of the mover deforms the magnetic field created by one of the armature coils. The deformation can be determined by measuring the induced voltages on the neighboring coils, and the position of the shunt, and thus the mover, can be calculated. A design method for the optimal dimensions of the shunt for a given armature to provide long measurement range and small maximum position error is presented, accompanied by a real-time measurement algorithm that will enable the motor to be driven using the method. Finally the method is verified by simulations and experimental results conducted on a full scale linear-motor elevator prototype that was constructed in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} the findings {{that are relevant}} to the design of smoke control systems for elevators. A method of dealing with elevator piston effect is discussed. Elevator piston effect is the transient pressures produced by elevator car motion, and this effect depends on air temperature, building leakage areas, elevator car velocity, and <b>hoistway</b> size. All other things being equal, piston effect is considerably greater for single-car hoistways than for multiple-car hoistways. Different approaches for dealing with the pressure fluctuations due to the opening and closing of building doors are presented. An approach for design analysis is presented with example analyses of two different elevator smoke control systems. Results indicate that many types of elevator smoke control systems can be designed to provide acceptable levels of pressurization even under severe conditions of doors opening and closing.

40|$|BACKGROUND A mine shaft is the {{lifeline}} to underground mines. Mine operators {{depend on}} safe, uninterrupted, and efficient {{movement of workers}} and materials. The shaft and hoisting system provides access to the network of openings used to recover the underground resource, provides vertical transport of miners and materials, and serves as an escapeway {{in case of an}} emergency. Accidents involving hoisting can be catastrophic. Such was the case in 1973 at the Markham Colliery in Derbyshire, UK when the conveyance overwound and fell to the shaft bottom, resulting in 17 deaths. Hoist and elevator machinery must meet the requirements specified in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Parts 57 and 75. According to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data, many shaft-related accidents in the United States are associated with the hoisting cycle. MSHA statistics show that there were about 1500 shaft- related accidents in the 5 -year period between 1992 - 1996. Most of these accidents resulted from the action, motion, or failure of the hoisting equipment or mechanism and involved movement of the conveyance which includes cages, skips, ore buckets, and elevators. A hoisting hazard may be characterized as an "unsafe hoist operating condition caused by insufficient or inaccurate information available to the hoist operator" (authors' quote). Earlier investigators have defined safety features and operating and maintenance standards for hoists, and reported on monitoring and control systems and sensors for hoists and conveyances [Farley, 1983; Ward, 19931. However, despite the considerable technological progress and hoisting control improvements in recent years, safety- related issues that require further investigation still remain. The hoist operator must constantly be aware of two important hoist-operating conditions: the position of the conveyance and the tension in the hoist rope. If this information is not available or is inaccurate, the hoist becomes unsafe. Current technology provides this information indirectly from sensors and indicators in the hoist room. However, unlike a building elevator <b>hoistway,</b> mine shaft <b>hoistway</b> problems often include: 1. poor ground conditions and excessive shaft wall and guide displacement; 2. rock bursts in deep mines (resulting in large rock movements and fragments blocking the hoist way); 3. water, ice, and salt buildup (impeding the smooth flow of the conveyance); 4. severe vibration from hoisting (resulting in loose guide support brackets, broken welds, or other alignment and conveyance mechanism malfunctions). The second issue relates to dynamic rope loads applied during normal winding, particularly during loading, acceleration, and stopping. Safety factors on wire rope are based on static load. They are artificially high to account for all cases of dynamic loads, even though the total load history on the rope (static and dynamic) during service is unknown. Therefore the tension, and thus the compliance with wire rope load safety factors, is unknown to the hoistman...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{phenomena}} such as transient and steady-state resonant vibrations in vertical {{transportation systems}} {{deployed in the}} modern built environment and underground mining applications affect {{the performance of the}} entire installation. In extreme high rise structures and deep underground mines traction drive elevator systems and drum-driven lifting installations employ long ropes and cables that exhibit low-frequency modes and nonlinear modal interactions. This results in the need to develop mathematical models in order to simulate their dynamic behaviour to predict and control their non-linear stationary and non-stationary dynamic responses; the coupled vibrations of a car/ conveyance and counterweight; as well as motions of other components present in the system, such as compensating sheave assemblies and diverter pulleys. The underlying causes of these dynamic responses / vibrations are varied. They include low frequency sway motions of the host structure induced by high winds and seismic activities, poorly aligned guide rail joints and guide rail imperfections, eccentric / out-of-balance pulleys and sheaves, systematic resonance in the electronic drive control system, motor torque ripple and aerodynamic effects that occur in the <b>hoistway.</b> Consequently, conditions for external, parametric and autoparametric resonances can readily arise during the operation of such installations. In this context, this paper will demonstrate a general approach to model the dynamic behaviour of typical vertical transportation and lifting installations. Subsequently, dynamic models and simulation techniques for the prediction of their non-stationary / nonlinear dynamic responses are discussed and the effectiveness of these techniques are demonstrated. Then, suitable strategies can be proposed to minimize the effects of adverse dynamic responses of the system so that the installation can operate under these conditions safely...|$|E
