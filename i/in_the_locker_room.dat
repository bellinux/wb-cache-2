5|$|Alston is also {{credited}} with helping {{to break down}} the barriers for female sports journalists. On October 1, 1974, after the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Houston Astros to clinch the NL Pennant at the Houston Astrodome, he invited Anita Martini to the post-game press conference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b> She became the first female journalist allowed in any major league locker room.|$|E
5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> when he received {{a telephone call from}} his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his son on a Jets triumph.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the final, Hamm collapsed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> from severe hydration. She was treated by medical staff with an intravenous drip and three liters of fluids. After 12 hours of sleep, {{she joined the}} team for magazine cover shoots, went to Disneyland for a celebration rally, and made numerous television appearances. A week later, the team met President Clinton at the White House and flew with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton on Air Force One to Cape Canaveral. Her leadership and performance at the 1999 World Cup cemented Hamm as a soccer icon.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, Striker {{made his}} first post-WWE appearance, by {{appearing}} on Family Wrestling Entertainment iPPV, FWE Rumble in Queens, New York as a color commentator. On October 21, 2013, Striker was defeated by Justin Credible in NYWC's House of Madness. After the match, Striker nailed Credible, causing him to bleed. Backstage, Striker tried to apologize but Credible cursed him out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> and stormed off. On July 2013, Championship Wrestling from Hollywood (CWFH) announced Striker as the new announcer of the promotion on MAVTV. On November 2, 2013, Striker made his in ring debut for CWFH, unsuccessfully challenging Scorpio Sky for the CWFH Heritage Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't enough as the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E

Both Harker and Flournoy were banned one (Harker) and five (Flournoy) games. Flournoy's ban was later reduced to three games. Police were informed about the incident and an investigation into Flournoy took place.|$|R
5|$|After {{only six}} games in Milwaukee, McGrattan was traded {{back to the}} Flames, in {{exchange}} for Joe Piskula, on February 28, 2013. McGrattan's positive influence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> as a player always prepared to play was cited as a reason why Calgary re-acquired him. The Flames also expected he would add a physical presence to the team, which he did in his re-debut with the Flames, a 4–2 victory over Vancouver that included several hits and a fight with Tom Sestito – his first NHL fight in over a year. He gave the crowd a salute following the fight, sending the fans into a frenzy and earning a ten-minute misconduct. He finished the season with three goals and 49 PIM in 19 games with the Flames, and earned a two-year contract extension from the team.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2013 NHL season, Malhotra {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent. After being unsigned by an NHL team {{at the start of the}} 2013–14 season and looking to continue his playing career Malhotra signed a 25-game professional try out (PTO) contract with the AHL's Charlotte Checkers. The Carolina Hurricanes signed Malhotra to a one-year two way contract on October 31 and he made his Carolina debut against the New York Rangers on November 2. On November 6, Manny scored his first NHL goal in 19 months, scoring a game winner in overtime against the Flyers. As a measure of the amount of respect he has earned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> in just a few weeks, Manny was selected to be an interim Assistant Captain while Tim Gleason was out with an injury. After Gleason was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, Malhotra was officially declared Alternate Captain for the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Sutter {{engineered}} a seven player {{trade at}} the end of January that sent Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik Sjostrom to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan, Ian White and Niklas Hagman. The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied. One day later, the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. The deals resulted in the change of over one third of the roster in the period of a day, moves that were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames hovered around the final playoff spot. While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room,</b> Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman's departure. Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary, while in Kotalik, the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York.|$|E

Karofsky, devastated, attempts suicide by hanging, but is saved in time by his father. The news causes shock {{at his old}} school, McKinley High: Members of the staff believe {{they could have done}} more to help him when he had been a student there, while Kurt blames himself for ignoring Karofsky's repeated phone calls that week. It also shocks Sebastian, who had cruelly rebuffed Karofsky at a gay bar, and he destroys the photos of Finn, thus abandoning his attempt at blackmail. New Directions coach Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has all of the members reveal something they are looking forward to in the future, to remind them that no matter how low they think their lives have sunk, they should not forget what is ahead of them. Rachel and Finn apologize to each other, and decide to get married the day after Regionals.|$|E

Crosetti comforts Thormann's wife Eva (Edie Falco), but is privately told by Dr. Eli Devilbiss (Sean Whitesell) that Thormann may be blind or mentally disabled, even if he survives. Crosetti begs Gee to give him the case and, even though Gee believes he is too emotionally involved, he gives in when Crosetti tries to make him feel guilty by showing him his previous gunshot wounds. When an investigation at the crime scene turns up nothing, Lewis catches Crosetti praying with a rosary <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b> Crosetti convinces a skeptical Lewis to pray with him for help in the investigation.|$|E

They are freed when Kogen's friend Dolly Parton uses her extra-strength makeup remover to dissolve the lock on the door. They run into a skybox suite and get {{a view of the}} game until the owner Rupert Murdoch arrives and confronts them. Homer's posse flee to the field, chased by Murdoch's security, until they get lost in the sea of victorious players. The group ends up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> where they share the celebration, and everyone has a Super Bowl ring on one of their hands at game's end.|$|E
5|$|New York {{played the}} Cleveland Browns a week later. In a meeting before the game, Ryan told his players that he {{expected}} to be fired {{at the end of}} the year. The Jets defeated Cleveland, 24–13, and despite the uncertainty, the players and coaches were in high spirits. Several players including Antonio Cromartie, Calvin Pace, and Willie Colon went on to publicly express their support for Ryan to return as coach. In the season finale, the Jets defeated the Miami Dolphins 20–7, eliminating them from playoff contention. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room</b> after the game, owner Woody Johnson and Idzik announced Ryan would return for the 2014 season much to the delight of the players.

5|$|The feud between Edge and Kane {{came to an}} {{end when}} Edge was put in an angle with Matt Hardy. On the July 11 episode of Raw, Hardy, who at the time was {{unemployed}} by WWE, made a surprise appearance, interfering in a match between Edge and Kane. The following week, as both Edge and Lita were walking towards the ring before a scheduled Steel cage match against Kane, Hardy attacked Edge from behind. On the August 1 episode of Raw, Vince McMahon officially announced Hardy's return to WWE, adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam. The following week, Hardy made his in-ring return, defeating Snitsky. After the victory, Hardy was attacked by Edge, and was carried backstage. In retaliation, Hardy counterattacked Edge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b> At SummerSlam, Edge was given the win in the match after Hardy hit the ring post and began to bleed profusely, which caused the referee to stop the match.|$|E
40|$|In this semi-structured {{interview}} research, {{we investigate}} {{the attitudes of}} 22 academy-level association football (soccer) players who are potentially {{on the verge of}} becoming professional athletes. We find that, {{as a result of these}} men belonging to a generation holding inclusive attitudes towards homosexuality, independent of whether they maintain contact with gay men, they are unanimously supportive of gay men coming out on their team. Thus, this research supports a growing body of literature suggesting that teamsport culture is no longer a bastion of homophobia <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK. Their support includes athletes being unconcerned with sharing rooms with gay players, changing with them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>rooms,</b> or relating to them on a social and emotional level. The only apprehension they maintain is that having a gay teammate might somewhat alter homosocial banter, as they would not want to offend that individual...|$|R

Seconds after the victory, Hardy {{was attacked by}} Edge, and as he was being carried backstage, Matt counterattacked Edge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>locker</b> <b>room.</b> On August 21 at SummerSlam, their match came to a premature end when Edge dropped Hardy onto {{the top of a}} ring post, causing him to bleed heavily. The referee ended the match on the grounds that Hardy could not continue, and Edge was declared the winner. After SummerSlam, the two continued fighting on Raw, including a Street Fight that resulted in Hardy performing a Side Effect on Edge off the entrance stage and into electrical equipment below. At Unforgiven, Edge faced Hardy in a steel cage match. Hardy caught an interfering Lita with the Twist of Fate and won the match with a leg-drop {{off the top of the}} cage.
