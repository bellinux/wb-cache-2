5|$|Although {{women in}} industrialised {{countries}} have narrowed {{the gender gap}} in life expectancy and now live longer than men, {{in many areas of}} health they experience earlier and more severe disease with poorer outcomes. Gender remains an important social determinant of health, since women's health is influenced not just by their biology but also by conditions such as poverty, employment, and family responsibilities. Women have long been disadvantaged in many respects such as social and economic power which restricts their access to the necessities of life including <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> greater the level of disadvantage, such as in developing countries, the greater adverse impact on health.|$|E

25|$|Diagnostic testing: Diagnostic {{testing is}} used to {{diagnose}} or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In many cases, genetic testing {{is used to}} confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on physical mutations and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed {{at any time during}} a person's life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic test can influence a person's choices about <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> management of the disease. For example, people with a family history of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) who experience pain or tenderness in their abdomen, blood in their urine, frequent urination, pain in the sides, a urinary tract infection or kidney stones may decide to have their genes tested and the result could confirm the diagnosis of PKD.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{bisexuality}} and heterosexuality, {{homosexuality is}} one of the three main categories of sexual orientation within the heterosexual–homosexual continuum. Scientists do not know exactly what determines an individual's sexual orientation, but they believe that it is caused by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences, These relationships are equivalent to heterosexual relationships in essential psychological respects. Homosexual relationships and acts have been admired, as well as condemned, throughout recorded history, depending on the form they took and the culture in which they occurred. Since the end of the 19th century, there has been a global movement towards increased visibility, recognition, and legal rights for gay people, including the rights to marriage and civil unions, adoption and parenting, employment, military service, equal access to <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> introduction of anti-bullying legislation to protect gay minors.|$|E
25|$|The College of Engineering {{is home to}} six {{academic}} {{departments and}} three degree programs focused on challenges associated with sustainability, energy, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. The faculty includes 30 named professors, six National Academy of Engineers members, 36 NSF career award winners and 11 University teaching award recipients. Initiatives led by college faculty include 14 college-based research centers and six university-based research centers. Annual research expenditures exceeded $55M this past year, representing over 40 percent of total University research dollars. The new Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Laboratory (ISE Lab) brings 194,000 sq. ft. of new research and teaching space to the campus. Additionally, the university's planned Science and Technology Campus will expand university-based research and shared research undertaken with corporate partners. Strategic partnerships with industry, government and academic institutions complement these initiatives, expanding the college's reputation and reach, and cultivating a culture of interdisciplinary collaboration, leadership and entrepreneurship among future engineers.|$|E
25|$|René {{has been}} viewed as {{a prime example of}} a benevolent dictator, leading his country {{to the point of being}} the most {{developed}} country in Africa— as measured by the Human Development Index— and helping build one of the continent's highest gross domestic products per capita. His supporters believe that he had solid social priorities, including his government's extensive funding of education, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> environment. Critical indicators, such as infant mortality, literacy rate, and economic well-being, are among the best in the continent. During his rule, the Seychelles avoided the volatile political climate and underdevelopment in neighbouring island countries such as the Comoros and Madagascar. His critics believe that he and his party are responsible for torture and other human rights abuses involving opponents of the government, allegedly including the death of a prominent dissident in London, Gérard Hoarau. After the 1977 coup, a significant portion of the population, including the deposed President Mancham, fled to the UK and South Africa due to political persecution and fear of the new government's alignment with the Soviet Union, Tanzania and North Korea. René also faced international pressure regarding his government's former requirement that all applicants to the country's secondary education system graduate a compulsory National Youth Service, which included traditional curricula, political education and, according to some critics, ideological indoctrination and paramilitary training. This requirement was abandoned after the transition to multiparty rule and the organisation was eventually abolished entirely. Critics of the René regime also call out perceived corruption and cronyism in his term.|$|E

Group concerns include education, <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> centralization of power, and the group supports regional autonomy and grass roots organizing. Members regard unsanctioned rallies as a core principle, saying that authorities do not see rallies that they have sanctioned as a threat and simply ignore them. For this reason, all of Pussy Riot's performances were illegal and used co-opted public space.

500|$|The {{importance}} of antibodies in <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> biotechnology industry demands {{knowledge of their}} structures at high resolution. This information is used for protein engineering, modifying the antigen binding affinity, and identifying an epitope, of a given antibody. X-ray crystallography is one commonly used method for determining antibody structures. However, crystallizing an antibody is often laborious and time-consuming. Computational approaches provide a cheaper and faster alternative to crystallography, but their results are more equivocal, since they do not produce empirical structures. Online web servers such as Web Antibody Modeling (WAM) [...] and Prediction of Immunoglobulin Structure (PIGS) [...] enables computational modeling of antibody variable regions. Rosetta Antibody is a novel antibody FV region structure prediction server, which incorporates sophisticated techniques to minimize CDR loops and optimize the relative orientation of the light and heavy chains, as well as homology models that predict successful docking of antibodies with their unique antigen.|$|E
