40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the world’s remaining dugongs (Dugong dugon) occur off northern Australia where they face various anthropogenic impacts. Here, we investigate the viability of two dugong meta-populations under varying regimes of indigenous hunting. We construct population viability analyses (PVAs) using the computer package VORTEX and published estimates of population sizes and hunting rates. In Torres Strait between Cape York and New Guinea, our models predict severe and imminent reductions in dugong numbers. Our ‘optimistic’ and ‘pessimistic’ models suggest median times for quasi-extinction of 123 and 42 years, respectively. Extinction probabilities are also high for eastern Cape York Peninsula. We demonstrate the <b>inadequacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> when harvest rates in neighbouring areas are high, identify the maximum harvest rates for meta-population stability and emphasise the urgent need for indigenous community involvement in management to establish sustainable rates of dugong harvest in these regions...|$|E

This study highlights {{the application of}} ammonium bicarbonate (NH 4 HCO 3) as supplementation assuring nitrogenous resource and buffering requisite. To investigate the role of NH 4 HCO 3 on the anaerobic degradation, a sequence of concentration up to 40 mg L- 1 was observed. The outcome was assessed {{on the basis of}} biogas evolved. The investigation revealed that 10 mg L- 1 was the optimal without distressing methanogenesis. Likewise, mathematical calculation clarified that this optimum dosing can boost biogas yield up to 27. 77 % likened to control PWW degradation. Outcomes exposed an apparent commercial benefit to make the industrial application viable...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho analisa a manutenção de reservas ótimas precaucionais no pais. As distintas medidas de adequação e as simulações produzidas oferecem a mesma inferência sobre a inadequação dos estoques de reservas brasileiras, mantidos em níveis aparentemente excessivos a partir de 2008. O exercício econométrico modelo de correção de erros vetorial (VEC) também não provê muito suporte à afirmação de que acumular níveis altos de reservas seja fortemente significante na determinação do risco-soberano e dos custos de financiamento extemo da economia, {{inclusive}} não reduzindo a volatilidade da taxa de câmbio. Por sua vez, identificam-se custos fiscais não negligenciáveis derivados da politica de esterilização. This paper analyses {{the maintenance}} <b>of</b> precautionary <b>reserve</b> holdings in Brazil, investigating three interrelated issues thing one optimization process, an econometric {{model of the}} expected effects of this strategy and on a cost-benefit analysis the optimal level for international reserves is estimated. different adequacy measures and model-based simulations offer the same inference about the <b>inadequacy</b> <b>of</b> the Brazilian <b>reserve</b> holdings, which have been maintained at excessive levels since 2008 furthermore, the econometric exercise does not provide much support tor the claim that accumulating high levels <b>of</b> <b>reserves</b> is highly significant in determining sovereign risk and the nation's extemal funding costs, as well as showing that reserves do no reduce exchange rale volatil ity.

40|$|A useful {{theoretical}} {{approach in the}} literature for those trying to conserve forest biodiversity involves a number of strategies to achieve maintenance of habitat for different species across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This approach emphasises the importance of implementing measures in off-reserve areas to complement reserve systems. This contrasts with both the traditional ‘set-aside’ approach to conservation and the primary aim of production forestry. Translating this risk-spreading approach into on-ground practice is often a difficult task. Using the conservation management of habitat for hollow-using fauna in Tasmania's production forests as a case study, we explore the issues associated with adopting the theory and applying it to on-ground practice. The approach that has evolved is evaluated {{in terms of the}} strategies proposed in the literature. The <b>inadequacy</b> <b>of</b> the existing <b>reserve</b> system in Tasmania to fully cater for the conservation of threatened hollow-users, problems associated with the current ‘off-reserve’ measures, impediments to effective implementation and the use of an adaptive management framework are highlighted. We provide some practical considerations to guide more effective implementation. This includes the development of measurable objectives, integration of conservation goals with silvicultural goals, development of clear and practical guidelines, effective training and communication programs {{and the development of a}} monitoring and an adaptive management process agreed to by all stakeholders. The ongoing success of such an approach depends on a high level of commitment by all involved to the overall goal of ecologically sustainable forestry...|$|R
