40|$|Among the {{important}} strategies in sustainable product development is by maintaining product recovery and prolonging product life which are {{highly dependent on}} the ease of disassembly. When considering the design for disassembly, there are many fastener-associated factors to be considered such as structural, disassembly process and the pre-disassembly process. There are very few designs for disassembly methods that support the selection of <b>fasteners</b> <b>for</b> design for disassembly (DfD) concepts. Most of the tools developed are more applicable during later stages of the design process when more product information is available. The process of selecting a <b>fastener</b> <b>for</b> its functional characteristics itself is often vague. Additionally, the requirements for disassemblability further complicate the process. This paper proposes {{the development of a}} multi-criteria decision making model to assist designers in selecting <b>fasteners</b> <b>for</b> DfD. PROMETHEE was used to build a decision-making model to help the designers in selecting the fasteners that could perform their intended functions with ease of disassembly. A design case study is described to reflect the usefulness of the fasteners selection model.
