5|$|The toxins in A.muscaria are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or {{finely diced}} and boiled in {{plentiful}} water until thoroughly cooked, {{it seems to}} be <b>detoxified.</b> Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread, the consumption of <b>detoxified</b> A.muscaria has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician Félix Archimède Pouchet was a populariser and advocate of A.muscaria consumption, comparing it to manioc, an important food source in tropical South America that must be <b>detoxified</b> before consumption.|$|E
5|$|The active {{constituents}} {{of this species}} are water-soluble, and boiling and then discarding the cooking water at least partly detoxifies A.muscaria. Drying may increase potency, as the process facilitates the conversion of ibotenic acid to the more potent muscimol. According to some sources, once <b>detoxified,</b> the mushroom becomes edible.|$|E
5|$|Boletus edulis {{is known}} to be able to {{tolerate}} and even thrive on soil that is contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as soil that might be found near metal smelters. The mushroom's resistance to heavy-metal toxicity is conferred by a biochemical called a phytochelatin—an oligopeptide whose production is induced after exposure to metal. Phytochelatins are chelating agents, capable of forming multiple bonds with the metal; in this state, the metal cannot normally react with other elements or ions and is stored in a <b>detoxified</b> form in the mushroom tissue.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{three new}} models were {{developed}} for efficacy testing of mycotoxin <b>detoxifying</b> agents {{in relation to}} recent European guidelines. In the first model, deoxynivalenol was given to broiler chickens as an intra-crop bolus together with a mycotoxin <b>detoxifying</b> agent in order to study the plasma concentration-time profile of deoxynivalenol. In the second model the same oral bolus was given, preceded by an oral bolus of mycotoxin <b>detoxifying</b> agent, {{to make sure the}} <b>detoxifying</b> agent was present in the whole intestinal tract when the mycotoxin was administered. In the third model, the mycotoxin <b>detoxifying</b> agent was mixed in the feed of broiler chickens, and after one week feeding, deoxynivalenol was given as an oral bolus. In order to evaluate the efficacy of these agents, plasma concentration-time profiles were set up and the main toxicokinetic parameters were compared. Two commercially available mycotoxin <b>detoxifying</b> agents were tested, but they were not able to lower the oral availability of deoxynivalenol. As a positive control, activated carbon was used. We showed that activated carbon significantly reduces the absorption and oral availability of deoxynivalenol in all three models. Therefore, it can be concluded that these models are able to demonstrate the efficacy of mycotoxin <b>detoxifying</b> agents in relation to EFSA guidelines...|$|R

50|$|In the literature, the <b>detoxifying</b> role of ADPRase is {{directly}} supported in E. coli cells. But in mammalian cells, {{there is only}} an indirect evidence linking ADPRase to a <b>detoxifying</b> role, and this comes from studies of the very specific rat liver ADPRibase-I by cytotoxic agents.|$|R
5|$|TCDD may in some {{conditions}} potentiate the carcinogenic {{effects of}} other compounds. An example is benzo(a)pyrene that is metabolized in two steps, oxidation and conjugation. Oxidation produces epoxide carcinogens that are rapidly <b>detoxified</b> by conjugation, but some molecules may {{escape to the}} nucleus of the cell and bind to DNA causing a mutation, resulting in cancer initiation. When TCDD increases the activity of oxidative enzymes more than conjugation enzymes, the epoxide intermediates may increase, increasing the possibility of cancer initiation. Thus a beneficial activation of detoxifying enzymes may lead to deleterious side effects.|$|E
5|$|Alcohol {{detoxification}} or 'detox' for alcoholics is {{an abrupt}} stop of alcohol drinking {{coupled with the}} substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be <b>detoxified</b> as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome {{as well as those}} who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are <b>detoxified</b> {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of pollutants and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic pollutants such as organochloride compounds.|$|E

25|$|NAPQI (N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine) is a toxic {{byproduct}} {{produced during}} the xenobiotic metabolism of the analgesic paracetamol (acetaminophen). It is normally produced only in small amounts, and then almost immediately <b>detoxified</b> in the liver.|$|E
25|$|However, {{under some}} {{conditions}} in which NAPQI is not effectively <b>detoxified</b> (usually in case of paracetamol overdose), it causes severe damage to the liver. This becomes apparent 3–4 days after ingestion and may result in death from fulminant liver failure several days after the overdose.|$|E
25|$|Inorganic arsenic and its compounds, upon {{entering}} the food chain, are progressively metabolised (<b>detoxified)</b> {{through a process of}} methylation. The methylation occurs through alternating reductive and oxidative methylation reactions, that is, reduction of pentavalent to trivalent arsenic followed by addition of a methyl group (CH3).|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} confirm the phytotoxicological basis for the {{ecological}} specialization of larval culicine fauna among different subalpine mosquito breeding sites, we compared the capability of six different Aedes larval taxa or populations of different ecological origin to <b>detoxify</b> dietary leaf litter originating from the environmental vegetation. Detoxification experiments were performed through in vitro digestion of a toxic leaf litter fraction using larval extracts as the enzymatic sources. Comparison of toxicological and <b>detoxifying</b> properties among the different larval samples indicates an association between their tolerance to leaf litter toxicants and their detoxification capability, which vary according to ecological origin. The fact that the <b>detoxifying</b> factor within the larval extracts {{appears to be a}} protein-like compound with a molecular weight bigger than 30 kDa suggests the possible involvement of <b>detoxifying</b> enzymes in larval tolerance to leaf litter toxicants. This is congruent with previous biochemical data that suggests the involvement of cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase and esterase activities in the detoxification process...|$|R
25|$|The Clinic {{sample was}} a group of 100 severe alcoholics who were <b>detoxified</b> at clinic in an urban, {{municipal}} hospital (Cambridge Hospital) in Massachusetts during the winter of 1971-1972.

This group was followed for 8 years to measure the effectiveness of the treatment.|$|E
25|$|Vaccine {{production}} techniques are evolving. Cultured mammalian cells {{are expected to}} become increasingly important, compared to conventional options such as chicken eggs, due to greater productivity and low incidence of problems with contamination. Recombination technology that produces genetically <b>detoxified</b> vaccine {{is expected to grow}} in popularity for the production of bacterial vaccines that use toxoids. Combination vaccines are expected to reduce the quantities of antigens they contain, and thereby decrease undesirable interactions, by using pathogen-associated molecular patterns.|$|E
25|$|The Afton {{community}} of Warren County, North Carolina {{is one of}} the most prominent environmental injustice cases and is often pointed to as the roots of the environmental justice movement. PCB's were illegally dumped into the community and then it eventually became a PCB landfill. Community leaders pressed the state for the site to be cleaned up for an entire decade until it was finally <b>detoxified.</b> However, this decontamination did not return the site to its pre-1982 conditions. There has been a call for reparations to the community which has not yet been met.|$|E

25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. These adverse effects {{are believed to be}} due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been <b>detoxified</b> multiple times but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior detox. Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears {{to be the most important}} factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|Acrylamide is {{considered}} a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to acrylamide causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. Acrylamide is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; {{the highest levels of}} acrylamide post-exposure are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. Acrylamide can metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a genotoxic metabolite, glycidamide, which {{is considered}} to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of acrylamide. On the other hand, acrylamide and glycidamide can be <b>detoxified</b> via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and isomeric glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. Acrylamide has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm.|$|E
500|$|When {{taken in}} normal {{therapeutic}} doses, paracetamol {{has been shown}} to be safe. Following a therapeutic dose, it is mostly converted to nontoxic metabolites via Phase II metabolism by conjugation with sulfate and glucuronide, with a small portion being oxidized via the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. Cytochromes [...] and 3A4 convert approximately 5% of paracetamol to a highly reactive intermediary metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). Under normal conditions, NAPQI is <b>detoxified</b> by conjugation with glutathione to form cysteine and mercapturic acid conjugates.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{ability of}} {{mosquito}} larvae to tolerate toxic compounds (temephos, Bacillus thuringiensis var. israelensis, toxic vegetable leaf litter) was examined on a laboratory larval strain of Aedes aegypti L. Bioassays and <b>detoxifying</b> enzyme activity measurements {{were performed to}} compare tolerance/resistance capacities. The possibility of a functional plasticity of <b>detoxifying</b> equipment was investigated through experimental determination of the inductive effect of each xenobiotic within a given generation. In the same way, the selective effect of a toxic leaf litter was also investigated along successive generations. Results revealed that differential cytochrome P 450 monooxygenase, esterase, and glutathione S-transferase activity levels correlated with the bioassay results. Both induction and selection increased larval tolerance to the xenobiotics used and increased the levels of larval <b>detoxifying</b> enzyme activities...|$|R
