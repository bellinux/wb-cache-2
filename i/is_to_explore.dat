5|$|Adventure is a {{video game}} for the Atari 2600 video game console, {{released}} in late –. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice {{and return it to}} the golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons that can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around the game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to console games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens and enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.|$|E
5|$|Europa Clipper — In July 2013 {{an updated}} concept for a flyby Europa mission called Europa Clipper was {{presented}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). In May 2015, NASA announced that it had accepted development of the Europa Clipper mission, and revealed the instruments it will use. The aim of Europa Clipper <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> Europa in order to investigate its habitability, and to aid selecting sites for a future lander. The Europa Clipper would not orbit Europa, but instead orbit Jupiter and conduct 45 low-altitude flybys of Europa during its envisioned mission. The probe would carry an ice-penetrating radar, short-wave infrared spectrometer, topographical imager, and an ion- and neutral-mass spectrometer.|$|E
5|$|While {{progressing}} {{through the}} game, the player can {{take control of}} three different characters: Juno, Vela, and Lupus. Each character has a special ability {{that allows them to}} uncover areas which the other characters cannot reach. Juno can walk through magma safely, Vela can swim underwater indefinitely, and Lupus can hover {{for a short period of}} time. Therefore, choosing the right character for the right stage is critical in order to complete the game. Initially, the game forces the player to use the three characters individually until they reach a meeting point. Once they reach the meeting point, all of the worlds can be tackled with any character in any order. The overall objective of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> all the galaxy to collect several starship parts and save a large number of survivors. The player can then use a starship and travel to the final stage.|$|E

50|$|In 1736, three {{different}} survey expeditions were organized {{with all three}} having representatives of both the Colony of Virginia and of Lord Fairfax. One party <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> and map the Potomac to its head; this included Major William Mayo and Mr Brookes for the Colony (and King) and Mr Winslow and John Savage for Fairfax. A second party <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> and map the North Branch of the Rappahannock (Mr Wood, Mr Thomas, Jr) and the final party <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> and map the South Branches (Rapidan and Conway Rivers) of the Rappahannock (Mr Graeme, Mr Thomas, Sr). All parties consisted of surveyors and commissioners and their works were completed in all three cases.|$|R
5|$|Portal 2 is a first-person {{perspective}} puzzle game. The Player {{takes the}} role of Chell in the single-player campaign, as one of two robotsAtlas and P-Bodyin the cooperative campaign, or as a simplistic humanoid icon in community-developed puzzles. These four characters can explore and interact with the environment. Characters can withstand limited damage but will die after sustained injury. There is no penalty for falling onto a solid surface, but falling into bottomless pits or toxic pools kills the player character immediately. When Chell dies in the single-player game, the game restarts from a recent checkpoint; in the cooperative game, the robot respawns shortly afterwards without restarting the puzzle. The goal of both campaigns <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the Aperture Science Laboratory—a complicated, malleable mechanized maze. While most of the game takes place in modular test chambers with clearly defined entrances and exits, other parts occur in behind-the-scenes areas where the objective is less clear.|$|E
5|$|Swords and Sorcery is {{presented}} in a first person top-down perspective and contains elements of dungeon crawling, a common trait of role playing video games. The game {{is set in a}} fictional land called Zob, in which he main objective <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> its catacombs and discover a large wealth of treasure, alongside collecting seven pieces of sacred Zob armour. The game begins with allowing the player to choose their player-character; the default protagonist is called Flubbit the Dull, however there is an option to allow the player to create and personalise their own character. Once a character has been created, a 14 in-game day training scheme will commence which gives the player an opportunity to improve their abilities such as lock picking, sword fighting and thieving. An in-game armoury is also accessible at any time, which includes utilities such as body armour and various weaponry. The form of currency in the game is dragon's teeth, which can be used to purchase items and equipment.|$|E

25|$|The aim of {{the project}} then <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the use of {{touchless}} interaction within surgical settings, allowing images to be viewed, controlled and manipulated without contact {{through the use of}} camera-based gesture recognition technology. In particular, the project seeks to understand the challenges of these environments for the design and deployment of such systems, as well as articulate the ways in which these technologies may alter surgical practice. While our primary concerns here are with maintaining conditions of asepsis, the use of these touchless gesture-based technologies offers other potential uses.|$|E

He said that DRDO is currently doing feasibility study of utilising the fighter aircraft's digital cockpit & weapons management systems. It can be assumed that this planned FMBT would have a fully automatic turret, larger ammunition storage, V-hull and smaller dimensions. Driver and Commander role would be retained for the 2 crews planned, with duplicated controls, with the Gunner/Loader roles completely automated.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of ITER {{emphasize}} {{that the only way}} to test ideas for withstanding the intense neutron flux is to experimentally subject materials to that flux, which is one of the primary missions of ITER and the IFMIF, and both facilities will be vitally important to that effort. The purpose of ITER <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the scientific and engineering questions that surround potential fusion power stations. It is nearly impossible to acquire satisfactory data for the properties of materials expected to be subject to an intense neutron flux, and burning plasmas are expected to have quite different properties from externally heated plasmas. Supporters contend that the answer to these questions requires the ITER experiment, especially in the light of the monumental potential benefits.|$|E

40|$|THESIS 8526 This thesis {{reports the}} {{findings}} of an exploratory study {{on the nature of}} sentencing in the District and Circuit Courts in Ireland. At the time of this study, two key claims had been made about sentencing in Ireland. Firstly, Irish judges exercise a very broad sentencing discretion, and it has been claimed that this results in widespread inconsistencies. Secondly, it has been claimed that Irish judges use prison excessively, especially for minor offences, and that this is caused by judicial punitiveness and by reluctance to use altematives to prison. The purpose of this thesis <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the nature of sentencing in Ireland in the context of these claims. Drawing from {{the findings of}} previous research, this thesis was guided by four main research objectives. The first objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> judicial views on crime, sentencing, and punishment. The second and third objectives <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the degree of consistency in sentencing and the reasons for inconsistency, if found. The fourth objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the degree of punitiveness, if any, in Irish sentencing practices. Two research methods traditionally used in sentencing research, semi-structured interviews and sentencing vignettes, were chosen. Semi-structured interviews <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the views of District and Circuit Court judges on crime, sentencing, punishment {{and the role of the}} courts in combating crime. Sentencing vignettes <b>were</b> used <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the degree of consistency, the reasons for inconsistency, if found, and the degree of punitiveness, if any, in the sentencing practices of District and Circuit Court judges. More than one quarter of all District and Circuit Court judges participated in this research...|$|R

500|$|The Cottage {{is set in}} {{a surreal}} {{environment}} in the Småland province in Sweden, and begins on the pier of a lake, outside a cottage surrounded by a deep forest and waterfalls. The cottage is larger on the inside than the outside, and has nine underground levels. The player is able to move in four cardinal directions and perform actions by typing simple commands, such as [...] "North", [...] "Left" [...] and [...] "Take ball". Their aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the cottage and its surroundings to find and collect items. The inside of the cottage includes obstacles such as trapdoors the player can fall through and robbers who can steal the player's valuables, while the cottage's surroundings include [...] "mysterious creatures" [...] that the player can encounter.|$|E

While {{the rest of the}} world dismiss them as monstrous figments of their imaginations and elements of childhood nightmares, Magnus realizes that they are the world's triumphs and mistakes. Magnus hence becomes their protector, but in some cases, their captor. She is also described as [...] "bold and straightforward, brave and no-nonsense, yet she remains proudly true to her formal Victorian English sensibilities". Portraying actress Amanda Tapping described Magnus as a [...] "crazy character" [...] who is [...] "very eccentric and very sexy and very unapologetic".|$|E

500|$|Players {{create their}} own avatars when {{beginning}} the game. Different skin tones, facial features, clothing, and hairstyles are available for customizing these player representations. Players also receive a special linking book, a volume {{that serves as a}} portal to a personal world or Age, known as Relto. The main objective of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> and restore power to other Ages; players must also find seven [...] "journey cloths". These cloths serve as save points in lieu of a game-saving option; characters are transported to the last cloth they touched when they restart. As in previous Myst games, player characters cannot die. For example, falling off a cliff sends characters back to Relto. The personal Age serves as a hub in Uru, containing a bookshelf with linking books to Ages players have explored, as well as avatar customization options and game information.|$|E
500|$|Concerns {{were noted}} during the {{construction}} of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which began operations in 2008, is the world's largest and highest-energy particle accelerator complex, intended to collide opposing beams of either protons or lead nuclei with very high kinetic energy. It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva, in Switzerland. The LHC's main purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the validity and limitations of the Standard Model, the current theoretical picture for particle physics. The first particle collisions at the LHC took place shortly after startup in November 2009, at energies up to [...] per beam. On 30 March 2010, the first planned collisions took place between two 3.5 TeV beams, which set another new world record for the highest energy man-made particle collisions. In 2012 the beam energy was increased to 4 TeV, after upgrades in 2013 and 2014 collisions in 2015 and 2016 happened at an energy of 6.5 TeV per proton.|$|E
500|$|Moreno is also {{credited}} for founding sociodrama. [...] Though sociodrama, like psychodrama, utilizes {{the theatrical}} form as means of therapy, the terms are not synonymous. [...] While psychodrama focuses on one patient {{within the group}} unit, Sociodrama addresses {{the group as a}} whole. [...] The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> social events, collective ideologies, and community patterns within a group in order to bring about positive change or transformation within the group dynamic. Moreno also believed that sociodrama {{could be used as a}} form of micro-sociologythat by examining the dynamic of a small group of individuals, patterns could be discovered that manifest themselves within the society as a whole, such as in Alcoholics Anonymous. [...] Sociodrama can be divided into three main categories: crisis sociodrama, which deals with group responses after a catastrophic event, political sociodrama, which attempts to address stratification and inequality issues within a society, and diversity sociodrama, which considers conflicts based on prejudice, racism or stigmatization.|$|E
