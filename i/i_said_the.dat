In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that I had ever seen in all my travels and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E

"Towards {{the end of}} last season, where <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} {{felt that}} way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Olivier's contemporaries at {{the school}} was Peggy Ashcroft, who {{observed}} he was [...] "rather uncouth in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun". By his own admission, {{he was not a}} very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis Casson, as a bit-part player, understudy and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du Maurier, of whom he said, [...] "He seemed to mutter on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du Maurier that no one ever heard a word <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>The</b> Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible hams like Frank Benson." [...] His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called [...] "singing" [...] Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery.|$|E
500|$|With three races {{remaining}} in the Championship and a fourteen-point advantage, Webber said he would continue his pursuit of the title; [...] "I need to keep racing hard and going for victories. Clearly, if my rivals have a rough weekend {{it makes it a}} bit harder for them and it gives me a bit more scope, but I'm not looking to abuse that because it can all go pear-shaped very fast." [...] Vettel said his season had been fraught with car problems but he remained positive about his chances; [...] "I think it's normal to have ups and downs – and sometimes you have more, sometimes less – but, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> expectation was probably {{to be in a position}} to fight for the championship and I think we're in a very strong and very good position." [...] Alonso urged his teammate Massa to help him in his title bid and said the Korean Grand Prix could become [...] "decisive" [...] for his championship rivals. He favoured Hamilton to win the Korean Grand Prix. With Hamilton twenty-eight points behind Webber and with Button a further three points behind his teammate, McLaren's team principal Martin Whitmarsh said his drivers would keep their focus in the season's remaining three races and produce consistent performances. Karun Chandhok, who raced for Hispania in the first ten races of the season, said Red Bull were the favourites to win, and that he thought the circuit's three long straights would suit the McLaren cars.|$|E

500|$|The Dark Knight was {{nominated}} for eight Academy Awards for the 81st Ceremony, breaking the previous record of seven held by Dick Tracy for the most nominations received by a film based on a comic book, comic strip, or graphic novel. The Dark Knight won two awards: Best Supporting Actor for Heath Ledger and Best Sound Editing. It was additionally nominated for six others, these being Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Sound Mixing, Best Visual Effects, Best Makeup, and Best Film Editing. Heath Ledger was the first posthumous winner of the Best Supporting Actor award, and only the second posthumous acting winner ever (Peter Finch posthumously won the Best Actor award for his performance in the 1976 film Network). In addition, Ledger's win marked the first win {{in any of the}} major Oscar categories (producing, directing, acting, or writing) for a superhero-based film. Notably, Richard King's win in the Sound Editing category blocked a complete awards sweep of the evening by the eventual Best Picture winner, Slumdog Millionaire. Although it did not receive a Best Picture nomination, the show's opening song paid homage to The Dark Knight along with the five Best Picture nominees, including host Hugh Jackman riding on a mockup of the Batpod made out of garbage. In spite of the film's critical success, the film was noticeably absent from the Best Picture nominee list, prompting controversy and led many to criticize the Academy Awards for [...] "snubbing" [...] the film. There was speculation that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences later changed their number of Best Picture nominees to ten, instead of the traditional five, because of the film's omission. In a question-and-answer session that followed the announcement, the Academy's then president Sidney Ganis said; [...] "I would not be telling you the truth if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> words Dark Knight did not come up." ...|$|E

Yorke wrote on Radiohead's site that [...] "I {{have no intention of}} being used by spider spin doctors {{to make it look like}} we make progress when it is just words", and told the NME that Blair had [...] "no environmental credentials as far as I'm concerned." [...] He told the Guardian that Blair's advisers had [...] "wanted pre-meetings. They wanted to know that I was on-side. Also, I was being manoeuvred into a position where if <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> wrong thing post-the meeting, Friends of the Earth would lose their access.

2500|$|Frazier won the MVP {{award for}} his 34-18 victory in the East-West Shrine Game, nationally {{televised}} on ESPN on January 13, 1996. West Coach Terry Donahue {{said there was no}} doubt that Frazier's performance had improved his standing in regards to the NFL draft. [...] "I think he came here with all kinds of doubts...this game really helped him and somebody is going to invest in him. I am really high on him. [...] When I did the Fiesta Bowl, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> guy was the most dangerous player in college football and I mean it more now. This guy's dangerous. He's great." [...] Frazier completed 11 of 20 passes for 163 yards, rushed six times for 33 yards, scored on a five-yard run, and threw a 52-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Jordan with 5:57 left in the contest.|$|E
2500|$|... ou {{know that}} Berio used The Raw and the Cooked in his Sinfonia. A {{part of the}} text is recited, {{accompanied}} by the music. I admit that I did not grasp {{the reason for this}} choice. During an interview a musicologist asked me about it, and I answered that the book had just come out and the composer had probably used it because it was at hand. Now, a few months ago Berio, whom I don't know, sent me a very disgruntled letter. He had read the interview, several years after the fact, and assured me that the movement of this symphony offered the musical counterpart of the mythical transformation I was revealing. He included a book by a musicologist [...] who had demonstrated the fact. I apologized for the misunderstanding, which was, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> result of my lack of musical training, but I'm still baffled.|$|E
2500|$|Thus {{began his}} {{transition}} into the brash, bombastic manager [...] "Captain" [...] Lou Albano. With a quick wit and a grating personality, Albano delivered memorable promos and earned the scorn of the wrestling audience as {{he attempted to}} dethrone World Wide Wrestling Federation superstar and WWWF World Heavyweight Champion Bruno Sammartino. Albano described the strategy behind his overblown, ranting interview style: [...] "I just remember the point I wanna bring across, and then I just babble before, during, and after. [...] Somehow, in the middle, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> two or three sentences that sold tickets. [...] Mostly, I just tried to make {{people want to see}} me get my ass kicked, and along the way, hopefully the guy I was managing would catch a beating too!" [...] Growing out his hair and beard, and packing on extra pounds, Albano gave the image of a wild man. He developed a later trademark, applying rubber bands to his beard, after having seen a homeless man do the same. He also often wore a rubber band hanging from a safety pin pushed through his cheek.|$|E

2500|$|As Marla Heasley recounts in Bring Back... The A-Team (May 18, 2006), {{although}} sexism was not prevalent {{on the set}} per se, {{there was}} a sense that a female character was not necessary on the show. On her first day on set George Peppard took her aside and told her [...] "We don't want you on the show. None of the guys want you here. The only reason you're here is because the network and the producers want you. For some reason they think they need a girl." [...] The interview continues with Heasley noting that on her last day of work Peppard took her aside again, saying: [...] "I'm sorry that this is your last day, but remember what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> very first day, that we didn't want a girl, has nothing to do with you. You were very professional, but no reason to have a girl." [...] In Bring Back... the A-Team, Dirk Benedict also remarked that: [...] "It was a guy's show. It was male driven. It was written by guys. It was directed by guys. It was acted by guys. It's about what guys do. We talked the way guys talked. We were the boss. We were the God. We smoked when we wanted. We shot guns when we wanted. We kissed the girls and made them cry... when we wanted. It was the last truly masculine show." ...|$|E
2500|$|Blue Horse {{invariably}} dined with Burbank at {{noon and}} {{always had a}} good appetite. One day, after dinner, Burbank said to Blue Horse: [...] "I notice that you always eat everything in front of you, but you never pass your plate back the second time or ask for another cup of coffee. Why is that? Is it because you cannot eat any more or drink any more coffee. O, yes, he replied, I could eat more, but I thought the twenty-five cents you paid for my dinner was for just what was placed before me. No, <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> twenty-five cents pays for all you can eat. Hereafter, if one plate is not enough, ask for more, and drink all the coffee you want. All right, he replied, I will. And he did. I also told him to tell his friends this, and suggested that if any white men sitting at his table left anything to eat on their plates before them, {{that it would be}} all right for him to gather it up and take it home for his wife and children. It is needless to say that all the Sioux Indians who patronized that hotel afterward got all that was coming to them.” One time Blue Horse was in the Indian trader's store with his little niece, who saw something on the shelves that she very much wanted. Blue Horse had no money, so he took off his old moccasins and gave them to the Indian trader in exchange for what the little girl craved and he walked home barefooted.|$|E
2500|$|Tony helps Gabby {{when she}} is run over. Pickard {{revealed}} that [...] "It's {{love at first sight}} for Tony" [...] when sees Gabby. On how the characters meet, Oruche explained: [...] "She's walking down the street minding her own business. She comes across Tony, he looks at her and says something to her but she doesn't answer him. He thinks she's rude [...] She gets hit by a car [...] he then helps her. She's a woman lying in the gutter so he helps her. [...] he comes to the hospital to meet my children [...] Basically I have no help and I'm unconscious so he has to help me..." [...] Pickard added that Gabby asks him to look after her children, Taylor (Shaun Blackstock) and Amber (Lydia Lloyd-Henry), which he takes as an indication she may feel the same. Oruche explained that while her character is hospitalised Tony and Gabby are [...] "getting used to spending time with each other". Pickard revealed that Tony would become [...] "embroiled in the drama of [...] life". Tony discovers Gabby, like Tony, is married but [...] "like Tony, she's not happy". Pickard revealed that when Gabby's husband, Phil (Andonis Anthony), returns Gabby will be too scared to leave him for Tony. Oruche also spoke of Phil's return, saying that Gabby and Tony [...] "want to spend their lives together but like <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> husband comes back. She's not in any fit state to go through separating with somebody". Tony and Gabby have a brief relationship before she leaves Hollyoaks village.|$|E
