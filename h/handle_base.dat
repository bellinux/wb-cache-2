50|$|The {{extension}} of the DE 1 freeway south through Dover Air Force Base was constructed later than the Dover to Smyrna segment due {{to the need to}} coordinate negotiations with the military installation and to allow the base to remediate hazardous material sites, maintain security and access restrictions with construction of a new main gate, and reconstruct base housing {{on the west side of}} the highway. Construction of an interchange at the Dover Air Force Base main gate commenced in February 1996. This project resulted in the relocation of the main gate further back in order to build the interchange and the overpass linking the main gate to base housing. This construction resulted in facilities having to be constructed at the north gate in order to be able to <b>handle</b> <b>base</b> traffic. In May of that year, groundbreaking took place for the DE 1 toll road between Odessa and St. Georges. The first contract of the Dover Air Force Base main gate interchange was completed in December 1998, with the second contract beginning in March 1999. The segment of DE 1 between US 13 south of Odessa and US 13 in St. Georges opened in November 1999. DE 1 was subsequently rerouted off US 13 between those two points.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the power control problem in CDMA {{wireless}} data {{networks in the}} analytical setting of non-cooperative game theory. User satisfaction is represented as a net utility function, which is the difference of a strictly concave function, based on signal to interference ratio, and a cost term on user's power. A detailed analysis for the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibrium for the above non-cooperative game is presented. Next, a decentralized power control algorithm is developed which converges to the Nash Equilibrium, as demonstrated by both analytical and simulation methods. The framework is then extended to the multi-cell case, making user utilities depend on base-station assignment as well as powers. We propose a generalized algorithm that can <b>handle</b> <b>base</b> station assignment and hand-off, as well as power control, and study by extensive simulations its performance in a dynamic environment...|$|E
40|$|The biodynamic {{response}} {{method is}} increasingly {{being used to}} study the human hand-arm system and vibration-induced injuries that affect the hand. Most measurements {{are made in the}} dominant forearm direction of excitation, but recently research has turned to multi-axis measurements as well as excitation. This study looks at a new instrument handle that measures the biodynamic responses at the palm and the fingers concurrently and in multiple directions. Besides the biodynamic response, the sensors inside the handle are able to measure the push and grip forces simultaneously and therefore remove the need for an additional force plate or force sensor at the <b>handle</b> <b>base.</b> The apparent mass of the handle was measured {{in order to determine the}} usable frequency range of the system. Additionally, the apparent mass distribution along the hand was investigated and it was found that the apparent mass distribution along the hand varies with frequency...|$|E
30|$|The {{depletion}} of wireless spectrum resources {{is well documented}} in the literature. In a work by Staple and Werbach [1], the authors discussed {{the current status of}} the frequency spectrum. In addition, they also reported on current efforts {{to solve the problem of}} spectrum scarcity. One of the most recent efforts involves the use of software-defined radios with sensing capabilities, called cognitive radio. Mitola and Maguire [5] published a paper on cognitive radio in 1999, but it has only recently won attention by researchers as a viable solution to improving spectrum efficiency. A number of studies have been conducted to quantify the benefits of using cognitive radios. Srinivasa and Jafar [14] carried out a theoretical study on the throughput potential of cognitive radios using different cognitive perspectives. Several studies [15, 16] have also proposed architectures and applications for cognitive radios. The focus of these works was primarily on to how to <b>handle</b> <b>base</b> station hand-offs and decision mechanisms. In addition, research on spectrum management [6, 17, 18], power control [19], and node coordination [18] has been reported. In most of these works, the formulations are conducted for the spectrum configuration only. Fully-cognitive radios have generally not been addressed in recent works. Also, the coexistence of several cognitive radios has received little attention as compared to the minimization of interference to primary clients. Although several studies have concentrated on the interference contributions [20, 21], most either focus on cognitive radios or on primary client interference. These two concerns are addressed in our paper along with throughput improvement and coverage. Femtocell architecture [8, 22, 23] has been used to mitigate the noise in cognitive radio communications. Research on femtocells has shown that they are limited by the amount of usable bandwidth in a small area [8, 22]. However, most studies assume that adjacent FBSs would not interfere with each other. This assumption is valid for a moderately dense network. On the other hand, for a dense network, interference is unavoidable. This paper merges the cognitive capabilities with a femtocell architecture to mitigate this drawback. The assumption of noninterfering base stations can now be validated even for the case of dense networks.|$|E

40|$|Instrumented handles or dynamometers {{are widely}} used to measure hand forces and/or the biodynamic {{response}} of hand-arm system. To study hand-transmitted vibration exposure, six generations of instrument handles were constructed or initially developed by researchers in ECTB/HELD/NIOSH. This presentation provided a summary of these handles. Their basic characteristics, limitations, and usefulness are described, which may help their appropriate applications and further improvements. Six Designs of Instrumented Handles Handle 1 : The conceptual design is recommended in ISO 10819 (1996) 1 for glove test. The grip force is measured by detecting bending strains on a measuring beam in the handle. A special handle fixture was designed to connect the handle to a shaker. Except the screws, the handle and fixture were made from aluminum. Handle 2 : The design {{is based on the}} principle of shear strain measurement. 2 - 3 Both grip and push forces can be measured simultaneously using this handle. This handle was directly designed for a simulated vibrating tool. Handle 3 : This design is basically composed of a <b>handle</b> <b>base,</b> a measuring cap, and two charge-based sensors (Kistler 9212) sandwiched between the base and cap. The handle was also made from aluminum. The fixture for Handle 1 was also used with this handle. This generation of handle has three different handle diameters (30, 40, and 50 mm). 4 Handle 4 : This design is an improvement from Handle 3. The handle fixture was totally redesigned and it was much stiffer than the previous one. The aluminum measuring cap was replaced with a magnesium cap. Handle 5 : The basic structure of this handle is the same as that for Handle 3. However, the piezoelectric sensors were replaced with two strain gage based sensors (Interface SML- 50). Handle 6 : This handle includes two measuring caps, four piezoelectric sensors, and a handle centre base. The handle fixture was the same as that with Handle 4. Methods for Handle Examinations The static and dynamic characterizations were performed using the methods reported by Dong et al. 5 - 6 Results and Discussion Handle 1 : The static force measurement depended on the hand grip location on the handle. Its natural frequency was less than 200 Hz. 5, 6 Because the transmissibility of gloves may not vary significantly with the applied grip force, this handle may be acceptable for glove test. However, the force measurements with this handle may not be reliable. Handle 2 : The static force measured with this handle was insensitive to the hand acting location. However, when the handle was vibrating, the force signals could be totally distorted. For this reason, it was not used for vibration studies...|$|E
