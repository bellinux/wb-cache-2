I see men in social, {{in economic}} and {{in international affairs}} alike, eager {{to put an end}} to conflict, inexpressibly weary of conflict and the waste and pain and death it involves. But to end conflict one must abandon aggressive or uncordial pretensions.

But how can they end any of these clashes except by the <b>definition</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> of a common end which will establish a standard for the trial of every conceivable issue, to which, that is, every other issue can be subordinated; and what common end can there be in all the world except this idea of the world kingdom of God?

We need a standard so universal that the platelayer may say to the barrister or the duchess, or the Red Indian to the Limehouse sailor, or the Anzac soldier to the Sinn Feiner or the Chinaman, [...] "What are we two doing for it?" [...] And to fill the place of that [...] "it," [...] no other idea is great enough or commanding enough, but only the world kingdom of God.|$|E

His extensive knowledge of the area's soils and climate was augmented {{by the research of}} Californian Professor Harold Olmo in 1955 during a government-sponsored trip to Western Australia. Olmo spent eight months in Western Australia at the invitation of the Western Australian Vine Fruits Research Trust, while on leave from his post as Professor of Viticulture at the University of California. When he published his report in 1956, one of the recommendations put forward was that Mount Barker and the Frankland area of Western Australia showed great promise for making table wines in the light traditional European style. This was further backed up by agricultural and viticultural scientist Dr John Gladstones in 1963, and endorsed by the Western Australian Grape Industry Committee (1964).A year later, Jamieson and Houghton's celebrated winemaker Jack Mann, went to Mount Barker and the first experimental cuttings were planted in 1965 at Forest Hill.|$|E

We investigate the impact of the <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> criteria for assets and liabilities in the existing CF and the DP. We conclude that, in areas where standards have diverged from the CF in the past, that is, not consistently applying probability thresholds, the DP supports the existing standards by removing those thresholds. Furthermore, the DP includes the more judgemental criteria of relevance and faithful representation to determine whether an item should be recognised as an asset or liability. This would justify those existing standards which currently do not recognise items that meet the (current <b>and</b> revised) <b>definitions</b> of asset or liability. Altogether, we conclude that the development of IFRSs will continue to be the outcome of professional debate, negotiation, consensus seeking and political influence. We therefore recommend that additional measures should be taken by the IASB to ensure coherence in the development and application of standards after implementation of a new CF...|$|R

40|$|Coma {{is defined}} as an altered state of {{consciousness}} from which arousal due to appropriate stimuli is not adequately achieved. Such a definition of the state of coma is plagued with semantic problems, and terminology describing various comatose states is vast and even more ambiguous when applied to the infant. Rather than using such terms as coma, semicoma, stupor, or obtundation, it is better to describe the physical state of the unresponsive patient. The description should include the patient’s appearance, movements either spontaneous or elicited from stimuli, the patient’s response to the stimulus, {{and the nature of the}} stimulus, whether voice, pressure, or pain. A detailed neurological description is not warranted when describing the comatose state, but it is appropriate to include whether or not respirations are spontaneous or supported, and the patient’s cardiovascular state. Pupillary size and activity should be included in the description of the stuporous patient. The comatose state of an infant may be much more difficult to recognize and is often confused with physiological sleep states. An infant is considered to be in a coma when there is no appropriate response to shaking, pinching, visual, or auditory stimuli. As with the older child, a detailed description of the state is necessary. More difficult to recognize in infants and children are the less severe forms of coma, especially since fluctuating metabolic situations with rapid changes can occur and the state of consciousness may change equally rapidly. Notwithstanding these difficulties of <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition,</b> a classification of coma in an infant and child is essential...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} {{financial}} reporting of long-lived assets. The author's {{aim was to}} analyze the approach of two major accounting principles - IAS/IFRS and US GAAP. Both of the principles address following issues: * initial <b>recognition</b> <b>and</b> measurement, * depreciation: allocation of capitalized costs over the useful life of the asset, * disposal of the asset. Broadly accepted classification of the long-lived assets divides the whole group into two parts: tangibles <b>and</b> intangibles. General <b>definitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>recognition</b> criteria are covered by the framework. Particular standards dial then with special matters. Although both international approaches {{have a lot in}} common, several differences emerge: * US GAAP do not allow to capitalize internally developed intangibles,however developed intangibles can be capitalized under special conditions according to IAS/IFRS; * impairment: IAS/IFRS allow to cancel or adjust the impairment towards the original value of the asset, US GAAP - once impairment is recognized, it is not permitted to cancel it and to return back to the original value of the asset; * IS /IFRS use historical costs based treatment and allowed alternative treatment - revaluation, US GAAP don't use allowed alternative treatment of the assets - revaluation is not permitted; 138 * IAS/IFRS set the useful life of the intangibles up to 20 years, US GAAP don't restrict the useful life at all. In the process of convergence of IAS/FRS and USGAAPquestions have arisen which of the approaches should be taken as a crucial one for world accounting principles.

However, the built heritage in smaller towns and cities in Malaysia have been relatively neglected and overlooked. In addition to the role in identity development of heritage sites, a physical built environment or more generally the place has not received adequate attention in built environment literature. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore heritage place inventory as an important conservation tool for establishing the value of places, ultimately leading to their legal protection. A survey was conducted in Kampung Kepayang, a small town in the state of Perak, Malaysia, to discover valuable background information of the identified historic resources through heritage place inventory. A total of 50 pre and post-war buildings of varying styles, values and uses were identified as unique characteristics that influence the distinctiveness of the town.

Plant macrofossil assemblages from elsewhere in interior Africa for this time interval are rare, but new work at Chilga in the northwestern Ethiopian Highlands documents forest communities at 28 Myr ago. Initial results indicate botanical affinities with lowland West African forest. The earliest known woodland community in tropical Africa is dated at 46 Myr ago in northern Tanzania, as documented by leaves and fruits from lake deposits. The community around the lake was dominated by caesalpinioid legumes, but included Acacia, for which this, to my knowledge, is the earliest record. This community is structurally similar to modern miombo, although it is different at the generic level.
