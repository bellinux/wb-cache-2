25|$|The Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> in {{the town}} of Abu Ghraib {{was one of the most}} notorious prisons in Iraq during the {{government}} of Saddam Hussein. The prison was used to hold approximately 50,000 men and women in poor conditions, and torture and execution were frequent. The prison was located on 280 acres of land 32 kilometers west of Baghdad. After the collapse of Saddam Hussein's government, the prison was looted and everything that was removable was carried away. Following the invasion, the U.S. army refurbished it and turned it into a military prison. It was the largest of several detention centers in Iraq used by the U.S. military. In March 2004, during the time that the U.S. military was using the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners.|$|E

40|$|In 1971, Philip Zimbardo {{conducted}} {{his famous}} prison experiment at Stanford University {{to examine the}} effects of situational variables on the behavior of volunteers engaged in roleplaying prisoners and guards. Thirty three years later, Zimbardo reacted to images of American military personnel engaged in sadistic acts at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> military <b>prison</b> in Iraq. Drawing a connection to the unexpected outcomes of his prison experiment, Zimbardo wrote The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. For Zimbardo, Lucifer is a quality embedded within all people making them susceptible to the evil forces of social systems and institutions. People engage in evil, whether street crime, prison brutality, or genocide as a consequence of being seduced or pushed into behaviors they would not ordinarily do. For Zimbardo, people are not evil, only systems and those who run the systems are evil. This paper argues that Zimbardo is wrong in his understanding of the nature of evil. As James Q. Wilson noted, Evil people exist. An alternative interpretation of the causes of violent crime, brutal acts by military personnel, and even Zimbardo s own psychologically-damaging experiment is offered to argue that evil exists and that evil forces can make evil people do evil things...|$|R
25|$|Male {{prisoners of}} war {{may be subject to}} rape and sexual {{violence}}. Sexual violence against male prisoners of the Iraq War gained wide publicity after graphic photos documented such abuses on male Iraqi prisoners by US guards at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison,</b> where prisoners were forced to humiliate themselves.|$|E

40|$|O presente trabalho busca mapear o caminho de constru??o de uma sociologia do mal atrav?s de uma cr?tica ?s constru??es pr?vias desse objeto na filosofia, na psicologia social de Stanley Milgram e Phillip Zimbardo e nas abordagens sociol?gicas de Zygmunt Bauman e Jeffrey Alexander. Dessa forma, ser?o discutidas as quest?es relacionadas ao mal como objeto socialmente constru?do e que cont?m a capacidade generativa de classificar simbolicamente a realidade social e as a??es humanas a partir das rela??es de forma??o dos sujeitos e das coletividades. Essa releitura do mal como objeto sociol?gico ser? substancialmente informada pela teoria disposicional da a??o de Pierre Bourdieu, atrav?s dos seus conceitos de habitus e libido social. Para tanto, o trabalho de constru??o do mal como problema emp?rico ser? feito atrav?s da an?lise das fotografias produzidas por soldados americanos na pris?o militar de Abu Ghraib no Iraque no ano de 2003. The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to delineate the trajectory of a sociology of evil through {{a critique of the}} concept as it appears in philosophical works, the social psychology of Stanley Milgram and Phillip Zimbardo, and the sociological approaches of Zygmunt Bauman and Jeffrey Alexander. Thus, evil will be considered as a socially constructed object, which contains a generative capacity of symbolically classifying social reality and human actions through formative relations of subjects and communities. This rereading of evil as a sociological object is fundamentally based on the dispositional action theory of Pierre Bourdieu, especially in regards to its concepts of habitus and social libido. As such, evil as an empirical problem will be considered through an analysis of the photographs taken by American soldiers in 2003 at the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> military <b>prison</b> in Iraq...|$|R
5000|$|During {{and after}} the {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, the U.S. captured numerous members of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. Rather than bringing the prisoners before domestic or international courts, Bush decided {{to set up a}} new system of military tribunals to try the prisoners. In order to avoid the restrictions of the United States Constitution, Bush held the prisoners in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp; because the camp is on territory that the U.S. technically leases from Cuba, individuals within the camp are not accorded the same constitutional protections that they would have on U.S. territory. Bush also decided that these [...] "enemy combatants" [...] were not entitled to all of the protections of the Geneva Conventions as they were not affiliated with states. While the administration established the camp at Guantanamo, it also authorized the creation of secret CIA prisons in various countries. In hopes of obtaining information from the prisoners, Bush allowed the use of [...] "enhanced interrogation techniques" [...] such as waterboarding. The treatment of prisoners at Abu <b>Ghraib,</b> a U.S. <b>prison</b> in Iraq, elicited widespread outrage after photos of prisoner abuse were made public. In 2005, Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act, which purported to ban torture, but in his signing statement Bush asserted that his executive power gave him the authority to waive the restrictions put in place by the bill. Bush's policies suffered a major rebuke from the Supreme Court in the 2006 case of Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, in which the court rejected Bush's use of military commissions without congressional approval and held that all detainees were protected by the Geneva Conventions. Following the ruling, Congress passed the Military Commissions Act of 2006, which effectively overturned Hamdan. The Supreme Court overturned a portion of that act in the 2008 case of Boumediene v. Bush, but the Guantanamo detention camp remained open at the end of Bush's presidency.|$|R
25|$|He was {{in command}} when {{the abuse of}} prisoners {{occurred}} most notably at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison.</b> Some have been {{highly critical of the}} U.S. military's failure to hold senior officers accountable, as blame for abuses at Abu Ghraib and other detention centers was placed only on a few individuals of the lowest rank.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> in Baghdad (Iraq) gained {{international}} notoriety for {{accounts of}} torture and abuses {{by members of the}} United States Army Reserve during the post-invasion period. Photographic images were circulated that exposed the posing of prisoners naked, sometimes bound, and being intimidated and otherwise humiliated, resulting in widespread condemnation of the abuse.|$|E
25|$|The use of dogs on prisoners by regular U.S. {{forces in}} Guantanamo Bay Naval Base was {{prohibited}} by Donald Rumsfeld in April 2003. A {{few months later}} following revelations of abuses at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison,</b> including use of dogs to terrify naked prisoners; Rumsfeld then issued a further order prohibiting their use by the regular U.S. forces in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Taguba was {{assigned}} to head an investigation into accusations of prisoner abuse in the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> in Iraq. Taguba became known worldwide when the Taguba Report, a classified, internal U.S. Army report on the investigation, was leaked {{to the public and}} published to national attention. The report was extremely critical of U.S. Army conduct and found widespread negligence and abuse.|$|E
25|$|Hersh first gained {{recognition}} in 1969 for exposing the My Lai Massacre and its cover-up during the Vietnam War, {{for which he}} received the 1970 Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting. In 2004, he notably reported on the US military's mistreatment of detainees at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison.</b> He has also won two National Magazine Awards and five George Polk Awards. In 2004, he received the George Orwell Award.|$|E
25|$|Taguba is {{best known}} for {{authoring}} the Taguba Report, an internal U.S. Army report on abuse of detainees held at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> in Iraq. The report was leaked, then published, in 2004. Taguba again made national headlines in June 2008 when he accused the Bush administration of committing war crimes in a preface to a report by Physicians for Human Rights on prisoner abuse and torture in American military prisons.|$|E
25|$|On 14 November 2006, the German {{attorney}} Wolfgang Kaleck {{filed the}} {{complaint with the}} German Federal Attorney General (Generalbundesanwalt) against Miller for his complicity in torture and other crimes against humanity at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kaleck was {{acting on behalf of}} 11 victims of torture and other human rights abuses, as well as about 30 human rights activists and organizations who are co-plaintiffs.|$|E
25|$|In March 2006, the U.S. {{military}} {{decided to}} transfer the 4,500 inmates to other prisons and transfer control of the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> to Iraqi authorities. The prison was reported emptied of prisoners in August 2006. The formal transfer was made on September 2, 2006.

25|$|Al-Zahedi, on {{the western}} {{outskirts}} of Baghdad - Secret graves near a civilian cemetery contain the remains of nearly 1,000 political prisoners. According to an eyewitness, 10 to 15 bodies arrived at a time from the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> and were buried by local civilians. An execution on 10 December 1999 in Abu Ghraib {{claimed the lives of}} 101 people in one day. On 9 March 2000, 58 prisoners were killed at a time. The last corpse interred was number 993.|$|E
25|$|He {{states that}} he joined the {{underground}} Zionist movement at age 14, without his parents' knowledge and was involved in underground activities. He was arrested and jailed by the Iraqi government in 1947, when he was 17 years old. During his two years in Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison,</b> he expected to be sentenced to death for smuggling Iraqi Jews {{out of the country}} to Iran, where they were then taken to Israel. He managed to escape from prison and travel to Israel, arriving in May 1950.|$|E
25|$|During {{the war in}} Iraq {{that began}} in March 2003, {{personnel}} of the United States Army and the Central Intelligence Agency committed a series of human rights violations against detainees in the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> in Iraq. These violations included physical and sexual abuse, torture, rape, sodomy, and murder. The abuses came to widespread public attention {{with the publication of}} photographs of the abuse by CBS News in April 2004. The incidents received widespread condemnation both within the United States and abroad, although the soldiers received support from some conservative media within the United States.|$|E
25|$|On April 8, 2005, Karpinski was {{formally}} relieved of {{command of the}} 800th Military Police Brigade. On May 5, 2005, President Bush approved Karpinski's demotion to Colonel from the rank of Brigadier General. Her demotion was not officially related to the abuse at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison.</b> The allegations against her were for dereliction of duty, making a material misrepresentation to investigators, failure to obey a lawful order and shoplifting. Military sources alleged that Karpinski had been arrested in 2002 on MacDill Air Force Base for stealing cosmetics, but Karpinski has denied the arrest took place.|$|E
25|$|After the United States invaded Iraq, {{she created}} the Occupation Watch Center in Baghdad {{to monitor the}} United States {{military}} and the war's effect on civilian populations. Through this center she brought Iraqi women to the United States {{to speak about the}} occupation, organized delegations of U.S. military family members to see the conditions of their children serving in Iraq, and documented United States abuses, including at Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> long before the scandal involving it broke in the United States media. She also organized medical aid delegations to Iraq to civilians harmed by the United States military.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the period}} of combat in March–April 2003, both protests and armed combat {{experienced}} a temporary decline in intensity. Protests against the war as a whole continued, often {{on the occasion of}} anniversaries of the war and visits by members of the Bush administration to foreign cities. Within the United States, general anti-war protests were joined by protests focusing on particular issues or strategies including: opposition to torture and abuse (such as that in the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison),</b> calls for withdrawal of members of the coalition from Iraq, counter-recruitment, support for military resisters such as Lt. Ehren Watada, and opposition to military and corporate contractors. The largest protests during this period have been national, multi-issue mobilizations such as those on August 30, 2004, and April 29, 2006. Black bloc elements were present during some of the protests.|$|E
500|$|For Alter {{and other}} critics, the {{structural}} support and {{impetus for the}} contemporary references rests upon the visual nature of the film's exposition, occurring {{in the form of}} imagery as opposed to conventional dialogue. [...] Visually, the refugee camps in the film intentionally evoke Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison,</b> Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and The Maze. [...] Other popular images appear, such as a sign over the refugee camp reading [...] "Homeland Security". [...] The similarity between the hellish, cinéma vérité stylized battle scenes of the film and current news and documentary coverage of the Iraq War, is noted by film critic Manohla Dargis, describing Cuarón's fictional landscapes as [...] "war zones of extraordinary plausibility".|$|E
500|$|On 20 February, the Marines {{launched}} Operation River Blitz, {{their first}} major offensive of the year, {{centered in the}} western Euphrates River Valley against the cities of Ramadi, Hīt, and Baghdadi. Different units adopted different strategies. In Fallujah, the Marines surrounded the city with berms, banned all vehicles, and required residents to carry identification cards. In Ramadi, the 2nd BCT of the 28th Infantry Division focused on controlling the main roads and protecting the governor and government center. In western Anbar, the 2nd Marine Regiment conducted search and destroy missions, described as [...] "cordon and search", where they repeatedly pushed into enemy-controlled towns and then withdrew. On 2 April, a group of up to 60 AQI fighters launched a major attack, described as [...] "one of the most sophisticated" [...] seen to date, on the Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison.</b> [...] The insurgents used a barrage of mortars, coupled with a suicide car bomb, in an unsuccessful attempt to breach the prison, wounding 44 US troops and 13 detainees.|$|E
500|$|Both sides {{committed}} {{human rights}} abuses in Anbar Province, often involving civilians {{caught in the middle}} of the conflict. [...] By late 2005, abuses had gotten so common that one American officer nonchalantly referred to [...] "discovering... 20 bodies here, 20 bodies there" [...] and the head of MNF-W referred to them as [...] "a cost of doing business." [...] During Operation Steel Curtain, insurgents forced their way into peoples' houses and held them hostage while engaging in gun battles with American forces, who often destroyed the homes. One Sunni Iraqi family described how in 2006 they fled the sectarian violence in Baghdad to Hīt. During their yearlong stay in Hīt, they watched AQI fighters kidnap a man for talking back to them; the fighters later dumped the man's body on his doorstep. The family also watched an American patrol hit a mine in front of their house, and worried that the Americans would conduct reprisal killings on the family. [...] An Iraqi sheikh spoke about how he was accidentally shot and arrested by the Americans and thrown in Abu <b>Ghraib</b> <b>prison</b> where he was tortured. [...] After his release he was targeted by insurgents in Fallujah who thought he was an American spy.|$|E
