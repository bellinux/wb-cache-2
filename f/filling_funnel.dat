50|$|There are {{different}} types of sample cells available, ranging from a flow cell for a few microliters to sample cells with a <b>filling</b> <b>funnel</b> for fast sample exchange without cleaning the measuring prism in between. The sample cells {{can also be used}} for the measurement of poisonous and toxic samples with minimum exposure to the sample.Micro cells require only a few microliters volume, assure good recovery of expensive samples and prevent evaporation of volatile samples or solvents. They can also be used in automated systems for automatic filling of the sample onto the refractometer prism.For convenient filling of the sample through a funnel, flow cells with a <b>filling</b> <b>funnel</b> are available. These are used for fast sample exchange in quality control applications.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{balloons}} {{are typically}} filled at an indoor faucet, an outside tap, {{or at the}} end of a garden hose. Multiple types of filling nozzles are available on the consumer market and come in threaded ( [...] standard in the U.S.) and non-threaded types. Non-threaded nozzles are called <b>filling</b> <b>funnels</b> and may be difficult to use. Some brands of nozzles are called loader instead of nozzle, but no differentiation exists between other types of nozzles. Nozzles may include a valve feature for turning the water source on or off as needed.|$|R
30|$|Publication bias was {{evaluated}} by combining a funnel plot assessment with Duval and Tweedie’s [33] trim and fill correction. Trim and <b>fill</b> <b>funnel</b> plots {{were performed to}} assess for publication bias of literature in all comparison models. This was to ensure that included studies did not report an inflated account of the effect on training frequency and strength outcome. Forest plots were generated to show the study-specific ES and the respective CI. Each forest plots performance measure was visually inspected against its SE {{to account for the}} ‘file drawer problem’. This is the potential effect of published studies being intrinsically biased due to a higher probability of significant results.|$|R
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a <b>filled</b> <b>funnel</b> with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|R

The surface-sample loader and pyrolyzer assembly (SSPLA) is described, along with the major problems encountered during design and testing. Three mechanisms were developed to implement the required SSLPA functions: (1) a soil loader that forces soil from a <b>filled</b> rotating <b>funnel</b> into each of three ovens located on a carriage, (2) a Geneva drive for rotating and precisely indexing the ovens to receive sample, and (3) a toggle-clamp mechanism for sealing the ovens by forcing circular double knife edges into gold sealing surfaces...|$|R
30|$|To {{check the}} {{robustness}} of the meta-analysis results, we conducted {{two types of}} sensitivity analyses (Borenstein et al. 2009). Because significant findings {{are more likely to}} be published than non-significant results, leading to an overestimation of the effects (Rosenthal 1979), we first control for a publication bias. For each of our outcomes, we conducted the Egger test, which examines whether the respective funnel plot of a relationship shows a significant asymmetry (Egger et al. 1997). The Egger tests are not statistically significant, which indicates the absence of a publication bias in our study. Ferguson and Brannick (2012) recommend to conduct two different publication bias tests to underline the robustness of findings. Therefore, we also conducted the Trim-and-Fill method, which trims unmatched values around the initial estimate and <b>fills</b> the <b>funnel</b> plot with imputed missing studies in an iterative process to achieve symmetric funnel plots (Duval and Tweedie 2000). We compared the initial and new estimators to identify remarkable changes. In two cases, trim-and-fill adjustments were made, whereby the effect sizes changed only marginally and the significance levels remained constant.|$|R
50|$|One person holds a clear pipe {{to their}} mouth, while a second holds {{the other end}} of the pipe with a large white plastic funnel attached. The pipe is part-filled with a {{translucent}} yellow-brown liquid, with the remainder of the pipe and the bottom of the <b>funnel</b> <b>filled</b> with a foamy head.Drinking from a beer bong is different from drinking beer normally (or other carbonated beverage). This is because the drinker is not in control of the volume of liquid entering the mouth. In addition, the force of gravity pushes the beer into the drinker's mouth and thus 'forces' the beer down. It is for this reason the beer bong often engages the gag reflex.|$|R
40|$|SINNMR (Sonically Induced Narrowing of the Nuclear Magnetic Resonance {{spectra of}} solids), {{is a novel}} {{technique}} that is being developed to enable the routine study of solids by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. SINNMR aims to narrow the broad resonances that are characteristic of solid state NMR by inducing rapid incoherent motion of solid particles suspended in a support medium, using high frequency ultrasound in the range 2 - 10 MHz. The width of the normal broad resonances from solids are due to incomplete averaging of several components of the total spin Hamiltonian caused by restrictions placed on molecular motion within a solid. At present Magic Angle Spinning (MAS) NMR is the classical solid state technique used to reduce line broadening, but: this has associated problems, not {{least of which is}} the appearance of many spinning side bands which confuse the spectra. It is hoped that SlNNMR will offer a simple alternative, particularly as it does not reveal spinning sidebands The fundamental question concerning whether the use of ultrasound within a cryo-magnet will cause quenching has been investigated with success, as even under the most extreme conditions of power, frequency and irradiator time, the magnet does not quench. The objective of this work is to design and construct a SINNMR probe for use in a super conducting cryo-magnet NMR spectrometer. A cell for such a probe has been constructed and incorporated into an adapted high resolution broadband probe. It has been proved that the cell is capable of causing cavitation, up to 10 MHz, by running a series of ultrasonic reactions within it and observing the reaction products. It was found that the ultrasound was causing the sample to be heated to unacceptable temperatures and this necessitated the incorporation of temperature stabilisation devices. Work has been performed on the investigation of the narrowing of the solid state 23 Na spectrum of tri-sodium phosphate using high frequency ultrasound. Work has also been completed on the signal enhancement and T 1 reduction of a liquid mixture and a pure compound using ultrasound. Some preliminary "bench" experiments have been completed on a novel ultrasonic device designed to help minimise sample heating. The concept involves passing the ultrasound through a temperature stabilised, liquid <b>filled</b> <b>funnel</b> that has a drum skin on the end that will enable the passage of ultrasound into the sample. Bench experiments have proved that acoustic attenuation is low and that cavitation in the liquid beyond the device is still possible...|$|R
50|$|The {{flowering}} {{season for}} E. dasyacanthus {{is between the}} months of March and May. The large flower of the plant grow {{at the sides of}} the stem above the areoles close to the stem apex. The flowers are typically 8-12 cm long and 7-11 cm wide. The flowers smell sweet and are pollinated by bees. In the Trans-Pecos region of Texas the flowers are usually bright yellow with a green throat. Other color the flowers may be include dark to pale yellow, canary yellow, golden yellow or deep red to rose pink. Since this taxon of cacti are mostly yellow flowered, flowers that are beta cyanic and orange are less common. The tepals are relatively thick and durable compared to E. reichenbachii, but thin and soft compared to E. coccineus. The stamens of the flowers have filaments resulting in the floral throat being <b>filled</b> with a <b>funnel</b> of yellow anthers.|$|R
40|$|The limited {{resource}} model {{states that}} self-control {{is governed by}} a relatively finite set of inner resources on which people draw when exerting willpower. Once self-control resources have been used up or depleted, they are less available for other self-control tasks, leading to a decrement in subsequent self-control success. The depletion effect has been studied for over 20 years, tested or extended in more than 600 studies, and supported in an independent meta-analysis (Hagger et al., 2010). Meta-analyses are supposed to reduce bias in literature reviews. Carter et al. ’s (2015) meta-analysis, by contrast, included a series of questionable decisions involving sampling, methods, and data analysis. We provide quantitative analyses of key sampling issues: exclusion {{of many of the}} best depletion studies based on idiosyncratic criteria and the emphasis on mini meta-analyses with low statistical power as opposed to the overall depletion effect. We discuss two key methodological issues: failure to code for research quality, and the quantitative impact of weak studies by novice researchers. We discuss two key data analysis issues: questionable interpretation of the results of trim and <b>fill</b> and <b>Funnel</b> Plot Asymmetry test procedures, and the use and misinterpretation of the untested Precision Effect Test and Precision Effect Estimate with Standard Error (PEESE) procedures. Despite these serious problems, the Carter et al. (2015) meta-analysis results actually indicate that there is a real depletion effect – contrary to their title...|$|R

40|$|A {{multi-purpose}} {{thermal insulation}} test apparatus {{is used for}} testing insulation materials, or other components. The test apparatus is a fluid boil-off calorimeter system for calibrated measurement of the apparent thermal conductivity (k-value) of a specimen material at a fixed vacuum level. The apparatus includes an inner vessel for receiving a fluid with a normal boiling point below ambient temperature, such as liquid nitrogen, enclosed within a vacuum chamber. A cold mass assembly, including the inner vessel and thermal guards, is suspended {{from the top of}} the vacuum chamber. Handling tools attach to the cold mass assembly for convenient manipulation of the assembly and for the installation or wrapping of insulation test materials. Liquid nitrogen is typically supplied to the inner vessel using a <b>fill</b> tube with <b>funnel.</b> A single port through the top of the vacuum chamber facilitates both filling and venting. Aerogel composite stacks with reflective films are fastened to the top and the bottom of the inner vessel as thermal guards. The comparative k-value of the insulation material is determined by measuring the boil-off flow rate of gas, the temperature differential across the insulation thickness, and the dimensions (length and diameters) of the test specimen...|$|R

40|$|The {{amounts of}} {{atmospheric}} depositions were measured by {{two types of}} bulk deposit-samplers (BDS). One {{of them was a}} commonly used dry-type BDS mounted with a conical polyethylene (PE) funnel on a PE-reservoir (d-BDS). The second BDS was a wet-type BDS which was devised to evaluate the nutrient loads deposited directly from the atmosphere onto lakes, and mounted with a cylindrical <b>funnel</b> <b>filled</b> with 0. 005 -M H 2 SO 4 at 5 cm in depth (w-BDS). The water sample in the reservoirs was collected after an appropriate time interval. As the funnel sizes of d-BDSs decreased from 20 to 9 cm in diameter, the trapping efficiencies of TN and TP increased, as measurement accuracies decreased. The efficiencies measured by w-BDSs were not affected by the funnel size in the tested range from 20 to 43 cm. Based on the data continuously measured by d-BDS 20 and w-BDS 20 mounted each with a 20 cm funnel for one year, the atmospheric deposition of TN and TP measured by d-BDS 20 were 18. 1 and 0. 745 kg ha(- 1) y(- 1), which were apparently smaller than 20. 7 and 0. 921 kg ha(- 1) y(- 1) measured by w-BDS 20. It is recommended from the results that the direct nutrient-loads from atmosphere into lakes should be evaluated on the base of the more reliable unit loads measured by a w-BDS mounted with a funnel larger than around 30 cm in diameter...|$|R
40|$|Multihead {{weighing}} {{machines are}} ubiquitous in industry for fast and accurate packaging {{of a wide}} variety of foods and vegetables, small hardware items and office supplies. These machines consist of a system of multiple hoppers that are filled with product which when discharged through a <b>funnel</b> <b>fills</b> a package to a desired weight. Operating the machine requires first to specify the product weight targets or setpoints that each hopper should contain on average in each cycle, which do not need to be identical. The setpoints selection has a major impact on the performance of a multihead weighing machine. Each cycle, the machine fills a package running a built-in knapsack algorithm that opens – or leaves shut – different combinations of hoppers releasing their content such that the total package weight is near to its target, minimizing the amount of product “given away”. In this paper, we address the open problem for industry of how to determine the setpoint weights for each of the hoppers before starting up the machine, given a desired total package weight. An order statistic formulation based on a characterization of near-optimal solutions is presented. This is shown to be computationally intractable, and a faster heuristic that utilizes a lower bound approximation of the expected smallest order statistic is proposed instead. The solutions obtained with the proposed methods can result in substantial savings for users of multihead weighing machines. Alternatively, the analysis presented could be used by management to justify the acquisition of new machines of this type...|$|R
40|$|The {{staining}} of thin {{sections of}} Osmium tetroxide (OsO 4) -fixed biological materials with the lead hydroxide preparation of Watson (5) or with semisaturated solutions of lead subacetate (1) represents a considerable advance in electron microscope technique. The contrast {{of the image}} viewed in the electron microscope is so far enhanced that accurate focusing is now possible at appreciably higher magnifications. The contrast and detail visible in the micrograph also appears much improved, without the introduction of obvious artifacts. For routine work, a serious handicap is {{the formation of a}} precipitate of lead carbonate over {{a large proportion of the}} section area. The method described by Peachey (4) considerably reduces this precipitate but allows only one grid to be stained per syringe. In the method to be described, as many as six grids can be stained simultaneously without any precipitation of lead carbonate. The apparatus for the filtration of the lead-staining solution and the staining of the sections is illustrated in Fig. 1 A. To prepare the lead solution the wire mesh support table is removed and a 3 -cm. by 11 -cm. test tube stood inside the lower part of the apparatus. A length of polythene tubing is pushed to the bottom of the test tube and a 5 -cm. diameter filter funnel and fine pore filter paper are arranged as illustrated in Fig. 2. The polythene tubing is passed through port c (Fig. 1 A) and connected to a No. 19 needle. Received for publication, July 1, 1960. The rubber stopper is inserted lightly into the hole. A brisk flow of nitrogen, humidified by bubbling through water, is passed through the apparatus for 5 minutes. Port c is then opened and the <b>funnel</b> <b>filled</b> with the lead solution by means of a pipette. -T- ~ STOPCOCK...|$|R
