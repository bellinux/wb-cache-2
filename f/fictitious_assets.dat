40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} an agent {{who wants to}} maximize his expected utility of his terminal wealth {{with respect to the}} power utility by the martingale method. The assets that the agent can allocate his capital to are assumed to follow a stochastic differential equation and exhibits stochastic volatility. The stochastic volatility assumption will make the market incomplete and therefore, the martingale method will not have a unique solution. We resolve this issue by including <b>fictitious</b> <b>assets</b> that complete the market and solve the allocation problem in the completed market. From the optimal allocation in the completed market, we will adjust the drift parameter for the <b>fictitious</b> <b>assets</b> so that our allocation don't include the <b>fictitious</b> <b>assets</b> in the portfolio strategy. We consider also the case when the assets also has stochastic drift and the agent can only observe the price process, which makes the information in the market for the agent partially observable. Explicit results are presented for the full and partially observable case and a feedback solution is obtained in the full observable case when the asset and volatility are assumed to follow the Heston model. I denna uppsats har vi en individ som vill maximera sin förväntade nytta med avseende till en potens nyttofunktion med martingal metoden. De tillgångar som agenten kan fördela sitt kapital till antas följa en stokastisk differentialekvation och dessa tillgångar antar stokastisk volatilitet. Den stokastiska volatilitet göra att marknaden blir ofullständig och implicerar att martingal metoden inte kommer anta en unik lösning. Vi löser det problemet genom att inkludera fiktiva tillgångar som kompletterar marknaden och löser allokerings problem med martingal metoden i den nya fiktiva marknaden. Från den optimala allokeringen i den fiktiva marknaden, kommer vi att justera drift parametrarna för de fiktiva tillgångarna så att vår allokering inte inkluderar dem i portföljstrategin. Vi undersöker också fallet när tillgångarna har stokastisk drift och individen kan bara observera pris processen, vilket gör informationen på marknaden för individen delvis observerbar. Resultat presenteras för de fullt och delvis observerbara fallet och en lösning erhålls i det fullt observerbara fallet när tillgången och volatiliteten antas följa en Heston modell...|$|E
40|$|This study investigates how {{controlling}} shareholders fraudulently extracted firm value via cash tunnelling from Chinese {{companies from}} 1998 to 2011. The {{evidence suggests that}} expropriating owners choose a balance sheet account that is {{not directly related to}} the firm’s operating business in order to record a <b>fictitious</b> <b>asset,</b> with the account remaining in the company’s books for a reasonably long time. The delay in recognising the <b>fictitious</b> <b>asset</b> as a loss in the financial statements makes it more difficult for auditors to detect the fraud. We develop two measures to estimate the total loss caused by the cash tunnelling, and estimate the loss to be two to four times net income. Evidence on the factors and process surrounding cash tunnelling is presented, and we demonstrate that the propensity to engage in tunnelling is positively related to the differential rights between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders and negatively related to firm profitability, the probability of fraud detection and the severity of the punishment. falsePublished onlin...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} printed using funds made {{available}} by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. Abstract: We propose {{a new approach to}} the pricing and hedging of contingent claims under transaction costs in a general incomplete market in discrete time. Under the assumptions of a bounded mean-variance tradeoff, substantial risk and a nondegeneracy condition on the conditional variances of asset returns, we prove the existence of a locally risk-minimizing strategy inclusive of transaction costs for every square-integrable contingent claim. Then we show that local risk-minimization is robust under the inclusion of transaction costs: The preceding strategy which is locally risk-minimizing inclusive of transaction costs in a model with bid-ask spreads on the underlying asset is also locally risk-minimizing with-out transaction costs in a fictitious model which is frictionless and where the <b>fictitious</b> <b>asset</b> price lies between the bid and ask price processes of the original model. In particular, our results apply to any nondegenerate model with a finite state space if the transaction cost parameter is sufficiently small.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether management 2 ̆ 7 s cognitions, values and perceptions {{are associated with}} fraud for 18 863 firm-years for Chinese listed firms from 2000 to 2014. Demographic characteristics of {{the chief financial officer}} (CFO) are used as proxies for management 2 ̆ 7 s cognitions, values and perceptions. We find that fraudulent financial reporting is higher when CFOs are younger, male, and have lower education backgrounds. An analysis of inflated earnings, <b>fictitious</b> <b>assets,</b> material omissions and other material misstatements provide similar results, with the exception that CFOs with higher education levels are associated with more inflated earnings.

5000|$|Fictitious capital (German: fiktives Kapital) is {{a concept}} used by Karl Marx in his {{critique}} of political economy. It is introduced in chapter 25 of the third volume of Capital. Fictitious capital contrasts with what Marx calls [...] "real capital", which is capital actually invested in physical means of production and workers, and [...] "money capital", which is actual funds being held. The market value of <b>fictitious</b> capital <b>assets</b> (such as stocks and securities) varies according to the expected return or yield of those assets in the future, which Marx felt was only indirectly related {{to the growth of}} real production. Effectively, fictitious capital represents [...] "accumulated claims, legal titles, to future production" [...] and more specifically claims to the income generated by that production.|$|R
40|$|A study {{released}} by the GAO in October 2002, Financial Statements Restatements: Trends, Market Impact, Regulatory Responses and Remaining Challenges, reported {{that the number of}} restatements increased 145 % from 1997 to 2001. In 2002, a study by Huron Consulting Group reported that the number of restatements increased an additional 22 % over 2001. Both reports noted a growing presence of large companies making restatements. Many restatements move to future periods earnings that have been recognized previously. For example, a restatement entailing premature revenue recognition may result in deferral of that revenue for future recognition. Capitalized costs written down through restatement eliminate future amortization expenses. The net result of such restatements is that companies report the same earnings twice - once in prior years and then again in future periods. Not all restatements, however, affect future earnings. For example, restatements that eliminate <b>fictitious</b> revenue and <b>assets</b> do not move prior-year earnings to future periods. This report looks at the effects of restatements on future earnings. Our objective is to highlight selected restatements that were filed with the SEC during 2002 and early 2003 that will benefit future-period earnings by material amounts...|$|R

Thesis : Postgraduate Program Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. Thesis : Postgraduate Program Sebelas Maret University of Surakarta. The {{purposes}} of this research are to make critical process of the money laundering evidence policy based on the Law Formulation Theory, and knowing consequence and proving implication with two evidence system, knowing a weakness and the money loundry evidence system excess. This thesis research type is doctrinal or normative research based on the second concept of the law from Soetandyo Wignyosoebroto. The research character is diagnostic. The data analysis applies qualitative analysis with using the logic principle, systematic, and juridict. Based on {{the description of the}} research result and related to the case studied, it can be concluded (a) The formulation of the money laundering evidence policy on the law of Money Laundering is to fill formulation of the law formation, but in input have an obstruction is no feeback is out comes acheaved who will be result, because the law of money laundry is too dominated by politic component as the main component, and not too pay attention for economic component in this thing is a disadvantages of country as the effect of money laundry. In the rule formulation must to pay attention philosophy aspect, sosiologic and juridict so in the performing level can be create of the law purpose. (b) the consequence and implication from there be equation and distinctive of the arrangement evidenced between The Penal Procedural Act and the law of money laundry at the rule in section 184 of The Penal Procedural Act. There is even in contrast is that in the Penal Procedural Act is unsystematized probe system flips over and electronic prove tool that constitutes a proof tool extension in the Penal Procedural Act. (c) In term of evidence the money laundry have a weakness as be equalled electronic proof tool force equalised with directions evidence tool so get easily be ruled out by other prove tool corresponds at the rule in section 184 of The Penal Procedural Act. Meanwhile in reverse probe to be gotten weakness because marks sense retroaktif's ground, at the law principle is may not retroactive, its reducing is electronic proof tool arrangement, jurisdictional enforcer is not understand the way of konfrehensif about the evidence, and also bended on the evidence with bureaucracy system and <b>fictitious</b> mail about <b>asset</b> wealth who one will validate and may used as mail evidence tool...|$|R
