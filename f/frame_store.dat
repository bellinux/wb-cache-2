The caravans from here are composed, for the most part, of very hard characters, the sort of men who would shoot you for your horse if they took a fancy to it; I would by no means advise you to ally {{yourself}} with such men. I can, I think, put you {{in the way of a}} better plan than that. I find that a great number of caravans from the West are going by a northern route which crosses the Missouri at a point called Omaha. I have been thinking that this will become an important place, and have made up my mind to freight four or five flats with flour, bacon, and other goods of all sorts, and a <b>frame</b> <b>store,</b> and to go up there and open a business. I shall want a handy man with me at first; I shall take up a storekeeper to leave there in charge, but at first he will want help. If you like to go up in charge of one of the scows, and to stay to help put up the store and set things running, I will give you a hundred dollars, and you can have your passage up for your horse, which I should advise you to buy here. You will get one that will carry you, though of course not much to look at, for about fifty dollars; I know several horse-dealers here, and will get one for you if you like. You had also better get a stout pony to carry your traps and provisions; that will cost about forty dollars. Then you must have a rifle and a Colt. These are absolutely necessary for such a journey, for I hear that the Indians are very troublesome on the plains. These, however, I myself shall have much pleasure in presenting you with, in testimony of the obligation I feel I owe you for saving my boat and goods. The hundred dollars that are due to you, and the hundred that you will further earn at Omaha, will be sufficient for your horses and outfit, which will leave this money which you placed in my hands untouched. You will find that very useful, for you will want to buy a tent and provisions and tools out there, and money to keep you till you hit upon gold. Well, what do you think of my offer?" ...|$|E
50|$|For {{playback}} and view-through purposes, circuits read {{image data}} from either a recorded cassette or the CCD and fill half a digital <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> at the PXL reduced rate, while scanning {{other half of}} the <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> at normal NTSC rates. Since each half of the <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> includes only 10800 pixels in its 120 by 90 array, the same as the CCD, the display resolution was deemed to be marginal, and black borders were added around the picture, squashing the framestore image content {{into the middle of the}} frame, preserving pixels which would otherwise be lost in overscan. An anti-aliasing low-pass filter is included in the final video output circuit.|$|E

50|$|From the 1840s to the 1870s, Main Street had mostly wood <b>frame</b> <b>stores</b> {{with wide}} {{shingled}} canopies resting on wooden posts.

Canvas awnings replaced wooden canopies.|$|R
5000|$|Color framing {{has become}} largely {{an issue of}} {{historical}} interest, first with the advent in the 1980s of digital composite video timebase correctors and <b>frame</b> <b>stores,</b> which could regenerate the color frame sequence of a composite signal at any phase, and later with analog component video editing and modern digital video systems, in which subcarrier phase is no longer relevant.|$|R
25|$|As {{building}} {{continued into}} the late 1830s and 1840s, houses reflected an austere Greek Revival style. They were mostly brick laid in Flemish bond primarily, with running and American bond appearing more. Plain pilasters flanked the recessed entrances, with little ornament on the front facades. Newer roofing materials and methods made flat roofs possible. Some <b>frame</b> <b>stores,</b> most since demolished, were constructed in the neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|The two-story wood <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> {{featured}} Greek Revival and Italianate {{elements in}} its design, reflecting a contemporary view that even functional buildings should have architectural ornaments. Broken pediments with dentillated eaves covered both gable {{ends of the}} building. Greek Revival-inspired pilasters marked three of the building's corners. The tall, narrow windows of the building had arched hoods, a typical Italianate feature.|$|E

This is achieved using complicated circuitry involving a digital <b>frame</b> <b>store,</b> the same method used for converting between NTSC and the 625/25 standards. The fact that the colour encoding of PAL-M and PAL/625/25 is the same does not help, as the entire signal goes through an A/D-D/A conversion process anyway.|$|E

50|$|Rev. Joshua D. Jones House is a {{historic}} home located at Mill Spring, Polk County, North Carolina. It was built in 1897, and is a two-story, three bay, frame I-house with a two-story rear ell. A kitchen addition was built in 1925. It features a shed-roofed porch covering three-fourths of the lower facade. Also on the property is the contributing one-room, <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> building and well. It was the home of African-American community leader Rev. Joshua D. Jones of the Stony Knoll community.|$|E
50|$|Converting between {{different}} numbers of lines and different frequencies of fields/frames in video pictures {{is not an}} easy task. Perhaps the most technically challenging conversion to make is from any of the 625-line, 25-frame/s systems to system M, which has 525-lines at 29.97 frames per second. Historically this required a <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> to hold those parts of the picture not actually being output (since the scanning of any point was not time coincident). In more recent times, conversion of standards is a relatively easy task for a computer.|$|E

The coaches were, except for the propulsion systems, a near-identical match to Amfleet coaches. Twenty-nine of the 31 coaches were renumbered and used as cab control cars for corridor services. This allowed trains to operate in push-pull service, rather than needing to be turned around on a wye at terminals or to have a locomotive on each end.|$|R
50|$|Packer Farm and Barkersville Store is a {{historic}} farm and general store and national historic district located at Middle Grove, Saratoga County, New York.

Also on the property are a frame smokehouse/dairy built about 1840, and a c. 1920 <b>frame</b> <b>store.</b> It served as the dwelling of the first Postmaster in Millersville, and is noteworthy for having continuously served as the Post Office and community store for 130 years.

5000|$|CEDs are {{conductive}} vinyl platters {{that are}} 30.0 cm in diameter. To avoid metric names {{they are usually}} called [...] "12 inch discs". A CED has a spiral groove on both sides. The groove is 657 nm wide and has a length of up to 12 miles (19 km). The discs rotate at a constant angular speed during playback (450 rpm for NTSC, 500 rpm for PAL) and each rotation contains several full frames (four frames for NTSC, three for PAL). This meant that freeze frame was impossible on players without an expensive electronic <b>frame</b> <b>store</b> facility.|$|E
