In this field American investigators (Dobzhansky and Wright 1943, 1947, Burla et al. 1950, Richardson 1968, 1969) dealt with the precise analysis on a single species from the stand point of population genetics, while European ones (Burla and Greuter 1959 a, b, Greuter 1963) {{were concerned about the}} <b>interspecific</b> <b>relation</b> for habitat preference between two closely allied species, Drosophila obscura and D. subobscura. The theoretical works (Wallace 1966 a, Wright 1968), based on the study by Dobzhansky and Wright (1943), have advanced with regard to some aspects of pouplation genetics, e. g., the rate of elimination of lethal genes by homozygosis in D. melanogaster (Wallace 1966 b), etc. On the other hand, even basic information on dispersal behavior in natural conditions is virtually absent for many species.

40|$|The present paper {{presents}} {{initial data}} about settlement and recruitment of macrobenthic organisms {{through the use}} of artificial substrates placed over Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile meadows in the Western Mediterranean. Three settlement frames were submerged in the Marine Protected Area (MPA) of Palma Bay (Balearic Islands, Western Mediterranean). A total of seven macrobenthic species from five phyla were recorded. Assemblages were dominated by the bivalve Anomia ephippium with the largest percentage of surface covered being 43. 5 % (± 4. 96). This study provides information on massive primary settlement of A. ephippium. Moreover, this species generated an optimal recruitment substrate for the settlement of two species of polychaete (Serpula vermicularis and Hydroides elegans) and the barnacle Balanus amphitrite. An <b>interspecific</b> <b>relation</b> was observed between B. amphitrite and A. ephippium, since 99. 9 % of this cirriped recruited directly over A. ephippium. Additionally, this study demonstrated that there is a substantial larval pool available ready to colonize suitable substrates for benthic organisms such as the bryozoan Calpensia nobilis and the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri associated with Posidonia oceanica. Our study is the first approach to gain knowledge of the complex process regarding settlement and recruitment, as well as the application of artificial structures in order to investigate the larval pool over P. oceanica meadows. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

Tested were 100 %, 10 %, 1 % and 0. 1 % seawater in combination with temperatures of 5 °, 10 ° or 15 ° C. In general all species preferred the 5 °C conditions above those with a higher temperature, and the middle salinity range (1 % for G. pulex, 1 % and 10 % for G. d. celticus and G. d. duebeni) above the lower or higher salinities. In nearly all situations tested G. pulex had a lower survival rate than G. d. celticus and G. d. duebeni. Notwithstanding the sometimes unfavourable conditions for G. pulex, this species can compete successfully with G. d. celticus under most of the experimental conditions, but the <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> between G. pulex and G. d. duebeni end in the competitive exclusion of the first species. These results support two theories: (1) G. pulex is able to compete successfully with G. d. celticus and to expel the latter from its niche, and (2) G. d. duebeni is able to invade freshwater and to establish inland populations. The differences demonstrated between G. d. celticus and G. d. duebeni are an argument for a different development and different capabilities of both subspecies.

It was strongly suggested that such a difference in the attacking range between the two parasites was not due to the interaction between both species but to the differential responses of the adult females of both species to microclimatic conditions in a pine tree. Preferential attack by the two egg parasites on the host population in relation to the crown heights contributes to avoidance of multiple parasitism.

In S. globosa, large males {{tended to be}} restricted to the upper level, while small males and juveniles were distributed more evenly. This feature is explained in connection with repulsive interactions between individuals. Juveniles of l. pusillus showed higher densities at upper levels inhabited by many conspecific sexable crabs, and the spatial associations between these juveniles and sexable crabs within the upper levels were highly positive. These spatial features of juvenile I. pusillus are attributable to their special habit that they can dwell in the adult burrows together with the adults. At the stations inhabited by both S. globosa and l. pusillus, juvenile S. globosa appeared to be restricted within rather upper levels, although no such tendency was detected at the stations devoid of I. pusillus.

40|$|Background: Holcoglossum {{is a small}} orchid genus of 12 species {{ranging from}} SW China to Thailand and NE India. Although {{molecular}} and morphological analyses have been performed to establish the phylogenetic relationships within this genus, the <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> and its relations with allied genera, such as Rhynchostylis, Aerides and Vanda, remain unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings: In addition to morphological analysis, maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian inference analyses were performed based on fragments of the nuclear ITS and chloroplast trnL-F and matK genes of 31 taxa (15 Holcoglossum, 14 Aeridinae, 2 outgroups) representing all major clades of the Holcoglossum alliance. The results suggest that Holcoglossum is triphyletic, comprising three clades: the Holcoglossum clade, its sister clade, and a distant clade {{more closely related to}} Rhynchostylis, Aerides, and Vanda than to the Holcoglossum clade. The Holcoglossum clade is further divided into three subclades; the genetic distances between these three subclades also support this delimitation. The molecular conclusion is consistent with their distinct morphological characters.

Both crustaceans were breeding under laboratory conditions to study their fecundity and growth. Additionally their behavior and potential <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> have been investigated in four different laboratory experiments.

Our results showed high fecundity (three generations within four weeks) and growth rates (duplication of body lengths in two weeks) for M. insidiosum. Two tube construction strategies were distinguished: a tube changing behavior for the amphipod M. insidiosum, showing greater construction activity for females, and tube keeping behavior for T. aff. dulongii. Overall, tanaid tubes were frequently claimed by M. insidiosum, demonstrating a close interspecific relationship and resulting in decreased sediment aggregating activity.

In the Tagus estuary these species are particularly important in the food web. Fish samples were taken monthly in the upper estuary, and the gut contents of a total of 431 P. minutus and 382 P. microps were analysed in order to study preferences and seasonal changes in their diets and to understand intra- and <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> between these two congeneric gobies. The sand goby had no dominant prey, although mysids were particularly important in the diet of this species. Shrimps and polychaetes were also common prey. P. microps preferentially ingested polychaetes, with isopods, amphipods, bivalves and copepods as secondary prey items. Significant seasonal variations in the ingestion of the main prey groups of both species were obtained, which reflect variations in prey availability. During the reproductive season there were differences in the food consumed by males and females, mainly for P. minutus, reflecting the different activity pattern exhibited by males and females during the breeding season, since parental care is supported by the former. The smallest classes from P. minutus increased their niche widths as they grew.

The inventories extend the known range of both species of Typhleotris on the Mahafaly Plateau. Abiotic water characteristics did not differ between seasons. The abundances of both species were negatively correlated with iron concentrations. Further correlations between the abundance of either fish species and abiotic water characteristics remained inconclusive as these water characteristics co-varied with geographical latitude that in turn was correlated with fish abundance.

40|$|Resources such {{as water}} taken up by plants can be {{released}} into soils through hydraulic redistribution and can also be translocated by clonal integration within a plant clonal network. We hypothesized that the resources from one (donor) microsite could be translocated within a clonal network, released into different (recipient) microsites and subsequently used by neighbour plants in the recipient microsite. To test these hypotheses, we conducted two experiments in which connected and disconnected ramet pairs of Potentilla anserina were grown under both homogeneous and heterogeneous water regimes, with seedlings of Artemisia ordosica as neighbours. The isotopes [15 N] and deuterium were used to trace the translocation of nitrogen and water, respectively, within the clonal network. The water and nitrogen taken up by P. anserina ramets in the donor microsite were translocated into the connected ramets in the recipient microsites. Most notably, portions of the translocated water and nitrogen were released into the recipient microsite and were used by the neighbouring A. ordosica, which increased growth of the neighbouring A. ordosica significantly. Therefore, our hypotheses were supported, and plant clonal integration mediated the horizontal hydraulic redistribution of resources, thus benefiting neighbouring plants. Such a plant clonal integration-mediated resource redistribution in horizontal space may have substantial effects on the <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> and composition {{of the community and}} consequently on ecosystem processes...|$|R
40|$|Morphological {{variation}} was {{studied in}} 124 accessions from 61 Passiflora L. species. Twenty-four quantitative descriptors selected for their high variation among subgenera were {{submitted to a}} principal component analysis. The first principal component (32 % of total variance) was associated with flower length and secondarily with floral cup constriction, the second (27 %) with flower width and bract shape, and the third (14 %) with peduncle branching, stem width, and leaf length, which relates it to the differentiation of subgenera Astrophea and Deidamioides. The projection of accessions in the resulting tridimensional space consistently separates the four subgenera, as well as supersection Tacsonia of subgenus Passiflora. A neighbor joining analysis, on a selection of 32 qualitative traits and four categorized quantitative variables, clustered species according to their chromosome number and, within subgenus Passiflora, separated supersections Tacsonia (pollinated by the sword-billed hummingbird) and Distephana (pollinated by shorter-billed hummingbirds) from all other, bee-pollinated, species. Thus, the morphological study allows separating the effects of genome evolution from those of more recent and independent coevolutions concerning the pollination syndromes of supersections Tacsonia and Distephana. Within subgenus Decaloba, diverging subclusters are consistent with supersections and particular sections, with the partial exception of supersection Decaloba. Within supersection Tacsonia, subclusters correspond {{to one or two}} sections, pointing to overclassification in the current taxonomy. Among the bee-pollinated species of subgenus Passiflora, only supersection Laurifolia is clearly validated.

40|$|Abstract: Information is {{a common}} {{phenomena}} in the biotic parts of ecosystems. Additional to the intraspecific long term transformation of information by the genetic code, intra- and <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> are determined by information. A wide spectrum of chemical and physical conditions is used as carrier for information. The high variety of information propagation is processed in different ways by organisms. Simple deterministic processing of information are {{at one end of}} the potential range, high complex and non linear processing the other end. In comparison to the food webs in ecosystem, the investment of energy in transmission or perception of information is relatively low. However, information is of high relevance for interactions among organisms. Highly evident is the role of information in intraspecific interactions of social organisms. Despite this fact is well documented and supported by several theories, it is still an open question how far emergent characteristics of ecosystems are caused by relations of information. Answers for this question are of high relevance for our understanding of ecosystems functions, and in particular for the functional relevance of biodiversity in ecosystems. It can be demonstrated on a theoretical basis, that information has different functions in ecosystems. Basically, in heterogeneous environments it is an essential precondition for the allocation of resources. For this reason, a high variability of information qualities has to be expected. Because this explanation is not sufficient for multi species systems, the functional relevance of information processes has to be considered. With this extended view it is possible to show the relevance of information for the fitness of organisms. In this analysis, the effects for specific species have to be distinguished from effects for the systems...|$|R
40|$|The Stress-gradient {{hypothesis}} predicates {{a change}} of interspecies relations from negative to positive according to the stress gradient. The basic assumption is {{that the presence of}} one species (the facilitator) makes the growth of other species easier. In this study was determined based on the 5 years experiment, whether the interspecies interactions (i. e. the importance of facilitation and competition) changes according to the hydrological conditions. Three wetland species (Calamagrostis canescens, Carex elongata and Deschampsia cespitosa) were planted in experimental pots with the presence and absence of the dominant species (Carex elata). The hydrological gradient (= the stress gradient) was simulated by three types of hydrological conditions: dry, fluctuating and wet. The success of the species within the specific conditions was correlated with the fitness-related characteristics of the plants including the biomass, the number of ramets and the height of the plants. Following hypotheses were tested: i) at a low intensity of stress (with the wet treatment), the C. elata represents a competitor for other species. On the other hand, at a high intensity of stress (with the dry treatment), the C. elata represents a facilitator, making it easier to the other coexisting species to grow. This presumption was confirmed only with the D. cespitosa, which was more successful under dry treatment with the presence of a dominant species, which facilitated it. With the other two species the change of <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> was not observed and the relationships remained negative. Furthermore the results showed, that in the dry treatment with the presence of a dominant species, there was a lower intensity of competition among the coexisting species. The experiment showed, that the interactions of particular species with dominant species can vary according to the stress gradient. The hydrological gradient also influences the character and intensity of interactions among the species...|$|R

The cost of running in these waders, measured as the slope of the regression line of energy expenditure against speed of locomotion, is significantly less than an allometrically calculated slope for all bird species (Taylor et al. 1982).

Cost of running for a 100 g wader is 22 % below the cost of a grouse, and 68 % below the cost of a hypothetical penguin of similar mass. Intraindividual cost of running in relation to body mass of a Turnstone and interindividual cost of running in Knots reveal much stronger increases of running costs with increasing body mass than <b>interspecific</b> allometric <b>relations</b> would predict, and this elevated activity cost probably importantly influences the set point for body mass regulation in birds...|$|R

40|$|The social {{behaviour}} of five species of Iguanid lizards from Madagascar Oplurus quadrimaculatus, O. grandidieri, O. fierinensis, O. cyclurus and O. cuvieri cuvieri is described. The field work {{was carried out}} near Tulear, Morondova and Soalala. The laboratory work took place, partly, at the Marine Station of Tulear and, mostly, in Marseille, where almost all the experiments were carried out. After summarizing relevant data on the ecology, morphology, and diet of these Iguanid lizards, the paper concentrates on {{the analysis of the}} relationships between individuals and their agonistic behaviour repertoire. The deterrent display and the threatening display, consisting of sequences of vertical oscillations of the front part of the body, are described. The study of 126 displays, using a frame by frame analysis of filmed sequences, shows the inter-specific variations. Some correlations between the morphology and habitat preferences of the various species and their display pattern are pointed out : the independent vertical movements {{of the head and neck}} are most often observed among the arboreal species (0. cyclurus and O. cuvieri), while the extension and rhythmic flexion of the fore limbs predominates among the more specialized rupicolous species (0. grandidieri and O. fierinensis). The aggresive displays which take place during short range confrontations contrast both O. fierinensis and O. grandidieri to the two arboreal species. Amongst the former, the threatening posture involves a dorsa-ventral flattening, with a "dorsal display" to the adversary. Amongst 0. cyclurus and O. cuvieri on the contrary, a lateral compression is apparent, and the animal presents to its opponent an enlarged profile. A special combat technique has been observed among O. grandidieri. Apart from these differences, many common display features draw the five species under consideration together, and confirm that this genus constitutes a fairly homogeneous taxonomic group. The territorial behaviour of Oplurus lizards is also considered. The five species have been subjected to a series of experiments in large terraria. With the exception of O. fierinensis, the male Oplurus demarcates an individual territory : two males of the same species cannot peacefully cohabit in a 10 m 2 area. The females are also intolerant of each other, but to a lesser degree : they are, on the other hand, accepted in the males territories. Territorial intolerance has also been observed under natural conditions amongst O. quadrimaculatus and cyclurus; the area controlled by the male of the first species can exceed 100 m 2, but is smaller for O. cyclurus. A territorial male O. quadrimaculatus allows one or several females to settle at least temporarily on its territory. Some information is given on the mating display of O. quadrimaculatus and O. cyclurus. An analysis of the <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> shows that Oplurus quadrimaculatus dominates the other species, except O. cuvieri. Interspecific confrontations are more frequent and more prolonged between species which are morphologically similar. The affinities and differences between Oplurus species as weil as the relations between Malagasy and American Iguanids, are discussed.

40|$|In {{scope of}} {{worldwide}} reef degradation due to anthropogenic environmental changes {{there is an}} urgent {{need to understand the}} different factors driving the processes within the coral reef ecosystem. Thus, the investigation of macroalgae becomes important, as they are observed to spread over the degraded reefs. Next to some conspicuous species, like Lobophora variegata and Dictyota spp., other smaller fialemntous algae, commonly known as algal turf, are observed. Algal turf has hardly been investigated to species level and has mainly been treated as functional group in many ecological studies. The need for studies at the species level is crucial, as certain species specific algal-coral interactions are reported {{to play an important role}} in the maintenance of the coral reefs. In order to increase the knowledge of turf algal communities in coral reefs ecosystems, the aim of the present study was to identify the species composition and to investigate the environmental factors potentially shaping the turf algal communities in a Carribean coral reef in the SW coast of Curacao. There were 101 different species identified, including 15 species of Chlorophyta, 10 species of Phaeophyceae, 61 species of Rhodophyta and 15 species of Cyanobacteria. To ease the investigation of these diverse assemblages, these species were grouped according to the lowest taxonomic level possible (preferably at genus level) for an adequate investigation under the dissection microscope (12 times magnification). Thus a total of 39 different taxa were distinguished. To understand the dynamics shaping these assemblages, the algal turf succession was followed over a period of 500 days, and the distribution of several turf algal species, growing on settlement tiles and as epiphytes on the dominant macrophyte L. variegata was investigated over a depth range from 2 to 40 m. Furthermore, in order to investigate the responses of turf algal communities towards changing environmental conditions, different successional stages were exposed in six multifactorial experimental studies to different environmental factors, including UV radiation, substrate quality, change in depth, eutrophication, annual variation, and grazing pressure. The findings of the present study confirmed that algal turf is not only comprises a diverse assemblage, but a highly complex community that is shaped and driven by specific responses to different environmental factors and <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations.</b> Furthermore, turf algal communities serve as habitat for different benthic and demersal fauna, provide a refuge for unicellular organisms, and may play a role as a bank of microstages for several bigger macroalgae. The communities responded to different environmental conditions, whereas the response depended on the species present and the different succesional stages. While the early stages were more affected by certain environmental stressors, e. g. grazing pressure, the later stages showed to be more tolerant, which were partly linked to the high observed tolerance of certain Cyanobacteria taxa, e. g. Dichothrix, which forms dense tufts, and might provide shelter for more sensitive organisms. The present study not only provides information about the composition and distribution of turf algal species in the research area, but also about community and species/taxa specific responses to different environmental stressors. This information is crucial as it allows for the development of a turf algal based assessment to predict environmental conditions, which can be used as monitoring device for the reef health. Overall the present study contributes to increase the knowledge of a long time understudied but important integrative part of the coral reef ecosystem. In the process of anthropogenic driven environmental change, further investigation of these complex communities will become crucial as they continue to spread over the reefs in the future...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to gather data on two species of birds of prey, the Red Kite Milvus milvus (RK) and the Black Kite Milvus migrans (BK), in the Tolfa Mountains (Central Italy). In 2010 - 2012 we surveyed 37 RK and 55 BK territorial pairs during the breeding season, and the communal roosts of RK in winter, within an area of 510 km 2. The breeding density of both species (mean values: 2. 32 and 3. 59 territorial pairs per 100 km 2 respectively for RK and BK) was almost constant during the study period. Laying dates of BK (9 April- 5 May) were shifted of about a month later with respect to RK (20 March- 3 April), while a marginal overlap occurred in fledging periods between the species. Most of nests were clumped in mixed loose colonies, while solitary nests were less than 20 %. Mean nearest neighbor distances between conspecific pairs were higher in RK than in BK. The lowest value of mean nearest neighbor distance was found between heterospecific pairs. Nest dispersion patterns showed a progressive increase in clustering, from RK to BK, and up to reciprocal interspecific nest distribution. Mean productivity and breeding success were slightly higher for RK. No influence of BK neighbors on RK productivity and breeding success was observed. Prey remains and pellets were collected under 11 RK and 9 BK nests occupied by breeding pairs to compare their food diets. Birds (50 %) and other small terrestrial vertebrates represented the largest part of biomass consumed by both the species. The proportion of food items coming from waste dumps (mainly slaughterhouse refuses) was higher in the diet of BK (23 %) than in RK (15 %). Analyses, performed both on number and biomass of food items, grouped into 11 taxonomic and weight classes, showed similar niche breadth and wide niche overlap between the two species. Habitat features were measured within a circular plot of 0. 04 ha (radius 11. 29 m) surrounding 15 RK and 21 BK nests occupied by breeding pairs. Moreover GIS analyses were performed on habitat features within circular buffers of 200 m and 500 m ray around each nest by means of Land Use Map. Due to nest clustering usually observed in the study area, the variables measured at nest tree and within the plot showed only marginal differences, while the wide overlap of buffers around the nests didn’t permit to detect significant differences. An evaluation of habitat suitability in the Tolfa Mountains is needed to assess if nest clusters of kite pairs were determined by scarce availability of suitable sites or by other factors, even intrinsic factors, like the heterospecific attraction. More reliable analyses would be needed to estimate food resources availability, but the relevant observed overlap occurred when the amount of preys was probably the highest in the year (mainly large insects, nestlings of other birds and snakes). Moreover, although an evaluation of habitat suitability in the Tolfa Mountains is needed, the extension and distribution of woodlands over the study area didn’t seem to represent a limiting factor, and the clustered interspecific nest dispersion could be due to other factors, even intrinsic, like the heterospecific attraction. The complexity of the <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> observed should be taken into account in planning conservation actions...|$|R
40|$|To date, {{there was}} no {{information}} available on the diversity and molecular characterization of fungi associated with oil palm decay. This study appeared {{as a response to}} that need for essential information on the overall, global biodiversity of fungi associated with oil palm decay. In this study, 5 isolates from 30 fresh samples from the Tanah- Gambus estates (infested fresh tissues and fruiting bodies) seemed to be Ganoderma boninense. In general, the strains isolated belonged to the class of the Ascomycetes and of the Mucorales. Some of these strains had a very fast growth rate (48 h), making them highly invasive, such as the genera Trichoderma or Fusarium. The PDA-Chloramphenicol medium seemed to be the most appropriate. Adaptation of the protocol developed in this study enabled us to extract DNA from all our samples using just 40 mg of mycelium of Ganoderma fruiting bodies and of fresh oil palm tissues. To date, the sequencing result for 250 samples gives a single species name and very high BLAST performance criteria (evalue, % coverage) for the best 10 results. After BLAST, we obtained 17 % the genus Ganoderma, 41 % of Ascomycetes, yeasts and other Basidiomycetes, 17 % miscellaneous (plants etc.) and 25 % of unusable sequences. An initial analysis of the <b>interspecific</b> phylogenetic <b>relations</b> of Ganoderma, based on a comparison of rDNA sequences, 5. 8 S and ITS 2, revealed clearly distinct clades where the species tended to group according {{to the nature of the}} sample and the geographical origin, particularly the species from Benin and Indonesia, and the freeze-dried samples from Indonesia.

40|$|Since {{the start}} of the industrialisation, the {{deposition}} of nitrogen and sulphur and the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased. The main objectives of this study were to find how these changes in climate and deposition can change the vegetation of mire ecosystems and the growth of Sphagnumspecies. Two main approaches were applied: re-investigated of two mires previously investigated 40 - 50 years ago and experiment manipulations. The plant species diversity had decreased on one of the two re-investigated mires (Skattlösbergs Stormosse; central Sweden), but the total number of species was unchanged on the other (Åkhultmyren; southern Sweden). On Skattlösbergs Stormosse, an acidification was found in the high pH areas, coinciding with reduction in rich fen species. At Åkhultmyren, there was a similar reduction in pH, but the changes in the plant composition also indicated increased nutrient levels and a drier mire surface. Therwere large changes in species composition on Åkhultmyren. For instance Scheuchzeria palustris had disappeared from the investigated area. Further, the cover of Scots pine (Pinusylvestris) had increased, which can be explained by a changed ground-water table regime. Monitoring of pines growing on a bog over a ten-year period showed that pines growing higher above the ground-war table had higher survival than lower-growing pines. Experimental addition of nitrogen during 3 - 4 years reduced Sphagnum growth in bogs and poor fens repressenting a wide range of ambient nitrogen deposition. A changed <b>interspecific</b> competitive <b>relation</b> was found between S. lindbergand S. balticum when increasing nitrogen influx, but the competitive relations between two hummock-growing species pairs did not change in a three-year nitrogen fertilization study. Sulphur additiodid not affect the production or length increment in S. balticum. An increased temperature reduced Sphagnum growth, but there were no indications of altered competitive relationshipbetween hummock and hollow inhabiting Sphagnum species in a four-year experiment...|$|R

In this way, some population features of Paguristes calliopsis Forest and Saint Laurent, 1968 such as size frequency distribution, sex ratio and shell occupation {{in the natural}} environment were studied. Specimens were collected by means of scuba methods in the infralittoral area of the Anchieta Island. A total of 116 individuals were analyzed. Size measurements (minimum; maximum; mean shield length ± sd, respectively) were 0. 8; 4. 5; 2. 76 ± 0. 79 mm for males and 2. 28 ± 0. 36 mm for females. The sex ratio was 1. 47 : 1 in favor of males which prevailed in the largest size classes. The hermit crabs occupied shells from eleven gastropod species and Cerithium atratum (Born 1778) was significantly the most occupied one (75. 86 %). Significant correlations were not obtained in all regression analysis, demonstrating sexual differences on fitting of the occupied shells. In the studied area P. calliopsis population is small if compared with the other hermit crab populations.

Estudos tÃm demonstrado que, vÃrias espÃcies de peixes procuram locais com habitats estruturados para se reproduzirem. Assim, este estudo teve por objetivo avaliar a influÃncia da complexidade estrutural fornecida pelas Ãrvores submersas sobre a assembleia ictioplanctÃnica na Ãrea de influÃncia de dois reservatÃrios da bacia do rio ParanÃ, demonstrando a importÃncia dos paliteiros para a reproduÃÃo da ictiofauna. As amostragens foram realizadas em locais com e sem a presenÃa de Ãrvores submersas nos reservatÃrios de MourÃo e Itaipu, entre os meses de outubro de 2009 a marÃo de 2010. Para as coletas foram utilizadas redes de plÃncton cÃnico-cilindricas de malha 0, 5 mm equipadas com medidor de fluxo para obtenÃÃo do volume de Ãgua filtrada, o processo foi realizado em arrasto contÃnuo, com uso de duas redes de plÃncton. Foram determinadas as abundÃncias de larvas, o nÃmero de espÃcies (riqueza), o Ãndice de diversidade de Shannon e determinado os tÃxons indicadores para cada ambiente analisado atravÃs do valor indicador. Para determinar se houveram diferenÃas espaciais significativas entre as mÃdias dos atributos avaliados foi aplicado um teste t. A composiÃÃo da assembleia ictioplanctÃnica nos diferentes ambientes foi sumarizada a partir de uma anÃlise de correspondÃncia (CA). Durante o estudo foram capturados 122. 099 indivÃduos, pertencentes a 22 espÃcies, seis ordens, 19 famÃlias. Destes, 78, 84 % foram indivÃduos capturados em locais sem estrutura, enquanto 21, 16 % foram capturados em locais estruturados. Para ambos os locais as espÃcies mais abundantes foram Hypophthalmus edentatus e Plagioscion squamosissimus. Os locais sem Ãrvores submersas tiveram os maiores valores de riqueza e abundÃncia de espÃcies o que indica que, as desovas podem estar ocorrendo nas Ãreas de cabeceira e que tanto os ovos como as larvas sÃo passivamente transportados por correntes de Ãgua para Ãreas de desenvolvimento, localizadas em Ãreas inferiores do reservatÃrio. Esse estudo demonstrou que, trechos com vegetaÃÃo submersa desempenham importante papel na reproduÃÃo dos peixes na Ãrea dos reservatÃrios amostrados e, por tanto, sua preservaÃÃo pode ser indispensÃvel para a representaÃÃo futura de muitas espÃcies de peixes nesses ambientes. The {{heterogeneity of}} the habitat assumes that structurally complex habitats {{can increase the}} diversity of species. In aquatic environments these complex habitats also {{play an important role}} in the biological diversity, in the <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> and in the systemâs productivity. Studies have shown that several fish species seek sites with structured habitats for their reproduction. This study intends to evaluate the influence of the structural complexity provided by submerged trees on the ichthyplankton in the influence area of two reservoirs located in Parana River basin, demonstrating the importance of such sites known as paliteiros. The samples were carried out in places with and without the presence of submerged trees from October 2009 to March 2010. For these samples, we used plankton nets with mesh size of 0. 5 mm equipped with a measurer to obtain the volume of filtered water. The process was realized with continuous drag, using two plankton nets. We determined the abundance of larvae, number of species, Shannonâs diversity index and the indicator taxons for each environment analyzed. To determine if there were any significant spatial variation we applied the t-test. The composition of the ichthyoplanktonic assemblage in the different environments was summarized based on a correspondence analysis (CA). During the study 122, 099 individuals were captured, belonging to 22 species, six orders, 19 families. Within this sample, 78. 84 % are individuals captured in environments without any structure, whereas 21. 16 % are individuals captured in structured environments. In both places the most abundant species were Hypophthalmus edentatus and Plagioscion squamosissimus. The places with submerged trees presented the highest values in richness and abundance of species, which indicates that spawning may have been occurring in headwaters located in areas with submerged vegetation, and that eggs, as well as larvae, are passively carried by water flows to development areas, located at lower areas in the reservoir. This study indicates that areas with submerged vegetation play a very important part in fish reproduction in the sampled reservoirs and, therefore, their preservation may be indispensable for the future presence of many fish species in these environments...|$|R

We investigated {{the relationship between}} intraspecific and interspecific aggregation in 17 component communities (the flea assemblage of a host population) of fleas parasitic on small mammals and hypothesized that interspecific interactions should be reduced relative to intraspecific interactions, facilitating species coexistence. We predicted that {{the reduction of the}} level of <b>interspecific</b> aggregation in <b>relation</b> to the level of intraspecific aggregation would be positively correlated with total flea abundance and species richness of flea assemblages. We also expected that the higher degree of facilitation of flea coexistence would be affected by host parameters such as body mass, basal metabolic rate (BMR) and depth and complexity of burrows. Results of this study supported the aggregation model of coexistence and demonstrated that, in general, a) conspecific fleas were aggregated across their hosts; b) flea assemblages were not dominated by negative interspecific interactions; and c) the level of interspecific aggregation in flea assemblages was reduced in relation to the level of intraspecific aggregation. Intraspecific aggregation tended to be correlated positively to body mass, burrow complexity and mass-independent BMR of a host. Positive interspecific associations of fleas tended to occur more frequently in species-rich flea assemblages and/or in larger hosts possessing deep complex burrows. Intraspecific aggregation increased relative to interspecific aggregation when species richness of flea infracommunities (the flea assemblage of a host individual) and component communities increased. We conclude that the pattern of flea coexistence is related both to the structure of flea communities and affinities of host species...|$|R

As glândulas dos vegetais são classificadas {{conforme}} o tipo de substâncias que secretam. Estas estruturas são encontradas na face adaxial dos pecíolos de Himatanthus obovatus (Mull. Arg.) Woodson e Tabernaemontana solanifolia A. DC. (Apocynaceae), bem como em estípulas de Palicourea rigida Kunth e Tocoyena formosa (Cham. & Schltdl.) K. Schum. (Rubiaceae). Estas quatro espécies nativas são muito comuns no Cerrado e suas glândulas ainda não foram caracterizadas. O objetivo do presente trabalho é caracterizar as glândulas destas plantas, por meio da morfo-anatomia, inclusive microscopia eletrônica de varredura (MEV), observações ecológicas e identificar a natureza química e a ação biológica de suas secreções. Amostras das glândulas foram fixadas, desidratadas e metalizadas para análise sob MEV, onde os cristais foram analisados por espectroscopia de energia dispersiva (energy dispersive spectroscopy, EDS). A análise anatômica foi realizada mediante inclusão em parafina utilizando cortes seriados. Cortes das glândulas frescas foram obtidos em micrótomo e submetidos aos testes histoquímicos. As imagens dos cortes foram obtidas sob fotomicroscópio com sistema de captura. Observações de campo, especialmente em H. obovatus, foram registradas por anotações, fotografias e filmes. As secreções de H. obovatus, P. rigida e T. formosa foram removidas das glândulas e liofilizadas. A matéria seca foi quantificada e foram realizados testes bioquímicos. Realizaram-se bioensaios com a secreção de P. rigida e T. formosa, usando-se os fungos fitopatogênicos Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc e duas cepas de Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. As secreções das glândulas reagiram positivamente ao vermelho de rutênio, o que evidencia as mucilagens ácidas. A composição das secreções, assim como a morfologia das glândulas possibilitaram sua identificação como coléteres. Eles são típicas emergências, constituídos por um núcleo parenquimático, revestido por epiderme em paliçada, exceto em P. rigida, onde foi constatado coléter do tipo "simples", não relatado na literatura, que possivelmente representa uma condição derivada em relação às emergências. Coléteres do tipo padrão ("standard") foram constatados, todos sem poros em sua superfície. Em T. formosa, eles possuem pedúnculo. Os coléteres em P. rigida são vascularizados, com um feixe xilemático central e floema. Os coléteres em P. rigida possuem cristais prismáticos e ráfides, constituídos por cálcio, níquel, nióbio e alumínio, conforme análise em EDS. Aparentemente este é um relato inédito da presença destes três últimos elementos na constituição química de cristais em plantas. Os testes histoquímicos revelaram pectinas, substâncias lipídicas e proteínas nas secreções dos coléteres das quatro espécies. Açúcares redutores foram verificados em H. obovatus e T. solanifolia e alcalóides em P. rigida e compostos fenólicos em T. solanifolia. A metodologia de obtenção das secreções foi muito satisfatória, sendo vantajoso seu uso em estudos fitoquímicos. As maiores quantidades de secreção obtidas foram de 500 mg para P. rigida e T. formosa. As quantidades médias de matéria seca das secreções, seus açúcares solúveis totais e proteínas foram, respectivamente, para cada espécie: H. obovatus – 0, 68 mg/pecíolo, 69, 2 μg/mg e 82, 9 μg/mg; P. rigida – 5 mg/gema, 162, 2 μg/mg e 76, 8 μg/mg; T. formosa – 13, 8 mg/gema, 174 μg/mg e 89 μg/mg (quantidades por mg de secreção). Os monossacarídeos detectados foram fucose nas três espécies analisadas e manose, arabinose e xylose em H. obovatus. Os bioensaios mostraram diferenças discretas, mas significativas entre o controle e o tratamento com as secreções. Formigas foram encontradas nos pecíolos de H. obovatus, onde permaneceram paradas e secreção foi constatada em seu aparelho bucal. Defesa do território também foi um comportamento observado. Os resultados indicam que as secreções dos coléteres estudados são de natureza química complexa, onde mucilagens, lipídios, proteínas e açúcares solúveis estão presentes. Os coléteres encontrados em H. obovatus, cujas secreções apresentaram as menores quantidades de açúcares solúveis e as maiores quantidades de fucose, estabelecem relações interespecíficas entre esta planta e várias espécies de formigas, que podem estar utilizando suas secreções como fonte alimentar, ou outra finalidade. O significado ecológico e evolutivo dos resultados é discutido. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTThe glands of {{the plants}} are classified according {{to the type of}} substances which secrete. These structures are found in the adaxial side of petioles from Himatanthus obovatus (Mull. Arg.) Woodson and Tabernaemontana solanifolia A. DC. (Apocynaceae), as well as in stipules of Palicourea rigida Kunth and Tocoyena formosa (Cham. & Schltdl.) K. Schum. (Rubiaceae). These four native species are very common in the Cerrado and their glands have not yet been characterized. The objective {{of this study is to}} characterize the glands of these plants, by means of the morphology and anatomy, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), ecological observations and identify the chemical nature and the biological action of their secretions. Samples of the glands were fixed, dehydrated and metallized for analysis under SEM, where the crystals were analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (energy dispersive spectroscopy, EDS). The anatomical analysis was performed on paraffin inclusion using serial sections. Sections of fresh glands were obtained in a and subjected to histochemical tests. The images of the cuts were obtained under fotomicroscopio with capture system. Observations from field, especially in H. obovatus were recorded by annotations, photos and movies. The secretions of H. obovatus, P. rigida and T. formosa were removed from glands and lyophilized. The dry matter was quantified and were carried out biochemical tests. Bioassays were performed with the secretion of P. rigida and T. formosa, using the phytopathogenic effects on succeeding fungi Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. and two strains of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. The secretions from glands reacted positively to the red of ruthenium, which highlights the mucilage acidic. The composition of secretions, as well as the morphology of glands allowed its identification as colleters. They are typical emergencies, consisting of a core parenchymatous, coated by epidermis in palisade, except in P. rigida, where it was found coleter of type "simple", not reported in the literature, which possibly represents a derived condition in relation to emergencies. Colleters standard type (“standard") were found, all without pores on its surface. In T. formosa, they have flower stalk. Colleters in P. rigida are vascularized, with a central vascular and phloem. Colleters in P. rigida have prismatic crystals and rafides, consisting of calcium, nickel, niobium and aluminum, as analysis in EDS. Apparently this is a unpublished report of the presence of these last three elements in the constitution chemistry of crystals in plants. The histochemical tests revealed pectins, lipid and protein in the secretions of colleters of the four species. Reducing sugars were recorded in H. obovatus and T. solanifolia, alkaloids in P. rigida and phenolic compounds in T. solanifolia. The methodology for obtaining secretions was very satisfactory, being advantageous its use in studies phytochemicals. The largest quantities of secretion were obtained from 500 mg to P. rigida and T. formosa. The average amounts of dry matter of secretions, its soluble sugars and total proteins were, respectively, for each species: H. obovatus - 0. 68 mg/petiole, 69. 2 μg/mg and 82. 9 μg/mg; P. rigida - 5 mg/gema, 162. 2 μg/mg and 76. 8 μg/mg; T. formosa - 13. 8 mg/gema, 174, 2 μg/mg, and 89 μg/mg (quantities per mg of secretion). Monosaccharides detected were fucose in the three species analyzed and mannose, arabinose and xylose in H. obovatus. The bioassays showed differences discreet but significant between the control and the treatment with the secretions. Ants were found in petioles of H. obovatus, where they remained standing and secretion was observed in its mouthparts. Defense of the territory was also an observed behavior. The results indicate that the secretions of colleters studied are of chemical nature complex, where mucilage, lipids, proteins and soluble sugars are present. Colleters found in H. obovatus, whose secretions showed the smallest quantities of soluble sugars and the largest quantities of fucose, establish <b>interspecific</b> <b>relations</b> between this plant and several species of ants, which may be using their secretions as a food source, or other purpose. The ecological and evolutionary significance of the results are discussed...|$|R
