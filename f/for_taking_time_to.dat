But the King on this occasion was true to his word. He gave Egede a private audience, and in 1719 sent orders to the magistrates of Bergen to collect all the opinions and information that could be gathered in regard to the trade with Greenland and the propriety of establishing a colony there, with a statement of the privileges that might be desired by adventurers wishing to settle in the new land. But, alas! no adventurers wished to settle there; the royal efforts failed, and poor Egede was left to fall back on his own exertions and private enterprise.|$|E

'You understand,' he says, 'that {{if it had been}} to the table of some friend not so prosperous as Mr. Dryfoos--your friend Mr. March, for instance--it would have been sufficient to know that he was your friend. But in these days it is a duty that a gentleman owes himself to consider whether he wishes to know a rich man or not. The chances of making money disreputably are so great that the chances are against a man who has made money if he's made a great deal of it.'" ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{a country}} once ruled by Spain, Filipinos are greatly {{influenced}} by the Christian Religion. Even though not closely related, Filipinos/Filipino Americans relate the values of sports with the similar values of religion. It brings in {{the connection between the}} body and the soul. One major religious figure, Pope John Paul II, preached of the harmony of one's body and soul. He advocated sports, athletics, outdoor activity for the significance of human values and the spiritual ideals. One formation of values developed spiritually is the building of self-confidence and self-esteem. The building of self-confidence and self-esteem can help with the building of deep spiritual faith. Sports for Filipino American can be the stepping stones of transforming Filipino values and developing them in relationship with Gospel values. An example would be the value of samahan or kupunan, which means group or team, in which it could lead to a Christian bonding that goes beyond the years of playing as an athlete. The term sama-sama, togetherness, which is used in concept of being a team is also redirected as being together or being in a community with God. Under God and sama-sama, can other Filipino values be nurtured and strengthened. A common example would be Manny Pacquiao, who is deep with his faith. Again, the term [...] "debt of gratitude", or Utang na loob, {{can be seen as a}} gift received from God and as a Christian, one must reciprocate what has been given to you. It is to be grateful to the mentors or coaches <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> develop your skills. Pope John Paul explains how one must be grateful to God who grants the giver physical strength and intellectual talents to play sports. In accordance to lakas ng loob, or perseverance, is the spiritual value of it which is building courage that is rooted in faith. Filipino Americans who believe in God may find his own strengths in sports through the Lord and deem it an act of his divine power and as a gift from Him. Sports for FIlipino Americans can be seen in a religious lense which becomes a path towards prayer and worship. The Filipino value Panggalang, meaning respect, comes from the long line of tradition of respecting elders and God's commandment of honoring one's father and mother. This then connects to honoring one's mentor or coach that has guided one through whichever sport chosen.|$|E
