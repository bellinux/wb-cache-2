500|$|The use {{of so many}} cover {{songs to}} fill up the album was a common feature at the time, because of the short time given to bands for songwriting and for the rushed {{schedules}} of production. The songs covered in the album were all treated with new arrangements to be considerably longer and sound more grandiose than the originals, {{in an attempt to}} emulate the American rock band Vanilla Fudge, which many Deep Purple members admired. [...] "Hush" [...] and [...] "Help!" [...] are clear examples of the [...] "Vanilla Fudge style of slowing a song down and bluesing it up" [...] to get a more psychedelic sound. The sound of the band was also heavily influenced by classical music: [...] "I'm So Glad" [...] is introduced by [...] "Prelude: Happiness", featuring an <b>electric</b> <b>arrangement</b> inspired by the first movement of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov's symphonic suite Scheherazade; the cover of [...] "Hey Joe" [...] was arranged inserting parts taken from the Miller's Dance, suite no. 2, part 2 of El sombrero de tres picos ballet by Manuel de Falla, on a rhythm reminiscent of the Boléro by Maurice Ravel.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rock and}} comedy songs [...] "Mystery Roach", [...] "Lonesome Cowboy Burt", [...] "Daddy, Daddy, Daddy", [...] "What Will This Evening Bring Me This Morning" [...] and [...] "Magic Fingers", and the finale [...] "Strictly Genteel", which mixes orchestral and rock elements, were noted as {{highlights}} of the album by reviewer Richie Unterberger. François Couture, a reviewer for Allmusic, said that [...] "Mystery Roach" [...] contains multiple meanings, {{all of which have}} a connection to lyrical subject matter in Zappa's discography. These include the freshwater fish, as the Mothers of Invention live album Fillmore East - June 1971 contained a song referring to the mud shark, a cannabis cigarette butt, which causes the character Jeff to go crazy {{within the context of the}} film's storyline, and a combed roll hairstyle, which connects the song lyrically to [...] "Jelly Roll Gumdrop", a song from Cruising with Ruben & the Jets. The version featured on the album is different from the version featured in the film, as it is missing small electric guitar solos by Zappa, and was not scripted as part of the film in its <b>electric</b> <b>arrangement,</b> having originally been written in three separate, unused acoustic blues-oriented arrangements. The song was not performed live.|$|E

5000|$|... "Rockin' in the Free World" [...] {{is a song}} by Neil Young, {{released}} on his 1989 album Freedom.
