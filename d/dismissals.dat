50|$|Lord Mackay {{held the}} <b>dismissal</b> was unfair.

5|$|Tallon responded {{during the}} 193839 season by equalling two world records. The season started poorly for Queensland, not winning {{any of their}} first three matches. Tallon made eight <b>dismissals</b> in the opening match of the Sheffield Shield {{campaign}} against New South Wales, but the visitors hung on for a draw with one wicket in hand. After two consecutive losses, Tallon set {{the first of his}} world records. Against New South Wales in Sydney, he dismissed 12 batsmen, six in each innings, a feat performed only once before, in 1868 by Surrey's Ted Pooley. Tallon's dozen included three stumpings and he was at the crease when Queensland hit the winning runs to complete their first victory in two years. After nine innings during the season without passing 36, Tallon returned to form with the bat, scoring 115 against South Australia, but was unable to take the field in the second innings due to injury as the match ended in a ten-wicket defeat. In the final match of the season, Tallon became the fourth keeper to make seven <b>dismissals</b> in an innings, in a match against Victoria. He did not concede a bye in the innings of 348, and scored 44 as Queensland completed an innings win. Tallon finished the season with 34 <b>dismissals</b> in six matches, setting a new Australian season record. He took more than five <b>dismissals</b> in an innings in four of the ten innings in which he kept wicket. Observers noted Tallon to be more motivated than ever; his catching and stumping style became more animated, and his appealing reached new levels of sound. He passed 100 first-class <b>dismissals</b> during the season, achieved in just 32 matchesthe fastest Australian to reach the mark. Tallon ended the season with 305 runs at 30.50.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1934, Tallon {{moved to}} Brisbane, where {{he worked as a}} {{storeman}} for a car company. In 193536, Tallon was Queensland's top batsman in terms of both runs and batting average, scoring 569runs at an average of 51.72. He started well with 58 in a drawn match against New South Wales, and then scored 45 and made six <b>dismissals</b> in an innings as Queensland fell to an innings defeat against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), including five stumpings. He then made four <b>dismissals</b> in an innings in the next match against Victoria.|$|E

5|$|Upon Tallon's {{return to}} Australia, {{he made an}} unbeaten 146 in Bradman's Testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948. He {{featured}} in a tenth-wicket partnership of 100 with Geff Noblet, who scored only nine as Tallon farmed the strike effectively. This saw the match scores tied on the last ball of the match. Tallon also made seven <b>dismissals</b> for the match. Queensland lost more than they won during the season, but Tallon continued to be productive, scoring 453 runs at 34.85 and making 26 <b>dismissals</b> in seven matches.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Gilchrist was {{dismissed}} {{for a single}} run in the semi-final against South Africa, despite which Australia won by seven wickets. As wicket-keeper, however, he took four catches, equalling the most <b>dismissals</b> in one match in the tournament and bringing his total for the tournament to 14, second behind Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of using <b>dismissal</b> taxes to finance {{unemployment}} benefits. We compare <b>dismissal</b> and employment taxes in a model with search frictions. Employment taxes give rise to externalities because firms do {{not take into account}} the effects their <b>dismissal</b> decisions have on others. By introducing <b>dismissal</b> taxes to finance unemployment insurance, these externalities can partly be internalized. Taking into account the budget of the unemployment insurance, employment taxes can be reduced by more than necessary to offset the adverse effect of <b>dismissal</b> taxes on the firm value. The introduction of <b>dismissal</b> taxes leads to higher job creation and lower unemployment, in contrast to standard results concerning employment protection. employment protection, search and matching models, unemployment, unemployment insurance...|$|R
50|$|The unfair <b>dismissal</b> claim would, {{if he is}} well advised, be {{in respect}} of the post-termination period and sue in court for {{wrongful}} <b>dismissal</b> in respect of the notice period, thus stretching out the statutory limits by making the unfair <b>dismissal</b> limit only start running from a later date to allow perhaps more loss of earnings and ignoring the breach of contract limit by using the court instead of tribunal to deal with wrongful <b>dismissal.</b> The burden of proving double recovery is on the employer and tribunal awards for unfair <b>dismissal</b> can be vague as to what {{and when they are}} for.|$|R

5|$|In the Second Test at Cape Town, Gilchrist struck 138 from 108 {{balls to}} set up a first innings lead and {{eventual}} four-wicket win. He then top-scored with 91 in the Third Test, and although Australia lost the match, Gilchrist ended the series with an astonishing 473 at 157.66 from just 474 balls, in addition to 14 <b>dismissals.</b>|$|E
5|$|In this role, Gilchrist {{is perhaps}} {{disadvantaged}} by his relatively tall stature for a pure wicket-keeper. However, while perhaps not as elegant as some, he has successfully kept wicket for spin bowler Shane Warne and fast bowlers Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee {{for most of}} his international career. His partnerships with McGrath and Lee are second and fourth respectively in both test and ODI history for the number of wickets taken. With Alec Stewart and Mark Boucher, he shares the record for most catches (6) by a wicketkeeper in a ODI match, however he has now achieved this feat five times, the most recent versus India in 2008 CB Series. The match in 2007 was also the second time he took six <b>dismissals</b> and scored a half century in the same ODI; he remains the only player to do so even once. At Old Trafford in August 2005, he passed Alec Stewart's world record of 4,540 runs as a Test wicketkeeper, Statistically, he is currently the most successful ODI wicket-keeper in history; with 417 catches and 55 stumpings, a total of 472 <b>dismissals,</b> his closest rival, Mark Boucher, is more than 80 <b>dismissals</b> behind.|$|E
