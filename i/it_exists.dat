5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> today, UBS {{represents}} a conglomeration {{of dozens of}} individual firms, many of which {{date back to the}} 19th century.

5|$|Helium (He) is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert {{monatomic}} {{chemical element}} that heads the noble gas {{series in the}} periodic table and whose atomic number is 2.

5|$|M-88 is an {{original}} trunkline {{dating back to}} the 1919 signing of the state system. An extension in the 1920s and paving in the late 1930s created the highway as <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> today.

5|$|Psilocybin is an {{alkaloid}} that is soluble in water, methanol and aqueous ethanol, but insoluble {{in organic}} solvents like chloroform and petroleum ether. Its pKa values {{are estimated to}} be 1.3 and 6.5 for the two successive phosphate OH groups and 10.4 for the dimethylamine nitrogen, so in general <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> as a zwitterionic structure.|$|E
5|$|The 7th Infantry Division is an {{infantry}} {{division of the}} United States Army. Today, <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> as a unique 250-man deployable headquarters at Joint Base Lewis-McChord overseeing several units, though none of the 7th Infantry Division's own historic forces are active.|$|E

5|$|UBS, as <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> today, is {{the result}} of a complex history {{representing}} a merger product of the Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation in June 1998 (SBC).

5|$|Yttrium {{isotopes}} {{are among}} the most common products of the nuclear fission of uranium in nuclear explosions and nuclear reactors. In the context of nuclear waste management, the most important isotopes of yttrium are 91Y and 90Y, with half-lives of 58.51days and 64hours, respectively. Though 90Y has a short half-life, <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> in secular equilibrium with its long-lived parent isotope, strontium-90 (90Sr) with a half-life of 29years.|$|E

5|$|Boron nitride is a heat- and {{chemically}} resistant refractory compound of boron and nitrogen with the chemical formula BN. <b>It</b> <b>exists</b> in various crystalline forms that are isoelectronic to a similarly structured carbon lattice. The hexagonal form corresponding to graphite {{is the most}} stable and soft among BN polymorphs, and is therefore used as a lubricant and an additive to cosmetic products. The cubic (sphalerite structure) variety analogous to diamond is called c-BN; it is softer than diamond, but its thermal and chemical stability is superior. The rare wurtzite BN modification is similar to lonsdaleite and may even be harder than the cubic form.|$|E
5|$|Cross {{was born}} in Madoc, Ontario to {{merchant}} Thomas Cross and his wife, Marie Mouncey. He studied at Upper Canada College, the University of Toronto, and Osgoode Hall Law School. He moved west to Edmonton in 1897, where he opened a law practice with William Short; <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> today as Duncan Craig LLP. When {{the idea of creating}} one or more new provinces out of the Northwest Territories gained currency, Cross was one of three people selected by Edmonton City Council to travel to Ottawa and ensure that Edmonton's interests were respected.|$|E
5|$|Freemasonry, as <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> {{in various}} forms all over the world, has a {{membership}} estimated by the United Grand Lodge of England at around six million worldwide. The fraternity is administratively organised into independent Grand Lodges (or sometimes Grand Orients), each of which governs its own Masonic jurisdiction, which consists of subordinate (or constituent) Lodges. The largest single jurisdiction, in terms of membership, is the United Grand Lodge of England (with a membership estimated at around a quarter million). The Grand Lodge of Scotland and Grand Lodge of Ireland (taken together) have approximately 150,000 members. In the United States, total membership is just under two million.|$|E

5|$|On September 8, 2001, Titania occulted {{a bright}} star (HIP106829) with a visible {{magnitude}} of 7.2; {{this was an}} opportunity to both refine Titania's diameter and ephemeris, and to detect any extant atmosphere. The data revealed no atmosphere to a surface pressure of 1–2 mPa (10–20 nbar); if <b>it</b> <b>exists,</b> {{it would have to be}} far thinner than that of Triton or Pluto. This upper limit is still several times higher than the maximum possible surface pressure of the carbon dioxide, meaning that the measurements place essentially no constraints on parameters of the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if <b>it</b> <b>exists,</b> is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice is thus not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study {{to determine if they}} are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|The {{botanic garden}} {{may be an}} {{independent}} institution, a governmental operation, or affiliated to a college or university.

In any case, <b>it</b> <b>exists</b> for scientific ends and is not to be restricted or diverted by other demands. It is not merely a landscaped or ornamental garden, although it may be artistic, nor is it an experiment station or yet a park with labels on the plants. The essential element is the intention of the enterprise, which is the acquisition and dissemination of botanical knowledge.|$|E
