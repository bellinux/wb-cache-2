In order to increase the overall diesel yield, {{it is necessary to}} perform a subsequent hydrocracking of the long-chain linear paraffins. This work is focused on characterization and testing of catalysts for the hydrocracking reaction of Fischer-Tropsch waxes. In particular, noble metal catalyst based on Pt and Pd on amorphous silica-alumina support were tested. Palladium based catalysts performed nearly an ideal bifunctional mechanism, while platinum based catalysts performed another way of cracking: hydrogenolysis. Platinum based catalysts are more active than palladium ones, with the same metal loading. This is a consequence {{of the nature of the}} metal sites. The product distribution is similar for both platinum and palladium catalysts. However, due to the hydrogenolysis cracking mechanism performed by platinum based catalysts, the amount of light gases produced on platinum based catalysts is higher. Furthermore, the deactivation behavior of the Platinum and Palladium catalysts has been studied, and the results showed that the dispersion of the active phase decreased with deactivation and the average crystallite diameter increased. This means a decrease in activity. A regeneration program, temperature programmed oxidation (TPO), has been carried out demonstrating that the activity was not completely recovered...|$|E

Non-renewable energy sources, like petroleum being the main source of energy, have become scarce due to their overuse and limited available reserve. Water hyacinth can be considered as a good source of lignocellulosic biomass. Cellulose and hemi-cellulose derived from water hyacinth via effective bioprocess can be converted to bioethanol. Production of liquid <b>fuel</b> <b>from</b> <b>biomass</b> can only be made economically viable and sustainable only if the de-polymerization of the recalcitrant hemi-cellulosic fraction of the biomass can be optimally utilized. The study aims to obtain an in-depth mechanistic understanding of the catalytic reaction involved in dilute sulphuric acid pre-treatment of water hyacinth biomass. Acid catalysed hemi-cellulose hydrolysis reaction kinetics in water hyacinth was studied based on a bi-phasic model. Arrhenius equation was used to study the kinetic modelling in a greater depth.

40|$|Abstract: Production of {{aviation}} biofuels has been strongly {{encouraged by the}} volatility of oil prices and environmental concerns. Brazilian society, companies, and government are taking a step forward {{in the production of}} renewable jet <b>fuel</b> <b>from</b> <b>biomass</b> feedstocks largely available in the territory. This study evaluated the use of different feedstocks (sugar crops, oil crops, and lignocellulosic biomass) for co-production of biojet fuel and higher value-added products in a bioreﬁ nery platform. The coproduction of biofuels and biochemicals in a bioreﬁnery context was demonstrated to be economically feasible. The main cost drivers of such a platform are feedstock biomass cost, selling price of the biochemicals, investment costs, and key process-inherent parameters such as conversion yields, obtained fermentable sugars, or oil content in the feedstock. Sugarcane was the most promising feedstock for a bioreﬁnery in the region of Minas Gerais, while soybean was the most promising feedstock for a bioreﬁnery in the region of Rio Grande do Sul, despite its higher uncertainty. Succinic acid was the most promising chemical intermediate for biopolymers industry due to its relatively high market value, unique market opportunity as a substitute of conventional petrochemicals, and forecast for future growth. Ethanol-to-jet (ETJ) and hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA) were the most attractive biojet fuel production routes in the present study.
