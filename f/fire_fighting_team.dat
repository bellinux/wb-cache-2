40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the initial emergency response time of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>teams</b> in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach– In an emergency incident time is of the essence, and the basic philosophy of an emergency response agency is to respond as quickly as possible to minimize the loss of life and property damage. In the current study, emergency response performance refers to team members’ speed in responding to emergency situations, which was measured as the time taken for the team members to get to the fire truck from the waiting room in selected fire stations in Malaysia. The data collection period lasted for five months. Findings – This study found that the overall average initial emergency response time was 84 seconds, while the overall average weighted initial emergency response time was 3. 71 seconds per meter. The current study has demonstrated that the average initial emergency response performed by <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>teams</b> in Malaysia is apparently better than that reported by previous studies by other emergency responders. Originality/value – This paper presents empirical evidence of the initial emergency response time of fire fighters in Malaysia, by taking into account the distance traveled by the responders. As such, the performance measure obtained gives a meaningful indicator. The finding of the current study is then compared to emergency response performance by other emergency response agencies in other countries...|$|R

[...] "Fuel quenching", by allowing landfill gas build-up, can work well, especially in conjunction with maintenance of the daily cover of soil or material places on landfills. However, this oxygen suppression method can be compromised if cracks develop in the soil cover due to settlement.|$|E

The progression of the fire-fighters through the corridor and the main-room suppression attack - in particular the effect of short, medium and long water pulses on either the hot gas layer or the fire seat - was charted against the compartment temperatures, heat release rates, oxygen levels and toxic species concentrations.

Air pollution in coal fire is mainly due to the fugitive {{emission of particulate matter}} and gases including sulphur dioxide (SO 2) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The traditional methods, executed by <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>teams</b> by covering the coal fire areas with soil, excavated burning coal outcrops and injecting water in the coal seam fires are continuously improved. Initiatives to introduce modern techniques, such as backfill placement at fracture and coal seam to cool down the burning coal and cut off air supply.

40|$|Purpose ‐ This paper aims to {{determine}} the influence of physical ability on initial emergency response performance among emergency response teams. Design/methodology/approach ‐ In an emergency incident, emergency responders are involved in vigorous physical activities. Previous attempts have demonstrated that job performance of emergency responders depends a great deal on their ability to perform strenuous physical activity. This paper examines the influence of physical ability namely weight, height, and cardiovascular endurance on emergency response performance among <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>teams</b> in Malaysia. Emergency response performance was defined as team member's speed in responding to emergency situations. Data on team member's physical ability and emergency response time were collected for the duration of five months. The distance from the waiting room to the fire truck in each selected fire station was used to measure performance. Findings ‐ This study found that the team with higher average weight and cardiovascular endurance level had better initial response to emergency situations, contrary to the research hypothesis. But it is speculated that the relationship could be further understood by considering the proportion of fat in the body. The relationship between cardiovascular endurance and initial emergency response performance further validates and justifies the use of physical fitness test as a criterion for job performance of fire fighters. Originality/value ‐ This paper offers empirical evidence of emergency response performance in Malaysia. Specifically, it presents findings on the influence of physical ability measures on initial emergency response performance from a team perspective. In addition, the emergency response performance was measured by the distance traveled by the responders, which serves as a meaningful performance indicator...|$|R
40|$|For {{years the}} use of {{remotely}} sensed data has been showing to be a suitable tool for detecting and monitoring forest fires thanks to the satellite possibility of surveying Earth surface at a global scale and supervising even inaccessible areas where traditional ground-based surveillance systems are not practicable. Anyway, a rapid and reliable satellite-based methodology for fire detection is {{required in order to}} provide an effective support to decision makers and local agencies in better managing ongoing events. Rapidity is desirable to assure that <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>teams</b> could extinguish <b>fires</b> before they expand too much; reliability is necessary in order to guarantee that the solicited efforts are addressed to actual fires and not to false alarms. In this context, the combination of the Robust Satellite Technique (RST), able to identify such events with very high reliability, and satellite sensors with high temporal resolution seems to assure both a reliable and a timely detection of abrupt Middle Infrared (MIR) transients related to fires. The RST approach, based on a multi-temporal analysis of co-located satellite records, has already demonstrated good performances in many cases of applications. For the first time a Total Validation Approach (TVA) has been experimented in order to verify the actual presence and nature of thermal sources responsible for detected anomalies. TVA implementation was possible thanks to the collaboration with administrators, decision makers and local agencies, which made dedicated light aircraft surveys and voluntary teams available for direct ground observations, allowing us a systematic study of the origin of each hot spot identified by RST. Some remarkable cases from recent campaigns in Italy will be shown and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a review of}} research into, and application of, a three dimensional (3 D) water fog technique for firefighting. The impact of water fog characteristics associated with properties of the nozzle (e. g., droplet size, momentum, flow rate, spray angle and pattern) and discharge techniques (e. g., discharge angle, and discharge duration related to the bursts) on performance of the 3 D water fog technique are discussed. Potential use of numerical computer studies to help understand and improve this technique is also reviewed and discussed. The 3 D water fog technique is not designed to replace the direct fire attack but rather to complement existing forms of fire attack {{in an effort to}} increase the safety and effectiveness of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> <b>teams.</b> Compared to the traditional straight-stream attack, the 3 D water fog technique has advantages in controlling steadily growing fires where the space can still be entered, but where the seat of the fire cannot be attacked directly. It has also been used for offensive attack to control flashover. However, there is not sufficient research to evaluate its capabilities in other fire scenarios, such as reducing the likelihood of backdraft, and in controlling fire threats in low visibility scenarios. Research on the effects of the nozzle type, application techniques and fire conditions on the performance of the 3 D water fog tactic is also very limited. Further research efforts, including both experimental and numerical studies, can help firefighters understand how to most effectively use this technique and also help to improve its performance in firefighting.
