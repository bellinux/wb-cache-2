5|$|The {{man-made}} chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) may be compromising {{the immune system}} of bottlenose dolphins. PFOS affects the immune system of male mice at a concentration of 91.5 ppb, while PFOS {{has been reported in}} bottlenose dolphins in excess of 1 ppm. High levels of metal contaminants have been measured in tissues {{in many areas of the}} globe. A recent study found high levels of cadmium and mercury in bottlenose dolphins from South Australia, levels which were later <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with kidney malformations, indicating possible health effects of high heavy metal concentrations in dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>associated</b> with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Both {{positive}} smoking outcome expectancies and metacognitions about smoking have <b>been</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> with cigarette use and nicotine dependence. The goal of {{this study}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> test a model including nicotine dependence and number of daily cigarettes as dependent variables, anxiety and depression as independent variables, and smoking outcome expectancies and metacognitions about smoking as mediators between the independents and dependents. METHODS: The sample consisted of 524 self-declared smokers who scored 3 or above on the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND: Uysal et al., 2004). RESULTS: Anxiety <b>was</b> not <b>associated</b> with either cigarette use or nicotine dependence but <b>was</b> positively <b>associated</b> with all mediators {{with the exception of}} stimulation state enhancement and social facilitation. Depression, on the other hand, <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> with nicotine dependence (and very weakly to cigarette use) but <b>was</b> not <b>associated</b> with either smoking outcome expectancies or metacognitions about smoking. Only one smoking outcome expectancy (negative affect reduction) <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> with nicotine dependence but not cigarette use. Furthermore one smoking outcome expectancy (negative social impression) <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> with cigarette use (but not to nicotine dependence). All metacognitions about smoking <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> with nicotine dependence. Moreover, negative metacognitions about uncontrollability <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> positively <b>associated</b> with cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: Metacognitions about smoking appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a stronger mediator than smoking outcome expectancies in the relationship between negative affect and cigarette use/nicotine dependence.
