Our fortunes, accumulated in one generation, are dispersed in the next. If it takes three generations to make a gentleman one will not make a thinker.

60|$|THREE MONTHS LATER.--The perplexity augments {{instead of}} diminishing. I sleep but little. It has ceased from lying around, and goes about on its four legs now. Yet it {{differs from the}} other four legged animals, in that its front legs are unusually short, {{consequently}} this causes {{the main part of}} its person to stick up uncomfortably high in the air, and this is not attractive. It is built much as we are, but its method of traveling shows that it is not of our breed. The short front legs and long hind ones indicate that it is a of the kangaroo family, but it is a marked variation of that species, since the true kangaroo hops, whereas this one never does. Still it is a curious and interesting variety, and has not been catalogued before. As I discovered it, I have felt justified in securing the credit of the discovery by attaching my name to it, and hence have called it KANGAROORUM ADAMIENSIS.... It must have been a young one when it came, for it has grown exceedingly since. It must be five times as big, now, as it was then, and when discontented it is able to make from twenty-two to thirty-eight times the noise it made at first. Coercion does not modify this, but has the contrary effect. For this reason I discontinued the system. She reconciles it by persuasion, and by giving it things which she had previously told me she wouldn't give it. As already observed, I was not at home when it first came, and she told me she found it in the woods. It seems odd that it should be the only one, yet it must be so, for I have worn myself out these many weeks trying to find another one to add to my collection, and for this to play with; for surely then it would be quieter and we could tame it more easily. But I find none, nor any vestige of any; and strangest of all, no tracks. It has to live on the ground, it cannot help itself; therefore, how <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> about without leaving a track? I have set a dozen traps, but they do no good. I catch all small animals except that one; animals that merely go into the trap out of curiosity, I think, to see what the milk is there for. They never drink it.|$|E

50|$|Scandinavia lies at {{the same}} {{latitude}} as Alaska or Greenland, but {{the effect of the}} warm North Atlantic Current is even more pronounced here than it is in Britain and Ireland. Save for a very small spot near Karasjok, Norway, which is in zone 2, nowhere in the Arctic part of Scandinavia <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> below zone 3. The Faroe Islands, at 62-63°N are in zone 8, as are the outer Lofoten Islands at 68°N. Tromsø, a coastal city in Norway at 70°N, is in zone 7, and even Longyearbyen, the northernmost true city in the world at 78°N, is still in zone 5. All these coastal locations have one thing in common, though, which are cold, damp summers, with temperatures rarely exceeding 20 C, or 15 C in Longyearbyen. This shows the importance of taking heat zones into account for better understanding of what may or may not grow.|$|E

The Magazine wrote [...] " [...] Dr Tedros has used {{innovative}} techniques to save the lives of millions of Ethiopians. Rather than building expensive hospitals, he has set up programmes to train 35,000 health workers. The workers then go on to provide care in nearly every community across Ethiopia -- especially for women and children, who are often the most vulnerable and underserved. As a result of this, women have access to family planning and are now able to plan the timing and spacing of their children. And children now receive life-saving vaccines and treatment for deadly illnesses such as pneumonia, malaria and diarrhoea. In five years, his work has reduced the death rate of Ethiopian children under five by 28 per cent. <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> more inspiring than that?" ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{review in}} Moving Picture World {{at the time}} said of the film, [...] "mysticism has been resorted to in several instances. There is a spiritual seance, a {{persistent}} strain of mental telepathy and a definite instance in which the occult powers of evil are demonstrated". The Exhibitors Herald opined that the film was [...] "an odd mixture of prison reform, second sight and crook reformation", and noted that Milford's acting was [...] "stilted and unreal and at no time <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> over very forcibly". A review of the film in the 1923 Exhibitor's Trade Review said the feature was [...] "an extremely entertaining picture...in {{spite of the fact}} that films which suggest a religious atmosphere are seldom viewed with favor by the average citizen in search of amusement...in the present instance there is no propaganda developed regarding any particular belief, no attempt at preaching, merely a thoroughly human story, shot through with trenchant dramatic punches and, if there is a moral to be traced, it is simply that it pays in the long run to do the right thing and keep your nerve intact".|$|E
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, Taylor was {{participating}} in the MacArthur Network on Socioeconomic Status and Health and developed an interest in mechanisms linking psychosocial conditions to health outcomes and she was influenced by her previous work John Libeskind. In another very popular paper with some UCLA colleagues, Rena Repetti and Teresa Seeman, titled [...] "Health psychology: What is an unhealthy environment and how <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> under the skin?," [...] they explored processes by which environments with different stressors such as poverty, violence exposure, threat, and other chronically stressful events lead to differences in health outcomes by socioeconomic status. Taylor greatly drew on Bruce McEwen's concept of allostatic load, the cumulative {{wear and tear on}} the body. In subsequent work with Dr. Repetti and Dr. Seeman, Taylor found that risky family environments predict elevated blood pressure and heart rate and an elevated flat cortisol slope in stressful laboratory tasks. Taylor also has interest in social support and how it relates to biology. She has examined cultural and gender differences in social support and how the affect adjustment to stressful life events. She has also found that people with more psychosocial resources have lesser cardiovascular and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to stress. Her interest in social support also influenced her tend-and-befriend model which will be discussed below.|$|E

[...] The actor goes on to assert, [...] "Well, I love Burt. You know, there's a little scene in the third movie that is quintessential Burt. Burt is so fear-driven that he's a paranoid, ultimately, but a comic paranoid. And there's a scene in which he goes up to his house to punch in his keycode on his pad. But before he does, he takes a good look around and {{stands in front of the}} pad - there's nobody there for miles! - but he blocks the keypad with his body. Because Burt would rightly assume that there's somebody in the hills with a high-powered telescope who wants his keypad information, wants the code. Now that's the level of paranoia. <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>get</b> funny? Yeah, because it's just so over the top. I love that. I love that about him. It's inherent in the fact that he has no sense of humor. It's because he doesn't consider life funny that we find him funny and his extremes which are so marvelous in human behavior....And one of the great things I love about Burt and what the writers do with him is he will prepare himself in certain ways and then we find out that, once again, he's not prepared because the animals have mutated in such a way that they've found a way to get around his best defenses. He couldn't possibly plan for every contingency and he thinks he has." ...|$|E
