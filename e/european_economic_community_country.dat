The effect of changes in emission legislation on engine development is reviewed.

Combustion systems, fuel injection equipment, exhaust gas recirculation and oxidation catalysts are areas where development is reaping benejits in reducing diesel emis-sions. ...|$|R

40|$|Although {{standardization}} of toxicity tests on aquatic organisms is an urgent necessity, very little {{has yet been}} achieved for the marine environment. As {{a first step in}} this direction, a simple, inexpensive and reliable short-term routine test with Artemia larvae is proposed. This test is the result of an extensive study in our laboratory, taking into account {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} Artemia bioassays published by various authors. The major advantage of the brine shrimp as a test species is its continuous availability under the form of dry cysts which can be hatched very easily; this eliminates all biological, technological, and financial problems of stock recruitment and/or culturing. The acute test presented is based on the determination of the LC 50 - 24 hr of instar II-III nauplii of a specific Artemia strain. Presently this test is the subject of an intercalibration exercise in North America: an analogous exercise is now in progress in the <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> <b>countries...</b>|$|R

Now {{membership}} {{stands at}} 50 SAIs (the SAIs of 49 European States and the European Court of Auditors).Although EUROSAI is the junior of INTOSAI’s seven Regional Working Groups, the idea of a European organisation of SAIs dates back to the foundation of INTOSAI in 1953. The first active steps towards the establishment of EUROSAI took place in 1974 during the VIII INTOSAI Congress in Madrid (1974). Between 1975 and 1989 the SAIs of Italy and Spain, counting on the Contact Committee of Heads of SAIs of the <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> <b>countries,</b> paved the way for EUROSAI by preparing the initial drafts of EUROSAI Statutes. In June 1989 the XIII INTOSAI Congress, held in Berlin, adopted the “Berlin Declaration” comprising the agreement of creating the European organisation of SAIs.In November 1990, the Constitutive Conference and the first Congress of EUROSAI were held in Madrid (Spain). During this event, the first EUROSAI President and Governing Board were elected, the Statutes were debated and approved, and the headquarters and permanent Secretariat were established.|$|R

40|$|Enthusiasts {{believe that}} the funds {{statement}} could be a major facilitating factor in the harmonization of accounting practices between countries. This study provides a starting point by delineating {{the state of the}} art regarding the funds statement in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia. ^ The historical development of the funds statement in the United States is reviewed. Seven major reporting areas identified in the United States Accounting Principles Board Opinion 19 (APB Opinion 19) are then compared with those in other countries [...] these seven areas are (1) reporting requirements, (2) concept of funds, (3) funds from normal operations, (4) extraordinary items, (5) financing activities, (6) investing activities, and (7) noncurrent exchanges. ^ The reporting provisions were found to be similar in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand except that New Zealand reports profit after tax and extraordinary items. In presenting funds from operations, Canada does not require the presentation of nonfund items. Significantly, Canada and Australia 2 ̆ 7 s promulgations do not require the presentation of a funds statement; however, both countries require the statement as a stock exchange listing requirement and Canadian companies are required by the Canada Business Corporations Act to present the statement annually. ^ All of the countries are members of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have implemented International Accounting Standard 7 (IAS 7). Australia considered its contents in the development of an exposure draft, which if adopted would be an excellent Standard. The United States does not adopt the International Standards. ^ The <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Community</b> <b>countries</b> are also members of IASC. Ireland, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Denmark and West Germany have implemented IAS 7. Belgium and Italy have not implemented IAS 7. ^ Some significant differences were found in the major reporting areas. Also there is considerable variation in the amount of detail provided in the promulgations. All of them lack specific guidelines and there is a need for more explicit terminology and definitive illustrations. ^ This study recommends the adoption of IAS 7 as the minimum Standard in all countries. The following recommendations are made to improve APB Opinion 19 : (1) Provide a funds statement for the previous period. (2) Identify the funds concept in terms of 2 ̆ 2 all financial resources 2 ̆ 2 in each section of the statement. (3) Profit or loss on the disposal of a long-term asset should be removed from operating income and the sale reported separately at the sale price. (4) When acquiring a subsidiary, report: (a) purchase price, (b) cash and shares paid, and (c) intended method of payment of unpaid balance. (5) Investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, report: (a) dividends, or (b) investor 2 ̆ 7 s share with retained portion shown as a reinvestment. ^ Recommendations for future research are discussed in terms of adapting the statement to provide: (1) current cost information, (2) cash flow information, and (3) forecasted data. ^ The adoption of IAS 7 would provide more uniformity and improve the reporting practices in some areas. The statement may be a key cog in the harmonization process and appears to have the potential to enhance the financial reporting process. ...|$|R
