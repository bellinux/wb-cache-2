40|$|The {{dimensional}} accuracy {{of a final}} casting of Inconel 738 LC alloy is affected by many aspects. One {{of them is the}} choice of method and time of cooling the wax model for precision investment casting. The main objective of this work was to study the initial deformation of the complex shape of a rotor blades casting. Various approaches have been tested for cooling a wax pattern. When wax models are air cooled and without clamping in the jig for cooling, deviations from the ideal shape of the casting are very noticeable (up to 8 mm) and most are in extreme positions of the model. When the blade is cooled in the <b>fixing</b> <b>jig</b> in a water environment, the resulting deviations compared to those of air cooling are significantly larger, sometimes up to 10 mm. This itself {{does not mean that the}} final shape of the casting is dimensionally more accurate with the usage of wax models, which have smaller deviations from the ideal position. Another deformation occurs when the shell mould is produced around the wax pattern and further deformations emerge while cooling the blade casting. This paper demonstrates the first steps in describing the complex process of deformations occurring in Inconel alloy blades produced with investment casting technology by comparing results of thermal imagery, simulations in foundry simulation software ProCAST 2010, and measurements from a CNC scanning system using a Carl Zeiss MC 850. Conclusions are so far not groundbreaking, but it seems that deformations of the wax pattern and deformations of the castings do in some cases cancel each other by having opposite directions...|$|E

It was {{found that there was}} a possible hazard from carbon monoxide unless great attention was paid to the standard of ventilation. If the general ventilation was defective then local exhaust ventilation was shown to be necessary. In one area surveyed a dramatic fall in carboxyhaemoglobin levels was noticed after improvements were made in the general ventilation and local exhaust ventilation installed.

40|$|AbstractEfficiency in {{aircraft}} production can {{be increased}} by using flexible robotic assembly systems instead of <b>fixed</b> <b>jigs,</b> but the flexibility can only be used in combination with efficient control algorithms. For large components which have an individual deformation, e. g. due to gravity, not only automated but self-optimizing control algorithms are required, which allow an autonomous product-specific adaptation of the systems behavior during assembly. Therefore, models are {{required in order to}} describe the products behavior to external forces and to adapt robot motions. Multiple linear regression is presented as an approach to generate a product model based on experimental data. The product model is used to generate robot motion for an automated untwisting process of large components. The depicted approach is being validated at a demonstrator consisting of two industrial robots and a CFRP panel...|$|R

40|$|In oral implantology, proper {{execution}} of the holes for the installation of dental implants {{is directly related to}} the correct functioning and durability of the system itself. For this reason, the procedure discussed here, which was once performed freehand in all its phases, is now being implemented through aids with more precision. Masks currently in use are created in resin ad hoc; surgical stents are inserted into the holes that will then be used as a guide. These aids are fixed into the jaw by means of micro bone screws in order to prevent movement during surgery. Despite this, we still use the guides as they are, centered properly with the help of drilling jigs. The same technique is also used in partially edentulous cases through smaller <b>jig</b> <b>fixed</b> on teeth near to the implant zone. In this article, we propose a guidance system for milling cutters used in partially edentulous cases involving from one to three adjacent installations. The purpose of the study was to realize a modular model adaptable to most dental implants, as well as efficient, quick, and low cost by pouring the resin into a plaster mold of the teeth, and then drilling the masks into position in the plants at the required angle...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the differences between Rocatec (as surface treatment) and # 600 polishing (as control) on shear bond strength of layering porcelain and hybrid composite to zirconium dioxide ceramics. MethodsManufactured zirconia blocks used in this study were yttrium partially stabilized zirconia (YTZ®), and veneering materials were NobelRondo Zirconia Dentin A 2 High Value (NZR) and Estenia C&B (ES). Total 48 zirconia blocks were fabricated (10 mm× 10 mm× 20 mm). The blocks of 24 each were treated by Rocatec and # 600 paper, respectively. Surface treated zirconia blocks were divided into two groups, according to veneering materials of NZR and ES. NZR was fired and ES was polymerized to zirconia. The fabricated specimen was <b>fixed</b> to mounting <b>jig</b> and applied shear force using the universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. All results were statistically analyzed by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test. EPMA analysis and SPM analysis of specimen interface were carried out. ResultsMean shear bond strength of each condition was: NZR/# 600; 23. 3 (S. D. ± 7. 0) MPa, NZR/Rocatec; 26. 9 (S. D. ± 7. 0) MPa, ES/# 600; 10. 7 (S. D. ± 2. 4) MPa, ES/Rocatec; 12. 5 (S.

40|$|PURPOSE. This study {{examined}} the effects of the abutment types and dynamic loading on the stability of implant prostheses with three types of implant abutments prepared using different fabrication methods by measuring removal torque both before and after dynamic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Three groups of abutments were produced using different types of fabrication methods; stock abutment, gold cast abutment, and CAD/CAM custom abutment. A customized jig was fabricated to apply the load at 30 ° to the long axis. The implant fixtures were <b>fixed</b> to the <b>jig,</b> and connected to the abutments with a 30 Ncm tightening torque. A sine curved dynamic load was applied for 105 cycles between 25 and 250 N at 14 Hz. Removal torque before loading and after loading were evaluated. The SPSS was used for statistical analysis of the results. A Kruskal-Wallis test was performed to compare screw loosening between the abutment systems. A Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare screw loosening between before and after loading in each group (α= 0. 05). RESULTS. Removal torque value before loading and after loading was the highest in stock abutment, which was then followed by gold cast abutment and CAD/CAM custom abutment, but there were no significant differences. CONCLUSION. The abutment types did not have a significant influence on short term screw loosening. On the other hand, after 105 cycles dynamic loading, CAD/CAM custom abutment affected the initial screw loosening, but stock abutment and gold cast abutment did not.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the structural/anatomical {{components of the}} static stabilisers of the canine glenohumeral joint (GHJ). The GHJ of 22 complete cadaver specimens (44 limbs) were manipulated to estimate laxity at joint angles of 150 º, 135 º and 90 º (palpation study). Following {{the removal of the}} peri-articular muscles, laxity was measured in 32 of these limbs after applying a 15 N force to the scapula in a variety of directions whilst the humerus was <b>fixed</b> to a <b>jig.</b> This was repeated for the abovementioned angles in intact joints and after venting and flushing to eliminate the limited joint volume and adhesion/cohesion (LJV/AC) mechanisms (biomechanical study). Results of the palpation and biomechanical studies were compared. Anatomical dissections were also performed to better describe the structures constituting the static GHJ stabilisers. The palpation study revealed a marked variation between joints although there was a tendency for progressive laxity as the joint was flexed. This finding was supported by the biomechanical study which also demonstrated no significant difference between intact and vented joints except in a cranio-caudal direction at 135 º and 90 º, and in a medial/lateral direction at 135 º. Static stabilisers contributed to the stability of the GHJ in extension but permitted an ever-increasing range of motion as the joint was flexed. The results of the palpation study did not correlate well with the objective measurements of the biomechanical study. Manipulation is unlikely to be a reliable method for determining subtle joint laxity in the GHJ. The static stabilisers do not appear to {{play a significant role in}} providing joint constraint during normal range of motion (except in extension). Diagnoses of pathological laxity attributable to dysfunction of the static stabilisers should be made with caution and surgical treatments should take cognisance of the abovementioned biomechanical features. Anatomical structures providing constraint to joint mobility are described. Dissertation (MMedVet (chir) (small animals)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006.

40|$|This thesis {{encompasses}} {{experimental work}} performed at The Canberra Hospital {{in collaboration with}} the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics, University of Wollongong, in the field of high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy. The purpose of this research was to develop an accurate and reliable in vivo dosimetry program {{that could be used to}} measure the dose delivered to organs at risk, such as the rectum and bladder, during HDR gynaecological brachytherapy. The current method of determining dose to these organs is based on calculation of a point dose by the treatment planning system (TPS). This calculation is limited in accuracy due to the inability of the TPS to consider heterogeneities in the dose calculation process. The implementation of an alternate dosimetry system independent to the TPS would be a useful tool for brachytherapy. The instruments chosen for measuring dose were a PTW five-diode array for use in the rectum; a PTW single diode probe for the bladder; and a uniquely designed Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET), known as a MOSkinTM, developed at the Centre for Medical Radiation Physics. Diodes and MOSFETs are commonly used in radiotherapy because of their desirable characteristics for accurate dose measurement. A thimble ionisation chamber traceable to a primary standards laboratory was used as a reference dosimeter for the calibration of these devices. To develop a better understanding of how these dosimeters may respond when used in brachytherapy, simulations were carried out using the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code. An 192 Ir source was modelled to emulate the micro Selectron ‘Classic’ HDR brachytherapy source used at The Canberra Hospital. The dose distribution and spectrum for this source was analysed in various media to determine how these characteristics changed with distance from the source. The Monte Carlo simulations showed a significant change in the 192 Ir photon spectrum with distance in water. The change in spectrum was attributed to the increasing portion of low energy scattered photons with distance from the source. Further investigation was also performed to determine the difference in dose deposited ina small silicon voxel compared to a voxel of water at various distances from the source. This gave an indication as to how the higher atomic number of the semiconductor detectors would affect their response at lower photon energies. The implications of these effects, i. e. the increase cross section for photoelectric absorption in silicon at low photon energies, helped determine the most appropriate distance to calibrate the dosimeters. After completing the Monte Carlo simulations, the inherent characteristics of the rectum diode probe, bladder diode probe, and MOSkinTM were investigated. The characteristics measured for each dosimeter included the energy dependence, angular dependence, linearity, long-term and short-term reproducibility and temperature dependence. By determining the inherent characteristics of each device, an uncertainty in measurement was calculated for each dosimeter. It was also found that the ionisation chamber displayed a poor spatial resolution when attempting to measure at distances close to the source. This was attributed to the significant dose gradient across the large air volume of the chamber. As a result, the ionisation chamber was deemed to be insufficient for calibrating the dosimeters close to the source. The final outcome of this work was the development of an appropriate calibration procedure for the diode probes and MOSkinTM that was sufficiently accurate and easy to reproduce. Two different phantom designs were evaluated: the first being a <b>fixed</b> cylindrical <b>jig</b> comprised of PMMA that could simultaneously calibrate all three dosimeters against an ionisation chamber at 8 cm from the source; and the second a perspex slab phantom allowing the dosimeters to be placed individually at any distance between 2. 3 and 8 cm from the source. Each phantom was imaged on a CT scanner and reconstructed in the TPS so that the doses measured by each of the dosimeters could be compared with those calculated by the TPS. Under full scattering conditions the dosimeters displayed good agreement with the TPS at large distances from the source but as the dosimeters were moved closer to the source a discrepancy between measured and calculated dose was observed. While calibrating at a non-clinically relevant depth of 8 cm was undesirable, the accuracy was far greater than attempting to calibrate the dosimeters close to the source where a large dose gradient turns small errors in positioning into significant errors in dose...|$|R
