40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{improved}} methodology to measure three-dimensional dynamic displacements of a structure by digital close-range photogrammetry. A series of stereo {{images of a}} vibrating structure installed with targets are taken at specified intervals by using two daily-use cameras. A new methodology is proposed to accurately trace the spatial displacement of each target in three-dimensional space. This method combines the correlation and the least-square image matching so that the sub-pixel targeting can be obtained to increase the measurement accuracy. Collinearity and space resection theory are {{used to determine the}} interior and exterior orientation parameters. To verify the proposed method, experiments have been performed to measure displacements of a cantilevered beam excited by an electrodynamic shaker, which is vibrating in a complex configuration with mixed bending and torsional motions simultaneously with multiple frequencies. The results by the present method showed good agreement with the measurement by two laser displacement sensors. The proposed methodology only requires inexpensive daily-use cameras, and can remotely detect the dynamic displacement of a structure vibrating in a complex three-dimensional defection shape up to sub-pixel accuracy. It has abundant potential applications to various fields, e. g., remote vibration monitoring of an inaccessible or <b>dangerous</b> <b>facility...</b>|$|E

It is noted {{that one of the}} important tasks of the management during emergencies is to determine areas of possible defeat, which will enable to minimize the risk {{to the health of the}} population living in these areas through its timely evacuation. This can be done only through the use of advanced mathematical models that can adequately describe the mass transfer of dangerous substances in various media influenced by many factors. Using such models, along with modern mapping package allows real-time view on the map the distribution of technological risk in the affected area and make effective management decisions for its minimization. Completed a detailed analysis of the damaging factors that are detrimental to human and material resources as a result of artificial disasters. It is shown that the development of emergency situation carried out in four stages. The first step is to release the accumulated human-machine systems or energy reserves harmful substances from the accident that occurred there. In the second stage, the uncontrolled spread of flows in new environment for them and move in it. The third stage is the subsequent physical-chemical conversion of additional energy release and the transition to a new phase or state of aggregation. And on the fourth stage the devastating impact of primary flow and / or given them damaging factors on them unprotected objects. A detailed analysis of each stage. The article noted that for effective management of ecological safety of potentially dangerous objects during their regular and emergency modes, you must create modern information-measuring and management systems for environmental monitoring. These systems should collect and process information and its presentation staff in a convenient form, and control functions: automatic control and adjustment, locking, remote control in all modes of potentially dangerous objects. The conditions and procedure of decision making under emergency situation was described. It is shown that a management decision involves: defining management objectives, assess the situation and the initial state, prediction of the situation, identify and evaluate the action sequences, making the most efficient sequence of actions as a management decision. The algorithm selecting combinations of measures resulting from liquidation of emergency situations. Noted measures must perform the Situation Centre in the normal operation of potentially <b>dangerous</b> <b>facility</b> to prevent it during the emergency. ?????????? ?????? ????????????? ?????????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????. ????????, ??? ????? ?? ?????? ????? ??? ?????????? ?? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ?????????, ??? ???????? ?????????????? ???? ??? ???????? ?????????, ???????????? ? ???? ?????, ????? ??? ????????????? ?????????. ??? ???????? ??????????? ?????? ? ??????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????, ??????????? ????????? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ? ????????? ?????? ??? ???????????? ?????? ????????. ????????????? ????? ??????? ?????? ? ???????????? ????????????????? ???????? ????????? ? ???????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ?? ????? ????????????? ???????????? ????? ? ???? ????????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????? ?? ??? ???????????. ???????? ????????? ?????? ?????????? ????????, ????????? ????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ???????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????. ? ?????? ????????, ??? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ?????? ?????. ?? ?????? ????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ????????-???????? ??????? ??????? ??? ??????? ???????? ???????? ? ?????????? ????????? ??? ??????. ?? ?????? ????? ?????????? ???????????????? ??????????????? ?? ??????? ? ????? ??? ??? ????? ? ??????????? ? ???. ?? ??????? ????? ?????????? ?? ?????????? ??????-?????????? ?????????????? ? ?????????????? ???????????????? ? ????????? ? ????? ?????????? ??? ??????? ?????????. ? ?? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????????? ??????? ?/??? ??????????? ??? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???????????? ?? ??? ???????. ??????????? ????????? ?????? ??????? ?????. ? ?????? ??????????, ??? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ??? ?? ??????? ? ????????? ??????? ??????, ?????????? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????-????????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ?????????????? ???????????. ?????? ??????? ?????? ???????????? ???? ? ????????? ?????????? ? ?? ????????????? ????????? ? ??????? ?????, ? ????? ??????????? ???????: ?????????????? ?????????? ? ?????????????, ??????????, ????????????? ?????????? ?? ???? ??????? ?????? ???????????? ???????. ??????????? ??????? ? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ???????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????. ????????, ??? ???????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????????????: ??????????? ???? ??????????, ?????? ?????????? ? ????????? ?????????, ??????????????? ???????? ????????, ??????????? ? ?????? ?????????????????? ????????, ???????? ???????? ???????????? ?????????????????? ???????? ??? ??????????????? ???????. ?????? ???????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ? ?????????? ???????????? ????????. ???????? ????, ??????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ????? ? ?????????? ?????? ?????? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ????????????? ?? ??? ???????????? ????????...|$|E

We review the main characteristics of a multi-agents system, namely interactions and cooperations of agents, communications and behaviours between them and finally the schedule of actions and jobs assignment to agents. The multi-agents system approach is increasingly applied in social and economic sciences; so we study mainly the territorial applications. In these applications new characteristics arise from the consideration of territory (land and space where the agents live or territory as an agent in itself, that evolves in the time). We study possible new applications of multi-agents applied to the territory (for instance, to define town planning policies or to locate <b>dangerous</b> <b>facilities).</b> Furthermore we study new tools to make operational multi-agents systems (mainly Swarm, the toolkit of Santa Fe Institute). With Swarm we present two kind of territorial applications: with located agents (fixed in space) and with not located agents (moving in the space).

40|$|Abstract>> In {{the present}} study, the {{frequency}} of the undesired accident was estimated for a quantitative risk assessment of a large-scale hydrogen liquefaction plant. As a representative example, the hydrogen liquefaction plant located in Ingolstadt, Germany was chosen. From the analysis of the liquefaction process and operating conditions, it was found that a LH 2 storage tank {{was one of the most}} <b>dangerous</b> <b>facilities.</b> Based on the accident scenarios, frequencies of possible accidents were quantitatively evaluated by using both fault tree analysis and event tree analysis. The overall expected frequency of the loss containment of hydrogen from the LH 2 storage tank was 6. 83 × 10 - 1 times/yr (once per 1. 5 years). It showed that only 0. 1 % of the hydrogen release from the LH 2 storage tank occurred instantaneously. Also, the incident outcome frequencies were calculated by multiplying the expected frequencies with the conditional probabilities resulting from the event tree diagram for hydrogen release. The results showed that most of the incident outcomes were dominated by fire, which was 71. 8 % of the entire accident outcome. The rest of the accident (about 27. 7 %) might have no effect to the population...|$|R

The scope of the 12 Unit-Specific Portion is limited to Part B permit application documentation 13 submitted for individual, `operating` treatment, storage, and/or disposal 14 units, such as the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility and 200 Area Effluent 15 Treatment Facility (this document, DOE/RL- 97 - 03). 16 17 Both the General Information and Unit-Specific portions of the Hanford 18 <b>Facility</b> <b>Dangerous</b> Waste Permit Application address {{the content of the}} Part B 19 permit application guidance prepared by the Washington State Department of 20 Ecology (Ecology 1987 and 1996) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency 21 (40 Code of Federal Regulations 270), with additional information needs 22 defined by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments and revisions of 23 Washington Administrative Code 173 - 303. For ease of reference, the Washington 24 State Department of Ecology alpha-numeric section identifiers from the permit 25 application guidance documentation (Ecology 1996) follow, in brackets, the 26 chapter headings and subheadings. A checklist indicating where information is 27 contained in the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility and 200 Area Effluent 28 Treatment Facility permit application documentation, in relation to the 29 Washington State Department of Ecology guidance, is located in the Contents 30 Section. 31 32 Documentation contained in the General Information Portion is broader in 33 nature and could be used by multiple treatment, storage, and/or disposal units 34 (e. g., the glossary provided in the General Information Portion). Wherever 35 appropriate, the Liquid Effluent Retention Facility and 200 Area Effluent 36 Treatment Facility permit application documentation makes cross-reference to 37 the General Information Portion, rather than duplicating text. 38 39 Information provided in this Liquid Effluent Retention Facility and 40 200 Area Effluent Treatment Facility permit application documentation is 41 current as of June 1, 1997...|$|R
