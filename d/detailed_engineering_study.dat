40|$|Since {{the passage}} of the Highway Safety Act of 1966, state {{departments}} of transportation have engaged in systematic safety improvement planning and programming. According to Davis (2000), the general approach to safety improvement planning employed by most states follows six principal steps: 1.

In safety improvement planning, the determination of benefits from implementation of countermeasures depends greatly on projected crash reductions. Such projections are acknowledged to be the most uncertain element of the safety planning process (Pfefer et al., 1999). More than 25 years ago Laughland et al. (1975) identified the need for development of a national comprehensive set of crash reduction factors (CRFs) that states could employ in evaluating safety countermeasures. However, this need has not been addressed, and is not likely to be pursued (FHWA, 1991). As a result, states have been responsible for developing their own CRFs...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{lightning}} protection of transmission lines is exclusively relying on their correct initial design. Although <b>detailed</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>studies</b> are usually performed by electric power utilities for the design of new transmission lines, there are reported cases where the design is based simply on tradition or on utilities' standardization policy. In this paper, the lightning protection of high-voltage transmission lines is faced as an optimization problem where optimum design parameters are calculated for the lines, relating their cost with the lightning failures' cost, aiming to reduce or even eliminate lightning failures. The optimization method considers all the available protection means, i. e. ground wires and surge arresters. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, it is applied on several operating Hellenic transmission lines of 150 kV carefully selected among others due to their high failure rates during lightning thunderstorms. The obtained optimum parameters, which reduce the failure rates caused by lightning are compared with the operating transmission lines' existing parameters showing the usefulness of the method, which can prove to be a valuable tool for the studies of electric power system designers.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{doubts about}} the {{technical}} and economic viability of retrofit to existing plants can be identified {{there have also been}} suggestions that CO 2 capture retrofits at appropriate sites could be economically attractive. The potential to extend the life of existing plants with paid-off capital could be beneficial and some project developers are exploring retrofit opportunities for CO 2 capture demonstration. This paper (and the accompanying study commissioned by IEAGHG) shows that there is a sound theoretical basis for CCS retrofits to existing power plants to be considered as a complement, and in some cases as an alternative, to new build power plants with CCS. A key recommendation resulting from the technical and economic analysis undertaken is that a general rejection of retrofitting on grounds such as the age or lower efficiency of existing plants is not justified. Instead CCS retrofits need to be assessed on a site-specific basis, which is feasible since only {{a relatively small number of}} plants (order 100 ’s) need to be retrofitted in order to have a significant impact on global CO 2 emissions.

40|$|The {{design of}} {{transmission}} lines {{is often the}} key issue for the existence or absence of failures caused by lightning. <b>Detailed</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>studies</b> are Usually performed by electric power utilities {{for the design of}} new transmission lines. However, there are also cases where the design is based simply on tradition or on utilities' standardization policy. The paper presents a cost related method for the optimum design of overhead high voltage transmission lines, which intends to reduce or even eliminate the lightning failures. Lightning failures' cost is related to design parameters' cost in order to calculate the optimum and most economic design parameter values. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the method is applied on several operating Hellenic transmission lines of 150 and 400 kV, respectively, carefully selected among others, due to their high failure rates during lightning thunderstorms. Special attention has been paid on open loop lines, where a possible failure in them could bring the system out of service causing significant problems. The proposed parameters that Occurred by the design method and which reduce the failure rates caused by lightning, are compared with the operating transmission lines existing design parameters showing the usefulness of the method, which call be proved a valuable tool for the studies of electric power systems designers.
