The focal technique has been Kyburg's method for reasoning with data of varying relevance to a particular query, though the aim is to be able eventually to compare various uncertainty calculi. The conclusions are not novel, but are instructive. 1. All of the calculi performed better than human subjects, so unbiased access to sample experience is apparently of value. 2. Performance depends on metric: (a) when trials are repeated, net = gains - losses favors methods that place many bets, if the probability of placing a correct bet is sufficiently high; that is, it favors point-valued formalisms; (b) yield = gains/(gains + lossee) favors methods that bet only when sure to bet correctly; that is, it favors interval-valued formalisms. 3. Among the calculi, there were no clear winners or losers. Methods are identified for eliminating the bias of the net as a performance criterion and for separating the calculi effectively: in both cases by posting odds for the betting game in the appropriate way.

40|$|When {{equally spaced}} {{points on the}} skin of a blindfolded human {{individual}} are stimulated in rapid succession, stimuli separated by a shorter temporal interval are perceived as closer together in space than stimuli separated by a longer temporal interval.

Psychophysical data of two <b>blindfolded</b> observers, <b>tested</b> under conditions of successive tactile stimulations of two points on the skin of the lower arm, with constant spacing and separated by two randomly varying temporal intervals, show that the tau effect occurs in the first trial blocks, and then vanishes over time.

A neural state observer model for neural integration with temporal bias reduction is exploited to account for the individual data, and discussed in the light of previous explanations.

50|$|At {{the time}} of Fazlullah's writing, neurologists were {{interested}} in the clinical value of using bilateral simultaneous and ipsilateral double stimuli in testing sensations of the skin. This testing is applied simultaneously on two sides of the body. In such studies, patients are required to announce whether or not they can feel any type of sensation on either side of their body. Such procedures are meant to study the sensory suppression phenomenon present in tactile-amorphosynthesis. In Fazlullah’s study, patients with parietal lesions were <b>blindfolded</b> and <b>tested</b> for tactile-amorphosynthesis by applying simultaneous stimulation {{on both sides of the}} body. Patients were then asked to report on the size, shape and nature of the presented object. Results determined that patients with a right parietal lobe lesions presented symptoms such as anosognosia, hemiasomatognosia, metamorphognosia, corporeal agnosia, phantom sensations, transposition of parts of the body, constructional apraxia, disorientation of space, agnosia of the left portion of space, anaesthoagnosia, and Balint optic ataxia, while patients with left parietal lobe lesions presented symptoms such as Gerstmann syndrome, parietal apraxia and construction apraxia. Interestingly, other patients with symptoms of Tactile-Amorphosynthesis showed signs of lobe lesions in the sensory tract and the spinal cord glioma. For this reason, such studies as Fazlullah's suggest that patients with lesions in other regions of the brain or spinal cord can also develop tactile-amorphosynthesis.|$|R

40|$|As {{hypothermia}} by immersion {{can reduce}} the sensory nerve conduction velocity, this study hypothesized that the reduction of sensory input to the ipsilesional upper extremity (UE) using cryotherapy would reduce the inhibitory activity of the contralesional hemisphere in chronic stroke subjects. Objective: In this study, hypothermia was applied by immersing the ipsilesional UE in association with sensory training of the contralesional UE of stroke patients to assess the immediate (e. g. sensorimotor function, hemodynamics, and levels of comfort) and long-term (sensory and motor performances of the UEs) effects. Methods: The sample included 27 stroke patients allocated into group 1 (n= 14), which received conventional physiotherapy for the affected UE, and group 2 (n= 13), which underwent 10 sessions of immersion hypothermia of the ipsilesional wrist and hand. Assessments were performed pre- and post-treatment and at follow-up using esthesiometry, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), the Nottingham Sensory Assessment, functional tests, tactile and weight discrimination, motor sequence, level of comfort, and hemodynamic parameters. Results: The immediate effects of hypothermia using immersion of the ipsilesional UE in association with sensory training of the contralesional UE were hemodynamic stability during and after hypothermia, the absence of sensory abnormalities in the contralesional UE, hypoesthesia in the ipsilesional extremity (dermatomes C 6 and C 8) (P< 0. 05), the maintenance of acceptable levels of comfort, and good patient compliance to the technique. The long-term effects included significant increases in scores on tests performed without functional vision, in scores on <b>blindfolded</b> functional <b>tests,</b> and in tactile localization and joint position sense for the contralesional hand in group 2 {{as well as the}} maintenance of these gains at long-term follow-up (5 weeks).

40|$|Background. One of {{the more}} {{pervasive}} effects of aging is loss of cutaneous sensation, which appears to correlate with im-paired postural control and increased risk of falling. This study examined the potential for compensating for the destabilizing effects of reduced cutaneous sensitivity by placing a raised edge underneath {{the perimeter of the}} plantar foot surface, so as to facilitate sensation from the stability boundaries of the base of support. Methods. The main experiment involved 14 healthy older adults (aged 65 - 73) selected because they were known, from a previous study, to have moderate plantar cutaneous insensitivity. We also report results of an initial experiment involving 7 healthy young adults (aged 23 - 31). In both experiments, we studied effects of the plantar facilitation on control of rapid step-ping reactions evoked by unpredictable postural perturbation, applied via sudden platform movement in forward, backward, and lateral directions. We also studied effects on "feet-in-place " responses evoked by continuous pseudorandom platform mo-tion in mediolateral and anteroposterior directions. Subjects were <b>blindfolded</b> in all <b>tests.</b> Results. Plantar facilitation reduced the incidence of "extra " limb movements, beyond the initial step, during forward-step reactions in the older adults. There also appeared to be an improved ability to control feet-in-place reactions: young subjects were better able to recover balance without stepping when falling backward (given instructions to "try not to step"), and both young and older subjects reduced {{the extent to which the}} center of foot pressure approached the posterior foot boundary during continuous anteroposterior platform motion...|$|R

Each <b>blindfolded</b> ewe was <b>tested</b> once with <b>blindfolded</b> own and alien lambs and the other with non-blindfolded own and alien ones. Before test period (10 min), tested ewe and lamb were separated (50 m away from each other) for 4 hours. Blindfolding had a significant influence on number of acceptance at the udder in Barki (P< 0. 01) and Rahmani (P< 0. 05) ewes. Some blindfolded Barki and Rahmani ewes accepted alien lambs at their udders. The effect of blindfolding on distance covered by dam towards the lamb and distance paced by lamb towards the dam was highly significant (P< 0. 01) in the two breeds studied. Non-blindfolded Barki and Rahmani lambs whether own or alien paced significantly longer distance towards blindfolded ewes than blindfolded own and alien ones. Meanwhile, number of baaings emitted by lambs was significantly (P< 0. 01) affected by blindfolding. Blindfolded lambs emitted more frequencies of baaings to seek care from ewes instead of vision.

40|$|Neck-shoulder pain {{is common}} in the general {{population}} and causes individual suffering as well as large costs for the society. Despite substantial efforts, there is still a shortage of methods for objective diagnosis and effective rehabilitation of such disorders. Thus, there is a great need to develop and evaluate new methods for these purposes. From clinical observations and recent research it has become evident that sensorimotor control can be impaired in people with neck-shoulder pain and {{may play a role in}} the pathogenesis of these disorders. In this thesis, precision of goal-directed arm movements, a previously unstudied class of movements in neck-shoulder pain, was studied. The main aim of the thesis was to investigate if people with chronic neck-shoulder pain have a reduced acuity of goal-directed movements of the upper extremity. A second aim was to study associations between reduced movement acuity and symptoms and self-rated characteristics. Upper limb repositioning acuity was assessed in <b>blindfolded</b> subjects performing <b>tests</b> of active, ipsilateral position-matching of two target positions (long and short) in movements constrained to horizontal-adduction of the shoulder. Reduced repositioning acuity, suggesting impaired shoulder proprioception, was found for both subjects with whiplash associated disorders (WAD) and non-specific neck-shoulder pain (NS). The degree of reduced acuity was shown to correlate with self-ratings of various health concepts, functioning and pain. A conspicuous finding was that there was lack of correlation between short and long target errors, along with the fact that associations between repositioning acuity and symptoms and self-rated characteristics was primarily found for the short target position. To further investigate the possible mechanisms underlying the disassociation between long and short target movement control, the association pattern between the outcome of several variants of ipsilateral position matching and velocity-discrimination tests, were studied. It was found that the perception of limb position in position-matching of short target locations appears to be predominantly based on movement velocity, whereas perception of limb position in movements to longer target locations may rely on a location-based perception mechanism. To extend the research on reduced upper extremity proprioception in neck-shoulder pain to a more natural movement situation, acuity of goal-directed pointing including full vision and 3 D multi-joint movements was investigated in WAD, NS and healthy controls subjects. The results revealed a reduced acuity for both neck-pain groups. Moreover, distinct associations between end-point acuity and neck movement problems, limitations of some physical functions and, in WAD; some aspects of pain, were revealed. The findings demonstrate that the precision of upper limb movements can be reduced in chronic neck-shoulder pain. Substantial associations with symptoms and self-rated functioning suggest a clinical relevance of acuity measures of goal-directed arm movements. The findings indicate that tests of sensorimotor control can provide objective measures that may be useful in biopsychosocial profiling and characterization of subgroups of patients with chronic neck-shoulder pain, and that training target control of goal-directed movements should be considered in rehabilitation programs of people with these disorders...|$|R
