40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} method based on the fuzzy Hough {{transform}} to locate the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> in posteroanterior radiographs. Firstly, a Canny edge detector {{is applied to the}} X-ray images in order to obtain an edge map. Then, the fuzzy Hough transform is used in combination with several constraints extracted from our domain knowledge. At the bottom of the radiograph we search for two circular arcs, as we can represent the shape of the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> by means of these curves. Locating the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> can be useful for a later processing of the X-rays in order to obtain a fully automated segmentation of the whole spine.

25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the <b>iliac</b> <b>crest</b> between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, and then run above the inguinal ligament. Both nerves give off muscular branches to both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|The lower limbs (human legs) {{have also}} been damaged. The left <b>iliac</b> <b>crest</b> {{contains}} small fractures. The inferior pubic ramus also contains similar fractures.

The right tibia has a defective area {{at the front of the}} distal shaft. The defective area extends 33.5 millimetres above the ankle joint. The metatarsal bones of both feet are broken, and missing from the body. The phalanx bones of both feet are also missing. There is a subcutaneous (hypodermic) filling at the back of the Lady's right hip region, where her buttock is located.|$|E
25|$|Nasal defects {{involving}} {{either the}} bone or the cartilage of the lateral nose are best managed with free grafts of flat septal bone and of cartilage. Small defects {{of the nasal}} dorsum can be covered with cartilage grafts harvested from either the septum or the concha of the ear. The correction of large-area defects of the nasal dorsum requires the stable support of a bone graft affixed either with a lag screw or with a low-profile plate. A costal graft (from the rib cage) is ideal for such a repair, {{because it can be}} harvested with an attached extension of cartilage that can be sculpted to blend into the nasal tip; other potential donor sites for nasal dorsum reconstruction materials are the outer table of the skull, the <b>iliac</b> <b>crest,</b> and the inner table of the ilium proper.|$|E

[...] In bipedal mammals, the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> are parallel to the vertically oriented sacroiliac joints, where in quadrupedal mammals they are parallel to the horizontally oriented sacroiliac joints. [...] In heavy mammals, especially in quadrupeds, the pelvis tend to be more vertically oriented because this allows the pelvis to support greater weight without dislocating the sacroiliac joints or adding torsion to the vertebral column.|$|R

25|$|The {{posterior}} dorsal hip {{muscles are}} inserted on or directly below the greater trochanter of the femur. The tensor fasciae latae, {{stretching from the}} anterior superior iliac spine down into the iliotibial tract, presses {{the head of the}} femur into the acetabulum but also flexes, rotates medially, and abducts to hip joint. The piriformis originates on the anterior pelvic surface of the sacrum, passes through the greater sciatic foramen, and inserts on the posterior aspect of the tip of the greater trochanter. In a standing posture it is a lateral rotator, but it also assists extending the thigh. The gluteus maximus has its origin between (and around) the <b>iliac</b> <b>crest</b> and the coccyx from where one part radiates into the iliotibial tract and the other stretches down to the gluteal tuberosity under the greater trochanter. The gluteus maximus is primarily an extensor and lateral rotator of the hip joint, and it comes into action when climbing stairs or rising from a sitting to standing posture. Furthermore, the part inserted into the fascia latae abducts and the part inserted into the gluteal tuberosity adducts the hip. The two deep glutei muscles, the gluteus medius and minimus, originate on the lateral side of the pelvis. The medius muscle is shaped like a cap. Its anterior fibers act as a medial rotator and flexor; the posterior fibers as a lateral rotator and extensor; and the entire muscle abducts the hip. The minimus has similar functions and both muscles are inserted onto the greater trochanter.|$|E

40|$|The line {{joining the}} {{superior}} {{aspect of the}} <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> posteriorly (the intercristal line) is commonly stated to cross the midline at the L 4 or L 4 – 5 spinal level on imaging. This study aimed to assess the spinal level identified through palpation of surface anatomy (<b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> and posterior superior iliac spines) in adults {{and the level of}} agreement compared with the intercristal line identified through imaging. The study participants included consecutive adult patients undergoing prone fluoroscopically guided spinal injections for chronic low back pain at the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital, Birmingham, between April and July 2004. Prior to fluoroscopic imaging, each patient's surface anatomy was palpated by two examiners and lines created to form the palpated intercristal line and the posterior superior iliac spine line. Following imaging, the mid-line spinal levels identified by these palpated lines were recorded and the level of agreement (kappa coefficient) with the intercristal line formed by imaging of the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> was assessed. The results showed that although the L 4 or L 4 – 5 spinal levels were identified on imaging of the intercristal line in 86. 7 % of 75 patients (49 female), the intercristal line formed through palpation tended to identify higher levels; the L 3 or L 3 – 4 spinal levels in 77. 3 % of cases and more commonly in females than in males (85. 7 vs. 61. 5 %) and in patients with higher body mass indices. The level of agreement between the two lines was poor (κ = 0. 05). The posterior superior iliac spine line identified the S 2 spinous process in 51 % and the S 1 in 44 % of 60 (45 female) patients. The results suggest that formation of the intercristal line by palpation of the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> identifies different spinal levels to those identified by imaging and that both methods should be regarded as different instruments. In the clinical situation, it may be more appropriate to consider that palpation of the intercristal line is a guide for identifying the L 3 or L 3 – 4 spinal levels rather than the L 4 or L 4 – 5 levels, particularly in females and patients with higher body mass indices...|$|R

50|$|The {{shape of}} the pelvis, most notably the {{orientation}} of the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> and shape and depth of the acetabula, reflects the style of locomotion and body mass of an animal. In bipedal mammals, the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> are parallel to the vertically oriented sacroiliac joints, where in quadrupedal mammals they are parallel to the horizontally oriented sacroiliac joints. In heavy mammals, especially in quadrupeds, the pelvis tend to be more vertically oriented because this allows the pelvis to support greater weight without dislocating the sacroiliac joints or adding torsion to the vertebral column. In ambulatory mammals the acetabula are shallow and open to allow a wider range of hip movements, including significant abduction, than in cursorial mammals. The lengths of the ilium and ischium and their angles relative to the acetabulum are functionally important as they determine the moment arms for the hip extensor muscles that provide momentum during locomotion. In addition to this, the relatively wide shape (front to back) of the pelvis provides greater leverage for the gluteus medius and minimus. These muscles are responsible for hip abduction which plays an integral role in upright balance.|$|R

[...] At the lower end of the rectus abdominis, the pyramidalis tenses the linea alba.

40|$|Introduction: Poor posture in {{children}} is a common problem. It appears most often in early school-age children and, if not corrected, progresses quickly as they mature. Aim of the research: To find a method that can prevent poor posture, is effective and attractive for children, {{and can be used}} on a wide scale in state schools. Material and methods : Seventy-seven first year pupils were tested at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the school year. Nineteen children undertook corrective exercises using unstable surfaces; 41 children sat on sensorimotor pillows during classes; and 17 children were the control group. Body mass and body height were measured. Body mass index was calculated. The symmetry of the position of selected skeletal points was assessed: the acromions, lower angles of the scapulas, apexes of the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests,</b> antero-superior <b>iliac</b> spine, and postero-superior iliac spine using a Duometer electronic device. The differences between the groups and changes between the first and second study for each group were estimated. Results : In the first study there were no significant differences in quality of posture. In the second study a significant improvement was noted in symmetry of the shoulders, scapulas, and pelvis {{in children}} who sat on sensorimotor pillows, as well as the position of the <b>iliac</b> <b>crests</b> and <b>iliac</b> spines in children exercising regularly on unstable surfaces.
