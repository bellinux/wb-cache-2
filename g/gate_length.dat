At lower <b>gate</b> <b>lengths</b> of 20 and 15 nm, the devices still maintain excellent device characteristics and follow traditional scaling with respect to gate delay and energy delay, although off-state leakage and gate leakage do increase. At 10 nm <b>gate</b> <b>lengths,</b> the transistors continue to function as MOS devices, but they are limited by off-state leakage. One feasible method of significantly improving off-state leakage is through reducing the sub-threshold gradient. We show that Depleted Substrate Transistors (DST), a broad category of devices that include single- and doublegate transistors, whose active channel region stays fully depleted during operation, can achieve near-ideal subthreshold gradients and a reduction in off-state leakage of at least two orders of magnitude over bulk transistors. We believe that DST architecture will adequately address transistor scaling needs down to 10 nm <b>gate</b> <b>lengths.</b> In addition to DST device architecture, new electronic materials and modules will be needed to maintain high performance and low-parasitic leakages. As an example, to alleviate increasing gate leakage, changes in the gate stack are necessary.
