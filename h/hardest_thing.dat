5|$|The final episode begins after Becky and Michael {{had slept}} {{together}} while house sitting for Tracy and Robert, and Michael hides {{in the bathroom}} when the latter couple return. Tracy phones a morning television phone-in show (hosted by Michael Thomas and Helen Atkinson-Wood, with appearances by Rachael Fielding and Jonathan Barlow), and when she realises that the show's divorce expert is hiding in her bathroom she takes on his role (with a heavy Northern accent, actually a slightly exaggerated version of Bennett's own voice) to give herself advice on the other line. Bennett says this was the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> she has had to do in her career.|$|E
25|$|The storyline {{reached its}} climax in March 2003. On-screen the character’s plans to abscond with Ricky {{and her son}} (on the night of her {{surprise}} birthday party) were thwarted by Barry’s discovery of the affair – leading to a public confrontation between the three protagonists. Shaun Williamson who played Barry has commented “Barry is absolutely devastated as his whole life is ripped apart. He can’t believe Nat has betrayed him. He loves his life with Natalie and Jack, and {{would do anything to}} make it work as a family again. Losing Natalie is going to be really difficult for Barry, but I think the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> will be losing his son.” The storyline signified the end of the characters’ three-year marriage and in a final plot twist Natalie opted to finish with Ricky and leave Walford alone, having discovered that he had recently slept with his ex-wife Samantha.|$|E
25|$|With {{millions}} of others I had prayed hard {{at the time of}} Dunkirk and never did prayer seem to be more speedily answered to the full. And we prayed for France and the next day she surrendered. I thought much, and when I went to bed I lay for a long time vividly awake. And I went over in my mind what had happened, concentrating on the thoughts that you had dwelt on, that prayer to be effective must be in accordance with God's will, and that by far the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> to say from the heart and indeed the last lesson we learn (if we ever do) is to say and mean it, ‘Thy will be done.’ And I thought what mites we all are and how we can never see God's plan, a plan on such a scale that it must be incomprehensible. And suddenly for what must have been a couple of minutes I seemed to see with extraordinary and vivid clarity and to hear someone speaking to me. The words at the time were clear, but the recollection of them had passed when I seemed to come to, as it were, but the sense remained, and the sense was this. ‘You cannot see the plan’; then ‘Have you not thought there is a purpose in stripping you one by one of all the human props on which you depend, that you are being left alone in the world? You have now one upon whom to lean and I have chosen you as my instrument to work with my will. Why then are you afraid?’ And to prove ourselves worthy of that tremendous task is our job.|$|E

500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season. He once again became showrunner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean said that [...] "the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. People are so on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] In April 2001, in an interview with The New York Times, Jean stated that he wanted [...] "to take the show back to the family".|$|E
500|$|On July 7, 1976 at La Casa Pacifica, Nixon {{suffered}} a stroke, {{which resulted in}} the paralysis of her entire left side. Physical therapy enabled her to eventually regain all movement. She said that her recovery was [...] "the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> I have ever done physically". In 1979, she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan, New York. They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a [...] house in Saddle River, New Jersey. This gave the couple additional space, and enabled them to be near their children and grandchildren. Pat, however, sustained another stroke in 1983 and two lung infections the following year.|$|E

500|$|Shackleton's first {{choices for}} the boat's crew were Worsley and Tom Crean—the latter, he said, [...] "begged to go". Crean was a shipmate from the Discovery Expedition, 1901–04, and had also been with Scott's Terra Nova Expedition in 1910–13, where he had {{distinguished}} himself on the fatal polar march. Shackleton was confident that Crean would persevere to the bitter end, and had great faith in Worsley's skills as a navigator, especially his ability to work out positions in difficult circumstances. Worsley later wrote: [...] "We {{knew it would be}} the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> we had ever undertaken, for the Antarctic winter had set in, and we were about to cross one of the worst seas in the world".|$|E
500|$|The second verse {{begins with}} {{an example of what}} Harrison biographer Alan Clayson views as the [...] "restricted code" [...] found in the lyrics on much of Extra Texture. Harrison sings, [...] "The speech of flowers excels the flowers of speech / But what's often in your heart is the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> to reach" [...] – the second line of which, Allison writes, [...] "is surely [...] talking about his {{inability}} to find God, who for him dwells, above all, inside the human being". Allison suggests that, with the singer describing life as first an [...] "enigma" [...] and then a [...] "mystery", the previous certainties of his faith have disappeared; true to the song title, Allison continues, [...] "Only death will reveal... whether his religious beliefs have been true or false." ...|$|E
500|$|Radiohead {{returned}} to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of OK Computer in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The string parts were recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London in January 1997. The album was mastered {{at the same}} location, and mixed {{over the next two}} months at various studios around the city. Godrich preferred a quick and [...] "hands-off" [...] approach to mixing, and said: [...] "I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with things and I fuck it up... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective." ...|$|E

After several low scores in the Test series—Trescothick started with only 20 runs from his first five innings—he reached two half-centuries, but failed to make a {{substantial}} match-winning contribution. This poor touring form {{may have been the}} start of the troubles that would rule him out of international cricket in the future. Trescothick said, [...] "The <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> for me has been the pitches. So far nets and the matches have been on average surfaces and runs have been hard work...In England you get used to good practice surfaces so the rhythm of batting comes pretty easy [...]" [...] However, he topped the England batting averages in the 7-match one-day series, with 267 runs including 130 in the 5th ODI and 82 from 57 balls in the 7th.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, the {{character}} underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages. Kelly branded the storyline challenging, admitting {{she felt a}} huge responsibility to get it right, stating: [...] "It's definitely been the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> I've done since I've been here. I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge." [...] Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding: [...] "She can't really put up any barriers about this– it's the worst thing that's ever happened. She goes from being a girl to a woman, I think. I'm just devastated for her". Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest, [...] "Most of Becky’s storylines have an element of fun in there somewhere, but with this one {{it was just like}} a cloud was hanging over me for six weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the light}} of the {{physical}} demands of performing in theatre Paige has said [...] "Musical theatre is the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> any actor will ever do. [...] You become obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised". Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked [...] "you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed – it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there". As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating dairy products and drinking alcohol and works hard on her fitness. After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she withdraws from her normal social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad and fax. She never reads her reviews, finding that it is not helpful to hear too many opinions of her work.|$|E

500|$|Peyton {{explained}} the writing by saying [...] "it always {{comes out of}} an emotional place." [...] One of the writers was Karen Walton, who had previously written the Canadian werewolf film Ginger Snaps. [...] The producers chose the type of animation due to Peyton's personal interest in it, although he later claimed that a day's work could lead to seconds' worth of material. [...] A factory was needed with 8 to 10 teams, {{with some of the}} animators having previously worked on the Tim Burton film Corpse Bride. [...] The characters were made out of plastic and foam. [...] Additionally, some animation was done through computers. [...] Each character's figure had a number of add-on lips to express various sounds, and their eyes and eyebrows were also adjusted frequently during production. [...] The figures could also be fastened into a surface, moved and fastened in again to portray movement. [...] Peyton remarked that [...] "The <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> is timing and pacing." [...] Still, he also liked to emphasize that the series did not cost too much money to produce.|$|E
500|$|As Kesler was {{returning}} from injury, Vancouver placed centre Manny Malhotra {{on injured reserve}} (IR) {{for the remainder of}} the season. In regards to the move, Gillis stated he felt Malhotra was vulnerable to serious injury because of an eye injury he suffered in 2011. The decision was made despite Malhotra playing in 78 games in the 2011–12 season and nine games in 2013. Gillis further noted that he had reservation about him playing in the previous season, but wanted to give Malhotra a chance to adapt. After watching him play, Gillis did not see the types of changes that would not put him at a higher risk of injury. Upon placing Malhotra on IR, Gillis called it the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> he had done as a GM. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly released a statement on the situation, saying [...] "the League is satisfied and has approved the team's and player's joint decision to discontinue the player's participation in NHL games at this time on the basis of the player’s current medical condition and the risk of injury that such condition poses." [...] The Canucks also announced that Malhotra would remain with the team in some capacity, but would not return to the ice including in the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|The Incredibles {{not only}} {{dealt with the}} trouble of animating CG humans, but also many other complications. The story was bigger than any prior story at the studio, was longer in running time, and had four {{times the number of}} locations. Supervising {{technical}} director Rick Sayre noted that the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> about the film was that there was [...] "no hardest thing," [...] alluding to the amount of new technical challenges: fire, water, air, smoke, steam, and explosions were all additional to the new difficulty of working with humans. The film's organizational structure could not be mapped out like previous Pixar features, and it became a running joke to the team. Sayre said the team adopted “Alpha Omega," [...] where one team was concerned with building modeling, shading and layout and another dealt with final camera, lighting, and effects. Another team, dubbed as the character team, digitally sculpted, rigged, and shaded the characters, and a simulation team was responsible for developing simulation technology for hair and clothing. There were 781 visual effects shots in the film, and they were quite often visual gags, such as the window shattering when Bob angrily shuts the car door. In addition, the effects team improved their modeling of clouds, using volumetric rendering for the first time.|$|E

500|$|Amanda Mealing plays Colonel Eleanor Grant, a [...] "smart, tough {{military}} leader who is skilled {{with a gun}} and diplomacy, but knows when to break a rule or two." [...] She is the new head of Section 20, replacing Hugh Collinson from the first series. Mealing described Grant as [...] "hard as nails," [...] "very contained, very direct," [...] and [...] "very driven." [...] Grant is also very distant from her team; [...] "she commands so she is not their pal but, at the same time, the guys are like her family. They spend so much time together moving from place to place. But, in a kind of motherly way, she has to keep them in check and sometimes they need a firm hand." [...] The actress called her role [...] "the best role I've ever had," [...] adding [...] "when I'm doing action scenes like flying in helicopters, the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> is to keep a serious face as all I want to do is scream for joy." [...] She researched for her role by taking advice from a female officer in a similar high-ranking position as Grant is. One piece of advice the officer gave Mealing was [...] "you mustn't try {{to be one of the}} boys or they'll lose respect for you, but you've got to be in charge." ...|$|E
500|$|The early 1950s {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a slump in Grant's career. His roles as a top brain surgeon who is {{caught in the middle of}} a bitter revolution in a Latin American country in Crisis, and as a medical-school professor and orchestra conductor opposite Jeanne Crain in People Will Talk were poorly received. [...] Grant had become tired of being Cary Grant after twenty years, being successful, wealthy and popular, and remarked: [...] "To play yourself, your true self, is the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> in the world". In 1952, Grant starred in the comedy Room for One More, playing an engineer husband who with his wife (Betsy Drake) adopt two children from an orphanage. He reunited with Howard Hawks to film the off-beat comedy Monkey Business, co-starring Ginger Rogers and Marilyn Monroe. Though the critic from Motion Picture Herald wrote gushingly that Grant had given a career's best with an [...] "extraordinary and agile performance", which was matched by Rogers, it received a mixed reception overall. Grant had hoped that starring opposite Deborah Kerr in the romantic comedy Dream Wife would salvage his career, but it was a critical and financial failure upon release in July 1953. Though he was considered for the leading part in A Star is Born, Grant believed that his film career was over, and briefly left the industry.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} Kevin Malone {{playing the}} drums in a band, {{which had been}} an idea circulated since the first season, when allusions to him being in a Steve Miller tribute band were written; the scenes {{had to be removed}} from the series due to issues negotiating with the singer. The crew later decided to have Kevin be in a Police tribute band called Scrantonicity because he [...] "talks so low, and has very little expression, and there is no band that sings higher and with more expression than the Police." [...] While Kevin was always intended to be the band's lead singer, executive producer Greg Daniels approached Baumgartner about possibly playing an instrument, but the actor replied he could not play anything. Daniels and Baumgartner then discussed instruments that would be [...] "funny" [...] to play and brought up harmonicas, saxophones, and drums. They ultimately decided on the latter because they deemed a [...] "drumming lead singer [...] be the funniest choice," [...] regardless {{of the fact that the}} actor had [...] "absolutely no drumming experience, and it's a difficult instrument." [...] Baumgartner took some drum lessons, but found filming of the episode to be [...] "the <b>hardest</b> <b>thing</b> that I've ever done artistically." [...] He was aided by a stunt musician who hid behind a curtain near the band.|$|E
