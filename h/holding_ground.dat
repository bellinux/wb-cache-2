5|$|The {{heavy losses}} {{sustained}} by the Heer (army) since the opening of Operation Barbarossa had resulted in a shortage in infantry and artillery. Units were in total 470,000 men understrength. For the Wehrmacht to undertake an offensive in 1943 {{the burden of the}} offensive, in both attacking the Soviet defenses and <b>holding</b> <b>ground</b> on the flanks of the advance, would have to be carried primarily by the panzer divisions. In view of the exposed position of Army Group South, Manstein proposed that his forces should take the strategic defensive. He anticipated that a Soviet offensive would attempt to cut off and destroy Army Group South by a move across the Donets River toward the Dnieper. In February, he proposed waiting for this offensive to develop and then delivering a series of counterattacks into the exposed Soviet flanks. Hitler, concerned about the political implications of taking a defensive stance, and preoccupied with holding the Donbass, rejected this plan. On 10 March, Manstein presented an alternative plan whereby the German forces would pinch off the Kursk salient with a rapid offensive commencing as soon as the spring rasputitsa had subsided.|$|E

25|$|Murat then {{arrived on}} the {{battlefield}} with reinforcements, deploying his two battalions of light infantry, and assuming personal command of Saint-Germain's cuirassier division. With the cuirassiers successfully countercharging and repulsing a Russian Dragoon regiment that had come up to attack {{the right wing of}} the French forces, Murat realised that he was in a dangerous position and sent word to General Delzons to hasten his march towards the field of battle. Several attacks ensued, with the French committing Jacquinot's cavalry brigade and the infantry, but with the Russians <b>holding</b> <b>ground.</b> Realising his numeric superiority, the Russian commander, General Ostermann-Tolstoy, launched an attack against both French wings, in an attempt to catch them in double envelopment. However, with the arrival of a fresh French division, Delzon's 13th division, the Russian commander decided to call off his attack and pull back. Murat opted against a pursuit, given his inferior forces and knowing that Broussier's division was too far off behind Delzons to be counted on.|$|E
25|$|Insects have a {{wide variety}} of predators, {{including}} birds, reptiles, amphibians, mammals, carnivorous plants, and other arthropods. The great majority (80–99.99%) of individuals born do not survive to reproductive age, with perhaps 50% of this mortality rate attributed to predation. In order to deal with this ongoing escapist battle, insects have evolved a wide range of defense mechanisms. The only restraint on these adaptations is that their cost, in terms of time and energy, does not exceed the benefit that they provide to the organism in question. The further that a feature tips the balance towards beneficial, the more likely that selection will act upon the trait, passing it down to further generations. The opposite also holds true; defenses that are too costly will have a slim to zero chance of being passed down. Examples of defenses that have withstood the test of time include hiding, escape by flight or running, and firmly <b>holding</b> <b>ground</b> to fight as well as producing chemicals and social structures that help prevent predation.|$|E

In mid-1917, it suffered heavy casualties during the Battles of Messines and Passchendaele. In March 1918, during the German Spring Offensive, the battalion repelled repeated attacks that were concentrated upon breaking through the Allied line at Dernancourt. Later, when the Allies launched their own offensive, the Hundred Days Offensive, the 45th Battalion was heavily involved in the fighting that began on 8 August 1918, during which time it was credited with capturing a large number of German soldiers, {{as well as a number}} of artillery pieces and machine-guns. Its last major action was the Battle of the Hindenburg Line, on 18 September, when it seized outposts of the Hindenburg Line, around Le Verguier.|$|E

40|$|A {{survey of}} local farmers {{was carried out}} to {{identify}} the current curfew practices on cattle at farms and <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> in West Timor prior to transport to Java. The survey was also aimed to recognise the potential stressors contributing to body weight loss {{and a lack of}} feed intake in the newly received cattle. There is little known about the current practices on Bali cattle at farms and <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> in West Timor before transportation. An interview and observation survey of 150 Bali cattle farmers and 9 traders was conducted in three different regencies throughout West Timor. There was no period of feed and water deprivation practiced by farmers prior to land transportation especially for cattle sold in traditional markets. The deprivation was only held for feedlot cattle for about 18 to 24 hours but then the animals were allowed to access feed and water for approximate 4 to 6 hours before weighing for sale and transportation. The animals were branded with hot iron after being sold. Duration of land transportation was depended on the distance from original farms or <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> to ports. As at farms, there were no deprivation practices in <b>holding</b> <b>grounds</b> prior to transport. All of the respondents reported that there was no written rule or protocols provided by government relating to transportation guidelines. In conclusion, the practices of feed and water deprivation, long duration of transportation, branded with hot iron, handling activities, mixing and different types of feeds in some stage of transportation might be potensial stressors contributing to the animals...|$|R

2500|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{debate among}} German staff officers, General Erich von Falkenhayn, {{the head of}} Oberste Heeresleitung (OHL, German army supreme command) insisted on rigid defence of the front line in 1916 and implied after the war that the psychology of German soldiers, shortage of manpower and lack of reserves made the policy inescapable, since the troops necessary to seal off breakthroughs did not exist. High losses incurred in <b>holding</b> <b>ground</b> by a policy of no retreat were preferable to higher losses, voluntary withdrawals {{and the effect of}} a belief that soldiers had discretion to avoid battle.

No divisions were moved from the 6th Army, despite it holding a shorter line with [...] divisions and three of the reserve divisions being in the 6th Army area.
