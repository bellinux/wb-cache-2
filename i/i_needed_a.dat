5|$|Pokiri success {{elevated}} Mahesh to super-stardom {{and brought}} recognition to Jagannadh {{as a writer}} and director. The sequences featuring Brahmanandam as a software engineer, the comedy track of Ali and Brahmanandam, Mahesh asking D'Cruz to give him upma at the railway station were acclaimed. The fashion trend of wearing doctor sleeves increased in Andhra Pradesh after Mahesh sported them and they continue to influence fashion even today. After the film's release, many films were released subsequently that had titles bordering on cuss words including Jagannadh's next film Desamuduru (2006). Mahesh revealed that he became confused after the film's success:It was such a huge hit, that if someone came to me with a script, I would approach the result of the film before approaching the character. I only wanted to act in movies that were like Pokiri, I think that was a mistake. It all got to me and I felt that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> break from films itself. Initially, I wanted just a seven-month break. I signed Khaleja after nine months, but it just kept getting delayed and the break ended up becoming a two-year-long holiday. But I didn't freak out... I relaxed {{for the first time in}} life.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} months of World War I, Kars was a key {{military}} objective for the Ottoman army. Ismail Enver who pushed the Ottoman Empire into World War <b>I,</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> victory against the Russians to defend his position. He collected an army on the eastern border. The army was badly defeated under Enver's command at the Battle of Sarikamish January 2, 1915 against Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich. This defeat was more due to the winter weather and bad planning, given the fact that Russians were actually preparing to evacuate Kars. With the loss of the eastern army, Ottoman defenses crumbled with further small battles and the Russian army succeeded in advancing as far west as Erzincan.|$|E

500|$|In the film, Ferris convinces Cameron {{to borrow}} his father's rare 1961 Ferrari GT California. [...] "The insert {{shots of the}} Ferrari were of the real 250 GT California", Hughes {{explains}} in the DVD commentary. [...] "The cars we used in the wide shots were obviously reproductions. There were only 100 of these cars, so it was way too expensive to destroy. We {{had a number of}} replicas made. They were pretty good, but for the tight shots <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> real one, so we brought one in to the stage and shot the inserts with it." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{always loved}} going to Ogmore and Southerndown. I thought the cliffs there {{looked like a}} {{building}} anyway. A building capable of withstanding the roughest weather for hundreds of years. The older they get, the better they look. I wondered {{if it would be}} possible to make a building which had the same qualities as these magnificent cliffs. To do that <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> lot of stone. Normal stone for buildings has to be specially cut into blocks; it takes a long time to make and costs a fortune. But in north Wales the historic slate industry has left behind whole mountains of waste stone that no-one wants. This was stone cut from the mountainside for nearly two hundred years but which wasn't good enough to make roof slates. Over 90% was thrown away. But it was ideal for making walls like the one I had in mind... —architect Jonathan Adams ...|$|E

Penman's first mystery, The Queen's Man, was a finalist for an Edgar Award for Best First Mystery from the Mystery Writers of America. Penman explains her reasons for turning to the mystery genre after writing only historical novels: [...] "By the time I'd finished researching and writing When Christ and His Saints Slept, I was in danger of burning out. For {{the first time in nearly}} two decades, my boundless enthusiasm for the Middle Ages had begun to flag. So I decided <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> change of pace, and since I am a long-time mystery fan, it occurred to me that a medieval mystery might be fun to write. Once that idea took root, it was probably inevitable that I'd choose to write about Eleanor of Aquitaine, surely one of history's most memorable women." ...|$|E

500|$|Final Nintendo 64 {{specifications}} {{and development}} workstations were not initially available to Rare: a modified Sega Saturn controller {{was used for}} some early playtesting, and the developers had to estimate what the finalised console's capabilities would be. The final Nintendo 64 hardware could render polygons faster than the SGI Onyx workstations they had been using, but the game's textures had to be cut down by half. Karl Hilton explained one method of improving the game's performance: [...] "A lot of GoldenEye is in black and white. RGB colour textures cost {{a lot more in}} terms of processing power. You could do double the resolution if you used greyscale, so a lot was done like that. If <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> bit of colour, I'd add it in the vertex." [...] At one time, developers planned to implement the reloading of the weapons by the player unplugging and re-inserting the Rumble Pak on the Nintendo 64 controller, though this idea was discarded at Nintendo's behest.|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> release. When I would go to Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E

Taylor found no credible, relevant, or legally admissible evidence, of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols having directly participated in the bombing. When McVeigh was asked if there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: [...] "You can't handle the truth!

[...] On the morning of McVeigh's execution a letter was released in which he had written [...] "For those die-hard conspiracy theorists who will refuse to believe this, I turn the tables and say: Show me where I needed anyone else.

500|$|In an {{interview}} with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, saying, [...] "This may sound weird, but I miss traveling. I miss the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling {{of being on the}} stage, knowing it's your best— I love that. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] On April 26, 2007, Ivan Kane, the owner of Los Angeles nightclub Forty Deuce, told E! News that Spears had pulled out of a surprise performance at the venue the previous night. Kane stated that during rehearsal, she was [...] "looking very hot, with four backup dancers and [...] sang three songs. They ran through the set several times, the choreography was smokin', and she sounded great." [...] Marc Malkin of E! News said that Spears thought she might need more time to prepare. He also reported that she was planning to tour House of Blues venues in the United States. Spears wanted to keep the rehearsals a secret, and did not even inform the owners of the different dance studios the reason for the preparation. In late April 2007, a marquee reading [...] "The M+M's" [...] appeared at the House of Blues in San Diego. Several gossip websites and local media sources identified the act as Spears, prompting the show to quickly sell out. The title, [...] "M+M's" [...] code name was claimed to be Mother (after having two children) and Miss (after being divorced). On May 1, 2007, a front-page story on The San Diego Union-Tribune fueled the speculation. The same day, the doors opened at 19:00 PST (03:00 UTC), and Spears took the stage at 22:00 PST (06:00 UTC). It marked the first time Spears was on stage since her knee injury caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled in June 2004.|$|E

In an interview with People in February 2006, Spears explained that she was anxious to resume her career, commenting she missed [...] "traveling [...] the road, seeing different places and being with the dancers and having fun. That feeling of being on the stage, knowing it's your best – I love that. <b>I</b> <b>needed</b> <b>a</b> break. I needed to be hungry again." [...] When asked about her next album, she said she had been experimenting in her home studio with live musicians, stripping down her sound and playing the piano. Spears wanted the album to represent her Louisiana roots, explaining that she grew up listening to blues. [...] "When I was little, I would listen to myself [...] But the record label signs you, and you're just thankful to get a hit song. You can't really show off your voice and where you came from. I would like to try to have more influences of that sound. Not that I'm going to be like frickin' Tina Turner. But you never know", she stated. She also said that she hoped the album would reinvigorate the current pop scene, adding that [...] "It's been boring. Nothing's been wow to me." [...] On May 9, 2006, Spears announced she was pregnant with her second child. A few days later, producers such as J. R. Rotem and Sean Garrett told MTV News they were working with Spears. On September 12, 2006, Spears gave birth to her second son, Jayden James. She filed for divorce from Federline on November 7, 2006, citing irreconcilable differences. After the divorce, her partying and public behaviour drew attention from the worldwide media, and ended with two separate stints at Promises Malibu Alcohol and Drug Rehab Treatment Facility in February 2007.
