50|$|Following the counter-inaugural ball, a group {{marched through}} the Adams Morgan {{neighborhood}} in Washington in an impromptu protest headed {{for one of}} the inaugural ball sites at the Washington Hilton Hotel. A few of the marchers wore masks and carried torches. A handful spray-painted buildings with the anarchist symbol and broke windows of a police car and a bank. A police roadblock directed the group into a maze of alleys where officers rounded up about six dozen marchers who were not engaged in vandalism; they were pepper-sprayed, detained, and jailed overnight. Charges were later dropped. A police report described the event.

5000|$|McCormick {{was born}} July 30, 1880 in Chicago to a {{distinguished}} family, and known as [...] "Bertie" [...] {{to his family}} because he had so many relatives named Robert. His maternal grandfather was Tribune editor and former Chicago mayor Joseph Medill. On his father's side, his great-uncle was inventor and businessman Cyrus McCormick. His elder brother Joseph Medill McCormick (known as Medill McCormick) was slated {{to take over the}} family newspaper business but was more interested in running for political office.From 1889 through 1893, he lived a lonely childhood with his parents in London where his father Robert Sanderson McCormick was Second Secretary of the American Legation in London, where he served from 1889 to 1892 under Minister Robert Todd Lincoln. Later, his father was ambassador to Austria-Hungary (1901-1902) and Imperial Russia (1902-1905) In 1905 he replaced Horace Porter as ambassador to France. In London, Bertie attended Ludgrove School. On his return to the United States, he was sent to Groton School. In 1899, McCormick went to Yale College, where {{he was elected to the}} prestigious secret society Scroll and Key, graduating in 1903. He attended law school at Northwestern University School of Law and served as a clerk in a Chicago law firm, being admitted to the bar in 1907. The following year, he co-founded the law firm that became Kirkland & <b>Ellis,</b> which <b>represented</b> <b>the</b> Tribune Company. He was a partner until 1920. In 1910, he took control of the Chicago Tribune, becoming editor and publisher with his cousin, Captain Joseph Medill Patterson, in 1914, a position he held jointly until 1926 and by himself afterwards.|$|R

40|$|Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT: <b>Ellis,</b> 2001) <b>represents</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) {{model of}} psychopathology. Although {{there is much}} empirical support for the basic theory of REBT (see David, Lynn, & Ellis, 2010), the model has never been tested {{in the context of}} posttraumatic stress responses to adverse life events. The first empirical chapter of the thesis investigated the construct validity of the Attitudes and Belief Scale 2 (ABS- 2 : DiGiuseppe, Leaf, Exner, & Robin, 1988). This chapter employed traditional confirmatory factor analysis and confirmatory bifactor modelling to investigate the psychometric properties of the ABS- 2. Results indicated that a bifactoral model conceptualisation was found to offer an adequate representation of the underlying factor structure of the scale. Based on these results, an abbreviated version of the ABS- 2 with superior psychometric properties was thus constructed. In the second empirical chapter confirmatory bifactor modelling and composite reliability analysis were employed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Profile of Emotional Distress (PED: Opris & Macavei, 2007). The PED was designed to capture the qualitative distinction between dysfunctional emotions, as predicted by REBT theory. Results indicated that the PED does not capture the distinction between functional and dysfunctional negative emotions, however a bifactor model inclusive of a single general distress factor, and four method factors was found to be an acceptable fit of the data. The third empirical chapter utilised structural equation modelling to test the organisation of the irrational beliefs in the prediction of posttraumatic stress responses. A model consistent with the predictions of REBT theory was found to be a good fit of the data and explained a large percentage of variance in each symptom class of posttraumatic stress. The fourth empirical chapter provided the first piece of empirical evidence that generalised irrational beliefs impact upon posttraumatic stress symptoms via traumaspecific irrational beliefs; a frequently hypothesised relationship which had hitherto remained untested. Results of structural equation modelling offered support for this core hypothesis. Subsequently, the fifth empirical chapter investigated the impact of traumaspecific irrational beliefs in the prediction of reporting posttraumatic stress symptoms while controlling for a number of important sociodemographic factors. Binary logistic regression analysis was employed and found that three irrational belief process positively predicted belong to the strongly symptomatic group. Finally, the sixth empirical chapter employed sequential moderated multiple regression analysis to determine if rational beliefs could positively moderate the impact of irrational beliefs of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Rational beliefs were found to exert a negative, direct effect on posttraumatic stress symptoms, and to lessen the impact of irrational beliefs on posttraumatic stress responses...|$|R
50|$|Ben Ellis (11 April 1906 - c. 1967) was a Welsh footballer, {{who played}} for Bargoed Town, Tredegar, Bangor and Motherwell. <b>Ellis</b> also <b>represented</b> Wales and <b>the</b> Scottish League.
