50|$|If {{a simple}} gear train has three gears, {{such that the}} input gear GA meshes with an {{intermediate}} gear GI which in turn meshes with the output gear GB, then the pitch circle of the intermediate gear rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output gears. This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this gear train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this gear ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the gears GA and GB engage directly. The intermediate gear provides spacing but does not affect the gear ratio. For this reason it is called an idler gear. The same gear ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler gears and hence an idler gear is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven gear. If the <b>driver</b> <b>gear</b> moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven gear also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} idler gear.|$|E

In this paper, a torsional-axial-lateral geared rotor analysis is used to determine dynamic transmission error as a function of bearing stiffness and damping. Bearings have a similar effect as found in shaft dynamics; transmission error can be reduced more than 10 decibels by appropriate selection of bearing properties...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{investigates the}} {{incidence}} of target gearing behaviour in firms {{as well as the}} drivers of such behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: The paper employs a triangulation approach across three methodological phases: a questionnaire survey, logistic regression modelling of firm data, and interviews with finance directors. The results are then discussed under the key themes of gearing optimality, valuation issues, external drivers, the finance life-cycle, the impact of risk, and the relationship between gearing and corporate strategy. Findings: The results reveal that the majority of firms engage in targeting, though targets are subject to fairly frequent revision as both external and internal drivers evolve. Important external drivers include macroeconomic variables and analysts’ views, whereas important internal <b>drivers</b> include income <b>gearing</b> and profitability.

40|$|Power {{transmission}} is traditionally achieved with a mechanical gear. These gears require maintenance, cause vibration, {{and have no}} overload protection. Magnetic gears (MGs) offer an innovative solution to these drawbacks as they do not require regular maintenance, have no need for lubrication, create very little acoustic noise, have built in overload protection {{and as a result}} of these advantages, have a longer lifetime of operation. The flux focusing axial magnetic gear (FFAMG) was assembled for future testing of power transmission, conversion, and generation applications. Gears are used to transmit power by converting low speed-high torque rotary motion into high speed-low torque rotary motion, or conversely, converting high speed-low torque rotary motion into low speed-high torque rotary motion, through a gear ratio. On a traditional mechanical gear this ratio is the ratio of teeth on the load gear to the teeth on the drive gear. The innovative FFAMG uses a ratio of magnetic poles on the <b>driver</b> <b>gear</b> to load gear to accomplish the power transmission that a traditional mechanical gear would achieve. As a result of this research the FFAMG was assembled successfully, magnetic flux density measurements were collected and compared with simulations. Finally, looking to the future, procedures for testing the efficiency and investigating the overload conditions of the FFAMG for continuing research were developed...|$|E

First, a unique test method for polymer gear wear will {{be described in}} brief and later used in the extensive investigation of acetal and nylon gear wear. Initial tests were performed using acetal pinions with acetal gears, and nylon pinions with nylon gears, with further investigation carried out using dissimilar polymer gears. In this case the driver and driven effects on the gear wear behaviour was also considered when dissimilar materials were used. For acetal against acetal gears, {{it was found that}} the acetal gear wear rate increased dramatically when the load reached a critical value for a specific geometry and the gear surface showed slow wear, with a low specific wear rate if the gear was loaded below this critical value. It was found that the surface temperature was the dominant factor influencing the wear rate and an initial relationship between gear surface temperature and gear load capacity has been established and further developed. Experimental investigation on nylon gears was also carried out and different failures have been found compared to acetal gears, such as gear root and pitch fractures. The most interesting observation from the experimental work is the significant difference in wear behaviour when running acteal against nylon gears, especially the low wear rate when acetal is used as the <b>driver</b> <b>gear.</b> The current paper will present an extensive investigation of polymer gear (acetal and nylon) friction and wear behaviour.

40|$|Transmission {{error is}} a measure of the {{positioning}} accuracy of a gear system. This has been widely documented in gearing for many years as the source of problems in noise and vibration. It is a result of errors in the contact conditions which affect the driven gear with respect to the rotation of the <b>driver</b> <b>gear.</b> This research aims to present a better understanding of the basic kinematics of worm gear systems by identifying the significant influences which determine the contact conditions. A literature review of existing theory is described which determines the major areas considered in worm gear contact analysis. Formulae are derived which quantify the effect of component parameter variation on contact. An investigation of the design, manufacture, and operating processes is recorded which identifies error sources relative to the theoretical contact condition. A computer program is developed which calculates contact characteristics such as worm and wheel component form, transmission error and contact marking pattern for a given design including any contact error sources. Computer calculations are validated by comparing direct measurements of these characteristics from several manufactured gear sets with synthesised results produced using the design information, machine settings and error sources detected during production. The behaviour of these gear sets during operation under a torque load has been investigated experimentally. Measured transmission error data from a test rig is used to develop a basic model of worm gear deformation under load. This model has been added to the computer program to improve and extend the analysis capability. The test rig has also been used to investigate the effect of initial wear on contact characteristics. The good correlation between calculated and experimental results shows that the characteristics of a worm gear set can be predicted once all elements of the design and manufacture are known. The results also validate the software as a useful design tool for academic and industrial applications. Important conclusions are drawn on design techniques, the manufacturing process, and the effects of operating under load. Further areas of investigation are identified which offer future research an opportunity to expand upon these conclusions...|$|E

50|$|Knot Punisher: Like the Knot Buster, it is {{designed}} to strike the Fractal Knot of the Heterodyne. Unknown to the Army, Domeki designed the Knot Buster merely as a prototype for this weapon. Where the Knot Buster is a single arm attachment, the Knot Punisher utilizes both arms. One arm utilizes the same pile driver-claw utility of the Knot Buster, but instead of an explosive charge, it is driven by a torque-less counter-rotating dual flywheel attached to the other arm. The flywheel is spun up in advance, the Heterodyne's Fractal Knot is grasped with the claw, and the flywheel is inserted into the pile <b>driver's</b> <b>gear</b> port, firing the spike and impaling the knot. The flywheel itself {{can be used as a}} melee weapon, as it is quite sturdy and possesses a greater radius than the arm and more stability than the drill arm. The downsides with this system is that Dai-Guard cannot pick anything up with it in place, (aside from using the claw), and it takes a considerable amount of time to install the equipment prior to battle.|$|R
