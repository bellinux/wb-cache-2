50|$|<b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> become {{sexually mature}} {{anywhere}} between eight and {{fifteen years of}} age, depending on which island they are from. Mating season also varies between islands, but soon after mating, the females migrate to sandy areas to nest, laying 2-20 eggs in a burrow about 50 cm deep. The eggs hatch anywhere from 90 to 125 days later.|$|E
5000|$|Charles Darwin {{described}} the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> as [...] "ugly animals, of a yellowish orange beneath, {{and of a}} brownish-red colour above: from their low facial angle they have a singularly stupid appearance." [...] The <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> grows to a length of 3 to(-) 5 ft with a body weight of up to 25 lb, depending upon which island they are from. Being cold-blooded, they absorb heat from the sun by basking on volcanic rock, and at night sleep in burrows to conserve their body heat. These iguanas also enjoy a symbiotic relationship with birds; the birds remove parasites and ticks, providing relief to the iguanas and food for the birds.|$|R
50|$|First {{described}} by American zoologist Edmund Heller in 1903, {{it has been}} questioned whether C. pallidus is a valid species {{in its own right}} or merely a variant or possibly a subspecies of the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> found on other islands in the Galapagos.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> (Conolophus subcristatus) is {{a species}} of lizard in the family Iguanidae. It {{is one of three}} species of the genus Conolophus.

5000|$|Like {{the other}} Galápagos ground finches, the small ground finch is an {{omnivore}} with {{a preference for}} vegetable matter. It feeds primarily {{on the ground or}} in low vegetation, eating seeds, buds, flowers, leaves and the occasional insect.

50|$|The Iguana Specialist Group (ISG) is {{concerned}} with the conservation of 45 lizards in the family Iguanidae in North, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Galapagos and Fijian Islands. Included are the marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus), Melanesian iguanas (Brachylophus), <b>Galápagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Conolophus), spiny-tailed iguanas (Ctenosaura), rock iguanas (Cyclura), desert iguanas (Dipsosaurus), green iguanas (Iguana), and chuckwallas (Sauromalus).|$|E
5000|$|The {{island is}} named after an English nobleman, Lord Hugh Seymour. North Seymour Island has an area of [...] and a maximum {{altitude}} of 28 m.

5000|$|Conolophus marthae, the <b>Galápagos</b> pink <b>land</b> <b>iguana,</b> is {{a species}} of lizard of the family Iguanidae. This {{critically}} endangered iguana is native only to the Wolf Volcano in northern Isabela Island of the Galápagos (Ecuador). The iguana has a pink body with some dark stripes, prompting some {{to call it the}} pink iguana or the Galápagos rosy iguana. The species was first discovered in 1986 and was identified as a separate species, distinct from the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana,</b> early in 2009. [...] This species is the only example of ancient diversification in the genus Conolophus and documents one of the oldest events of divergence ever recorded in the Galápagos.|$|R
40|$|Conolophus marthae sp. nov., a {{new species}} endemic to Volcan Wolf of {{northern}} Isla Isabela of the Galapagos archipelago, is described. The new species is morphologically, behaviorally, and genetically distinguished from the other two congeneric species C. subcristatus and C. pallidus. Besides the taxonomic implications, C. marthae sp. nov. is extremely important {{as it is the}} only evidence of deep divergence within the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> lineage...|$|R
50|$|<b>Land</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{primarily}} herbivorous; however, some individuals {{have shown that}} they are opportunistic carnivores supplementing their diet with insects, centipedes and carrion. Because fresh water is scarce on the islands it inhabits, the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> obtains {{the majority of its}} moisture from the prickly-pear cactus that makes up 80% of its diet: fruit, flowers, pads, and even spines. During the rainy season it will drink from available standing pools of water and feast on yellow flowers of the genus Portulaca.|$|R
5000|$|Following Charles Darwin's {{return from}} the Beagle voyage, Buckland {{discussed}} with him the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> and Marine iguanas. He subsequently recommended Darwin's paper {{on the role of}} earthworms in soil formation for publication, praising it as [...] "a new & important theory to explain Phenomena of universal occurrence {{on the surface of the}} Earth—in fact a new Geological Power", while rightly rejecting Darwin's suggestion that chalkland could have been formed in a similar way.|$|E

50|$|Researchers theorize that <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> {{and marine}} iguanas {{evolved from a}} common {{ancestor}} since arriving on the islands from South America, presumably by rafting. The marine iguana diverged from the land iguana some 8 million years ago, which is older {{than any of the}} extant Galapagos islands. It is therefore thought that the ancestral species inhabited parts of the volcanic archipelago that are now submerged. The two species remain mutually fertile in spite of being assigned to distinct genera, and they occasionally hybridize where their ranges overlap.|$|E
50|$|The {{stock for}} the captive {{breeding}} {{program of the}} <b>Galápagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> is descended from iguanas which Captain G. Allan Hancock translocated from nearby Baltra Island to North Seymour Island in the 1930s.

50|$|Coastal lakes, {{moist soil}} and areas where {{freshwater}} and seawater mix contain unique species {{still to be}} studied. Cold, hot and warm marine currents come together here, generating a wide diversity of animal life: from small coloured fish to large mammals.; marine <b>iguanas,</b> <b>Galapagos</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Iguana,</b> <b>galapagos</b> crabs, Galápagos sea lion, Sharks, Blue footed boobie, swallow-tailed gulls, ducks, frigatebirds and the galápagos tortoise. The most unique species to the Galápagos is the Marine Iguana, due to its amphibious nature. It is the only known reptilian lizard that can forage in water and on land.|$|R

He has also conducted research on reptilian herbivores including <b>Galapagos</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Iguana,</b> Chuckwallas, and the federally listed desert tortoise. He has served on the desert tortoise recovery team, and chaired the assessment committee for the U.S. government's desert tortoise recovery plan.|$|R
50|$|South Plaza {{was formed}} by lava up {{streaming}} {{from the bottom of}} the ocean. Despite its small size it is home to a large number of species and it is famous for its extraordinary flora. That is why this island is very popular with visitors. On the steep banks it is possible to see a great number of birds such as nesting red-billed tropicbirds and swallow-tailed gulls, but most of all, enjoying the beautiful view from atop the steep banks or strolling along the base of the cliff is an extremely pleasurable experience. Very attractive are the beautiful prickly pear cactus trees (Opuntia echios) and of course the large colony of <b>Galápagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas.</b> Depending on the season, the Sesuvium ground vegetation changes its colour from intense green in the rainy season to orange and purple in the dry season.|$|E
50|$|Baltra is {{currently}} {{not within the}} boundaries of the Galápagos National Park. The Galápagos Land Iguana is the subject of an active re-introduction campaign on the island; it became extinct on Baltra in 1954. However, in the early 1930s, Captain G. Allan Hancock had translocated a population of <b>Galápagos</b> <b>Land</b> <b>Iguanas</b> from Baltra to North Seymour Island, a smaller island just a few hundred metres north of Baltra. The iguanas survived and became the breeding stock for the successful Charles Darwin Research Station captive breeding program. During the 1980s iguanas from North Seymour were brought to the Darwin Research Station as part of this project and in the 1990s land iguanas were reintroduced to Baltra. As of 1997 scientists counted 97 iguanas living on Baltra, 13 of which were born on the islands. Currently {{it is not uncommon to}} see iguanas either crossing the mainroad or on the runway at the airport.|$|E

50|$|The <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> in the <b>Galápagos</b> vary in {{morphology}} and coloration {{among different}} populations. In {{addition to the}} relatively widespread and well-known <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> (C. subcristatus), {{there are two other}} species of Conolophus: the pink <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> (C. rosada) from northern Isabela Island and the Santa Fe <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> (C. pallidus) from Santa Fe Island. Based on genetic evidence, the <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> and marine iguana diverged about 8-10 million years ago. Within the <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> genus, the oldest split, about 5.7 million years old, is between C. subcristatus and C. rosada. The differentiation between the last two species, C. subcristatus and C. pallidus, is less clear and it has been questioned if they are separate species. Based on mtDNA and cytochrome b, they fall into three monophyletic groups: C. subcristatus of western islands (Isabela and Fernandina), C. subcristatus of central islands (Santa Cruz, Baltra and South Plaza) and C. pallidus. Although the exact pattern is uncertain, it is possible that C. pallidus is closer to one of the C. subcristatus groups, than the two C. subcristatus groups are to each other.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguana</b> {{has been the subject}} of an active {{reintroduction}} campaign on Baltra Island. These animals became extinct on Baltra by 1954, allegedly wiped out by soldiers stationed there who shot the iguanas for amusement. However, {{in the early}} 1930s, William Randolph Hearst had translocated a population of <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> from Baltra to North Seymour Island, a smaller island just a few hundred metres north of Baltra because he could not understand why no iguanas were present there. Hearst's translocated iguanas survived, and became the breeding stock for the Charles Darwin Research Station captive breeding program that has successfully reintroduced the species to Baltra and a number of other areas. Visitors today frequently see iguanas on both the runway of the Baltra airport or while they cross the road.|$|R
50|$|Less {{than two}} hundred mature {{individuals}} remain. When first described, {{it was suggested that}} it should be considered a critically endangered species due to its tiny range and population, and this recommendation was followed when the IUCN reviewed its status in 2012. The area where it lives is uninhabited by humans, and also difficult to access, which limits research into the species. The Galápagos pink land iguana is threatened by introduced feral cats and black rats, which can take eggs and young. The only native predator of the species is the Galápagos hawk. Other threats are possible hybridization with <b>Galápagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas</b> (unknown at present, but has occurred based on genetic evidence), as the ranges of the two species come into contact, and chance events such as eruptions of the Wolf Volcano, which has happened as recently as 2015. It has been proposed that a captive breeding program should be established for the Galápagos pink land iguana, similar to the successful program already established for some populations of the Galápagos land iguana.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{attention}} given to them, the Galapagos have not yet finished offering evolutionary novelties. When Darwin visited the Galapagos, he observed both marine (Amblyrhynchus) and land (Conolophus) iguanas but did not encounter a rare pink black-striped land iguana (herein referred to as "rosada,'' meaning "pink'' in Spanish), which, surprisingly, remained unseen until 1986. Here, we show that substantial genetic isolation exists between the rosada and syntopic yellow forms and that the rosada is basal to extant taxonomically recognized <b>Galapagos</b> <b>land</b> <b>iguanas.</b> The rosada, whose present distribution is a conundrum, is a relict lineage whose origin dates back to a period when {{at least some of}} the present-day islands had not yet formed. So far, this species is the only evidence of ancient diversification along the Galapagos land iguana lineage and documents one of the oldest events of divergence ever recorded in the Galapagos.
