Editor Timothy A. Good has called [...] "Bloodline" [...] {{the second of}} two parts – the first half was the season's third episode [...] "The Plateau", which Owusu-Breen and Schapker also co-wrote. Executive producers Jeff Pinkner and J.H. Wyman had planned Fauxlivia's pregnancy since they conceived her character, but noted that [...] "this isn’t {{going to be a}} normal pregnancy that you see, either. And the pregnancy is [...] in a Fringe way that you don’t comprehend yet. It's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> traditional love triangle, 'I'm pregnant and having a baby' story. It’s going to be Fringe-ified." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he was 15 he {{was sent}} to the Wingate Institute, where young Israeli athletes are groomed to become {{profession}}als. [...] "It wasn't easy being far away from your family", Ram remembers, [...] "but you know it is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> profession and that's {{what you are going to}} try to do for life. You practice twice a day and fit in school in between." [...] He became a professional tennis player in 1996, at the age of 16, but did not compete in a Grand Slam tournament until 2001 when he appeared in the Wimbledon doubles with Erlich.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Gatiss {{said that}} Capaldi's Doctor was [...] "sort of Tom Baker, Jon Pertwee and even Christopher Eccleston style...it's someone who's not {{immediately}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> {{best friend and}} can be quite abrupt and rude." [...] Moffat added to this analysis of the character by saying, [...] "He has a tremendous ability with throwaway humour {{and a lot of}} it is around the fact that sometimes he is terribly rude. I think kids will think he is the rude Doctor [...] You might want to cuddle him but he really will resist." [...] It has been said that part of the Doctor's personality will share [...] "a certain acid wit" [...] of Malcolm Tucker, the role Peter Capaldi is most famous for, [...] "specifically the attitude, the wisecracks and the energy...he can be edgy, volatile and dangerous". Capaldi has stated that all of the previous actors who had played the Doctor were channelled in his portrayal and that his particular influences were Hartnell, Pertwee and Davison.|$|E

6000|$|... "If I ever do get <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{wonderful}} man, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on <b>your</b> account, Jessie," [...] he returned {{in a low}} voice. [...] "You have been my inspiration. Don't forget that;" [...] and he drew her closer than before.|$|R
60|$|CONRAD. Well, why not? For all you know, {{the man you}} <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry may <b>be</b> <b>your</b> great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmother's great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson.|$|R
2500|$|Meanwhile, Wentz {{began to}} hype the band {{wherever}} possible: from wearing [...] "Pete! at the Disco" [...] T-shirts onstage to mentioning {{the group in}} interviews. Wentz gave a quick shout-out to the band during a press junket {{on the day before}} the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards: [...] "I've got a couple of bands coming out soon on Decaydance, one being this band called Panic! at the Disco," [...] Wentz said. [...] "Their record is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> next favorite record. It's called A Fever You Can't Sweat Out – get it before your little brother does." [...] At the time of the band's signing, all of the band members were still in high school (with the exception of Ross, who was forced to quit UNLV). Urie graduated in May 2005, and Wilson and Smith finished school online as the band left for College Park, Maryland, to record their debut record.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the game}} itself, the city remains nameless but is {{strongly}} influenced by the environs of Philadelphia. Cage cited his like of M. Night Shyamalan movies, several which are situated in Philadelphia. Working with a scouting agent that assisted on the Philadelphia film, Cage and his team visited the city, taking {{in many of the}} poorer neighborhoods and meeting with the residents there to capture the despair, poverty, and fear they saw. Cage has also stated that [...] "I would like people to play it once…because that's life. Life you can only play once... I would like people to have this experience that way." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm fine with , but the right way to enjoy Heavy Rain is really to make one thing because it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> story. It's going to be unique to you. It's really the story you decided to write... I think playing it several times is also a way to kill the magic of it." [...] In the Director's Cut edition of the game (the PS Move compatible edition) within the bonus content, [...] "The Origami's Trail", the narrator states that the game is in fact set in Philadelphia.|$|E

6000|$|... "Stay you {{two in the}} background," [...] he said to Ben Greenway and Dickory; [...] "you {{are both}} landsmen, and you don't count in a {{ceremony}} such as this <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be.</b> Station <b>your</b> men as I told you, Bittern, and man the yards when it is time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] she interrupted; [...] "Mr. Carew is sure we're all <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{ruined by}} <b>your</b> {{mother and the}} Universal Transportation Company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No!" [...] he answered. [...] "As {{a matter}} of fact, the spot where you were {{standing}} is not often altogether submerged. You {{might have been a}} prisoner for a few hours. Perhaps as the tide <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> high, <b>your</b> feet would have been wet. But there was no danger." ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. Amah, {{come and}} be {{introduced}} to the gentleman. He's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> master now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Less {{dramatic}} {{things for}} you, now, Milt. Trigonometry is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> idea of fun; blueprints and engineering books." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Although he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> aide-de-camp, Keith, he {{had better}} go to his regimental barracks, and drill {{for a few hours}} a day, if you can spare him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really {{from your}} {{appearance}} {{you might have}} seen the Ragnall ghost, or <b>be</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> married against <b>your</b> will, or--I don't know what. Also you have forgotten to fasten your tie." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jenny and I <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help. We <b>are</b> <b>your</b> debtors, {{as well as}} Belle, {{and demand}} the {{privilege}} of paying up. Blessings, like curses, come home to roost, Fan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope, my dear, you <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> like <b>your</b> mother," [...] said Mr. Burke, gently. [...] "My poor cousin Nora <b>was</b> subject <b>to</b> {{a strange}} lapse of memory at times," [...] he remarked to Louise. [...] "She always {{recovered}} in time, but for days {{she could remember}} nothing of her former life--not even her own name. Are you ever affected that way Eliza?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{you are a}} lot of innocents, upon my word. Why, EVERYbody {{is talking}} of it. Your pa goes to see Rosemary West. SHE is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> step-ma." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Harry {{you need}} not be cross with me because I love the girl who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> wife. You would not like it if I did not care about her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Graham laughed. [...] "That's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> affair. When {{you want}} them the dollars will be ready, and there's only one condition. Every dollar we put down has got to bring another in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anyhow," [...] he went on, {{speaking}} with decision, [...] "so {{long as you}} feel like that, you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have a new gown--or two--and a new hat, and you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have them at once. They <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> bought with <b>your</b> brother's money, mind. Shall I come shopping with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Terence," [...] {{the colonel}} said, [...] "I didn't {{think the time}} was coming so soon when I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{instructed}} by <b>your</b> father's son, but I will own that you have made me feel that I have begun campaigning too late in life, {{and that you have}} given me a lesson." ...|$|R
5000|$|Prophet Kaswa <b>is</b> said <b>to</b> have prophesied {{the coming}} of Europeans: [...] "There are coming terrible strangers who bring war; they will surely come. O you people, you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> robbed of <b>your</b> country: you will not even <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> cough." [...] It was not until 1905-1919 that the Wafipa began seeking {{employment}} with Europeans.|$|R
6000|$|... "See here, my friend, {{you have}} been taking {{advantage}} {{for a long time}} now of the fact that you were ill. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> nurse indefinitely." [...] She slammed her bedroom door.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{told them}} not a word, except {{that my brother}} was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> tutor. When I saw Miss Salter setting off by this line, I made Jem take second-class tickets, {{that she might be}} ashamed of me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{remember}} I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> father's guest, as {{you call}} it. I mean {{to pay for the}} dinner myself, and to send in my own wines. Your father shall have nothing to complain of on that head." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I’ll {{believe that}} when I see it,” said Sidney Feeder, who {{was by no means}} {{perfectly}} incredulous, but who thought it salutary to take that tone. “I’m not sure you’ve any right to work—you oughtn’t to have everything; you ought to leave the field to us, not take the bread out of our mouths and get the kudos. You must pay the penalty of being bloated. You’d have been celebrated if you had continued to practise—more celebrated than any one. But you won’t be now—you can’t be any way you fix it. Some one else <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>your</b> place.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Id Software's John D. Carmack praised Native Client at QuakeCon 2012, saying: [...] "if {{you have}} to do {{something}} inside a browser, Native Client is much more interesting as something that started out as a really pretty darn clever x86 hack in the way that they could sandbox all of this in user mode interestingly. It's now dynamic recompilation, but something that you program in C or C++ and it compiles down <b>to</b> something that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not <b>your</b> -O4 optimization level for completely native code but pretty damn close to native code. You could do all of your evil pointer chasings, and whatever you want to do as a to-the-metal game developer." ...|$|R
5000|$|At an awards {{ceremony}} for a music magazine, Buchan was presenting an award that was won by Green Day, a band {{he had previously}} said that he hated. Buchan alleged that during the after-party Green Day member Billie Joe Armstrong confronted him and said [...] "when you die, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> standing over <b>your</b> grave, laughing at ya." [...] The two then had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> separated by onlookers.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{mean to say}} is," [...] he said at length, in a {{trembling}} voice—"what I mean to say is, without no round-aboutedness, will you lend a ’ard-working man, what’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> future father-in-law, a couple o’ pounds?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, mamma, dear mamma, I am {{so glad to}} {{have you}} again! I was very naughty, but I've learned a lesson, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> good child now," [...] cried Nelly, holding her mother tight with many kisses.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} pretty, Eliza; and I'm {{sure you are}} as good as you're pretty," [...] {{announced}} Louise. [...] "So you must tell me about yourself, and whether you are happy here or not. From this time on I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>your</b> friend, you know, and keep all your secrets; and I'll help you all I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a four-leaved clover," [...] {{answered}} Peter exultantly. [...] "That means {{good luck}} for the summer. I {{found it in}} Markdale. There ain't much clover in Carlisle this year {{of any kind of}} leaf. The crop <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a failure. <b>Your</b> Uncle Roger says it's because there ain't enough old maids in Carlisle. There's lots of them in Markdale, and that's the reason, he says, why they always have such good clover crops there." ...|$|R
50|$|Barres has {{described}} experiences of gender discrimination in MIT. Once, after solving a difficult math problem that stumped many male students, {{he was charged}} with an accusation that it was solved for him by a boyfriend. He was the top student in the class, but found it hard to get a willing supervisor for research. He lost a scholarship to a man who had only one publication, while he already had six. While earning a PhD at Harvard, he was told that he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> win a scientific competition, which was evidently between him and one man; the Dean confided to him, “I have read both applications, and it’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> you; <b>your</b> application <b>is</b> so much better.” But the award <b>was</b> given <b>to</b> the man, who dropped out of science a year later.|$|R
50|$|In {{between the}} park and the town is the Chibi-House. Most of the {{features}} from the old game are included in this game such as recharging and the Chibi-PC. But {{there are still some}} differences such as Telly Vision being replaced with a robot connected to the wall named Chet. There's a reader that reads cartridges you collect and adds minigames and utilities to the shop for you to put into your park. The Chibi-PC has more features then from the first game including a park projects section where you ask your friends to do the projects you want them to do. You can mess with the tiller, the height, and roads and rivers. There's also a smogling forecast where you can check how many smoglings or smogglobs <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in <b>your</b> park.|$|R
