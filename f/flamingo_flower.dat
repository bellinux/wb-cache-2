5000|$|Flamingo {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 59, based on 25 reviews. musicOMH published a positive review stating, [...] "It's clear from <b>Flamingo</b> that <b>Flowers</b> {{accounts for the}} lion's share of talent in The Killers, and if they ever go on definite hiatus, their fans {{can look forward to}} more consistently good material in the form of Flowers' solo albums." [...] Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone described Flowers' penchant for weaving beautiful losers into his songs by stating, [...] "It would be laughable if Flowers wasn't 100 percent committed, and if the hooks on Flamingo weren't irresistible. He is, and they are - and you'll be too busy singing along to giggle." [...] Alix Buscovic of BBC compared tracks [...] "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas" [...] and [...] "Crossfire" [...] to stadium albums Sam's Town and Day & Age and tracks [...] "Magdalena" [...] and [...] "Was It Something I Said?" [...] to 80s pop sensibility album Hot Fuss. Ryan Dombal for The Village Voice described Flowers as [...] "a combination of Bono's brassiness, Morrissey's high drama, and Ian Curtis's spasmodic awkwardness, the singer represents an endangered species in 2010: a genuine arena-ready rock-'n'-roll deity who, at 29, isn't yet on blood thinners." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shortly after {{announcing his}} band {{would take a}} brief hiatus, Flowers began to record his first solo record. After his first single [...] "Crossfire" [...] gained momentum, Flowers {{announced}} a short club tour to help promote his forthcoming album. The tour received high praise from many critics and was expanded into a full length tour into Europe and North America. The namesake of the tour derives from the iconic <b>Flamingo</b> Road in <b>Flowers</b> hometown of Las Vegas, Nevada - where {{he worked as a}} bellhop at the historic Flamingo Las Vegas. He mentions, [...] "A lot of my life took place on Flamingo Road. It's part of Vegas mythology, and now it's part of my own mythology … That's my 'hood.'" [...] Flower's band, The Killers paid tribute to Las Vegas with their second album, Sam's Town, named for Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall.|$|R
40|$|In Brazil, Anthurium andraeanum (<b>flamingo</b> <b>flower)</b> {{stands out}} as an {{important}} species for cut leaves and flowers productions, as well as potted cultivation. Due {{to the fact that}} ornamental plants play an important part in the tropical agriculture diversification, there is great interest to know the problems that affect anthurium cultivation in order to improve its productive potential. The aims of this study were identify the causal agent of intense mosaic and leaf deformation observed in anthurium commercial crops from four cities of the São Paulo state, Brazil; to assess the extent of the virus occurrence in these cities and the methods for its detection, as well as to analyse the anthurium genotypes reactions in relation to the virus. Anthuriums were sampled from the following cities: Mogi das Cruzes, Pariquera-Açu, Iguape and Registro. Leaves and spathes from symptomatic plants were used in mechanical transmission assays. The virus was transmitted only when spathes were used to prepare the inocula, and it induced Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) -like symptoms in the indicator hosts. PTA-ELISA and RT-PCR were performed to identify the virus species, since CMV was detected in all agricultural areas sampled. Anthuriums from IAC varieties, 'Jureia', 'Garoa', 'Eidibel' and 'Astral' and from 'Caipira' and 'Branco' cultivars were inoculated with CMV and all of them were susceptible to the virus. Some of the symptoms observed in CMV infected anthuriums although similar to those induced by Dasheen mosaic virus, are more severe for inducing leaf deformation and intensive mosaic. Both viruses are worldwide spread and transmitted by aphid in a non-persistent manner. Although CMV has a wide host range, it was not found in the literature the presence of anthurium as a host to the virus. The eradication of weed plants, mainly Commelina and Tradescantia that are CMV natural hosts, the elimination of the symptomatic anthuriums and control of the aphid population should also be done in the anthurium crop, since anthurium genotypes with resistance for CMV are not available...|$|E
