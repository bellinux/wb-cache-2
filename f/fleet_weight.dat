As of today, {{the most prevalent}} metals in aircraft recycling are aluminium, as well as nickel and titanium super alloys, e. g., for the engines. The total <b>fleet</b> <b>weight</b> amounts to about 1. 3 million metric tons of materials (not only metals). The aircraft engine material stock alone amounts to about 170, 000 metric tons in the entire fleet. In the coming decade, more than 200, 000 metric tons of obsolete aircraft structural materials can be expected for recycling. This article aims to quantify this flying stock in more detail...|$|E

In this paper we estimate the increased probability of fatalities from {{being hit by a}} heavier vehicle in a collision. We show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1, 000 pounds heavier results in a 47 % increase in the baseline fatality probability. Estimation results further suggest that the fatality risk is even higher if the striking vehicle is a light truck (SUV, pickup truck, or minivan). We calculate that the value of the external risk generated by the gain in <b>fleet</b> <b>weight</b> since 1989 is approximately 27 cents per gallon of gasoline. We further calculate that the total fatality externality is roughly equivalent to a gas tax of $ 1. 08 per gallon. We consider two policy options for internalizing this external cost: a gas tax and an optimal weight varying mileage tax. Comparing these options, we find that the cost is similar for most vehicles. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} found that {{plans for the}} loading of the cargo had not been changed despite the change in itinerary. No calculation of the vessel's stability had been made, a practice found to be common across many operators' <b>fleets.</b> The <b>weight</b> of cargo on board was underestimated, the actual weight being 265 tonnes greater than that calculated to be on board. The {{investigation found}} that the cargo had shifted {{as a result of}} the ship listing; it was not the cause of the list. The ship's ballast water system was not fully servicable, with all but one of the gauges for each ballast tank being unservicable, a situation that had existed since at least July 2014. It was possible to take manual readings of the amount of water in each ballast tank. The chief officer was in the habit of calculating how much water was transferred between tanks by timing the pumps and using their capacity of 7 tonnes per minute. Some of the straps used to secure the cargo to the deck were found not to meet regulations in force at the time, only being half as strong as they should have been.|$|R

North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. Influence of the Skipper Effect in fishing efficiency {{of a mixed}} fishing fleet, looking at a Mexican case study. Understanding the factors that define technical efficiency in a fleet is a requirement to define strategies to regulate the fishing pressure. In industrial and semi-industrial <b>fleets</b> more <b>weight</b> {{has been given to}} the technological effect, while in small-scale fisheries the skipper effect has been more widely discussed. This study aimed to understand the human and technological factors that define the fishing efficiency of a semi-industrial fleet operating at the Campeche Bank, Mexico. A stochastic ray frontier was used to evaluate such efficiency. Nine variables were included: days at sea, crew size, vessel length, power-engine, skippers’ experience, skippers’ education, year-season, fishing area and fishing gear. The data from two fishing seasons (2012 and 2014) used in the analysis comes from logbooks of skippers and interviews undertaken in the Yucatan coast. A total of 1, 095 fishing trips were analyzed, the efficiency of the fleet for both year was medium (0. 72 and 0. 62). Fishing gear, days at sea, crew size, fishing zone and skipper experience were significant variables. The skipper experience (given their background), associated to other variables seemed more relevant for fishing efficiency than the technological effect. Catch composition associated to the type of gear used and fishing zone were also significant factors, which becomes relevant when one analyze the performance of a mixed fishery. ...|$|R
40|$|New car <b>fleet</b> fuel economy, <b>weight</b> {{and engine}} power have changed {{drastically}} since 1980. These changes represent both movements along and {{shifts in the}} "fuel economy/weight/engine power production possibilities frontier". This paper estimates the technological progress that has occurred since 1980 and the trade-offs that manufacturers and consumers face when choosing between fuel economy, weight and engine power characteristics. The results suggest that if weight, horsepower and torque were held at their 1980 levels, fuel economy for both passenger {{cars and light trucks}} could have increased by nearly 50 percent from 1980 to 2006; this is {{in stark contrast to the}} 15 percent by which fuel economy actually increased. I also find that once technological progress is considered, meeting the CAFE standards adopted in 2007 will require halting the observed increases in weight and engine power characteristics, but little more; in contrast, the standards recently announced by the new administration, while certainly attainable, require non-trivial "downsizing". I also investigate the relative efficiencies of manufacturers. I find that US manufacturers tend to be above the median in terms of their passenger vehicle fuel efficiency conditional on weight and engine power, and are among the top for light duty trucks; Honda is the most efficient manufacturer for both passenger cars, while Volvo is the most efficient manufacturer of light duty trucks. However, I also find that over time, US manufacturers' relative efficiency in both passenger cars and light trucks has degraded. These results may provide insight into their current financial troubles. ...|$|R

40|$|Maximising {{revenues}} {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges of regional airports especially after the introduction of deregulation and privatisation of airports with the increase of aggressive competition in the markets. The calculation of aeronautical revenues generation has always been considered as a straightforward method and airport managers generally overlooked on the importance of daily operational factors such as the different flight services offered at the airports, the type of aircraft airlines utilised, time of the day the flight arrives or departs, and the number of passengers the airlines ferry in and out of their airport, types of destination and how these factors influence the generation of aeronautical revenues for their airport. The first objective of this research is to measure the airside operation factors that influence the generation of aeronautical revenues deterministically. The influential variables were determined through literature reviews and case studies of regional airports in the Netherlands and Malaysia, and were validated with regression analysis. Preliminary model was developed based on the determinants and the model was analysed using Bayesian Network theory. Thus, the research is also geared towards developing a baseline matrix using stochastic approach to analyse the effect of airside operation factors on aeronautical revenues generation as the second objective. The next objective concerns with the formulation of mathematical optimisation algorithm known as Aeronautical Revenue Optimisation Model (AROM) to generate maximum aeronautical revenues for regional airport in line with the objectives of the airport. Finally, the research embarks on developing a graphical user interface (GUI) tool based on the model to estimate the possible potential aeronautical revenues that could be generated which will be useful for airport managers in their decision making. The GUI for AROM is a user friendly tool which allows airport managers to key-in the main input parameters such as mode of operations (arrival or departure), traffic types (Schedule, Business, Charter, etc.), flights details (day or night, weekday or weekend, number of passengers, international or domestic), <b>fleet</b> types (aircraft <b>weight</b> and engine type) and type of flights (domestic or international) in order to determine the composition offlight operations that produces optimum aeronautical revenues that could be achieved. Results obtained show that the maximum revenue achieved is based on flights composition, which is more focused towards certain types of traffic types with higher frequency for each of them in contrast to the current practise of offering small number of all sorts of traffic types. The model developed in this research is flexible; it allows decision makers to set the upper bound of flight constraints. The model can also be extended to include bigger sets of flight details, for example, to have day, evening and night flight instead of just day and night. Aside from that, the parameter can also be generalised such as to consider all international flights instead of domestic and international. The traffic types can also be adjusted to include shorter or longer list of traffic types to suit the airport's services...|$|R

The remainder of the abstract provides a more detailed outlines of the three essays. ^ Chapter 1 explores strategic behavior by consumers in demand response programs. The chapter looks at how the confluences of consumer strategic behavior, technology and price incentives in demand response lead to conflicting outcomes. Demand response has become an important tool for utilities to manage load during peak periods. While the effects of demand response programs on peak load reductions are well studied and intuitive, assessments typically fail to recognize the potential for off-peak behavioral responses that may mitigate the total benefits of the program. Using smart meter consumption data on residential air conditioning units enrolled in a direct load control program, this paper examines changes in consumption prior to and after curtailment events. The manuscript rigorously estimates both peak and off peak changes in consumption to better understand net benefits of DR programs. We examine Pacific Gas and Electric 2 ̆ 7 s (PG 2 ̆ 6 E) SmartAC program, which is designed to reduce peak cooling load by directly controlling air conditioning units of participants. ^ Usually, program evaluation uses the availability of a control group to obtain unbiased estimates of program impacts. However, {{we do not have the}} luxury of a control group in our data. Instead we estimate unit-specific non-linear consumption models and then compare load on event days to predicted load. Importantly, we use data from the summer 2007 training period from a stratified random sample of 294 participating AC units. In contrast to subsequent summers and normal DR designs, during the training period curtailment days were called for many different temperature levels, not just the hottest days. This aspect means we are not predicting out of sample, and we can have greater confidence in our econometric evidence. Our methodology is validated by a falsification test in which we find no changes in consumption during peak or off-peak times on non-curtailment days that match the temperature and timing profile of actual curtailment days. ^ Several key results emerge from this analysis. First, we confirm that the SmartAC program, like other DR and DLC programs, reduces peak load during event days. In this case, peak consumption was reduced 19...|$|R
