2500|$|Although Spain apologized, on February 13, 1898, the Maine {{exploded}} {{and sank}} in Havana Harbor, Cuba, two days later, killing 266 American sailors. After a hasty naval court of inquiry, the American press blamed Spain and {{accused them of}} planting a mine that sank the battleship. The war with Spain {{became known as the}} “Correspondents’ War”. Journalists not only wrote stories about the conflict, but took part in the fight. In 1898, the prestige of the press ran high. American society was changing as literacy rates increased. There was a new revolution of readers. As war zones became more open to the press, journalists wrote eyewitness accounts of what was happening. In an era before radio and television, newspapers were the main source of information, opinion, and entertainment <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b> [...] "You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war", newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst declared. In New York City, where the population was about 2,800,000, the combined circulation of daily papers was about 2,000,000.|$|E

The band teased saying that [...] "What About Us" [...] is a pop track, and that is a good indication of what the expect from the album, and that they've paired up with Diane Warren to record a few ballads and not just pop tracks. In early December 2012, the band tweeted [...] "In the studio today! Finishing up a few tracks for the NEW ALBUM..whoop!" [...] Although, the band returned to record more songs later in 2013.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to evaluating the half model, the researchers also reviewed {{all the evidence}} used in the debate to date. With the help of FBI and BATF forensics investigators, they concluded that some 25 to 30 documents supporting the ship being a rebuild were forgeries. In 1991, they published their findings and conclusion that the current Constellation and the original frigate are two different ships. The authors {{did not agree with}} Chapelle, however, over the nature of the new ship's construction; they pointed out that the Act for the Gradual Increase authorized the Navy to build new ships from the oak acquired under its provisions, so {{there was no need to}} subvert Congress's authority on the matter. Lynaugh summarized the report in a separate article published in 1993, Discussion of the Origins of the Frigate and the Sloop Constellation, and concluded that [...] "though not built in Baltimore in 1797, the present ship was the last sail-only powered warship designed and built by the U.S. Navy. As such, it is a rare artifact of first importance and truly deserves to be preserved and displayed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>public.</b>|$|E
