The 3 -year study was conducted near Vernon, Texas to determine biomass persistence of chemically terminated wheat and rye cover crops following six application rates of glyphosate. Treatments were applied at the boot or at the 50 % heading stage of growth. The amount of standing biomass at 0 to 1 ft, 1 to 2 ft, and> 2 ft was estimated 4 wks after application and expressed {{as a percentage of}} the total biomass or percent persistence. Percent control or kill was also recorded. A successful treatment was defined as> 90 % control and> 15 % standing residue above 1 ft. Results indicate that rye and wheat provided acceptable stubble persistence when terminated with at least 0. 38 lb ai/ac glyphosate at 50 % <b>heading.</b> <b>Higher</b> <b>application</b> rates of glyphosate did not increase control (> 90 % kill) of the cover crop, were less cost effective, and resulted in decreased stalk persistence.

40|$|Means of {{hydroelectric}} power generation today typically require {{state or federal}} funding, massive construction projects and <b>high</b> <b>head</b> differentials {{with the use of}} a dam. With thousands of miles of canals and waterways at our disposal, it is necessary to find a cost effective way of generating a substantial amount of power from low-head {{hydroelectric power}} sources. This senior project details research on low-head hydroelectric power generation, along with the design, construction and evaluation of a twisted Savonius hydroelectric turbine. Sizing optimizations for a twisted Savonius turbine were performed, and the hydroelectric power generation unit was constructed, including a housing for placement in a flume. This turbine was tested at varying flow rates and head differentials and the theoretical power outputs were calculated. The turbine performed well under low flows and very low <b>head</b> <b>applications,</b> providing nearly 700 W of power from approximately one foot of head loss. This design for a low-head hydroelectric turbine could easily be used in a canal or waterway for commercial farming, residential or for pumping plant applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{low head}} {{hydropower}} station {{is in the}} southwest of China, its Francis turbine ran well at a rated power and rated net head, but the turbine produced severe abnormal vibration and noise at <b>higher</b> <b>head</b> than the rated head, full load and overload. By analyzing, characteristic points on vibration conditions are inside the area of channel vortices on runner performance curve. CFD analysis indicates that unstable vortices exist between runner blades. The two results demonstrate that the vibration and noise of Francis turbine are caused by runner channel vortices at <b>higher</b> <b>head</b> than the rated head, full load and overload...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master's thesis is to describe the existing surge tank solutions and additional improvements, and to simulate the hydraulic behavior of the surge tanks and how it affects the hydropower plant. The <b>high</b> <b>head</b> hydropower plant Torpa and the low head hydropower plant Åna-Sira are used for the case study, thus the surge tanks can be simulated under different hydraulic conditions. Turbine pressures and mass oscillations after a complete turbine shutdown, and turbine regulation parameters from operating the hydropower plant, are simulated in the LVTrans software. The result is a Surge Tank Atlas, where the surge tank solutions are described with conceptual drawings, advantages and disadvantages, and documentation from the simulations. This Surge Tank Atlas provides a useful tool to compare different surge tank solutions for both a <b>high</b> <b>head</b> and low head hydropower plant. Some of the conclusions are valid for both hydropower plants and all the surge tank solutions. Increasing the distance from surge tank to turbine, decreasing the surge tank volume or a strong throttling of the surge tank will increase the water hammer significantly, {{and to some extent}} reduce the mass oscillations. An optimal throttling of the surge tank will stabilize the running of the hydropower plant, reduce the surge tank mass oscillations and hence the necessary height and volume of the surge tank. Other conclusions vary between the open and the closed surge tank, and the <b>high</b> and low <b>head</b> hydropower plant. The closed surge tank shows a better dampening of the water hammer than the open surge tank for both hydropower plant, the closed surge tank can be throttled stronger than the open surge tanks, and the surge tanks at the low head hydropower plant requires more volume than for the <b>high</b> <b>head</b> plant, even though the hydraulic head is a tenth of the <b>high</b> <b>head</b> hydropower plant. Hence there are some significant differences in the hydraulic behavior between the surge tank solutions and the <b>high</b> <b>head</b> and the low head hydropower plant, that will be presented and discussed in the Surge Tank Atlas...|$|R

40|$|The sizing of {{photovoltaic}} {{water pumping}} systems {{is critical for}} ensuring that the desired hydraulic output is achieved.

The testing system response was verified and with the testing system operational <b>high</b> <b>head</b> photovoltaic water pumping system sizing models were tested. By using the testing system to investigate four sizing models the operation and suitability of the models was determined. One of the sizing models, PVYST was discovered to simulate flow rates that exceed the maximum flow rate of the pump, which could result in an overestimation {{of the volume of}} water supplied. Additionally, the behaviour of the pump to series and parallel configurations of the photovoltaic array was investigated to determine if the manufacturer&# 146;s sizing was accurate.
