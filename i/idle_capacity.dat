5|$|Hirschman {{also stated}} that during {{conditions}} of slack activity in developed countries, the stock of resources, machines and entrepreneurs are merely unemployed, and are present as <b>idle</b> <b>capacity.</b> So in this situation, simultaneous investment in {{a large number of}} sectors is a well-suited policy. The various economic agents are temporarily unemployed and once the inducement to invest starts operating, the slump will be overcome. However, for an underdeveloped economy, where such resources are absent, this principle doesn't fit.|$|E

40|$|Even a {{fully loaded}} {{computer}} system, where the bottleneck resource is constantly busy, often has some <b>idle</b> <b>capacities</b> available on other resources. This proposal argues for using these <b>idle</b> <b>capacities</b> speculatively, increasing system performance for correct predictions. In such a system, all resources will ideally be constantly loaded with either regular foreground tasks, or speculative idle-time tasks. The key contribution of this proposal {{is a model}} for non-interfering use of <b>idle</b> resource <b>capacity,</b> based on three principles: resource prioritization between regular foreground and idle-time use, preemptability of idle-time processing, and isolation of speculative side effects. Current operating systems fail to provide all three capabilities. Without new mechanisms, processing of speculative tasks can delay or even starve foreground processing, and result in a decreased foreground performance, instead of increasing it.

Thus, speculation can no longer delay or interfere with foreground processing. Based o...|$|R

25|$|To stop inflation, the {{government}} opted for heterodox policies of control within an expansionary program. Prices and wages {{in the modern}} sector were to be fixed, after an initial one-shot increase in wage rates. The increase in wages was intended to raise living standards of workers and stimulate production by raising sales to consumers. To offset the effects of higher wages on costs of production, financial costs of the business sector were cut by intervention {{in order to reduce}} and control interest rates. After making one adjustment of the exchange rate to minimize negative effects on exports, {{the government}} stopped the process of continuing devaluation in order to help hold down inflation. Imports were rightly expected to go up as the economy revived; to help finance them, García made his controversial decision to stop paying external debt service beyond 10 percent of the value of exports.

40|$|AbstractWe {{elaborate}} some complex stylized facts {{related to}} the Mexican economy. The analyzed period runs from 1960 to 2013 with selected subperiods. Our main findings are: 1) there are involuntary <b>idle</b> <b>capacities</b> in the manufacturing industries; 2) {{the growth of the}} Mexican economy is not balanced but unbalanced; 3) there is an inflation-free environment. This fact is consistent with the previous ones; 4) there is a mixed of efficient and inefficient sequences of investment; 5) the stimulus of manufacturing exports on macroeconomic performance has been offset by its imports; 6) the deficits in manufacturing balance and in the current account have been financed without difficulty. Of course, this financing capacity constitutes a second best condition; 7) according to a backward linkages analysis, the towing capacity of manufacturing sector over the Mexican economy would be a larger one if the manufacturing imports penetration had not been so intense since the trade liberalization; and 8) the size of the positive effect of the manufacturing sector on the economy and on the non-manufacturing sectors diminished since the early eighties.

40|$|In recent years, the {{proliferation}} of mobile devices {{has led to the}} emergence of mobile grid computing, that is extending the reach of grid computing by enabling mobile devices both to contribute to and utilise grid resources. Thus, the pool of available computational and storage resources can be significantly enriched by leveraging <b>idle</b> <b>capacities</b> of mobile devices. Nevertheless, the emergence of the mobile grid gives rise to challenges, which have not hitherto been addressed thoroughly. Among those is the security threat, which arises from the multitude of mobile devices accessing grid resources and associated network connections, spanning across the globe. Accordingly, the aim of this paper is two-fold. First, it surveys prominent grid monitoring systems and attempts to identify any potential limitations with respect to the security aspect. The results of the survey indicate that existing solutions fail to address the security concerns, which arises from enabling the mobile devices interacting with the grid. To this end the second aim of the paper is to propose a monitoring system which continuously tracks the geo-location of the mobile devices accessing the grid and thereby ascertains that the location-based security policies are not violated...|$|R

40|$|Cloud Computing {{has emerged}} as a {{successful}} computing paradigm for efficiently utilizing managed compute infrastructure such as high speed rack-mounted servers, connected with high speed net-working, and reliable storage. Usually such infrastructure is dedi-cated, physically secured and has reliable power and networking in-frastructure. However, much of our <b>idle</b> compute <b>capacity</b> is present in unmanaged infrastructure like idle desktops, lab machines, phys-ically distant server machines, and laptops. We present a scheme to utilize this <b>idle</b> compute <b>capacity</b> on a best-effort basis and provide high availability even in face of failure of individual components or facilities. We run virtual machines on the commodity infrastructure and present a cloud interface to our end users. The primary challenge is to maintain availability in the presence of node failures, net-work failures, and power failures. We run multiple copies of a Virtual Machine (VM) redundantly on geographically dispersed physical machines to achieve availability. If one of the running copies of a VM fails, we seamlessly switchover to another running copy. We use Virtual Machine Record/Replay capability to imple-ment this redundancy and switchover.

40|$|We draw {{on three}} strands of {{literature}} dealing with utilization, maintenance, and scrapping {{in order to}} analyze {{the properties of the}} respective policies and their interac-tions. We do so by focusing on the last period of the received multi-period service life model and extending it in three directions: first, by associating the physical deteriora-tion of equipment to the intensity of its utilization and maintenance; second, by ex-panding on the range of explainable operating policies to allow for <b>idling,</b> mothballing, <b>capacity</b> depleting, capacity preserving, full capacity, upgrading, and downgrading; and, third, by linking the operating policies to the capital policy of scrapping. Owing to these enhancements, the analysis leads to several important findings. One among them is that optimal operating policies behave usually in opposite directions, proceed-ing in time from harder to softer or vice versa, depending on the net revenue earning capability of the equipment under consideration. Another is that profit (loss) making equipment is scrappable iff on the average the operating capital deteriorates faster (slower), or equivalently improves slower (faster), than the scrapping capital. And still an-other result is that operating policies are determined jointly with scrapping policy capi-tal policies, thus suggesting that empirical investigations of their determinants should allow for this simultaneity.

Particular focus has been placed upon business models within the B 2 B-segment of the sharing economy, where a small company within the transport sector states as an example. Methodology: A qualitative methodology, based on an abductive approach, has been used. The case study is explorative and based on qualitative semi-structured interviews and observations, as well as printed sources. Theoretical framework: The thesis’ theoretical framework consists of theories within the fields of the sharing economy, business models and business models within the sharing economy. Conclusions: This study has shown that critical mass can be considered to be the biggest challenge for companies within the sharing economy in order to become economically sustainable. The ability to achieve a critical mass is determined by how well the company uses business model development and innovation to handle other aspects such as trust, <b>idling</b> <b>capacity,</b> belief in the commons, customer effort and changing consumer behaviors.
