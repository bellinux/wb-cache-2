40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{financial}} product innovativeness of Islamic financial institutions. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative research methodology is used to collect and analyze the views of practitioners and researchers of Islamic finance. Different assessments are noted which raise the issue of lack of clarity on that subject. Findings – Innovation levels of Islamic financial institutions are low owing to the development of Islamic finance as a new activity. Research limitations/implications – The data available for the study are limited to the views of a small sample of practitioners and researchers in the field of Islamic finance. Practical implications – The major practical implication is the necessity of developing financial product innovativeness programs as a means for survival and growth.

40|$|From the {{perspective}} of poverty alleviation, socially relevant, or pro‐poor, rural innovation {{is of particular interest}} in a country like India since it is in rural areas that most of the poor live. Pro‐poor innovation in rural areas is more likely to occur through small‐scale ventures and entrepreneurs than industrial research and development. The Indian banking system does not support such rural pro‐poor entrepreneur‐based innovation efficiently. Instead a pioneering alternative financing sector has been emerging recently. There are three broad categories of organisations in this sector: grassroots innovators and incubators, micro venture capital firms, and small‐scale financiers. This paper considers why the core of India’s financial system, its banking sector, does not support rural entrepreneur‐based innovation. It ends by discussing the emerging alternative financing sector at the periphery which, on the other hand, appears able to do so.

40|$|A key {{component}} of climate change mitigation efforts will be {{the need to develop}} new technological solutions and to diffuse current state-of-the-art technologies to developing countries. However, due to a number of market failures, the required research and technological transfers are currently not being undertaken. The essay discusses how what has been learned about promoting innovation policies at the general level {{can be applied to the}} specific challenges in the environmental area. It stresses the need to establish the proper regulatory and institutional frameworks as a precondition for attracting funding into these activities. More specifically, there is a current need to set a realistic price for carbon emissions that will provide an important financial incentive for firms to invest in mitigation technologies. The issue of finding finance for often long-term and risky environmental projects is likely to become especially difficult due to the 2008 financial crisis.

40|$|Given {{the mixed}} {{evidence}} {{for the impact of}} various publicly funded initiatives that aim to foster entrepreneurial activity, this paper empirically examines the efficacy of publicly funded business advisory services in relation to entrepreneurial outcomes. Based on a sample of 228 early-stage firms, of which 101 used business advisory services focused on helping companies secure 1 st rounds of financing and start generating revenues, we examine the firm-level impact such services can have on sales growth, <b>innovation,</b> <b>finance</b> and alliances. We find services are positively associated with firms’ sales growth, patents, finance and alliances. We assess statistical and economic significance, and assess robustness to controls for the non-randomness of the firm’s matching with the business advisory service program, as well as endogeneity of advisors’ hours spent with firms, among other robustness checks. We find significant robustness of hours spent on sales and finance, but sensitivity of the effect of hours on patents and alliances after controlling for endogeneity...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{sets out}} to explore the often ignored role of the consumer (end-user) within sustainable innovation by examining the potential of reward-based crowdfunding in enabling sustainable entrepreneurship.

The dissertation employs four articles in order to explore this. The first sets the stage by systematically reviewing the various roles that end-users can adopt within sustainable innovation process. The second serves to present a conceptual understanding of how the process of crowdfunding is organized. Finally papers three and four respectively present the dissertation’s empirical evidence.

40|$|This survey {{reviews the}} {{theoretical}} literature on high impact entrepreneurship. The survey is guided {{in part by}} the recent classification changes at the Journal of Economic Literature (JEL) regarding entrepreneurship. The board voted to create a new classification code, L 26, for entrepreneurship. The JEL intends to use this code for all articles and books that focus on economic questions related to entrepreneurial activity. Publications related to questions on occupational choice issues will be cross classified with J 23; those focusing on innovation and entrepreneurship will be cross classified with O 31; those focusing on finance will be cross classified with G 24 Investment Banking, venture capital, brokerage and rating agencies; those focusing on new firms, start ups; and business related publications on how to be an entrepreneur will be cross classified (or solely classified) with M 13. What does this economic literature tell us about entrepreneurship?

40|$|The {{amount of}} capital {{required}} to transition energy systems to low-carbon futures is very large, yet analysis of energy systems change has been curiously quiet {{on the role of}} capital markets in financing energy transitions. This is surprising given the huge role finance and investment must play in facilitating transformative change. We argue this has been {{due to a lack of}} suitable theory to supplant neoclassical notions of capital markets and <b>innovation</b> <b>finance.</b> This research draws on the notion from Planetary economics: Energy, climate change and the three domains of sustainable development, by Grubb and colleagues, that planetary economics is defined by three ‘domains’, which describe behavioural, neoclassical, and evolutionary aspects of energy and climate policy analysis. We identify first- and second-domain theories of finance that are well established, but argue that third-domain approaches, relating to evolutionary systems change, have lacked a compatible theory of capital markets. Based on an analysis of electricity market reform and renewable energy finance in the UK, the ‘adaptive market hypothesis' is presented as a suitable framework with which to analyse energy systems finance. Armed with an understanding of financial markets as adaptive, scholars and policy makers can ask new questions about the role of capital markets in energy systems transitions...|$|E
40|$|Nations {{rise and}} fall {{according}} to the trends of their economies. For it is the economic growth of a nation that confers on it, its status among the comity of Nations. Since the end of World War II, the American economy has led {{the world in terms}} of trade, manufacturing, <b>innovation,</b> <b>finance</b> etc. Hence the American state became the leading nation in the world and the dollar, the de-facto currency most sought after as a means of lubricating trade and storage of wealth. However, over the last decade there has been a gradual slow down in the American economy; growth has petered down and the status of the dollar among international currencies is on the decline. Will the dollar lost its dominant role in international transactions as a reserve currency? This paper notes that it will happen, albeit slowly. Hence, it purports to highlight the demerits of maintaining our external reserves in a single currency (Dollar). Drawing heavily from existing literature on external reserves management and exchange rate, It suggests that the monetary authorities should start a gradual divestment from purely dollar denominated securities to securities denominated in other currencies. Only the optimal level of reserves should be kept by the authorities while the excess should be used for infrastructural development, as well as institute A Sovereign Wealth Funds to manage the revenue from sales of crude oil for future generations; among others...|$|E
40|$|As we {{move into}} the global century, several aspects of social and {{economic}} life are changing and post-industrial shifts are unparalleled by virtue of the interconnectedness that brings together the corners of the globe. New technologies, new economic relationships, new social processes, and new political developments are all characteristics of globalization (Hudson and Lowe, 2004 : 22) in a post-industrial age featured by information, <b>innovation,</b> <b>finance</b> and services. As the world has contracted, people’s quality of life has changed regardless of where they live. In fact, the propagation of free market mindsets in emerging economies has created collective network connections with considerable good but pervasive inequalities as well. A fundamental aim of this book is to argue that these changes are part of a economic transition to post-industrialism associated with risks and inequalities that shape human experience {{in the midst of a}} formidable global financial climate. There is an obvious tension with this. On the one hand, life expectancy, health statuses and per capital incomes are at an all-time high and many feudal practices have been relegated to the past (Phillipson, 2006). On the other hand, vast numbers of people struggle with poverty and significant pockets of poverty portend more than lack of income. Those living on the bottom of the socio-economic ladder labor under the burden of avoidable, lifestyle diseases, hunger and related maladies, not to mention myriad social risks (Turner, 2008).
