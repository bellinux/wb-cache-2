25|$|Note {{that the}} induced EMF method is {{dependent}} on the assumption of a sinusoidal current distribution, delivering an accuracy better than about 10% as long as the wavelength to element <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> is greater than about 60. However, for yet larger conductors numerical solutions are required which solve for the conductor's current distribution (rather than assuming a sinusoidal pattern). This can be based on approximating solutions for either Pocklington's integrodifferential equation or the Hallén integral equation. These approaches also have greater generality, not being limited to linear conductors.|$|E
500|$|A {{variety of}} rounds have been {{developed}} for Rheinmetall's tank gun. For example, a long line of armor-piercing discarding sabot (APDS) rounds was developed by Rheinmetall. Originally, the Leopard 2 was outfitted with the DM23 kinetic energy penetrator, based on the Israeli M111 Hetz. The DM23 was eventually replaced by the DM33, which was also adopted by Japan, Italy, Netherlands and Switzerland. The DM33 has a three-part aluminum sabot and a two-part tungsten penetrator, and is said to be able to penetrate [...] of steel armor at a range of [...] [...] The DM43 is a further development of this round, co-developed between Germany and France. The introduction of the longer barrel came {{hand in hand with the}} introduction of a new kinetic energy penetrator, the DM53. With the projectile including sabot weighing in at 8.35 kilograms with a 38:1 length to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> and with a muzzle velocity of , the DM53 has an effective engagement range of up to [...] A further development, called the DM63, improved upon the round by introducing a new temperature-independent propellant, which allows the propellant to have a constant pattern of expansion between ambient temperatures inside the gun barrel from [...] to [...] The new propellant powders, known as surface-coated double-base (SCDB) propellants, allow the DM63 to be used in many climates with consistent results. The new ammunition has been accepted into service with the Dutch and Swiss, as well as German, armies.|$|E

2500|$|Aluminum has a {{different}} optimal wall thickness to tubing diameter than steel. [...] It is at its strongest at around 200:1 (diameter:wall thickness), whereas steel is {{a small fraction of}} that. [...] However, at this ratio, the wall thickness would be comparable to that of a beverage can, far too fragile against impacts. [...] Thus, aluminum bicycle tubing is a compromise, offering a wall thickness to <b>diameter</b> <b>ratio</b> that is not of utmost efficiency, but gives us oversized tubing of more reasonable aerodynamically acceptable proportions and good resistance to impact. This results in a frame that is significantly stiffer than steel. [...] While many riders claim that steel frames give a smoother ride than aluminum because aluminum frames are designed to be stiffer, that claim is of questionable validity: the bicycle frame itself is extremely stiff vertically because it is made of triangles. Conversely, this very argument calls the claim of aluminum frames having greater vertical stiffness into question. On the other hand, lateral and twisting (torsional) stiffness improves acceleration and handling in some circumstances.|$|E

The proposed motorbike is equipped with an air turbine in place of an internal combustion engine, and transforms the energy of the compressed air into shaft work. The mathematical modeling and performance evaluation of such small capacity compressed air driven vaned type novel air turbine is presented here. The effect of isobaric admission and adiabatic expansion of high pressure air for different rotor to casing <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> with respect to different vane angles (number of vanes) have been considered and analyzed. It is found that the shaft work output is optimum for some typical values of rotor to casing <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> at a particular vane angle (i. e. no. of vanes). In this study, when casing diameter is considered 100 mm, and rotor to casing <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> are kept 0. 70 to 0. 55, the average maximum power is obtained to the order of 4. 95 kW (6. 6 HP) which is sufficient to run motorbikes...|$|R

In previous work it was shown that for bidisperse systems with moderate <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 : 2 to 1 : 4, this approach leads to discrepancies, and a correction factor is needed. In this work we demonstrate that this correction factor also holds for more extreme <b>diameter</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 : 5, 1 : 7 and 1 : 10, although the force on the large particles is slightly overestimated when using the correction factor.
