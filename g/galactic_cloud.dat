The far-IR luminosity is proportional to the first power of the CO luminosity for clouds undergoing high-mass star formation. There are massive clouds without any current high-mass star formation. The average gas depletion time is about 2. 5 billion yr. The far-IR luminosity-to-mass ratio for isolated or weakly interacting spiral galaxies observed by IRAS is twice that for the average Galactic molecular cloud.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{address the problem}} of {{understanding}} the star formation process in giant molecular <b>clouds</b> in a <b>galactic</b> context. Most simulations of molecular clouds to date use an oversimplified set of initial conditions (turbulent spheres/boxes or colliding flows). Full galactic scale models are able to generate molecular clouds with complex morphologies and velocity fields but they fail to reproduce in detail the effects that occur at sub-pc scales (e. g. stellar feedback). Our goal is to build the bridge between these two scenarios, and to model the star formation process in molecular clouds produced in a galactic context. We extract our molecular <b>clouds</b> from full-scale <b>galactic</b> simulations, hence we need to increase the resolution by two orders of magnitude. We introduce the details of the program used to simulate molecular clouds in Chapter 2, and describe in detail the method we follow to increase the resolution of the <b>galactic</b> <b>clouds.</b> In Chapter 3 we compare our simulated <b>galactic</b> <b>clouds</b> with the more conventional approach of using turbulent spheres. We create turbulent spheres to match the virial state of three <b>galactic</b> <b>clouds.</b> We perform isothermal simulations and find that the velocity field inherited from the full-scale galactic simulations {{plays an important role in}} the star formation process. Clouds affected by strong galactic shear produce less stars compared with clouds that are compressed. We define (and test) a set of parameters to characterise the dynamical state of our clouds. To include stellar feedback in our simulations we need to introduce a cooling/heating algorithm. In Chapter 4 we analyse how the different velocity fields of our clouds change the temperature distribution even in the absence of feedback. To study the formation of molecules we need to model the chemistry of H 2 in our clouds. We also add CO chemistry, and produce synthetic observations of our clouds. The effect of feedback from winds and supernovae in <b>galactic</b> <b>clouds</b> is studied in Chapter 5. We analyse the effect of winds in clouds with very different velocity fields. We find that the effect of winds is stronger in highly virialised, high star forming clouds, with <b>clouds</b> with weak <b>galactic</b> shear, compared to unbound shear-dominated clouds. The steady and continuous action of the winds appears to have a greater effect than the supernovae. In summary, the inherited properties from the galaxy have an impact on many relevant processes in star formation, influencing gravitational collapse, the formation of filamentary structures, the temperature field of the cloud, and have a considerable effect on the impact of feedback in the clouds...|$|R

No lines of (H 2 O) 2 were found. Our limit for the abundance of (H 2 O) 2 relative to that of water (from H 18 2 O data) is typically < 10 − 4 toward dense cloud cores. Toward Orion-KL an even more stringent limit of < 810 − 6 is derived. The abundance of (H 2 O) 2 relative to H 2 is typically < 10 − 10.

40|$|Polarimetry in the far-infrared and {{submillimeter}} {{has been}} valuable in tracing magnetic fields in bright <b>Galactic</b> <b>Clouds.</b> We discuss the techniques {{we have developed}} and trends we have found in polarization vs column density, and vs wavelength. The polarization spectrum {{has proven to be}} more interesting than had been anticipated. It is potentially valuable in explaining grain alignment and in characterizing dust species. One can expect the infrared cirrus to be a much simpler environment than the molecular clouds that have heretofore been explored at multiple wavelengths. Although cirrus observations must deal with low signals and wide extent, it is becoming possible to measure accurately the spectral energy distribution from mid-infrared to microwave frequencies and it should soon become feasible to determine the polarization spectrum over the same range. 1...|$|R
40|$|The diffuse {{radiation}} {{field in the}} UV (900 - 3, 000 A) affects the structure of <b>galactic</b> molecular <b>clouds</b> and conveys important information concerning the physical characteristics and spatial distribution {{of gas and dust}} in the universe. Continuum emission in this range is probably dominated by interstellar dust scattering in our galaxy. For view directions and angular resolutions allowing observations in the rifts between <b>galactic</b> dust <b>clouds,</b> the background due to the integrated light of spiral galaxies may be detected, providing important information on their structure and evolution. The redshifted emission from an intergalactic medium may be observable in the regions between nearby bright galaxies. Present observations provide weak constraints on the radiation field required to ionize the intergalactic medium at the level required by the Gunn-Peterson test...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Phanerozoic life {{has probably been}} influenced by extraterrestrial events and properties of the Earth-Moon system that have not, until now, been widely recognized. Tide range, gravitational strength, the Earth's axial tilt, and other planetary properties provide background conditions whose effects on evolution {{may be difficult to}} distinguish. Solar flares, asteroid impacts, supernovae, and passage of the solar system through <b>galactic</b> <b>clouds</b> can provide catastrophic changes on the Earth with consequent characteristic extinctions. Study of the fossil record and the {{evolution of}} complex Phanerozoic life can reveal evidence of past disturbances in space near the Earth. Conversely, better understanding of environmental influences caused by extraterrestrial factors and properties of the solar system can clarify aspects of evolution, and may aid in visualizing life on other planets with different properties...|$|R
