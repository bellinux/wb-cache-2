40|$|An <b>immunologic</b> <b>method</b> for the quantitation of 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) {{levels in}} human plasma has been developed. A {{monoclonal}} antibody recognizing 8 -MOP was prepared by immunizing mice with an 8 -MOP derivative conjugated to bovine serum albumin with 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylamino- propyl) - carbodiimide-HCl. The antibody {{was characterized by}} competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and recognizes 8 -MOP (50 % inhibition at 2 pmol) as well as structurally related psoralen derivatives including 4 '-aminomethyl- 4, 5 ', 8 -trimethylpsoralen (50 % inhibition at 50 pmol), 5 -methoxypsoralen (50 % inhibition at 150 pmole), and 6, 4, 4 '-trimethylangelicin (50 % inhibition at 360 pmol). The assay has a limit of sensitivity of 1 ng/ml plasma. For analysis of 8 -MOP levels in plasma, samples were first extracted using SepPak C 18 cartridges. The extracts were analyzed for 8 -MOP levels both by ELISA and high-pressure liquid chromatography. There was a good correlation between the values determined by both methods (r = 0. 92, p < 0. 0005).

The detectable change in HbA 1 c percentage depends on total analytical error. Since we have previously evidenced major problems in the routine use of HPLC, we compared a highly automated glycohemoglobin assay with the reference HPLC to solve the problem. The within- and between-run coefficients of variations ranged from 0. 86 to 0. 93 %, and 2. 51 to 2. 12 %, respectively, for the HPLC, and from 1. 07 to 0. 95, and 1. 61 to 0. 99 % for the immunoturbidimetric assay. After HbA 1 c-assay calibration, the quality-control survey report of duplicate determinations performed on 20 consecutive days by both the HPLC and the <b>immunologic</b> <b>method</b> provided the expected mean values of control materials. The assay of 106 blood samples showed a minor yet significant bias of the immunoturbidimetric assay toward lower HbA 1 c. values (p 0. 0001), as previously observed, although the two determination series resulted significantly correlated (r= 0. 96,p= 0. 0001).

To {{delineate}} {{the role of}} the glutathione S-transferase (GST) isozyme hGST 5. 8 in protection mechanisms against oxidative stress, the effect of low-level transient exposure of H 2 O 2 to retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells on hGST 5. 8 and other enzymes involved in defense against oxidative stress was examined. METHODS. Cultured human RPE cells were exposed to 50 �M H 2 O 2 for 20 minutes. Subsequently, the cells were washed and resuspended in the culture media. The cells were pelleted and lysed, and the levels of lipid peroxidation products including thiobarbituric acid–reactive substances (TBARS), glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glucose 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, GST, catalase (CAT), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were determined and compared with levels in control cells. Total GSTs were purified by GSH-affinity chromatography, and the isozymes were separated by isoelectric focusing, characterized, and quantitated. hGST 5. 8 was quantitated by an <b>immunologic</b> <b>method</b> as well as by determining activity toward its preferred substrate, 4 -hydroxynonenal (4 -HNE). Kinetic constants of hGST 5. 8 purified from H 2 O 2 -treated cells were also determined and compared with those of control cells. RESULTS.

40|$|Cyclosporin A (CyA) is intensively metabolized by the hepatic {{cytochrome}} p 450 III monooxygenase A {{system in}} the human liver, the most important metabolites being M 1, M 17, and M 21. Because CyA and its metabolites have nephrotoxic, hepatotoxic, and neurotoxic side effects, CyA dosage must be calculated to avoid the risk of organ rejection through underdosage and toxic organ damage through overdosage or accumulation of metabolites. In this study, we determined the whole-blood concentrations of cyclosporin and metabolite M 17 by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) and by monoclonal specific and polyclonal nonspecific fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Abbott) in patients after immunosuppressive treatment. Patients with different resorption and metabolization rates showed high individual variations. CyA concentrations in patients with good liver function and low concentra-tions of CyA metabolites showed a good correlation between the HPLC and the FPIA (TDx-monoclonal assay) methods in ranges between 25 and 180 ng/mL. TDx-mono-clonal was not always as precise as HPLC. In cases of metabolic disorders, we found false high CyA concentrations assayed with the <b>immunologic</b> <b>method,</b> caused by a cross-reaction of the elevated metabolite concentration.

Routine screening for iron loading could provide valuable information in epidemiologic, diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic studies of emerging infectious diseases. Excessive iron in specific tissues (iron loading) promotes infection, neoplasia, cardiomyopathy, arthropathy, and a profusion of endocrine and possibly neurodegenerative disorders (1 - 5). An array of behavioral, medical, and <b>immunologic</b> <b>methods</b> are being developed to decrease iron loading or its detrimental effects. Routine screening for iron loading in populations exposed to certain diseases can provide valuable epidemiologic, diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic information. Hazards of Iron Loading Iron can contribute to disease development in several ways. Excessive amounts of the metal in specific tissues and cells can hinder the ability of proteins, such as transferrin and ferritin, to prevent accretion of free iron. Moreover, in infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, and illnesses that involve ischemia and reperfusion, iron causes reactions that produce superoxide radicals (6). Nonprotein bound ferric ions are reduced by superoxide, and the ferrous product is reoxidized by peroxide to regenerate ferric ions and yield hydroxyl radicals, which attack all classes of biologic macromolecules. Hydroxyl radicals can depolymerize polysaccharides, cause DNA strand breaks, inactivate enzymes, and initiate lipid peroxidation (6). Iron can also increase disease risk by functioning as a readily available essential nutrient for invading microbial and neoplastic cells. To survive and replicate in hosts, microbia...|$|R

40|$|The modern {{concepts}} of ichthyosis are rather ambiguous and need more precise definition. The modern conception of pathogenesis of ichthysosis is offered and considered in this article. Aim. An {{aim is to}} analyze received data of our researches about molecular disturbances of keratin on the background of ichthyosis and the current data on the pathogenesis of disease. Materials and methods. An analysis {{of the results of}} research in 70 patients with ichthyosis by the methods of the flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and by <b>immunologic</b> <b>methods</b> is presented in an article. Results. Authors revealed molecular, immunologic and immunohistochemical changes that realizes the disturbance of keratinization on the background of this disease. The model of pathogenesis of the various manifestations of gene mutations that causes ichthyosis is proposed and it can be taken into account when elaborating the new directions of therapy. Conclusions. Gene mutations that cause ichthyosis realizes on the background of disturbance of the cell cycle causing cornification and disturb the local and general immune reactions that summarily lead to the clinical presentations of disease.   </p...|$|R
40|$|The immune {{response}} to microorganisms not only {{participates in the}} elimination of unwanted organisms from the body, but also assists in diagnosis of infectious diseases. The nonspecific {{immune response}} is {{the first line of}} defense, assisting the body until the specific immune response can be mobilized to provide protective mechanisms. The specific immune response involves humoral or cell-mediated immunity or both, dependent {{on the nature of the}} organism and its site of sequestration. A variety of test systems have been developed to identify the causative organisms of infectious diseases. Test systems used in immunoserology have classically included methods of detecting antigen-antibody reactions which range from complement fixation to immunoassay methods. Relevant test systems for detecting antigens and antibodies are described. With numerous test systems available to detect antigens and antibodies, there can be confusion regarding selection of the appropriate system for each application. Methods for detecting antibody to verify immunity differ from <b>immunologic</b> <b>methods</b> to diagnose disease. Techniques to detect soluble antigens present in active infectious states may appear similar to those used to detect antibody, but their differences should be appreciated...|$|R
40|$|Infection {{of the eye}} {{caused by}} Acanthamoeba species {{constitutes}} a burgeoning and unsolved problem. Of individuals with Acanthamoeba keratitis, 85 % wear contact lenses; abrasion of the cornea is implicated. Corneal infection often can be prevented by good lens care and hygiene. Severe Acanthamoeba keratitis often can {{be very difficult to}} treat; surgery can be less than successful and may lead to further problems. The encysted stage in the life cycle of Acanthamoeba species appears to cause the most problems; many biocides are ineffective in killing the highly resistant cysts. Combination therapy—that is, use of 2 or 3 biocides, sometimes with antibacterial antibiotics—appears to work best. Recurrence is common if treatment is stopped prematurely. <b>Immunologic</b> <b>methods</b> are being investigated as a form of prevention, and oral immunization of animals recently has been successful in the prevention of Acanthamoeba keratitis by inducing immunity before infection occurs. Immunization thus may eventually become the best approach for reduction of the incidence of amebic infection in humans. The first case of Acanthamoeba keratitis, an amebic in-fection of the eye that involved Acanthamoeba poly-phaga, was reported when a Texas rancher splashed tap water from a contaminated river source into his ey...|$|R
