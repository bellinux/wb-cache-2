5|$|Grissom {{is often}} {{regarded}} as well-educated, but unusual in his approach toward <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> social life. In the series, {{some of his}} comments and actions {{can be seen to}} dumbfound his co-workers and superiors. His relationship with his subordinates in the office is portrayed as being a father figure to the team, but very professional in his work.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Schindel and Weston Woods Studios {{made the}} 18-minute Robert McCloskey, a {{documentary}} which is sometimes screened in art schools. The film shows McCloskey sitting in Boston Public Garden and intercuts pages from his sketchbook drawings for Make Way for Ducklings.

5|$|Regardless of the {{immediate}} receptions of St. John and The Age of Bronze, Rodin had achieved a new degree of fame. Students sought him at his studio, praising <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> scorning the charges of surmoulage. The artistic community knew his name.|$|E
5|$|Winton's efforts did {{not come}} to public light until 1988, when his wife {{discovered}} papers in their loft, whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> he {{came to be known as}} the 'British Schindler', in comparison to Oskar Schindler. Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved, because unlike Schindler, his life had never been in danger.|$|E

5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{remaining}} empty, the castle slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1960, Dutton {{was named}} {{president}} of the Calgary Exhibition and Stampede on a two-year term. He had been a Stampede director for ten-years previous to his appointment. As head of the exhibition, he also spoke for the Stampeders hockey team of the Western Hockey League, and was its chief negotiator. Through <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> community spirit, Dutton {{played a major role}} in helping Calgary and the surrounding area shed its rural image in the 25 years following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Also in 1998, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) SIGCHI awarded Engelbart the CHI Lifetime Achievement Award. ACM SIGCHI later {{inducted}} Engelbart {{into the}} CHI Academy in 2002. Engelbart was awarded The Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit in 1996 and the Benjamin Franklin Medal in 1999 in Computer and Cognitive Science. In early 2000 Engelbart produced, with volunteers and sponsors, {{what was called}} The Unfinished Revolution– II, {{also known as the}} Engelbart Colloquium at Stanford University, to document and publicize <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> ideas to a larger audience (live, and online).|$|E

50|$|Juan was a well-regarded painter {{during his}} life, but many records were lost. <b>His</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> life {{were brought to}} light again when the {{researcher}} and art historian Ceán Bermudez in 1800 published a dictionary of famous artists and included a brief article about <b>his</b> <b>works</b> <b>and</b> Italian influences. The full reconstruction of its biography has been primarily accomplished in the 20th century.|$|R
5|$|Canon William Lummis, MC, was a {{military}} historian who built up an archive on the service records and final resting places of Victoria Cross holders. This was then summarised into a pamphlet which was taken to be an authoritative source on these matters. However, Lummis was aware of short-comings in <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> encouraged David Harvey to continue it. The result was Harvey's seminal book Monuments to Courage. In 2007 the Royal Mail used material from Lummis' archives to produce a collection of stamps commemorating Victoria Cross recipients.|$|E
5|$|Defining for {{his career}} was the {{invitation}} he got in 1944 from the people of Standaard Boekhandel, a chain of libraries who were also active as publishers. They were interested in <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> wanted to publish some books. Vandersteen presented them with the first designs for a daily comic strip, but they put that on hold and first ordered four juvenile books from Vandersteen. These were published in 1945 and 1946 in Dutch and French (by Casterman).|$|E
5|$|Friedrich's {{reputation}} suffered {{further damage}} when his imagery {{was adopted by}} a number of Hollywood directors, such as Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut Börsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.|$|E

5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} in <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> {{the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished to cure the animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E
5|$|His {{plays and}} songs {{achieved}} new {{popularity in the}} 1960s and 1970s, and <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> style continue to influence popular culture. Coward did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including Graham Payn, his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the Noël Coward Theatre in his honour in 2006.|$|E
5|$|However, Sitchin, {{who died}} in 2010, denied any {{connection}} between <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> Lieder's claims. In 2007, partly in response to Lieder's proclamations, Sitchin published a book, The End of Days, which set {{the time for the}} last passing of Nibiru by Earth at 556 BC, which would mean, given the object's supposed 3,600-year orbit, that it would return sometime around AD 2900. He did however say that he believed that the Annunaki might return earlier by spaceship, and that the timing of their return would coincide with the shift from the astrological Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius, sometime between 2090 and 2370.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} in which The Wrestlers was painted, sports were {{becoming}} increasingly popular, and the painting is both a reflection of this trend and a part of the English tradition of copying poses from classical Hellenistic works. It was also a time of change in the British attitude to race relations. Etty in this period was generally making a conscious effort to illustrate moral lessons in <b>his</b> <b>work,</b> <b>and</b> {{it is not clear whether}} he chose the topic as a form of social commentary or simply because the contrast between the black and white flesh tones was visually striking.|$|E

Marni, although she admits that she still loves Karman, insists that she will stay with her new husband; Haji Bakir, Karman's uncle, and Karman's mother have likewise forgiven him. Tini and Haji Bakir's grandson Jabir are betrothed as planned, and, when the villagers renovate the dilapidated mosque, Karman makes the cupola. He receives much praise for <b>his</b> <b>work</b> <b>and</b> finds {{a sense of belonging}} in the mosque.|$|E

Following a drunken celebration at a bar with other expatriates over England's 1966 World Cup victory, Lane excitedly tells the other SCDP partners that he has arranged a lunch meeting with a fellow Englishman he met at the bar, Edwin Baker, over possible representation for Jaguar Cars in America.|$|E
