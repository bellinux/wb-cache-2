40|$|Carton board {{packages}} are often closed with an adhesive. The adhesive joint thus formed has {{to meet the}} demands during the entire product life from converting to end-use. The adhesive joint has to be characterized if it is good or bad for the actual application. Today such characterization is done by manually peeling the joint, immediately after the adhesive application in the <b>gluing</b> <b>machine.</b> The manual peel test is a subjective test that is operator dependent. An operator needs long experience to be able to perform a manual peel test. Therefore, the packaging industry is interested in a test method that can objectively predict good or bad adhesive joints. The adhesive joints have been tested in the so-called Y-peel test arrangement. An advantage of the Y-peel test is that it gives an objective result from the force–elongation curve. Testing has been performed with carton boards of two different thicknesses. Hotmelt adhesive was used and the open time was varied in the glue applicator. It was found that the Y-peel test gives results in qualitative agreement with the manual peel test. Moreover, by evaluating the energy consumption (dissipative energy) during the Y-peel test it was possible to obtain not only a qualitative but also a quantitative assessment of the adhesive joint...|$|E

Duct tape is also often a key ingredient. Once completed, teams must race their boats across a shallow pond, river, or swimming pool using similarly constructed oars. The boats will almost always flood, sink, or shred under the weight, mostly {{owing to the}} difficulties of waterproofing cardboard.|$|R

The test sample is composed of several sheet layers <b>glued</b> together, <b>machined</b> to shape, and then compressed in a lubricated channel die along the “thin” directions. This simple test has been validated by a comparison of finite element simulations and experimental results. The stress-strain curves can be considered accurate up to strains of 1. 2...|$|R

Structural {{members of the house}} are fastened by hand-forged flat nails and <b>glue.</b> No <b>machined</b> nails were used in the original structure. [...] At the time of its nomination, the house was painted all white; however, its current occupants have since repainted the structure in a combination of yellow, burgundy, and olive.|$|R
40|$|Strength and {{durability}} {{of different types}} of chairs is mostly function of rigidity and type of joints. Classification of chairs was completed upon their critical points. Based on this divide, chairs were classified into six categories. Based on previous research, strength of joints have been influenced by <b>gluing</b> surface, <b>machining</b> quality, type of fit, species and humidity of wood material, glue quality and gluing parameters. Research have been carried out on two groups of chairs, and two groups of joints. Machining quality, type of fit and gluing surface, have been varied during experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} mechanism {{of a commercial}} cold water soluble starch glue on stepped and folded sack papers has been studied on a pilot <b>machine</b> of bottom <b>gluing.</b> The <b>machine</b> was equipped with a conventional gluing station. The influence of the relevant process parameters e. g. paper velocity, speed and speed ratio of rolls, roll gaps, material and surface characteristics of the stereos, glue viscosity etc. on the time- and position-related glue thickness uniformity has been evaluated. The relations between the parameters have been quantified and from the date the glue thickness uniformity during the application has been optimized. The results make possible the determination of suitable parameter ranges for the thickness control systems. In part 1 (issue 4 / 1988) {{the results of the}} investigations of a continuous glue application with smooth, not interrupted application rolls on not stepped papers are discussed. In this part 2 the intermittent glue stereotype application on folded and stepped sack papers are treated...|$|R
50|$|The Synthophone {{requires}} different maintenance than a saxophone. It {{differs from}} other wind controllers {{by not having}} onboard presets, it must be used with a computer or MIDI synthesizer. The reed is <b>glued</b> to a <b>machined</b> metal piece (lip sensor). The additional finger combinations allow the instrument to produce polyphonic effects {{to make it a}} chordal instrument or it can be played as a homophonic instrument. Some other distinguishing features are selectable diatonic tonality, six chord variations (inversions, subs, number of voices, unison/chords) adjusted with lips, freeze harmony, sustain, and obligato or portamento. Programmable to change to the keys of Bb, C, Eb. The electronics are within a Yamaha YAS-275 saxophone.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe term motor {{should be}} {{understood}} as the converter of an electrical energy into a mechanical energy. The stepper motor converts electrical signals in form of impulses, for the angle of rotation. The relationship is proportional, so that the stepper motor rotation speed {{is dependent on the}} frequency of the control impulses. The research concerns developed prototype of <b>glue</b> distributing <b>machine.</b> Its task is to glue coating parts and seats used in machines and mass transit vehicles. Parts to be bonded are characterized by great variety and complicated geometry. Due to the high requirements for constant quality of applied adhesive layer and the shortest possible operation time, it is necessary to apply specialized propulsion and control system. The article presents the results of research regarding the identification of torque characteristics in a function of rotational speed of the stepper motor. In addition, torque variations for different values of the supply current of motor coils where determined. Actual characteristics of stepper motor were necessary due to the frequency increase selection method applied in the project. This will enable the accurate control of the stepper motor...|$|R
40|$|The Timesaver belt {{grinding}} machine {{has been selected}} by the Atlas collaboration for deburring the master and spacer plates after die stamping and laser cutting, respectively. However, the question has been raised {{as to whether or}} not the plates are sufficiently clean after going through the Timesaver machine to immediately be glued into a submodule assembly. This would greatly enhance the production of submodules because the task of cleaning individual master and spacer plates is labor intensive and time consuming as well as raises environmental issues with the detergent that is used. In order to investigate the possibility of using the Timesaver process to clean the plates as well as debur them, several plates were run through the machine and their cleanliness inspected before and after. In addition, several glue samples were subjected to the same process, glued, and then pulled apart in an attempt to gauge the cleanliness of the plates. From this series of tests it can be concluded that the wet Timesaver machine can adequately prepare the surface of the master and spacer plates as well as clean the plates for <b>gluing.</b> The <b>machine</b> was able to adequately remove all of the oil and grime from the test plates. Also, from the single test on the dry machine it appears that significant cleaning will be required to adequately clean the plates before gluing in order to remove the remaining grit...|$|R
5000|$|The {{wardrobe}} supervisor also regularly inventories and inspects all {{costumes and}} coordinates all costume repairs. The majority of minor costume repairs are done on site at the theatre {{by either the}} Wardrobe Supervisor or {{in the cases of}} many regional theatres, the onsite wardrobe maintenance crew which is connected to the in house costume shop. Most repairs are considered [...] "emergencies", however, and whenever possible they are done onsite at the theatre before and sometimes during the actual performance. The wardrobe supervisor's space in the theatre, with few exceptions, contains a sewing <b>machine,</b> <b>glue</b> gun, and all sewing supplies necessary for any type of emergency repair that could be required. Most wardrobe supervisors are very qualified seamstresses in their own right. The rule of thumb is that only in the case of very significant damage is a costume sent back to the shop for repair. The one exception to this rule are shoes. Although most supervisor's maintain a regular schedule for polishing and re-spraying of shoes, for safety reasons, actual shoe repair work is always sent out.|$|R
40|$|Still the {{metering}} of <b>glue</b> in a <b>machine</b> of bottom <b>glueing</b> {{of paper}} sacks is a technical problem not yet solved satisfactory. The usually applied manual control of glue metering by the operators {{often results in}} an overdosing. This leads {{to a loss of}} mechanical strength and microbial stability of the sacks, caused by high humidity. An automatic control of glue metering can only be achived, when appropriate, i. e. powerful and cost efficient sensors are available. One of the measuring principles which are adaptable to the measurement of glue application is microwave absorption measurement. Industrial microwave sensors already on the market, are far too expensive for the use in machines for the bottom glueing of paper sacks where up to 16 positions are to be equipped with a measurement system. For {{the last couple of years}} cheap microwave sources and detectors for the use in mass products have been available. With these components it should be possible to construct a sensor at very low cost s. Therefore the suitability of these microwave components for the measurement of glue application has been investigated and a sensor prototype for online measurement in a <b>machine</b> of bottom <b>glueing</b> has been developed...|$|R
