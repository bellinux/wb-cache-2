40|$|Although it {{is known}} that <b>Jacksonian</b> <b>epilepsy</b> was first {{described}} by Bravais in 1827, some 40 years before Jackson began his work on the topic, little has been published on what Bravais wrote. Louis François Bravais (1801 – 1843) came from a French provincial family, which made a number of scientific, mainly botanical, contributions. In his Paris M. D. thesis, based on 25 instances of what he termed "hemiplegic epilepsy," Bravais described a set of unilateral epileptic seizure phenomena, including postseizure hemiparesis, very similar to those Jackson wrote about in 1870. However, Jackson accepted that the initially unilateral convulsive phenomena could spread to involve both sides of the body, whereas Bravais believed that this was incompatible with his entity, unless the generalization was a very rare event in the sufferer. Bravais in his account refused to go beyond descriptions of phenomena, whereas Jackson reasoned from the phenomena to a new concept of epileptogenesis, and also from them deduced that there must be localized representation of function in the cerebral cortex. Although Bravais had the priority, his work went largely unnoticed until Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s insights had made their impact on medical thinking. © 2009 International League Against Epilepsy...|$|E
40|$|A {{patient is}} {{described}} {{who had a}} combination of stimulus-sensitive cortical myoclonus, epilepsia partialis continua, and <b>Jacksonian</b> motor <b>epilepsy.</b> He eventually required surgery because {{of the severity of}} his seizures. Electrophysiological recordings made before and during surgery, and PET scans performed before surgery identified an abnormal area of cerebral cortex in the postcentral parietal region. It is suggested that the stimulus-sensitive myoclonus arose because input into this region from peripheral sensory afferents produced an abnormal discharge which was fed forwards via cortico-cortical connections to the precentral motor cortex, to produce a reflex muscle jerk. The epilepsia partialis continua may have been caused by spontaneous discharges arising in the same region of parietal cortex. Both forms of jerking disappeared after resection of this part of the cortex...|$|R
