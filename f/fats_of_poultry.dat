40|$|T^ECENT {{years have}} seen a renewed-* • * • {{interest}} in the energy requirements of chickens. Before {{the introduction of the}} high energy broiler ration by Scott et al. (1947) little attention was paid to energy levels and to the bulk (indigestible mat-ter) content <b>of</b> <b>poultry</b> rations, with the result that most older type rations were high in bulk, low in energy, and were usually less efficiently utilized. Since 1947 we have been moving in the opposite direction: decreasing the bulki-ness of our diets and concommitantly in-creasing the energy and efficiency of utilization. This past year has seen the use <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> in <b>poultry</b> rations to further increase the energy content and possibly the efficiency of utilization as well. The concept of bulk (indigestible matter) and feed volume (dry matter) was introduced by Lehmann (Scharrer, 1951), who pointed out their importance in relation to satisfying the animal's need in two ways: first, the physiological satisfaction of the animal; and second, its appetite demands. The ideal is to have both requirements satisfied at the same time. If appetite is satisfied by bulk before physiological needs, the animal will stop eating before it gets all of its requirements; if the reverse happens, then the animal will overeat physiologically and feed waste results.

The main f actors that affect the digestibility and metabolizable energy content <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> for <b>poultry</b> are their contents  of saturated fatty acids and the unsaturated to saturated ratio (U FA: SFA), the carbon chain length of the SFA, the level of free fatty acids (FFA), {{and the age of}} the birds. Also, {{it is important to consider}} quality aspects <b>of</b> the <b>fat</b> being fed, such as the level of moisture, impurities and insaponifiable matter and toxic products developed in fats excesively heated, such as polymers resent in restaurant greases of  poor quality. The results of the present studies show that up to 45 % FFA in a crude palm oil - palm destilled fatty acids blend are permisable without detrimental effect on broiler performance when that blend was included at a 6 % rate in starler diets. Besides, better results are obtained when a <b>fat</b> <b>of</b> high FFA content and /or low IJFA: SFA is fed after the first week of age and not in day-old broilers. The use <b>of</b> <b>fats</b> <b>of</b> high FFA content is feasible but a previous determination of its ME content is necessary before formulation of the feed.
