5|$|In this stage, it <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> inquire into, firstly, {{the object}} of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of {{differentiation}} against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration {{the object of}} the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it <b>is</b> <b>necessary</b> <b>to</b> ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers {{the object of the}} statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
