5|$|Agricultural {{losses were}} <b>heavy.</b> <b>In</b> Florida, the second-largest {{producer}} of oranges in the world, {{damage to the}} citrus crop was estimated at $200million, and caused a 50% increase {{in the price of}} grapefruit juice. Charley, along with the other storms that hit Florida during 2004, caused a total agricultural loss of $2.2billion. Other crops, nurseries, buildings, and agricultural equipment also suffered.|$|E
5|$|Calleia had {{his first}} real role as a <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> Small Miracle, and his success in the play was {{responsible}} for his move to Hollywood. Calleia's contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer permitted him a hiatus of six months a year, to continue his stage work. He was not new to motion pictures—he had made three feature films on the East Coast—but when MGM put Calleia under contract they promoted his first film, Public Hero No. 1 (1935), as his screen debut. Calleia's portrayal of the gunman was listed by film critic Andre Sennwald of The New York Times {{as one of the}} year's ten best male performances.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks {{along the}} Italian coast {{prompted}} Dubourdieu {{to mount a}} second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of Montagu, Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga. The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> weight of shot. Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.|$|E

5|$|India {{followed}} the NZ tour with {{a trip to}} Australia. India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> each of these matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in failure as India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had {{to come out in}} defense of his team.|$|E
5|$|The NS-10 {{does not}} have a {{perfectly}} flat frequency response. The sound of the NS-10 is slightly <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> the midrange, and like other sealed-box speakers of similar size its bass extension is limited. It has a +5dB boost in the midrange at around 2kHz, and the bottom end starts rolling off at 200Hz. The midrange response is so open that it exposes the frequencies that are the most problematic and worst-sounding to the human ear.|$|E
5|$|The edmontosaurs {{also showed}} enriched carbon isotope values, which for modern mammals would be {{interpreted}} as a mixed diet of C3 plants (most plants) and C4 plants (grasses); however, C4 plants were extremely rare in the Late Cretaceous if present at all. Thomas and Carlson put forward several factors that may have been operating, and found the most likely to include a diet <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> gymnosperms, consuming salt-stressed plants from coastal areas adjacent to the Western Interior Seaway, and a physiological difference between dinosaurs and mammals that caused dinosaurs to form tissue with different carbon ratios than would be expected for mammals. A combination of factors is also possible.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the effects of the application of organic amendments on the behavior of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> contaminated farmland soils, field plot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of the addition of six different organic amendments on the activity of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> soils, concentration of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> surface water, and heavy metal uptake by rice plants. The tested six organic amendments were composted rice straw, fresh chicken manure, composted chicken manure, fresh pig manure, composted pig manure and commercial organic fertilizer. The results showed that application of all of the six organic fertilizers could obviously increase the contents of water soluble <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> the soils and concentrations of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> the surface water at early stage of the experiment, as compared with the control without application of organic manure. The increase in the contents of water soluble <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> the soils and concentrations of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> the field surface water were highest for fresh pig manure, followed by fresh chicken, and the lowest for commercial organic fertilizers. The contents of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> soils and the concentrations of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> field surface water decreased with the increase of the experimental time. The effects of applying organic fertilizer on the accumulation of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> rice grains was not obvious. Correlation analysis showed that the contents of water soluble <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> soils, and concentrations of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> field surface water were all significantly correlated with the corresponding DOC concentration, suggesting that the increase of DOC could promote the activation of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> soils. The difference in the activity of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> soils added with different organic amendments might be due to the difference in the degree of decomposition and release DOC capacity of the added organic amendments. But the research also showed that the soil DOC decreased gradually with the increasing time of organic fertilizer application. Therefore, the activation of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> farmland soils caused by organic manure was temporary, and the accumulation of <b>heavy</b> metals <b>in</b> the grain during the late rice growth was not obvious...|$|R

5|$|Unemployment was {{particularly}} <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> Britain's traditional staple export industries—coal mining, shipbuilding, {{iron and steel}} and textiles—all of which were in a slow decline from their Victorian heyday. Because of the concentration of these industries {{in the north of}} England, in Scotland and in Wales, the percentage of unemployed persons in these regions was significantly higher, sometimes more than double, than in the south throughout the interwar period. The decline of these industries helped to create pockets of long-term unemployment outside the normal cyclical variations; some workers had no work for years.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. It was a rare example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was <b>heavy.</b> <b>In</b> the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E
5|$|In South Korea, {{damage was}} {{heaviest}} in South Gyeongsang Province, where 71people were killed. Damage was particularly <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> Busan, {{as well in}} as Yecheon, Ulsan, and Daegu. In Busan, strong winds wrecked 11lifting cranes, each weighing about 900tons, which injured five people and killed two in one incident. Many shipyards in the region were closed, and initial reports estimated {{it would take a}} year to fully reopen the Busan port. The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $50million (USD), causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20%. High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan, and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility, damaging them both. Sixteen people were killed in Busan.|$|E

5|$|Industrialist Joseph Wharton had a near-monopoly on {{the mining}} of nickel in the United States, {{and sought to}} promote its use in coinage. He was also highly {{influential}} in Congress. His friends there, though they had failed to obtain the metal's use for the two-cent piece, had been more successful with the base-metal three-cent coin. Pollock prepared a bill authorizing a five-cent coin of the same alloy as the three-cent piece, with a total weight not to exceed 60 grains (3.9 g). At the committee stage in the House of Representatives, the weight was amended to , ostensibly to make the weight equal to five grams in the metric system but more likely so that Wharton could sell more nickel. This made the new coin <b>heavy,</b> <b>in</b> terms of weight per $.01 of face value, compared to the three-cent copper-nickel coin. The bill passed without debate on May 16, 1866. The new copper-nickel coin was legal tender for up to one dollar and would be paid out by the Treasury in exchange for coin of the United States, excluding the half cent, cent and two-cent. It was redeemable in lots of $100 for banknotes. Fractional currency in denominations of less than ten cents was withdrawn.|$|E
5|$|Typhoon Imbudo was {{the strongest}} typhoon to strike Luzon since Typhoon Zeb five years prior, and was the fifth storm in eight weeks to affect the country. The typhoon left {{widespread}} areas flooded for several days. Cagayan Valley was largely isolated after a bridge was damaged in Ilocos Norte. Damage was <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> the region, totaling P2.2billion (PHP, $40million USD), and over 80,000people were displaced by the storm. Damage was heaviest in Isabela, where damage was estimated at P1.9billion (PHP, $35million USD), mostly to crops and killed livestock. There, winds and rain knocked down trees and caused a province-wide power outage. Most trees {{less than three years}} old fell during the high winds. In Isabela province, the banana crop was almost entirely destroyed, and most of the corn and rice crops were heavily damaged. The high damage caused the gross regional product, or overall economy of the Cagayan Valley, to decrease by 0.3% than what would have happened without the typhoon.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this <b>heavy</b> <b>in</b> my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
