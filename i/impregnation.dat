5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural <b>impregnation,</b> the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the new mother kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ranch}} {{inhabited}} by the Proletheans, a religious extremist group, following her <b>impregnation,</b> Helena is {{introduced to the}} group's nursery where she bonds with a young girl. The Prolethean leader, Henrik Johanssen (Peter Outerbridge), impregnates his teenage daughter Gracie (Zoé de Grand'Maison) with his and Helena's embryos. Sharing their displeasure with what Henrik has done, Helena and Gracie decide to flee the ranch together, but are caught by Henrik as they are preparing to leave. Henrik's protégé and Gracie's lover, Mark (Ari Millen), arrives to defend Gracie. Mark and Gracie flee together as Helena attacks Henrik. Helena tortures Henrik with his own medical instruments before burning down the ranch and running away herself.|$|E
5|$|In this section, Heilmann draws {{evidence}} from his observations of germ cells, <b>impregnation,</b> cell division, ontogeny and comparative embryology about the probable ancestry of birds. A {{fair amount of}} detail is devoted early in the section to comparative studies between the germ cells of many different species of extant bird and reptile (and several mammals), including some comments on the corkscrew locomotion observed in the spermatozoa cells of several bird and reptile species, but no mammals. He {{then goes on to}} offer a similar comparison between the egg cells of birds and reptiles, and finds considerably more similarity there than either has to the egg cell of a mammal. Following an analysis of the germ cells, he moves onward through the developmental cycle by next examining the process of fertilization and subsequent cleavage of the zygote. He presents here several figures and illustrations of the cleavage of the blastoderm in reptiles and birds.|$|E

40|$|O 2 electrocatalysis on (2, 3) FeNPc <b>impregnations</b> on {{different}} carbon blacks {{was investigated in}} H 2 SO 4 medium. The effect of nitric acid treatment on the carbon black support is to enhance both the activity and stability of the catalyst. Moreover, as seen by XPS, the dissolution of iron is impeded by this oxidation treatment which, however, does not increase the density of active sites with the BET surface area. From the data presented, a redox mechanism can hardly be invoked, {{in contrast to the}} situation for FeNPc <b>impregnations</b> on active charcoals...|$|R

5|$|Another {{important}} episode concerns mutilations {{that the}} combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set's testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus's eyes. Sometimes {{the eye is}} torn into pieces. Set's mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus's eye is even more important, for this stolen Eye of Horus represents {{a wide variety of}} concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus's major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the Eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. The Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set's loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set's head after his <b>impregnation</b> is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus's Eye when it appears on Set's head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge {{in the form of the}} Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.|$|E
25|$|The main <b>impregnation</b> {{techniques}} are wet <b>impregnation</b> and dry <b>impregnation.</b> During wet <b>impregnation,</b> the porous particles are dissolved in the extractant {{and allowed to}} soak with the respective fluid. In this approach, the particles are either contacted with a precalculated amount of extractant, which completely soaks into the porous matrix, or the particles are contacted with an excess of extractant. After soaking, the remaining extractant, which is not inside the pores, is evaporated.|$|E

50|$|Vasubandhu {{explains}} that the āśraya (foundation or support) of the fundamental change that indicates ātmabhāva (psychophysical continuum) is the non-conceptual wisdom free from the duality of the apprehender and the apprehended; āśraya refers to obscured tathagatagarbha (the fourth vajra-point) and its change (tataparāvrtti) which is enlightenment (the fifth vajra-point). It is possible to replace one āśraya with another by freeing the ayatanas (internal and external sense- bases) from physical and mental <b>impregnations</b> of negative tendencies which bring about craving, suffering etc., by cultivating calm abiding and superior insight, which process activates theayatanas associated with awareness (vidyā) that purify all <b>impregnations</b> of negative tendencies and involve raising oneself to śuddhāśrayabhūmi, the level of pure superior intention, never {{to return to the}} lower realms or suffer rebirth.|$|R

40|$|The protargol {{staining}} {{method has}} proved to be indispensable for revealing the cellular structures of a variety of protozoa, especially the flagellates and ciliates. Protargol provides permanent stains of a variety of cellular structures: nuclei, extrusomes, basal bodies, and microfilamentous constituents of cells. Together with the older silver nitrate methods, protargol <b>impregnations</b> have provided the basis for the detailed descriptions of nearly all ciliates to date. The performance of commercially available preparations has varied widely. Recently, suppliers have stopped stocking the effective forms of protargol resulting in a worldwide shortage. Thus, it has become necessary for protistologists to explore on-site synthesis of this critically important agent. An optimum protocol for synthesis of protargol should be rapid, relatively inexpensive, simple enough to be done by non-chemists, and achievable without specialized equipment. In this article, the authors briefly review the interesting history of protargol and describe a protocol, based on the early studies of neuroanatomists, that yields a protargol producing <b>impregnations</b> of ciliates comparable to those obtained with previously available commercial preparations...|$|R

25|$|If the {{wet method}} is used, the {{extractant}} is dissolved in an additional solvent prior to <b>impregnation.</b> The porous particles are then dispersed in the extractant-solvent solution. After soaking the particles, the excess solvent {{can either be}} filtered off or evaporated. In the first case, an extractant-solvent mixture would be retained within the pores. This would be of interest for extractants which would be solid at design conditions when pure. In the second case, only the extractant would remain inside the pores.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{characterization of}} several dispersed molybdena catalysts on silica support (MoO 3 -SiO 2) prepared {{from a variety}} of precursors (Mo(VI) -acetylacetonate, oxo-peroxo Mo-species, hydrated ammonium heptamolybdate) and preparation methods (deposition of the Mo-phase on finite SiO 2 support by aqueous and methanol <b>impregnations,</b> by adsorption, by oxo-peroxo route-like, and by one-step synthesis of MoO 3 -SiO 2 system with molecular precursors) are presented. The molybdena concentration on silica was comprised in a large interval (1. 5 - 14 wt%) depending on the preparation method which governed the Mo-loading on silica. Convenient comparisons among samples at similar Mo-concentration have been made discussing the morphologic-structural (XRD, XPS, UV-vis-DRS, and N 2 -adsorption) and physicochemical (TG-DTG, TPR, and n-butylamine-TPD) sample properties. Polymeric octahedral polymolybdate aggregates predominated in the samples prepared by aqueous and methanol <b>impregnations,</b> which were at high Mo-concentration. On the contrary, isolated Mo(VI) species in distorted Td symmetry predominated in the sample pre-pared by adsorption which was at very low Mo-concentration. The sample acidity was composed of a weak acidy site population, associated with the silica support, and a strong acid site population associated with the Mo-dispersed phase.

25|$|<b>Impregnation</b> is, in essence, the {{converse}} of extraction. A substance is dissolved in the supercritical fluid, the solution flowed past a solid substrate, and is deposited on or dissolves in the substrate. Dyeing, which is readily {{carried out on}} polymer fibres such as polyester using disperse (non-ionic) dyes, is a special case of this. Carbon dioxide also dissolves in many polymers, considerably swelling and plasticising them and further accelerating the diffusion process.|$|E
