500|$|The {{top three}} drivers in both races {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in a later press conference. Although Bird spoke of his satisfaction of controlling {{the pace of the}} feature race, he believed he was fortunate because of him receiving a new rear wing after being impacted by Ceccon at the first start, [...] "It’s an amazing to be able to win my first GP2 race in Monaco. Maybe I should have done it already in the past in GP2, but it <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> right today." [...] Ceccon stated he was [...] "happy" [...] to secure second place and praised his team for his strategy that enabled him to move ahead of Evans, [...] " [...] It’s my first GP2 podium and it’s {{two years in a row}} that I finish on the podium here since I finished third last year in GP3 here as well. Today, I finished in P2 in race 1. It’s good." [...] When asked if he was disappointed over his third place finish, Evans replied yes as he struggled with grip on his supersoft compound tyres at the restart and was being pressured by Bird on the harder soft compound tyres. Evans believed that had he overtaken Ceccon he could have had similar pace levels to Bird and felt the best possible result he could have achieved was second but stated he would accept the result.|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I think at the time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{part because}} of public {{misunderstanding}} surrounding gothic aesthetics, people in the goth subculture sometimes suffer prejudice, discrimination, and intolerance. As {{is the case with}} members of various other subcultures and alternative lifestyles, outsiders sometimes marginalize goths, either by intention or by accident. Actress Christina Hendricks talked of being bullied as a goth in school and how difficult it was for her to deal with societal pressure: [...] "Kids can be pretty judgmental about people who are different. But instead of breaking down and conforming, I stood firm. That is also probably why I was unhappy. My mother was mortified and kept telling me how horrible and ugly I looked. Strangers would walk by with a look of shock on their face, so I never <b>felt</b> <b>pretty.</b> I just always felt awkward". Prejudice moves people into circles of bonding where they share these similar experiences and are accepted. Young goths have to define themselves and learn beauty is an aspect of cultural relativism.|$|E

5000|$|Mitchell later recalls, [...] "I {{think we}} both <b>felt</b> a <b>pretty</b> {{fair amount of}} {{pressure}} when we started shooting. It was Julie’s picture, {{but it was still}} Roger’s company, and he was the bottom line. We both very much wanted to make him happy." ...|$|R
60|$|We were {{summoned by}} the Dingpun to march at 10 a.m.: I demanded an {{interview}} with Campbell first, which was refused; but I <b>felt</b> myself <b>pretty</b> safe, and insisting upon it, he was brought to me. He was sadly bruised about the head, arms, and wrists, walked very lame, and had a black eye to boot, but was looking stout and confident.|$|R
2500|$|Utley had a {{slow start}} to spring training. [...] He was hitting only [...]175 (10 for 57), {{including}} 1 double and 3 RBIs with just two games remaining. [...] Utley remained confident for the 2014 season. [...] "For younger guys, I think results make you feel better," [...] Utley said. [...] "But as you go, you realize they're not quite as important this time of year. Physically, I feel good. Early in the spring, I <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> decent at the plate. There were some times in the middle when I felt a little uncomfortable and {{a little out of}} sorts. The last four or five days, I've started to feel a little more comfortable at the dish. For a guy that has done this for a few years, your game plan for Spring training is different than it would be during the regular season." [...] Despite a poor spring training, over {{the first two weeks of}} the season, he was [...] "the hottest hitter in baseball", and as of April 13, possessed a 1.314 on-base plus slugging (OPS) average.|$|E
2500|$|Less dramatically, {{there were}} {{suggestions}} that Eden’s touchiness and over-sensitivity to criticism, characteristics frequently remarked upon by colleagues, were exacerbated by Lady Avon (described by historian Barry Turner, without explanation, as [...] "equally touchy"). One of Eden's private secretaries claimed that [...] "she {{had a habit}} of stirring up Anthony when he didn't need it". However, Eden's biographer D. R. Thorpe concluded that such imputations arose from a misreading of the Edens' relationship, noting also that, during Suez, the only two people in whom Eden could confide without inhibition were his wife and the Queen. Indeed, as historian Ben Pimlott put it, [...] "if Lady Eden came to believe that the Suez Canal flowed through her drawing room, the Queen must have <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> damp as well" [...] David Dutton, another (not notably sympathetic) biographer of Eden, noted that [...] "some observers believed that Clarissa was excessively protective and tended to exacerbate Eden's natural volatility" [...] but also remarked on her devoted companionship and that [...] "during the dark days of the Suez Crisis, [...] was at his side, supportive throughout".|$|E

60|$|I {{supposed}} that if I {{went to see}} Rectus, and {{told him about the}} matter, I should make him blue, too. But, as I had no right to tell him, and also <b>felt</b> a <b>pretty</b> strong desire that some of the folks should come with good spirits and appetites, I kept away from him. He would have been sure to see that something was the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{second in}} command laughed a little at the tone. But he guessed that the neutral wouldn't even have to lie very much. Fellows like that, unless caught in the very act, <b>felt</b> {{themselves}} <b>pretty</b> safe. They could afford to chuckle. That fellow was probably chuckling to himself. It's very possible he had been before at the game and didn't care a rap for the bit of evidence left behind. It was {{a game in which}} practice made one bold and successful, too.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{a pretty}} big all, too," [...] Jerry grumbled. [...] "I <b>felt</b> skeered <b>pretty</b> nigh out of my wits, {{and the other two}} allow they were just as bad. If it hadn't been for your boat ahead I reckon we should never have gone through it, but as long as you kept on straight, there didn't seem any reason why we shouldn't. I tell you I feel so shaky that if there were a grizzly twenty yards off I am blamed if I could keep the muzzle of my rifle on it." ...|$|R

60|$|With that, as if {{to change}} the theme, he led the astounded {{locksmith}} back to {{the night of the}} Maypole highwayman, to the robbery of Edward Chester, to the reappearance of the man at Mrs Rudge's house, and to all the strange circumstances which afterwards occurred. He even asked him carelessly about the man's height, his face, his figure, whether he was like any one he had ever seen--like Hugh, for instance, or any man he had known at any time--and put many questions of that sort, which the locksmith, considering them as mere devices to engage his attention and prevent his expressing the astonishment he <b>felt,</b> answered <b>pretty</b> much at random.|$|R
5000|$|This {{song was}} {{recorded}} for photographer Gjon Mili. Mili had agreed very reluctantly to film the Quartet at work, {{and the band}} <b>felt</b> [...] "on <b>pretty</b> shaky ground" [...] at the session. Their first attempt to record was, as a result, very tentative, and Mili's dismissive pronouncement after this [...] "take" [...] made Brubeck's [...] "blood begin to boil". The resulting second [...] "take", heard on the album, was an [...] "expression of rage and frustration".|$|R
5000|$|While {{collecting}} {{articles about}} {{things he was}} interested in, Fountain was riveted by Haiti, regarding it [...] "like a laboratory, almost ... Everything that’s gone on {{in the last five}} hundred years—colonialism, race, power, politics, ecological disasters—it’s all there in very concentrated form. And also I just <b>felt,</b> viscerally, <b>pretty</b> comfortable there." [...] Speaking little French, let alone Haitian Creole, he went for his first trip abroad there in 1991 and at least thirty more times. From this came four of the best regarded stories in his 2006 breakthrough collection of short stories: Brief Encounters With Che Guevara; a late bloomer, he was forty-eight. He was interviewed following the publication of this book by Rain Taxi in the winter of 2006. He has won numerous awards and inclusion of his work in New Stories from the South: The Year's Best (2006).|$|R

60|$|I know I felt first-rate, and I think Rectus {{must have}} <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> much the same, for his tongue rattled {{away at a}} rate that wasn't exactly usual with him. There was no mistaking Corny's feelings.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} {{all manner of}} mean things about you because you [...] did not answer my note of last week, when--what do you think? [...] The note came back to me, brought in {{by one of the}} smaller [...] girls here, Jessie Brown. Jessie was going to town that day, [...] and I gave her the note to post and she put it in the pocket of [...] her coat, along with several other letters, so she says. Well, [...] the pocket had a hole in it, and, as you might know, my own [...] particular letter had to slip through that hole into the lining [...] of the coat. The rest of the letters were mailed, but my letter [...] remained in the lining until this morning, when Jessie came to [...] me with tears in her eyes to tell of what had happened. I <b>felt</b> [...] <b>pretty</b> angry over it, but glad to know that you were not guilty [...] of having received the note and then not answering it.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought it}} {{affecting}} {{to see such}} a sturdy fellow as Ham was now, trembling in the strength of what he <b>felt</b> for the <b>pretty</b> little creature who had won his heart. I thought the simple confidence reposed in us by Mr. Peggotty and by himself, was, in itself, affecting. I was affected by the story altogether. How far my emotions were influenced by the recollections of my childhood, I don't know. Whether I had come there with any lingering fancy that I was still to love little Em'ly, I don't know. I know that I was filled with pleasure by all this; but, at first, with an indescribably sensitive pleasure, that a very little would have changed to pain.|$|R
60|$|George sprang up. At {{the sound}} of her voice every nerve in his body danced in mad exhilaration. He was another man. Depression fell from him like a garment. He {{perceived}} that he had misjudged all sorts of things. The evening, for instance, was a splendid evening--not one of those awful dry, baking evenings which make you feel you can't breathe, but pleasantly moist and full of a delightfully musical patter of rain. And the barn! He had been all wrong about the barn. It was a great little place, comfortable, airy, and cheerful. What could be more invigorating than that smell of hay? Even the rats, he <b>felt,</b> must be <b>pretty</b> decent rats, when you came to know them.|$|R
60|$|I {{passed around}} {{to the other side of}} the garden, where an open gateway led to the pear orchard. I <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> certain that John Stumpy had pursued this course, and I entered the orchard on a run.|$|E
6000|$|Well, of course, {{that put}} a more {{different}} light on it, and me and Jim <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn't been quite so chipper. I couldn't say nothing, and Jim he couldn't for a while; then he says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank God you {{are back}} again!" [...] the captain said. [...] "I have been blaming myself, ever since you started; though, as all was quiet, we <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> sure they hadn't made you out. Well, {{have you any}} news? Did you get on board?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Not {{a boy in}} {{the house}} but <b>felt</b> the <b>pretty</b> child's influence, and was {{improved}} by it without exactly knowing how or why, for babies can work miracles in the hearts that love them. Poor Billy found infinite satisfaction in staring at her, and though {{she did not like}} it she permitted without a frown, after she had been made to understand that he was not quite like the others, and on that account must be more kindly treated. Dick and Dolly overwhelmed her with willow whistles, the only thing they knew how to make, and she accepted but never used them. Rob served her like a little lover, and Teddy followed her like a pet dog. Jack she did not like, because he was afflicted with warts and had a harsh voice. Stuffy displeased her because he did not eat tidily, and George tried hard not to gobble, that he might not disgust the dainty little lady opposite. Ned was banished from court in utter disgrace when he was discovered tormenting some unhappy field-mice. Goldilocks could never forget the sad spectacle, and retired behind her veil when he approached, waving him away with an imperious little hand, and crying, in a tone of mingled grief and anger, ...|$|R
60|$|Enemies {{the most}} obstinate and courageous can't hold out against starvation; so the elder Osborne <b>felt</b> himself <b>pretty</b> easy about his adversary in the {{encounter}} {{we have just}} described; {{and as soon as}} George's supplies fell short, confidently expected his unconditional submission. It was unlucky, to be sure, that the lad should have secured a stock of provisions on the very day when the first encounter took place; but this relief was only temporary, old Osborne thought, and would but delay George's surrender. No communication passed between father and son for some days. The former was sulky at this silence, but not disquieted; for, as he said, he knew where he could put the screw upon George, and only waited the result of that operation. He told the sisters the upshot of the dispute between them, but ordered them to take no notice of the matter, and welcome George on his return as if nothing had happened. His cover was laid as usual every day, and perhaps the old gentleman rather anxiously expected him; but he never came. Some one inquired at the Slaughters' regarding him, where it was said that he and his friend Captain Dobbin had left town.|$|R
60|$|And {{right here}} was John Barleycorn getting me {{in a more}} {{insidious}} though no less deadly way than when he nearly sent me out with the tide. I had a few months still to run before I was seventeen; I scorned {{the thought of a}} steady job at anything; I <b>felt</b> myself a <b>pretty</b> tough individual in a group of pretty tough men; and I drank because these men drank and because I had to make good with them. I had never had a real boyhood, and in this, my precocious manhood, I was very hard and woefully wise. Though I had never known girl's love even, I had crawled through such depths that I was convinced absolutely that I knew the last word about love and life. And it wasn't a pretty knowledge. Without being pessimistic, I was quite satisfied that life was a rather cheap and ordinary affair.|$|R
60|$|Altogether, Margaret <b>felt</b> <b>pretty</b> well {{satisfied}} with life as she tripped blithely down the country road between {{the ranks of}} snow-laden spruces, with the blue sky above and the crisp, exhilarating air all about.

5000|$|Alexander is most {{known for}} her {{modeling}} during the late eighties and early nineties. During her career, she was featured {{on the covers of}} Vogue, Harpers Bazaar, Elle, Mademoiselle, Glamour, and Mirabella and worked on campaigns for Cover Girl, Tiffany & Co, and Chanel's Allure. She also worked with the top photographers of her time such as Steven Meisel, Patrick Demarchelier, Gilles Bensimon, and Peter Lindbergh. Alexander reached the peak of her career when she was featured in the 1988 and 1989 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issues and in Herb Ritts' Pirelli Calendar. She was then featured in People magazine's [...] "50 Most Beautiful People, proving how successful she truly had become. Despite being so successful, she told People that she had never <b>felt</b> she was <b>pretty</b> until she was pregnant. In the 1990 interview, she told them, Until I was pregnant I felt like an impostor waiting to be found out." ...|$|R

6000|$|It {{was five}} o'clock; {{the sun was}} {{brighter}} than ever. People in carriages and people on foot in one leisurely, unending stream were filing in at Hyde Park Corner. Mrs. Pendyce went, too, and timidly--she was unused to traffic--crossed to the further side and took a chair. Perhaps George was in the Park and she might see him; perhaps Helen Bellew was there, and she might see her; {{and the thought of}} this made her heart beat and her eyes under their uplifted brows stare gently at each figure-old men and young men, women of the world, fresh young girls. How charming they looked, how sweetly they were dressed! A feeling of envy mingled with the joy she ever <b>felt</b> at seeing <b>pretty</b> things; she was quite unconscious that she herself was pretty under that hat whose brim turned down all round. But as she sat a leaden feeling slowly closed her heart, varied by nervous flutterings, when she saw someone whom she ought to know.
