5|$|Republicans were {{generally}} successful {{in state and}} local elections around the country in 1899, and McKinley was optimistic about his chances at re-election in 1900. McKinley's popularity in his first term assured him of renomination for a second. The only question about the Republican ticket concerned the vice presidential nomination; McKinley needed a new running mate as Hobart had died in late 1899. McKinley initially favored Elihu Root, who had succeeded Alger as Secretary of War, but McKinley decided that Root was doing too good a job at the War Department to move him. He considered other prominent candidates, including Allison and Cornelius N. Bliss, but none were as popular as the Republican party's rising star, Theodore Roosevelt. After a stint as Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Roosevelt had resigned and raised a cavalry regiment; they fought bravely in Cuba, and Roosevelt returned home covered in glory. Elected governor of New York on a reform platform in 1898, Roosevelt had <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presidency. Many supporters recommended him to McKinley for the second spot on the ticket, and Roosevelt believed it would be an excellent stepping stone to the presidency in 1904. McKinley remained uncommitted in public, but Hanna was firmly opposed to the New York governor. The Ohio senator considered the New Yorker overly impulsive; his stance was undermined by the efforts of political boss and New York Senator Thomas C. Platt, who, disliking Roosevelt's reform agenda, sought to sideline the governor by making him vice president.|$|E
25|$|Governor Bravo had had <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Moluccas himself, and had {{intended}} to dispatch a Spanish force there at a later, opportune moment. Nevertheless, he felt it best {{to comply with the}} Portuguese request. At the end of 1602 the Spanish force was dispatched from the Philippines, taking with them the ship Santa Potenciana and three large frigates, with 150 well-armed Spanish soldiers, 10,000 fanégas of rice, 1,500 earthen jars of palm wine, 200 head of salt beef, 20 hogsheads of sardines, conserves and medicines, 50 quintals of powder, cannonballs and bullets, and cordage and other supplies, the whole in charge of Captain Joan Xuarez Gallinato, with orders to take that help to Terrenate and to place himself under the command of the Portuguese general. He made his voyage there in a fortnight, and anchored in the port of Talangame, in the island of Terrenate, two leguas from the fort. There he found Andrea Furtado de Mendoça with his galleons at anchor, awaiting him.|$|E
500|$|Ford united the state's Democratic Party, {{allowing}} them to capture {{a seat in the}} U.S. Senate in 1972 {{for the first time since}} 1956. The seat was vacated by the retirement of Republican John Sherman Cooper and won by Ford's campaign manager, Walter [...] "Dee" [...] Huddleston. Ford's friends then began lobbying him to try and unseat Kentucky's other Republican senator, one-term legislator Marlow Cook. Ford wanted lieutenant governor Julian Carroll, who had run on an informal slate with Combs in the 1971 primary, to run for Cook's seat, but Carroll already had <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> governor's chair. Ford's allies did not have a gubernatorial candidate stronger than Carroll, and when a poll showed that Ford was the only Democrat who could defeat Cook, he agreed to run, announcing his candidacy immediately following the 1974 legislative session.|$|E

500|$|Francis Mackey, an {{experienced}} harbour pilot, had boarded Mont-Blanc {{on the evening}} of 5 December 1917; he had asked about [...] "special protections" [...] such as a guard ship, given the Mont-Blanc's cargo, but no protections were put in place. Mont-Blanc started moving at 7:30am on 6 December, heading towards Bedford Basin. Mackey kept <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ferry traffic between Halifax and Dartmouth and other small boats in the area. He first spotted Imo when she was about [...] away and became concerned as her path appeared to be heading towards his ship's starboard side, as if to cut him off his own course. Mackey gave a short blast of his ship's signal whistle to indicate that he had the right of way, but was met with two short blasts from Imo, indicating that the approaching vessel would not yield its position. The captain ordered Mont-Blanc to halt her engines and angle slightly to starboard, closer to the Dartmouth side of the Narrows. He let out another single blast of his whistle, hoping the other vessel would likewise move to starboard, but was again met with a double-blast in negation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first known}} ascent was on 25 December 1894, when New Zealanders Tom Fyfe, John Michael (Jack) Clarke and George Graham reached the summit via the Hooker Valley {{and the north}} ridge. [...] Despite an earlier failed attempt on 20 December, the local climbers were spurred on by their desire for the first ascent {{to be made by}} New Zealand mountaineers amid reports that the American mountaineer Edward FitzGerald had <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> summit. The party reached the summit at {{approximately}} 1:30pm after bounding up the last leg of the mountain full of excitement at reaching the top. The route they had successfully traversed was not repeated again until the 100th ascent over 60 years later in 1955. Swiss guide Matthias Zurbriggen of FitzGerald's party made the second ascent on 14 March 1895 from the Tasman Glacier side, via the ridge that now bears his name. This is credited as the first solo ascent, although Zurbriggen was accompanied part of the way up the ridge by J Adamson. After Zurbriggen's ascent it was another ten years before the mountain was climbed again. In February 1905 Jack Clarke with four others completed the third ascent following Zurbriggen's route. So Clarke therefore became the first person to do a repeat ascent.|$|E
2500|$|Randolph regrets Cope did {{not realize}} what Randolph could have done for him: [...] "I could have opened up avenues {{that would have made}} his year here a very {{different}} thing."(299) He and Mrs. Phillips plan to attend graduation as [...] "reconciled competitors"(301) to see Cope in his farewell performance. After the ceremony, Carolyn, still in pursuit, congratulates Cope. Cope leaves for Freeford without saying his goodbyes. A few weeks later, he sends Carolyn a perfunctory note reporting that he visited Arthur in Winnebago for a few days and has now taken a new position with [...] "an important university in the East."(307) The narrator interprets the note as evidence that Cope has <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> future and will travel East alone. Of Cope's attachment to Arthur, Randolph remarks to Joe: [...] "iking is the great mystery–whether you take its coming or its going."(309) He plans not to repeat his attempt to cultivate a young man in the coming academic year. Mrs. Phillips imagines Cope and Carolyn may still make a match. Randolph finds it equally plausible that Arthur will join Cope in the East. Ruefully Mrs. Phillips tells him: [...] "The young, at best, only tolerate us. We are but the platform they dance on,–the ladder they climb by."(314) ...|$|E
