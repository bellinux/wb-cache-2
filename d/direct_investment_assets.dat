40|$|This paper {{takes an}} {{in-depth}} look at U. S. direct investment valuation adjustments. We develop a methodology to generate valuation adjustments at the quarterly frequency, which can be combined with the Bureau of Economic Analysis's quarterly direct investment flows to obtain quarterly estimates of <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities. Our methodology involves two steps. First, we estimate valuation adjustment models with annual data. Our models rely on variables that reflect terms used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis in their data construction: exchange-rate changes, changes {{in the price of}} products, and changes in stock-market prices. Second, we apply quarterly data to the estimated models to generate quarter valuations and implement a procedure that ensures that the estimated valuations for the four quarters in a given year sum to the reported annual valuation adjustments. With this framework we consider how asset price shocks affect the net direct investment position and, hence, net international investment position. Investments, Foreign; Investments...|$|E
40|$|In this speech, Stephen Nickell, {{member of}} the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee, {{discusses}} {{the recent history of}} the U. K. current account deficit. Over the past 20 years, the average annual deficit has been around 2 % of GDP and shows no signs of diminishing. Indeed, the trade deficits continues to worsen and only substantial offsetting net income flows have contained the current account deficit within bounds. To understand what is going on, {{we need to look at}} the net asset position. U. K. foreign assets are enormous, around four times GDP. U. K. foreign liabilities are fractionally bigger using official statistics. But if we correct for the fact that <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>assets</b> and liabilities are measured at book value rather than market value, the U. K. net asset position remains positive. More importantly, U. K. assets are biased towards equity type assets and liabilities towards debt type assets. Since the returns on the former are typically greater than the returns on the latter, this explains the positive net income position. The risks to this situation are detailed in the text...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} few years, large {{holdings}} of foreign assets and liabilities along with an increasing relevance of the valuation effects—capital gains or losses—have characterized global financial integration. This paper presents an empirical assessment {{of the implications of}} stocks, flows and valuation adjustments in external crises, sovereign credit ratings and the long-run dynamics of real exchange rates (RER), in both industrial and developing economies. We find that foreign assets and liabilities are rather distinctive external holdings with different implications in the occurrence of an external crisis. Valuation adjustments have an impact on crises, although quantitatively not very large. Portfolio liabilities (particularly equity) increase the probability of current account reversals, while the likelihood of sudden stops increases with foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>assets.</b> In the case of sovereign credit ratings, we find a noteworthy effect of the stock and flows of FDI liabilities on improvin sovereign ratings. Finally, as for the RER, gross assets and liabilities appear equally important, but components of external holdings have considerably different effects. While the cumulative current account is associated with real depreciation, the valuation effect is strongly linked with real currency appreciations in developing economies. ...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. {{current account}} deficit widened to $ 435 billion in 2000, a record 4. 4 {{percent of gross}} {{domestic}} product, as the lagged effect of strong growth in the U. S. economy in late 1999 and early 2000 continued to drive up imports of goods and services faster than exports increased. To a lesser extent, a decline in U. S. price competitiveness also contributed to the expansion in the deficit. The $ 104 billion increase in the current account deficit was entirely accounted for by an equal-sized increase in the goods and services deficit. Other components of the current account moved in small and offsetting directions. The current account deficit represents an excess of U. S. investment over U. S. saving of more than $ 400 billion. In addition, almost $ 300 billion of U. S. saving flowed abroad {{in the form of a}} continued increase in foreign direct and portfolio investment by U. S. residents. To finance the current account deficit and the capital outflow, the foreign private sector purchased a record amount [...] more than $ 700 billion [...] of U.

However, as a consequence, the standard presentation portrays direct investment in a fragmentary way.

40|$|The U. S. service surplus soared {{from near}} zero in 1985 to about $ 60 billion in 1992, {{offsetting}} about {{two thirds of}} the goods trade deficit. Could this merely reflect improvement in data collection? Or does this mean U. S. services industries are more competitive internationally than goods industries? Is the services surplus likely to continue to rise? This paper estimates a forecastable model of U. S. services trade to address the above questions. We find that data improvement actually had a negative net impact on the services surplus, since it affected imports more than exports. Instead, the surge in the services surplus was mainly due to strong foreign growth and, to a lesser extent, dollar depreciation. An increase in either outward or inward foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>asset</b> (FDIA) has a significant and positive impact on both exports and imports of other private services, but has only a modest net effect on the U.

40|$|After {{decades of}} {{negligible}} outbound {{foreign direct investment}} (FDI), Chinese firms' outbound investment has reached significant levels in recent years, challenging international investment norms and affecting international relations. But China's outflows are poorly understood. Seen in context, China is a laggard in global investment, and the country faces numerous internal impediments to overcoming this disadvantaged position. Daniel H. Rosen and Thilo Hanemann review the data behind China's growing outbound investment, consider the commercial and political forces driving this growth, and analyze both foreign and domestic obstacles for Chinese overseas investors. While extensive media coverage has provoked worries that Chinese firms are buying up the world, China remains a relatively minor global investor compared with OECD countries. China's net FDI position remains negative, with $ 5 of FDI assets under foreign ownership in China for every $ 1 of Chinese <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>assets</b> abroad. But China's efforts to rebalance its economic growth and make the shift toward higher value-added economic activity will increasingly force Chinese firms to invest abroad. Government policy has evolved {{in recent years to}} encourage and support China's firms to look abroad. Investment regimes in host countries are one obstacle to Chinese outbound FDI, but China's firms are even more impeded by home-made problems, including the parochial executive leadership and a dearth of key management skills needed to operate successfully overseas. Rosen and Hanemann argue that the growing volume and changing nature of China's outbound investment have important implications for policymakers in host countries. Host country governments must clarify their policies and draw a clearer line between legitimate national security reviews and protectionist economic competitiveness impulses disguised as security concerns. The lack of data transparency contributes to the poor understanding of China's outbound investment, and these inadequacies must be corrected if China and investment incumbents are to work together optimally. In addition, given its disadvantaged FDI starting position China should be expected to pull considerable weight to preserve and promote an open international investment environment, including by maintaining openness at home. If China converges upward to OECD outbound investment levels rather than incumbent leaders trimming down to historic Chinese levels due to protectionism, then future flows coming from China can contribute positively to a range of international issues, from financial crisis recovery to mitigating climate change. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an investigation}} of the determinants of the international role of a currency. In the standard approach to international currencies, agents assess the desirability of a currency {{on the basis of a}} set of country and currency characteristics that serve as indicators of future transaction costs associated with the currency 2 ̆ 7 s international use. These characteristics, called standard determinants, are [...] inflation variability, exchange rate variability, inflation rate, exchange rate, financial openness, world export share, depth and breadth of the financial market, and net foreign asset position. The first four determinants relate to monetary performance, and along with financial openness, are summarily referred to as currency stability criteria. ^ A critical evaluation of the standard approach reveals a central weakness relating to the role of currency stability criteria as determinants of international currency status. When agents base future expectations about a currency 2 ̆ 7 s transaction costs on the available evidence regarding stability, they, in effect, presume that future monetary performance and financial openness will mirror the past performance of the currency. The dissertation argues that such a view is naive, because the issuer 2 ̆ 7 s promise of stability is not exogenously enforceable. That the issuer will not be tempted to renege ex post, that is, deviate from its previous record of stability, cannot be guaranteed ex ante. ^ The dissertation advocates an enforcement approach to international currencies that makes explicit the underlying agency problem. It models the relationship between the key currency issuer and foreign holders of its currency as an endogenously enforceable contract. Endogenous enforcement mechanisms elicit appropriate issuer behavior, and translate into four structural characteristics of the issuer nation, called enforcement determinants [...] stock of foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment</b> <b>assets</b> abroad, multinational rent earnings from abroad, central bank independence, and military strength. In the enforcement approach to international currencies, agents supplement the standard currency stability criteria with these enforcement determinants, as indicators of a currency 2 ̆ 7 s future stability prospects. Unlike currency stability criteria, the remaining standard determinants are not subject to surprise changes, so that for them, actual observed record is a reasonable indicator of future trends. ^ The dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s model of the determinants of currency internationalization thus includes the set of standard determinants and the set of enforcement determinants. The model is estimated using time-series cross-sectional analysis for four data sets, and three different measures of international currency share. The econometric investigation indicates that all enforcement determinants are strongly significant and robust in explaining international currency share. Monetary performance related standard determinants fail to exhibit explanatory power, while the performance of the remaining standard determinants can be characterized as mixed. ^ Endogenous enforcement, as a theoretical framework for studying international currencies, and the dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s empirical results in particular, have important implications. They suggest that in the international acceptance and use of national currencies, 2 ̆ 2 structure 2 ̆ 2 speaks louder than 2 ̆ 2 actions 2 ̆ 2. While popular predictions regarding the future evolution of the U. S. dollar, the deutsche mark, and the yen envision an evolving 2 ̆ 2 tripolar 2 ̆ 2 world, the dissertation underscores convergence of enforcement determinants among the 2 ̆ 2 big three 2 ̆ 2 as crucial to the tripolar outcome. ...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{theory has}} {{identified}} {{a number of}} channels through which openness to international financial flows could raise productivity growth. However, while there is a vast empirical literature analyzing the impact of financial openness on output growth, far less {{attention has been paid to}} its effects on productivity growth. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between financial openness and total factor productivity (TFP) growth using an extensive dataset that includes various measures of productivity and financial openness for a large sample of countries. We find that de jure capital account openness has a robust positive effect on TFP growth. The effect of de facto financial integration on TFP growth is less clear, but this masks an important and novel result. We find strong evidence that FDI and portfolio equity liabilities boost TFP growth while external debt is actually negatively correlated with TFP growth. The negative relationship between external debt liabilities and TFP growth is attenuated in economies with higher levels of financial development and better institutions. foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> external <b>assets</b> and liabilities, capital flows, capital account liberalization, financial openness, portfolio equity, debt, total factor productivity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn the Czech Republic the {{building}} is {{considered part of the}} land on which it lies. Consequently there can be owners of land and buildings being various natural or legal persons. Since 2014 there was a reform of the Czech Civil Code, which leads to the gradual consolidation of property ownership (land and buildings). In the usual case, the division of property on land and buildings in the Czech Republic and the subsequent consolidation efforts constitutes a need for assessment of the relevant investments. Income based model to assess the <b>direct</b> real estate <b>investments</b> (<b>Asset</b> Dividing Appraisal Model, ADAM) presented in {{this article is based on}} the methods of measurement values and calculating return on investment, and offers the possibility of investment by real estate appraisal in the background above the consolidation of ownership in the Czech Republic. In doing so, ADAM model combines the approaches to the valuation of property in continental Europe (German yield method) and international approaches, such as the capital market based discounted cash flow method. The objective of the model ADAM is to evaluate <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> in real estate (land and buildings) and the resulting cash flows, rather than the determination of its current market value...|$|R
