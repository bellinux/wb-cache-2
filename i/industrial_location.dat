2500|$|These {{policies}} {{had a major}} structural {{effect on}} the city's economy. While government policy had limited success in preventing the growth of Birmingham's existing industries, {{it was much more}} successful in preventing new industries establishing themselves in the city. Birmingham's economic success over the previous two centuries had been built on its economic diversity and its ongoing ability to adapt and innovate – attracting new businesses and developing new industries with its large supply of skilled labour and dynamic entrepreneurial culture – but this was exactly the process that government <b>industrial</b> <b>location</b> policy sought to prevent. Birmingham's existing industries grew strongly and kept the economy buoyant, but growing local fears that the city's economy was becoming over-specialised were dismissed by central government, even though danger signs were growing by the early 1970s. In 1950 Birmingham's economy could still be described as [...] "more broadly based than that of any city of equivalent size in the world", but by 1973 the West Midlands had an above-average reliance on large firms for employment, and the small firms that remained were increasingly dependent as suppliers and sub-contractors to the few larger firms. The [...] "City of [...] Thousand Trades" [...] had become over-specialised on one industry – the motor trade – much of which by the 1970s had itself consolidated into a single company – British Leyland. Trade union organisation grew and the motor industry in particular saw industrial disputes from the 1950s onwards. A city that for most of its history had a reputation for weak trade unionism and strong cooperation between workers and management, developed a reputation for trade union militancy and industrial conflict.|$|E
2500|$|Ottawa's former {{industrial}} {{appearance was}} vastly altered by the 1950 Greber Plan. Prime Minister Mackenzie King hired French architect-planner Jacques Greber to design an urban plan for managing {{development in the}} National Capital Region, {{to make it more}} aesthetically pleasing and thus more befitting a location serving as Canada's political centre. Greber's plan included the creation of the National Capital Greenbelt, the Parkway, the Queensway highway system, the relocation of downtown Union Station (now the Government Conference Centre) to the suburbs, the removal of the street car system, the decentralization of selected government offices, the relocation of industries and removal of substandard housing from the downtown and the creation of the Rideau Canal and Ottawa River pathways {{to name just a few}} of its recommendations. In 1958 the National Capital Commission was established as a Crown Corporation from the passing of the National Capital Act to implement the Greber Plan recommendations-which it successfully accomplished during the 1960s and 1970s. In the previous 50 years, other commissions, plans and projects had failed to implement plans to improve the capital such as the 1899 Ottawa Improvement Commission (OIC), The Todd Plan in 1903, The Holt Report in 1915 and The Federal District Commission (FDC) established in 1927. In 1958 a new City Hall opened on Green Island near Rideau falls where urban renewal had recently transformed this former <b>industrial</b> <b>location</b> into green space. Until then, City Hall had temporarily been located for 27 years (1931–1958) at the Transportation Building adjacent to Union Station and now part of the Rideau Centre. In 2001, Ottawa City Hall moved back downtown to a relatively new building (1990) on 110 Laurier Avenue West, the prior home of the now defunct Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. This new downtown location was very close to Ottawa's first (1849–1877) and second (1877–1931) City Halls. [...] This new city hall complex also contained an adjacent 19th century restored heritage building formerly known as the Ottawa Normal School.|$|E

40|$|Analyses of {{decisions}} {{pertaining to the}} spatial distribution of industries have long been the domain of economists or economic geographers. “Location Theory ” {{is considered to be}} a part of both economic geography and microeconomics. Location decisions of firms, including those of secondary industries, have mostly been looked at in terms of cost minimization, profit and market maximization, cost reduction and comparative advantage. A more recent concern has been the link between innovations and <b>industrial</b> <b>locations.</b> At times welfare concerns have entered into the study of <b>industrial</b> <b>locations</b> but again these issues have been taken from an economic viewpoint with income generation and employment creation being the main focus. There has been a noticeable absence of interest in environmental issues in planning methods pertaining to normative influences on <b>industrial</b> <b>locations.</b> This lack of emphasis, however, begs the question of how would public regulators decide on the optimal location of industries so as to safeguard natural environments as well as achieve the social equity goals.
