Silicon compounds such as silicones, silanes, silsesquioxane, silica and silicates, some of which were developed as alternatives to more toxic halogenated products, can considerably improve the <b>flame</b> retardancy of plastic materials.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Flames</b> without Brown {{changed their}} name to Byrd's Drops of Joy. However, they found little success; when Brown {{approached}} them {{to reform the}} <b>Flames</b> they agreed. At this point, The Famous <b>Flames</b> ceased being a vocal/instrumental group, and became a straight vocal group, since Brown had begun to employ the old J.C. Davis outfit as his road band. Original <b>Flames</b> members Bobby Byrd and Johnny Terry returned, and new <b>Flames</b> members Bobby Bennett and Baby Lloyd Stallworth were added. Along with Brown, these four men comprised the longest-lasting lineup of The Famous <b>Flames.</b> Original <b>Flames</b> guitarist Nafloyd Scott also returned and {{was added to the}} band.The rest of the original <b>Flames</b> faded into obscurity.|$|R
5|$|A <b>flame</b> fougasse (sometimes {{contracted}} to fougasse {{and may be}} spelled foo gas) {{is a type of}} mine or improvised explosive device which uses an explosive charge to project burning liquid onto a target. The <b>flame</b> fougasse was developed by the Petroleum Warfare Department in Britain as an anti-tank weapon during the invasion crisis of 1940. During that period, about 50,000 <b>flame</b> fougasse barrels were deployed in some 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Although never used in combat in Britain, the design saw action later in Greece.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, <b>flame</b> fougasses {{similar to}} the {{original}} British design {{have been used in}} several conflicts including the Korean and Vietnam Wars where it was improvised from easily available parts. The <b>flame</b> fougasse remains in army field manuals as a battlefield expedient to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic {{compounds}} such as {{sodium arsenite}} or sodium arsenate are effective <b>flame</b> retardants for wood {{but have been}} less frequently used due to their toxicity. Antimony trioxide is a <b>flame</b> retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile <b>flame</b> retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types. These employ boron, antimony or halogenated hydrocarbon compounds.|$|E

50|$|The {{uniform of}} the Arditi drawn from regular {{infantry}} units consisted of a Bersagliere cyclist coat with black <b>flames</b> as a lapel patch.

From these uniforms and other insigna, indicative of the army unit of origin, was born a distinction between the Red <b>Flames</b> (Bersaglieri Arditi), Black <b>Flames</b> (Arditi Infantry) and Green <b>Flames</b> (Arditi Alpini).

5|$|Months {{before each}} Games, the Olympic <b>Flame</b> is lit in Olympia in a {{ceremony}} that reflects ancient Greek rituals. A female performer, acting as a priestess, ignites a torch by placing it inside a parabolic mirror which focuses the sun's rays; she then lights the torch of the first relay bearer, thus initiating the Olympic torch relay that will carry the <b>flame</b> to the host city's Olympic stadium, where it {{plays an important role}} in the opening ceremony. Though the <b>flame</b> has been an Olympic symbol since 1928, the torch relay was only introduced at the 1936 Summer Games to promote the Third Reich.|$|E
5|$|Nemertea use organs called protonephridia to excrete soluble waste products, {{especially}} nitrogenous by-products {{of cellular}} metabolism.

5|$|The Adventure Time {{crew was}} {{satisfied}} with the episode on its completion. In spite of that, Muto described the reaction from fans on the Internet as largely negative, much to their surprise. It earned an A− grade from Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club, who compared Cinnamon Bun's evolution from a simple-minded character to one of complexity with the progression of the show itself. Sava opined that the theme of life following a broken romance benefits from this complexity. Sava saw the physical cooling of <b>Flame</b> Princess as a crafty metaphor for the personal changes an individual from a former relationship might experience, {{as well as the}} nostalgia felt over such a relationship. Separate from romance, Sava interpreted the battle between the <b>Flame</b> Lord and the <b>Flame</b> King as to demonstrate <b>Flame</b> Princess is a more sensible ruler.|$|E
