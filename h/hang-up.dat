25|$|In September 1986, Russell Dann {{reported}} he {{had been}} stabbed in his sleep with an icepick. He accused Laurie of the crime, although he had not actually seen his attacker. The police decided not to press charges against Laurie based on a medical report which suggested that the injury might have been self-inflicted, Russell's abrasive attitude towards the police, and his failed polygraph test. Russell and his family continued to receive harassing <b>hang-up</b> phone calls, and Laurie was arrested for calls made to Russell's sister. The charges were dropped {{due to lack of}} evidence.|$|E
500|$|Mega Man Powered Up {{received}} generally positive reception {{after it}} was revealed. It was perceived initially as a [...] "straight port" [...] of the NES game with graphical enhancements. IGN writer Nix felt that the graphical update as seen at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show was well-designed. He noted that its biggest <b>hang-up</b> {{was the fact that}} the original Mega Man was improved upon by its sequels and that the original lacked functions such as the charge shot, the slide, and Rush. Jeff Gerstmann felt the game was promising and praised its take on the original levels as well as its level editor. Juan Castro felt that it would appeal to Mega Man fans and those looking for an [...] "oldschool platformer." ...|$|E

50|$|<b>Hang-ups</b> {{stem from}} {{internal}} {{factors that can}} {{get in the way of}} starting or completing a project. Examples of such <b>hang-ups</b> include anxiety, boredom, impatience, and the failure (often borne of excessive egotism) to realize that a) one might not have all the information necessary to succeed and/or b) certain aspects of the problem might be more or less important than one believes. Dealing with <b>hang-ups</b> can be as simple as reducing hyperfocus on a specific aspect of a problem by taking a short break from working on the problem or that specific aspect of it.|$|R

2500|$|Dann {{continued}} to make numerous <b>hang-up</b> phone calls to her former in-laws, friends, and babysitting clients. Eventually, the calls escalated to death threats. An ex-boyfriend and his wife also received dozens of threatening calls. In May 1988, a letter, later confirmed to have been sent by Laurie Dann, {{was sent to the}} hospital administration where her ex-boyfriend then worked, again accusing him of sexual assault. Since the phone calls were across state lines, the FBI became involved, and a federal indictment against Dann was prepared. However, the ex-boyfriend, fearful of publicity, and concerned about Dann getting bail and then attempting to fulfill her threats against him, decided to wait until other charges were filed in Illinois. [...] In May 1988, a janitor found her lying in the fetal position inside a garbage bag in a trash room. [...] This precipitated a search of her room and her departure back to Glencoe.|$|E

5000|$|In the US, Federal Communications Commission rules require {{users of}} {{selective}} calling {{to monitor the}} channel (i.e. switch to carrier squelch) before transmitting. In other words, the user must monitor (listen) {{to make sure the}} channel is not in use by someone on another selective calling code before transmitting. To enforce this rule, base stations often have a monitor switch on the microphone. The push-to-talk button is split into two segments. One segment turns the selective calling off. The other segment of the button transmits. A mechanical interlock prevents the transmit button from being pressed until the monitor button is down. This is called, [...] "compulsory monitor before transmit." [...] In mobile radios, microphones are stored in a <b>hang-up</b> box. When the microphone is pulled out of the <b>hang-up,</b> the radio reverts to carrier squelch, (the selective calling feature is disabled). The user automatically monitors—verifies no one else is using the channel—by pulling the mike out of the <b>hang-up</b> box. Hand-held radios sometimes have LED indicators that show when the channel is in use.|$|E
