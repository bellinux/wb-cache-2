5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants. The leaves of the sensitive plant, Mimosa pudica, close up rapidly in response to direct touch, vibration, or even <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> thermal stimuli. The proximate cause of this mechanical response is an abrupt change in the turgor pressure in the pulvini {{at the base of}} leaves resulting from osmotic phenomena. This is then spread via both <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> chemical means through the plant; only a single leaflet need be disturbed.|$|E
5|$|As a metal, {{titanium}} {{is recognized}} for its high strength-to-weight ratio. It {{is a strong}} metal with low density that is quite ductile (especially in an oxygen-free environment), lustrous, and metallic-white in color. The relatively high melting point (more than 1,650°C or 3,000°F) makes it useful as a refractory metal. It is paramagnetic and has fairly low <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{products}} {{are the leading}} manufacturing field. The United States is the largest producer {{of oil in the}} world, as well as its second-largest importer.

5|$|Early {{means of}} {{communicating}} over a distance included visual signals, such as beacons, smoke signals, semaphore telegraphs, signal flags, and optical heliographs. Other examples of pre-modern long-distance communication included audio messages such as coded drumbeats, lung-blown horns, and loud whistles. 20th and 21st century technologies for long-distance communication usually involve <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> electromagnetic technologies, such as telegraph, telephone, and teleprinter, networks, radio, microwave transmission, fiber optics, and communications satellites.|$|E

5|$|In the European Union, the {{directive}} on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in <b>Electrical</b> <b>and</b> Electronic Equipment (see RoHS) bans mercury from certain <b>electrical</b> <b>and</b> electronic products, and limits {{the amount of}} mercury in other products to less than 1000 ppm. There are restrictions for mercury concentration in packaging (the limit is 100 ppm for sum of mercury, lead, hexavalent chromium and cadmium) and batteries (the limit is 5 ppm). In July 2007, the European Union also banned mercury in non-electrical measuring devices, such as thermometers and barometers. The ban applies to new devices only, and contains exemptions for the health care sector and a two-year grace period for manufacturers of barometers.|$|E
