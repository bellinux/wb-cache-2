Results from empirical research show that there is no clear cut evidence of corporate farms being inherently less efficient for all <b>farming</b> activities than <b>family</b> <b>farms.</b> Where significant differences have been found in favour of <b>family</b> <b>farms</b> against the average corporate farm, the best corporate farms still tend to perform as well as the best <b>family</b> <b>farms.</b> As far as size in concerned, in countries in transition where small <b>family</b> <b>farms</b> are well established and managed continuously by the present farm household, they appear to be less inefficient compared to larger cohorts as against countries where small <b>family</b> <b>farms</b> are a relatively new phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|HIS PAPER DISCUSSES {{the problem}} of {{developing}} a formal definition of T <b>family</b> <b>farming,</b> and {{the problem of}} operationalizing it’. The contention is that only by working in that direction will rural sociology be able to address one of the basic problems of the discipline: the prevalence, development and likely future of <b>family</b> <b>farming.</b> In principle there are three types of definitions of <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> circulating, and a number of more or less ad hoc operationalizations. The problems with these is that most definitions are not truly formal. They are too marked by the context in which they were developed. Similarly, operationalization tend to be ad hoc, for example locating <b>family</b> <b>farms</b> within certain acreage or income brackets. The problem with context-bound definitions and ad hoc operationali-zations is the usual problem of empiricism, i. e., that research gets stunted. It becomes difficult to study development over time (as contexts change), and to make comparative studies of <b>family</b> <b>farming</b> and agrarian structure.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to empirically explore the determinants of family harmony in small and medium-sized <b>family</b> <b>farms.</b> Data from 244 questionnaires from 36 <b>family</b> <b>farms</b> were collected and analysed.

The impact of the existence of family forums and conflict management on family harmony was examined by means of multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicate that a significant proportion of the variation in family harmony among family members in <b>family</b> <b>farms</b> is explained by the existence of family forums and the management of conflict among family members.
