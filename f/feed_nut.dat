50|$|The {{great tit}} {{is a popular}} garden bird due to its acrobatic {{performances}} when <b>feeding</b> on <b>nuts</b> or seed. Its willingness to move into nest boxes has made it a valuable study subject in ornithology; it has been particularly useful {{as a model for}} the study of the evolution of various life-history traits, particularly clutch size. A study of a literature database search found 1,349 articles relating to Parus major for the period between 1969 and 2002.|$|R
50|$|The Sri Lankan {{sloth bear}} (Melursus ursinus inornatus) is a {{subspecies}} of the sloth bear found mainly in lowland dry {{forests in the}} island of Sri Lanka. The Sri Lankan sloth bear is omnivorous. It <b>feeds</b> on <b>nuts,</b> berries, and roots, as well as carrion and meat. One of its main staples is insects, which it removes from rotting stumps and trees with its long, hairless snout. It rarely kills animals. Yala National Park is a famous place to sight these mammals in Sri Lanka.|$|R
50|$|Mockernut is {{not easily}} injured by ice glaze or snow, but young {{seedlings}} are very susceptible to frost damage. Many birds and animals <b>feed</b> on the <b>nuts</b> of mockernut hickory. This feeding combined with insect and disease problems eliminates the annual nut production, except during bumper seed crop years.|$|R
50|$|Tithoes confinis {{can reach}} {{a length of}} 55 - 100 mm. This beetle has a massive hairy body and strong mandibles. The basic colour is dark brown. Pronotum bears two spines on both edges. Adults are nocturnal. Larvae <b>feed</b> on Cashew <b>Nut</b> Trees (Anacardium occidentale) and other trees {{belonging}} to the Anacardiaceae family.|$|R
5000|$|The Delmarva fox {{squirrel}} {{like many}} squirrel species, use trees to elude predators. Their preferred habitat is mature forest of both hardwood and pine trees {{with an open}} understory. An open understory within the forest is needed for the squirrels to successfully <b>feed</b> on <b>nuts</b> and seeds of the many trees such as oaks, hickories, sweet gum, walnut, and loblolly pine during the fall season when these trees are dispersing their seeds. In the summer and early fall they often feed on mature green pine cones. Other less important food sources include buds, fruit, insects, and grain.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of dominance status to foraging and ultimately survival or reproductive success in wild primates is known; however, {{few studies have}} addressed these variables simultaneously. We investigated foraging and social behavior among 17 adult female Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) on Kinkazan Island, northern Japan, from September to November in 2 consecutive years (2004 and 2005) to determine whether interannual variation in food availability was related to variation in agonistic interactions over food resources and the feeding behavior of individuals of different dominance rank. We compared energy obtained with daily energy requirements and also examined the effect of variation in feeding behavior on female survival and reproductive success. Fruiting conditions differed considerably between the 2 yr: of four nut-producing species, the nuts of only Torreya nucifera fruited in 2004, whereas all four species, particularly Fagus crenata, produced nuts in abundance in 2005. The abundance and average crown size of trees of Torreya nucifera were smaller than those of Fagus crenata, {{and there was a}} higher frequency of agonistic interactions during 2004, when dominant, but not subordinate, individuals were able to satisfy daily energy requirements from <b>nut</b> <b>feeding</b> alone through longer <b>nut</b> <b>feeding</b> bouts. In contrast, all macaques, regardless of their dominance rank, were able to satisfy their energy requirements by <b>feeding</b> on <b>nuts</b> in 2005. Subordinate macaques appeared to counter their disadvantage in 2004 by moving and searching for food more and maintaining larger interindividual distances. Several lower-ranking females died during the food-scarce season of 2004, and only one dominant female gave birth the following birth season. In contrast, none of the adult females died during the food-scarce season of 2005, and 12 females gave birth the following birth season. These findings suggest that an interaction between dominance rank and interannual variation in food availability are related to macaque behavior, survival, and reproduction...|$|R
25|$|The {{blue jay}} mainly <b>feeds</b> on <b>nuts</b> and seeds such as acorns, soft fruits, arthropods, and {{occasionally}} small vertebrates. It typically gleans food from trees, shrubs, and the ground, though it sometimes hawks insects from the air. Like squirrels, blue jays {{are known to}} hide nuts for later consumption. It builds an open cup nest in {{the branches of a}} tree, which both sexes participate in constructing. The clutch can contain two to seven eggs, which are blueish or light brown with brown spots. Young are altricial, and are brooded by the female for 8–12 days after hatching. They may remain with their parents for one to two months.|$|R

40|$|Underutilized {{fruit trees}} {{play a vital}} role in food {{security}} and economy of the rural population in a number of African countries. Beside the significant important of the underutilized fruit trees in food security and livelihood of the local population many applications can be summarized such as using of leaves for fodder, branches for fencing materials, fire wood and charcoal making, timber for furniture and constructing huts, controlling soil erosion and competing desert encroachments. In spite of their great potential little attention has been given to this species. Balanites aegyptiaca “soap berry tree; thorn tree, desert date” is an important multipurpose trees species in dry land Africa. The tree is a potential source of medicines, pesticides, edible oil, animal <b>feed,</b> <b>nuts,</b> soap, and fuel wood. The edible fruits are rich in saturated fatty acids which are used as cooking oil. The fruit also contains Stereoids (Saponins, Sapogenins, and Disogenins) which are used as row materials for industrial production of contraceptive pills and other sexual hormones. The excessive uses of the tree for fruit production and for other uses combined with scarcity of natural regeneration lead to drastic depletion of this species. The desert date tree is adapted to dry and hot climatic environment which are characterized by increasing of land and water resources. However, little information is available about propagation and domestication of this valuable tree species; therefore, studies are needed for sustainable use of underutilized fruit trees in general and for Balanites aegyptiaca in particular. This article aims at highlighting and summarizing information on different aspect of B. aegyptiaca to stimulate the scientist interest in this valuable tree species which is of economical importance for rural inhabitants of western Sudan and other African countries.

40|$|Ginkgo biloba L. {{is among}} the oldest species of trees on earth. Various parts of the tree {{have a history of}} use in {{prevention}} of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. However, most of the current scientific research is focused on the Ginkgo leaf extract. Thus, we tested the effect of Ginkgo nuts on lipid metabolism as a therapeutic for cardiovascular diseases. Four preparations of Ginkgo nuts (whole nuts, their methanol extract and its lipid and water soluble fractions) were tested using Human Hepatoma cells (Hep G 2) and in vivo mouse <b>feeding</b> study. Ginkgo <b>nut</b> preparation may modulate serum cholesterol levels by modulating Apolipoprotein B secretion as well as low-density lipoprotein receptor in the liver. From mouse <b>feeding</b> trial, Ginkgo <b>nut</b> supplementation, as whole nuts, reduced the levels of hepatic cholesterol while increasing serum cholesterol compared to control. The lipid soluble fraction was responsible for decreased hepatic cholesterol, while the water soluble fraction may contribute to increased serum cholesterol. The lipid soluble fraction of Ginkgo nut may have potential to be used for the purpose of prevention of cardiovascular diseases. This is the first report investigating the effects of Ginkgo nuts on cholesterol metabolism...|$|R
