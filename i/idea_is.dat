5|$|Fragment 1 {{identifies}} Jesus {{as the son}} of the Holy Spirit; this <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> found also in the Egyptian Coptic Epistle of James, {{another indication}} of the Egyptian origin of the gospel.|$|E
5|$|A {{cultural}} trope {{imagines the}} female mantis as a femme fatale. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> propagated in cartoons by Cable, Guy and Rodd, LeLievre, T. McCracken, and Mark Parisi, among others. It ends Isabella Rossellini's short {{film about the}} life of a praying mantis in her 2008 Green Porno season for the Sundance Channel.|$|E
30|$|Step 3 : The {{results from}} the {{previous}} step are used to converge and organise the tentative list of drivers and trends. In this step a joint list of <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> organised by applying the NGT procedure. <b>Ideas</b> <b>are</b> structured and grouped, some <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> subsumed, redundant <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> deleted, overlapping and interrelated <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> merged, and reorganised <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> levelled into a hierarchy. A common and shorter list is emerging.|$|R

5|$|An overvalued <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> a {{false belief}} that is held with {{conviction}} {{but not with}} delusional intensity. Hypochondriasis is an overvalued idea that one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued idea that a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued idea of being thin.|$|E
5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of our knowledge of the world on the categories of thought.|$|E
5|$|One {{prevailing}} <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that carnivory {{in plants}} {{is not a}} black and white duality, but rather a spectrum from strict non-carnivorous photoautotrophs (a rose, for example) to fully carnivorous plants with active trapping mechanisms like those of Dionaea or Aldrovanda. However, passive traps are still considered fully carnivorous. Plants that fall between the definitions in the strict carnivorous/non-carnivorous demarcation can be defined as being protocarnivorous.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> to {{have four}} teams playing, including England and Scotland, but this <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> quickly {{replaced with a}} match between France and the United States.|$|R
40|$|Innate <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> not {{objective}} <b>ideas</b> {{which have}} {{ceased to be}} doubtful. They <b>are</b> not <b>ideas</b> of attributes or modes but rather true realities. Therefore, they are simple, clear, and distinct. These <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> not possible to analyze. Innate <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> not conceived when thinking of "something" but when the real world is felt. Therefore, they correspond with objective ideas...|$|R
40|$|In a {{democracy}} should the non-democratic <b>ideas</b> <b>be</b> allowed? a) If no, i. e. other <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> not allowed- even those non-democratic-, then one not has {{a democracy}}, because {{the freedom of}} speech is restricted. b) If yes, i. e. the non-democratic <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> allowed, then one might end up to a non-democracy (because the non-democratic ideas could overthrow the democracy as, for example, i...|$|R
5|$|Some {{claim that}} {{swooping}} {{can be prevented}} by hand-feeding magpies. Magpies will become accustomed to being fed by humans, and although they are wild, {{will return to the}} same place looking for handouts. The <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that humans thereby appear less of a threat to the nesting birds. Although this has not been studied systematically, there are reports of its success.|$|E
5|$|The {{experience}} of being entertained {{has come to be}} strongly associated with amusement, so that one common understanding of the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> fun and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of ceremony, celebration, religious festival, or satire for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving insight or intellectual growth.|$|E
5|$|The {{trivalent}} dysprosium ion (Dy3+) {{has been}} studied due its downshifting luminescence properties. Dy-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG:Dy) excited in the ultraviolet region {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} results in the emission of photons of longer wavelength in the visible region. This <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> the basis {{for a new generation of}} UV-pumped white light emitting diodes.|$|E
5000|$|Two unique <b>ideas</b> <b>were</b> {{used in the}} game. The first <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "break" [...] {{during the}} matches. This was to present a logical {{representation}} for things happening between rounds. The second <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> the [...] "finishing move," [...] a concept derived {{to be similar to}} that of the [...] "Fatality" [...] in Mortal Kombat. Neither idea has seen use in any subsequent Capcom games.|$|R
50|$|Unusual <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> welcome: To get a {{good and}} long list of <b>ideas,</b> unusual <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> welcomed. They may open new ways of {{thinking}} and provide better solutions than regular <b>ideas.</b> They can <b>be</b> generated by looking from another perspective or setting aside assumptions.|$|R
50|$|Modification of NGT, {{undertaken}} by Bartunek and Murnighan, helps {{to deal with}} ill-structured problems. Normal <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> generated and listed, followed by the facilitator questioning if the <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> relevant to the same problem. If not, the problem {{is said to be}} ill-structured, and the <b>ideas</b> generated <b>are</b> clustered into coherent groups. These clusters of ill-structured <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> then treated as problems in their own right, and the NGT procedure is applied to them. Regular breaks are taken by the participants to ensure that the group feels they are still working on the original problem.|$|R
5|$|A further {{suggestion}} is that Mari Lwyd derives from the English term Merry Lude, referring to a merry game. Peate opposed this idea, arguing that if the latter was converted into Welsh then {{the result would be}} merri-liwt or merri-liwd. Peate also dismissed the idea that had been suggested to him that the term Mari in this context had derived from Morris, a reference to Morris dance. Another reason to doubt this <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that there is no known historical link between the Mari Lwyd, which was found in South Wales, and the Morris dance, which was concentrated in the north of the country.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that the Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{relevant}} words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that Völundr {{is described as}} one of the elves in Völundarkviða. As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape Böðvildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton lais, Kötludraumur and Gullkársljóð. The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.|$|E
50|$|Galambos’ idea of {{according}} {{property rights}} to <b>ideas</b> <b>is</b> controversial. Among the most passionate opponents of this <b>idea</b> <b>are</b> libertarian intellectuals who are aghast {{at the idea}} that anyone could limit their access to ideas of others.|$|R
60|$|Both {{impressions}} and <b>ideas</b> may <b>be</b> either simple, {{when they}} are incapable of further analysis, or complex, when they may be resolved into simpler constituents. All simple <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> exact copies of impressions; but, in complex ideas, the arrangement of simple constituents may be {{different from that of}} the impressions of which those simple <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> copies.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{the metro}} station of Merode was {{planned to be}} {{underneath}} {{the building of the}} Bank Bruxelles Lambert. Due to security issues this <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> not fully implemented however leftovers of this <b>idea</b> <b>are</b> still visible in the building.|$|R
5|$|Cats {{have either}} a mutualistic or {{commensal}} relationship with humans. Two main theories are given about how cats were domesticated. In one, people deliberately tamed cats {{in a process}} of artificial selection as they were useful predators of vermin. This has been criticized as implausible, because the reward for such an effort may have been too little; cats generally do not carry out commands and although they do eat rodents, other species such as ferrets or terriers may be better at controlling these pests. The alternative <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that cats were simply tolerated by people and gradually diverged from their wild relatives through natural selection, as they adapted to hunting the vermin found around humans in towns and villages.|$|E
5|$|Ostrom's {{description}} of Deinonychus in 1969 {{has been described}} as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that dinosaurs may have been warm-blooded. This development has been termed the dinosaur renaissance. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of Deinonychus and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> almost universally accepted.|$|E
5|$|Sheldon, Raj, Leonard and Howard discuss Howard's {{bachelor}} party, with Howard reaffirming to Raj that strippers {{are banned}} from the party. Raj then suggests a wine tasting train trip through Napa Valley but, despite Sheldon's approval, this <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> rejected as well. Meanwhile, Amy is filming Bernadette and Penny making wedding party gifts. She begins {{to ask a question}} about consummation but Penny tells her to ask something normal, such as what Bernadette's married name will be.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{proposed the}} idea of removing the kickoff play, and quoted that the [...] "kickoff return is too dangerous for the game". The <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> met with criticism and the <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> eventually dropped.|$|R

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The Spinozistic {{conception}} of a conatus was a historical precursor to modern theories of autopoiesis in biological systems. In systems theory and the sciences in general, {{the concept of a}} conatus {{may be related to the}} phenomenon of emergence, whereby complex systems may spontaneously form from multiple simpler structures. The self-regulating and self-maintaining properties of biological and even social systems may thus be considered modern versions of Spinoza's conatus principle; however, the scope of the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> definitely narrower today without the religious implications of the earlier variety.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this <b>idea,</b> <b>is</b> arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
50|$|Symbiotic idea: A {{symbiotic}} {{method of}} <b>idea</b> creation <b>is</b> when multiple <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> combined, using different elements of each {{to make a}} whole.|$|R
50|$|The idea-expression {{dichotomy}} specifies that mere <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> {{not entitled}} to copyright; only the expression of those <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> granted protection. For example, if a magician writes a description of how a trick works, the description will generally be subject to copyright.|$|R
50|$|Berkeley {{began his}} {{treatise}} by asserting that existence {{is the state}} of being perceived by a perceiver. Human minds know ideas, not objects. The three kinds of <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> those of sensation, thought, and imagination. When several <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> associated together, they are thought to <b>be</b> <b>ideas</b> of one distinct thing, which is then signified by one name.|$|R
