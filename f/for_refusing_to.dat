5|$|The 16th-century English Reformation, {{during which}} the Church of England {{broke away from the}} {{authority}} of the pope and the Catholic Church, split the Southworth family of Samlesbury Hall.

In her few remaining years, she became the keeper of the Sam Houston legacy and opened his records to a trusted biographer. When she died of yellow fever four and a half years later, Margaret could not be buried with her husband in a public cemetery in Huntsville for fear of contamination, and was instead interred next to her mother on private property.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and the PLO were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, <b>for</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Carroll {{was elected}} to the Kentucky Senate from District 7, {{defeating}} Harold Fletcher – the older brother of then-governor Ernie Fletcher – by a wide margin. The district included all or portions of Anderson, Fayette, Franklin, and Woodford counties. He made headlines in 2007 when he called on Fletcher's lieutenant governor, Steve Pence, to resign for his disloyalty after Pence endorsed Anne Northup in the Republican gubernatorial primary rather than backing Fletcher's re-election bid. Pence refused to resign, citing an investigation of the administration's hiring practices as his reason <b>for</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> endorse Fletcher. Fletcher won the Republican primary, but lost in the general election to Democrat Steve Beshear.|$|E
5|$|In 572 the Byzantine ruler JustinII (reigned 565–578) {{refused to}} renew the annual {{payments}} to Sassanid Persia that {{had been part of}} the peace agreement concluded by his uncle, JustinianI (r. 527–565) and the Persian shah KhosrauI (r. 531–579) in 562. This marked the culmination of the progressive deterioration of Byzantine–Persian relations over the previous years, which manifested itself in diplomatic and military manoeuvring in their geopolitical periphery. Thus the Byzantines initiated contacts with the Central Asian Göktürks for a joint effort against Persia, while the Persians intervened in Yemen against the Christian Axumites, allies of Byzantium. Justin furthermore regarded the annual tribute as an indignity unworthy of Romans, and used the outbreak of a major revolt in Persian Armenia in 571–572 as a pretext <b>for</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> continue the payments.|$|E

King was arrested during this campaign, which concluded with a United States District Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that ended racial segregation on all Montgomery public buses. King's role in the bus boycott transformed him into a national figure and the best-known spokesman {{of the civil rights}} movement.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer <b>for</b> <b>refusing</b> <b>to</b> release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race was so close that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E
