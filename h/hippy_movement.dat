500|$|Quatermass {{met with}} a {{generally}} unenthusiastic critical response. Sean Day-Lewis wrote, [...] "Although Piers Haggard's direction achieves much verisimilitude and the story is certainly enough to command some addiction; I did not feel exactly grabbed; the genre has moved some way since the 1950s and the Professor moves a little slowly for the 1970s". The reviewer in The Daily Telegraph found Professor Quatermass [...] "far too unheroic and unresourceful to carry much interest" [...] while The Times found the serial to be [...] "a so-so affair". More positive was the Daily Mail who thought the serial was [...] "not the best of Nigel Kneale but it equalled any of his earliest Quatermass stories". John Brosnan, writing in Starburst magazine, found the serial to be [...] "a bitter reaction {{by a member of}} an older generation to the younger generation whose apparently irrational behaviour makes them appear to belong to a totally different species. Naturally in the traditions of sf, these failings are exaggerated to the nth degree. Thus muggers and juvenile delinquents become armed gangs and the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> with its emphasis on mysticism, becomes the Planet Church. It's very much a story of Age versus Youth and significantly it's the older people who are impervious to the malign alien influence". This view is echoed by filmmaker John Carpenter who said, [...] "Nigel was very embittered about the way of the world, as was shown, I think, in The Quatermass Conclusion".|$|E

50|$|At {{the height}} of the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> and the {{psychedelic}} age in the 1960s, the futen zoku or vagabond tribe emerged in the Shinjuku area of Japan. Japanese media depicted them as dangerous because of their substance abuse and their public presence. More recreational drug users who patronized clubs and coffee shops were known as danmo zoku.|$|E

50|$|O'Connell {{is noted}} for making films about the post-beat and <b>hippy</b> <b>movements</b> in San Francisco in the 1960s. O'Connell co-wrote {{some of the}} music for his films, such as Revolution played by Mother Earth in the film of the same name. This film also {{featured}} Country Joe and the Fish, Quicksilver Messenger Service and Steve Miller Band.|$|R
50|$|Génesis was a Colombian folk-rock band, {{very popular}} during the 1970s. They are {{regarded}} as {{a significant part of}} the Colombian social progressive and <b>hippy</b> <b>movements</b> of the time. Génesis is considered a pioneer in fusing rock music with the native folk music of Colombia. Colombian icon Humberto Monroy of Los Speakers was a founding member and driving force behind the band.|$|R
50|$|The 1959 {{opening of}} Lenox Square and 1964 opening of Ansley Mall lowered {{sales in the}} Shopping District. The area became a famous hippy hangout and {{acquired}} the name of The Strip. By 1967 the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> had been seriously repressed and the area stagnated. Many businesses were set on fire (arson) and many buildings were torn down {{to make way for}} parking lots.|$|E
50|$|When the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> {{started to}} happen he {{realized}} it was not his thing and he slipped back into drinking. He approached the lowest point in his life and many times he did not get to eat because what little money he had, he spent on booze. One guy who still tried to help him occasionally was Ronnie Hawkins. Ronnie added him as a second drummer to his band for several one nighters where he shared the stage with regular drummer Levon Helm.|$|E
50|$|In 1972, WVUM went stereo, and in 1978, {{the station}} {{completely}} renovated the studio facilities {{on the second}} floor of the Whitten University Center. The station would remain there until a larger space downstairs was renovated in 1999, offering two studios and an office. Previously, this new space had been a barber shop (that went bankrupt in the later 1960s/early 1970s because of the <b>Hippy</b> <b>movement)</b> and a bowling alley motor room. In 2008, for the 40th year of WVUM, IKEA aesthetically renovated the office in the University Center. The summer of 2015 brought new renovations to WVUM's office, modernizing it and increasing space substantially.|$|E
5000|$|While the 1960s and 1970s <b>hippy</b> <b>movements</b> were, and {{continue}} to be, unfairly derided [...] for their infatuation with rediscovering ancient religion and culture, many of these re-birthing systems {{are now part of}} mainstream ideology. Although {{the subject matter of the}} workshops at Nambassa was controversial for the time, these once-alternative ideas are now accepted by many as integral components of a freethinking modern society. The biggest complaint against the festival organisers from festival patrons, was that there were never enough hours in the day to attend their desired programme.|$|R
5000|$|But {{in reality}} {{were far from}} all bands {{political}} at all, and had not asked {{to be put in}} the [...] "progg-category" [...] at all. This is especially true for many bands from Stockholm, while Gothenburg became Sweden's capital of political bands. November, like most bands and solo-artists was put in the [...] "progg-category" [...] by media, for no reason at all. Still today are November confused with the red [...] "progg"-music, but they certainly never played political music. Nor did they attempt to deceive the Swedish youth into becoming communists of any kind. November was just very loosely connected with the far wider anti Vietnam war <b>hippies</b> <b>movement</b> and liked to play hard rock fast.|$|R
50|$|The hippie (also spelt as <b>hippy)</b> {{subculture}} <b>movement</b> {{arose in}} the United States in the 1960s. Other countries were quick to pick up this youth movement. Among other traits, hippies were supposed to sport long hair. Hippies in the West were said to consume great amounts of illegal drugs.|$|R
5000|$|Released {{alongside}} the B-side [...] "Ayer Nomás"—written by Pipo Lernoud and Moris—"La balsa" [...] {{became a major}} hit in Argentina and various Latin American countries, selling around 250,000 copies. It is a melodic, beat-influenced song, with prominent use of a Farfisa electronic organ and bossa nova elements attributed to Nebbia. Its sound—and commercial impact—reflected the loss of popularity of the nueva ola phenomenon and American rock 'n' roll, which began {{to be perceived as}} trivial. The success of [...] "La balsa" [...] was an unprecedented feat for Spanish-language rock (rock en español), as it established its commercial viability {{at a time when the}} use of Spanish lyrics was discouraged. Its release is generally considered to be the origin of Argentine rock, paving the way for bands such as Almendra and Manal—along with Los Gatos, these bands are considered the founders of the style. The popularity of [...] "La balsa" [...] turned Argentine rock into a widespread youth culture phenomenon, and was followed by the appearance of the first magazines, independent record labels and music festivals of the movement. The song also became an anthem for the burgeoning Argentine <b>hippy</b> <b>movement,</b> which grew in size and influenced this first stage of rock nacional.|$|E

50|$|Whilst the {{programmable}} computerised amplifier {{was perhaps}} released a decade too soon Orange continued to produce solid state amplifiers with the denim clad Jimmy Bean amp being released in 1976. The low cost but high quality integrated circuit chips {{used in the}} OMEC allowed for a wealth of innovative signal processing technology to be adapted to other amplifiers and when coupled with a proven power amp design, led to the launch {{of a series of}} solid state amps and matching cabinets throughout 1976 to 1979. By the late 1970s the music world had moved on significantly from the psychedelic <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> of the 1960s and the decision was taken to update the design of the range, The typeface was changed to a more modern font, the sleeve was lowered to give a sleeker look and the basketweave grille was changed to a black material with a different level of sound transparency. As part of this major makeover in 1978/1978 Orange divided its product range into Orange Sound Reinforcement and Orange Instrument Amplification. Sound reinforcement included PA, mixing desks and solid state power amps. Examples of models from this period include the Series Two and the Hustler range of guitar and bass amplifiers. In 1978 the Orange Shop closed when the buildings on New Compton Street were demolished. Production ceased at the Bexleyheath factory in 1979 when {{as a direct result of}} two major overseas distributors going into liquidation within a short period of time made the production line no longer viable.|$|E
2500|$|... there [...] no {{question}} that the <b>Hippy</b> [...] <b>movement</b> and its repercussive influence in England owed much of its imagery, its manner, dress and personal appearance to the Pre-Raphaelite ideal ...

50|$|The {{influences}} on Upritchard's figurative sculptures are various: {{the figures in}} the Bayeux tapestry, Japanese Noh theatre, 1960s psychedelic portraiture, Grasser's wooden figures, the bronze figures of the Chola dynasty, court jesters and medieval performers. Writers about these works often reference counter-cultural <b>movements,</b> <b>hippies,</b> shamans and marionettes when describing them. Comparisons {{have been made to}} the earlier work of Bruce Conner and Paul Thek and Upritchard's closer contemporaries Ryan Trecartin, Lizzie Fitch and Saya Woolfalk.|$|R
50|$|In 1967, Harry Hepcat {{decided on}} {{preserving}} {{the music and}} styles of the fifties and early sixties. In an age of acid rock, <b>hippies</b> and protest <b>movements,</b> most agents and venues considered that idea insane. At {{one of the early}} concerts at Hofstra University, on Long Island, the over enthusiastic students rioted, turning over slide show equipment and destroying band signs and a poster photo of Alan Freed. In spite of this, the times finally caught up with Harry and the fifties revival was on.|$|R
40|$|You {{are what}} you eat' is a phrase older than it might seem. Originating with Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, and echoed by Feuerbach ('Der Mensch ist, was er ißt. '), it was popularised {{in the work of}} the {{nutritionist}} Victor Lindlahr and the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> of the 1960 s. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, our culture appears fixated on the food which we eat, and the effect it has upon us. This need not be unique: Jacob Neusner has calculated that sixty-seven per cent of rabbinic legislation deals with food, its preparation and consumption...|$|E
40|$|This article {{argues that}} the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> of the 1960 ’s and 1970 ’s, {{both in terms of}} its {{underlying}} philosophy and its practical lifestyle, made significant contributions to the environmental movement. The focus is on one specific hippy community, the followers of Stephen Gaskin, first in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco and later on The Farm at Summertown in Tennessee. Their views concerning the natural environment and how they put these views to practice in their day-to-day lifestyle are investigated. Of particular relevance is their use of drugs as a holistic sacrament and their lifestyle close to nature as a self-sustaining community in the countryside. It is concluded that traces of the impact of their outlook and their lifestyle on environmental thinking can still be observed in contemporary society...|$|E
40|$|It {{might seem}} trivial and mere {{common sense to}} note that revolts and {{revolutions}} are deeply emotional moments. In history books and newspapers, we read about the tense and emotionally charged atmosphere that leads to violence when protestors confront police forces, or about furious and passionate crowds acting {{in defiance of the}} ideal of rational and coldblooded politics. But rage and anger are not the only emotions involved in the politics of protest. Consider the iconic photographs of the summer strikes during the French Popular Front in 1936, depicting smiling workers occupying their factories and construction sites, or the cheering crowds storming the Berlin Wall in November 1989. Or consider the genre of protest songs, telling stories of solidarity and hope as well as deep sorrow. At times, social and political movements even made feelings their central concern, such as the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> with its calls for free love. On {{the other side of the}} political spectrum, conservative as well as social democratic observers often denounced protests and riots as politically irrelevant outbreaks of hatred, or mocked the ‘hysterical’ fear of the peace movement during the 1980 s. Somehow, these examples suggest, feelings mattered, yet how precisely they mattered is rarely investigated. The essays in this special issue will address this question in order to enrich our understanding of protest movements, revolts and revolutions. Collectively, they intend to open a theoretical and methodological debate on the role of emotions in the politics of protest and resistance...|$|E
25|$|The {{political}} {{ideals of}} <b>hippies</b> influenced other <b>movements,</b> such as anarcho-punk, rave culture, green politics, stoner {{culture and the}} New Age movement. Penny Rimbaud of the English anarcho-punk band Crass said in interviews, and in an essay called The Last Of The Hippies, that Crass was formed in memory of his friend, Wally Hope. Crass had its roots in Dial House, which was established in 1967 as a commune. Some punks were often critical of Crass for their involvement in the hippie movement. Like Crass, Jello Biafra {{was influenced by the}} hippie movement, and cited the yippies as a key influence on his political activism and thinking, though he also wrote songs critical of hippies.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{people have}} {{looked for a}} generic term to replace the {{numerous}} existing initialisms. Words such as queer (an umbrella term for sexual and gender minorities that are not heterosexual, or gender-binary) and rainbow have been tried, but most have not been widely adopted. Queer has many negative connotations to older people who remember the word as a taunt and insult and such (negative) usage of the term continues. Many younger people also understand queer to be more politically charged than LGBT. [...] "Rainbow" [...] has connotations that recall <b>hippies,</b> New Age <b>movements,</b> and {{groups such as the}} Rainbow Family or Jesse Jackson's Rainbow/PUSH Coalition. SGL ("same gender loving") is sometimes favored among gay male African Americans as a way of distinguishing themselves from what they regard as white-dominated LGBT communities.|$|R
500|$|Christian metal has {{its origins}} in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the Jesus {{movement}}, a hippie movement with Christian ideology consisting of hippies that converted to Christianity. The Christian <b>hippies</b> within this <b>movement,</b> known as [...] "Jesus People", developed a musical movement called Jesus music, which primarily began in southern California, ex. Los Angeles when hippie street musicians converted to Christianity. These musicians continued playing the same styles of music they had played before converting, among them heavy metal music, though they infused their lyrics with a Christian message. Larry Norman {{was one of the}} earliest Christian rock musicians who released his first album titled Upon This Rock in 1969 which is arguably the first Christian rock album produced. Norman's song [...] "Why Should the Devil Have All the Good Music?" [...] summarised the ideas of these musicians.|$|R
40|$|Somewhere {{between a}} {{travelling}} cinema and theatre troupe, a kiss-a-gram and a takeaway delivery service, London-based artist Oreet Ashery’s Party for Freedom was an itinerant work combining live performance with moving-image and an original album soundtrack. An invitation for self-organised gatherings to host {{and experience the}} work - anywhere from a sitting room and work place to public spaces and venues - it also appeared at venues across London including Millbank Media Centre at Millbank Tower and OrganicLea, a workers cooperative {{on the edge of}} the Lea Valley. Party for Freedom was loosely based on Vladimir Mayakovsky’s 1921 play Mystery-Bouffe, telling the story of the Clean and the Unclean. It explored performances of liberation and political nakedness; and responded to the changing landscape of Dutch politics following the assassinations of controversial Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn in 2001 and film director Theo van Gogh in 2004, and the ensuing popularity of Geert Wilders, the Dutch politician and leader of the far-right Partij voor de Vrijheid [Party for Freedom]. Including newly commissioned punk, experimental and contemporary classical music by Finnish composer Timo-Juhani Kyllönen, all-girl post-punk band Woolf, and London-based musician Morgan Quaintance, the Party for Freedom moving-image work featured an irreverent array of characters and scenarios, developed through workshops and filmed in the lush setting of a 13 th-century church in the English countryside. Questioning the currencies of perceived Western freedom, the work drew on trash aesthetics, leftist sentiments grounded in the 1960 s and 1970 s avant-garde, the <b>hippy</b> <b>movement</b> and far-right populist claims positing Islam and immigration as a threat. Party for Freedom appeared at ticketed public London events exploring themes of the work. The project was launched with a live concert of the moving-image work with the original album soundtrack on May 1 at Millbank Media Centre, Millbank Tower. Members of the public also invited the Party to a large range of venues, residential and commercial...|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} devoted to {{focusing}} {{on the issue of}} counterculture in the 1960 s and examining the hippie movement and, in particular, finding {{the answer to the question}} what appealed to the wider public in the United States of America so much, that some 450, 000 attended the acts and concerts of the Woodstock Festival in the summer of 1969. I am going to consider what factors led to the fact that the <b>hippies</b> and their <b>movement</b> became well known and influential to the younger generation of this era. Last August Americans celebrated the 40 th anniversary of the biggest music festival ever. Both History Channel and Discovery Channel had specials on the event. The news drew my attention to one of the most pivotal periods of American history and culture. My research aims at fulfilling these interests in the cultural protest that lies in hiding behind the political, social and cultural events of the 1960 s. régi képzésangol nyelv és irodalom szakos tanár (távoktatás...|$|R
