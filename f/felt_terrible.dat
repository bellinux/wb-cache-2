500|$|I did Winnie Winkle for 20 years, {{and when}} they told me, [...] "You have 90 days to wrap it up," [...] because they were discontinuing it, I <b>felt</b> <b>terrible,</b> but after I {{finished}} it, I didn't even miss it. I was depressed because I lost a good job, but I just didn't miss it. Maybe it was the routine of it every week I didn't miss, but I {{have a lot of}} good memories of doing that strip.|$|E
2500|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> for him, he {{has been}} unwavering in his desire to meet her for 3 years and despite many {{attempts}} {{to get him to}} pick a 2nd wish or change his mind he would not. Last year Ina gave a 'soft no' supposedly because she had a 10 month book tour and they called and asked him {{what he wanted to do}} and he said 'I will wait' and he did." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack's {{face looked}} ghastly pale and haggard as we {{hurried back to}} rejoin the teacher; and I {{have no doubt that}} he <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> anxiety when he {{considered}} the number and ferocity of the savages, and the weakness of the few arms which were ready indeed to essay, but impotent to effect, Avatea's deliverance from these ruthless men.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{profound}} silence. The court was interested and curious. I couldn't quite understand it all, but I <b>felt</b> a <b>terrible</b> sinking.|$|R

60|$|And {{taking a}} pillow from the bed, she crushed it against herself and swayed herself unconsciously, in her orgasm of {{unbearable}} feeling. Right in her bowels she <b>felt</b> it--the <b>terrible,</b> unbearable feeling. How could she bear it.|$|R
60|$|When she {{had talked}} {{it all out}} she lay down on her pillow again. I {{got up and went}} downstairs to light the fire. I <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> old and tired. My feet seemed to drag, and the tears kept coming to my eyes, though I tried to keep them away, for well I knew it was a bad omen to be weeping on a wedding day.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Master, {{we never}} {{took her to}} anyone. When we first began to fear that she {{was never going to}} talk Thomas wanted to take her to Charlottetown and have her looked to. He thought so much of the child and he <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> about it. But her mother wouldn't hear of it being done. There was no use trying to argue with her. She said that it would be no use--that it was her sin that was visited on her child and it could never be taken away." ...|$|E
60|$|The leader, {{with a quick}} {{movement}} of his rein, threw his horse out in front, and pointed first to the sun, now close down on the hill tops, {{and then to the}} castle, said something which I did not understand. For answer, all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart. I should have <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> fear at seeing Jonathan in such danger, but that the ardor of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them. I felt no fear, but only a wild, surging desire to do something. Seeing the quick {{movement of}} our parties, the leader of the gypsies gave a command. His men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour, each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order.|$|E
5000|$|... "I <b>felt</b> so <b>terrible</b> I {{could eat}} only 51. In 2006, I had eaten 60 {{of them in}} two minutes for a local record event. But I am sure I shall {{make it to the}} Guinness World Records." [...] Anandita to The Associated Press.|$|R
60|$|The {{incident}} of the knife, and of Duncan McKay's significant glance, at once flashed across Davidson's mind, and he <b>felt</b> a <b>terrible</b> {{sinking of the}} heart when the suspicion, once before roused within him, seemed now to be confirmed. He resolved, however, to reveal his thoughts to no one--specially not to Elspie.|$|R

60|$|Duane went to {{bed that}} night {{exceedingly}} thoughtful. The long trail was growing hot. This voluble colonel had given him new ideas. It came to Duane in surprise that he was famous along the upper Rio Grande. Assuredly he would not long be able to conceal his identity. He {{had no doubt that}} he would soon meet the chiefs of this clever and bold rustling gang. He could not decide whether he would be safer unknown or known. In the latter case his one chance lay in the fatality connected with his name, in his power to look it and act it. Duane had never dreamed of any sleuth-hound tendency in his nature, but now he felt something like one. Above all others his mind fixed on Poggin--Poggin the brute, the executor of Cheseldine's will, but mostly upon Poggin the gunman. This in itself was a warning to Duane. He <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> forces at work within him. There was the stern and indomitable resolve to make MacNelly's boast good to the governor of the state--to break up Cheseldine's gang. Yet this was not in Duane's mind before a strange grim and deadly instinct--which he had to drive away for fear he would find in it a passion to kill Poggin, not for the state, nor for his word to MacNelly, but for himself. Had his father's blood and the hard years made Duane {{the kind of man who}} instinctively wanted to meet Poggin? He was sworn to MacNelly's service, and he fought himself to keep that, and that only, in his mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Far be {{it from me}} to decry {{the holy}} state of matrimony, Mrs. Dr. dear, but I felt that when a man was running a {{revolution}} he had his hands full and should have postponed marriage until a more fitting season. The Russians are done for this time {{and there would be}} no sense in shutting our eyes to the fact. But have you seen Woodrow Wilson's reply to the Pope's peace proposals? It is magnificent. I really could not have expressed the rights of the matter better myself. I feel that I can forgive Wilson everything for it. He knows the meaning of words and that you may tie to. Speaking of meanings, have you heard the latest story about Whiskers-on-the-moon, Mrs. Dr. dear? It seems he was over at the Lowbridge Road school the other day and took a notion to examine the fourth class in spelling. They have the summer term there yet, you know, with the spring and fall vacations, being rather backward people on that road. My niece, Ella Baker, goes to that school and she it was who told me the story. The teacher was not feeling well, having a dreadful headache, and she went out to get a little fresh air while Mr. Pryor was examining the class. The children got along all right with the spelling but when Whiskers began to question them about the meanings of the words they were all at sea, because they had not learned them. Ella and the other big scholars <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> over it. They love their teacher so, and it seems Mr. Pryor's brother, Abel Pryor, who is trustee of that school, is against her and has been trying to turn the other trustees over to his way of thinking. And Ella and the rest were afraid that if the fourth class couldn't tell Whiskers the meanings of the words he would think the teacher was no good and tell Abel so, and Abel would have a fine handle. But little Sandy Logan saved the situation. He is a Home boy, but he is as smart as a steel trap, and he sized up Whiskers-on-the-moon right off. 'What does [...] "anatomy" [...] mean?' Whiskers demanded. 'A pain in your stomach,' Sandy replied, quick as a flash and never batting an eyelid. Whiskers-on-the-moon is a very ignorant man, Mrs. Dr. dear; he didn't know the meaning of the words himself, and he said 'Very good--very good.' The class caught right on--at least three or four of the brighter ones did--and they kept up the fun. Jean Blane said that 'acoustic' meant 'a religious squabble,' and Muriel Baker said that an 'agnostic' was 'a man who had indigestion,' and Jim Carter said that 'acerbity' meant that 'you ate nothing but vegetable food,' and so on all down the list. Whiskers swallowed it all, and kept saying 'Very good--very good' until Ella thought that die she would trying to keep a straight face. When the teacher came in, Whiskers complimented her on the splendid understanding the children had of their lesson and said he meant to tell the trustees what a jewel they had. It was 'very unusual,' he said, to find a fourth class who could answer up so prompt when it came to explaining what words meant. He went off beaming. But Ella told me this as a great secret, Mrs. Dr. dear, and we must keep it as such, for the sake of the Lowbridge Road teacher. It would likely be the ruin of her chances of keeping the school if Whiskers should ever find out how he had been bamboozled." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that my {{intelligence}} confirmed a hope of hers and gave her relief. I <b>felt</b> something <b>terrible</b> in the balance for Steele.

60|$|She <b>felt</b> a <b>terrible</b> hunger, {{a desire}} to take his head {{in her arms and}} kiss it. Her muscles ached and quivered with {{something}} she could not fathom.

The leaves whispered a message to her, and the stream repeated an occult note of joy, which was mixed with sorrow.|$|R

50|$|From then on, Rita wouldn't {{stop talking}} about her superhero Paddy {{and told him that}} she had told her parents and that they wanted to meet him. Paddy started to get sick of all the praise and Rita's parents, Jeff and Sue were just the same.

Jeff told Paddy that Rita's sister, Sally, was killed eight months earlier in a hit and run incident. Paddy <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> and tried to apologise but Rita wouldn't listen.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the film}} {{finished}} {{and the lights}} came up, there was complete silence. Then Nat Cohenturned round slowly and said, [...] "Well, I've seen worse." [...] In retrospect, I can smile about it. But whenever I work on a production I give it my all in terms of energy and hours spent {{trying to get it}} right. Crossroads to Crime was no exception. So at the time I <b>felt</b> <b>terrible</b> about it not being up to the standard I'd hoped it would be. Gerry Anderson (1996), remembering the response to the film at its test screening ...|$|E
60|$|Still, {{our hero}} was not unmanned.
