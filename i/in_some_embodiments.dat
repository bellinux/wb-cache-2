F om the standpoint of Native American philosophies and spiritual beliefs, geological unrest is not merely a reflection but <b>in</b> <b>some</b> cases anactual <b>embodiment</b> of the spiritual world. To understand the significance of pet-roglyph sites, they must be considered in the context of overall Native American beliefs.
