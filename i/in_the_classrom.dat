The {{present study was}} conducted to determine any behavior differences between elementary LD and nonhandicapped girls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regular <b>classrom.</b> Data were col-lected on child behaviors, child-child interactions and teacher-child interactions. Results showed that the LD girls spent less time doing schoolwork than nonhandi-capped girls. Unlike in research with LD boys, teachers were not found to (a) spend more time interacting with the LD children or (b) initiate more approaches to the LD girls. However, the teachers responded significantly less frequently to call-outs from LD girls. The present findings regarding teacher interactions with LD and nonhandicapped girls differ from those of most previous studies involving boys. The requirement that learning disabled (LD) children be observed in their regular classrooms (Federal Register, 1977) has led to an increase in observational research to determine any behavioral differences between LD and nonhandi-capped children in such settings.

Keywords: English Native speaker, Strategy in teching speaking 	Succes in teaching depends onmany factors, {{one of them}} is teaching strategies. Teachers have to perform appropiate strategies for teaching speaking because the use of teacher strategies depend on the students speaking proficiency. Good communication between teacher and students shows indicator of the teaching succes. Teacher’s strategy usefull to increase teachers capability in delivering material so the students get building their desire to study. The researcher has problem of the research were: How does English native speaker design teaching speaking? How does the english native speaker stimulate the students to speak? And what kinds actiivity set by english native speaker tha support the students to practice spaking english? 	Meanwhile, {{the purpose of this study}} is to find out the design that used by english native speaker to teaching speaking, to know how english native speaker stimulate the students to speak.

Then the subject of this research are the English native speaker. The data of this research were aken from obeservation and interview with english native speaker amd the students who are teach by english native speaker. 	The result showed that in Teaching Speaking the Native speaker use a design according to the lesson plan. The design are include of Warm Up (Pre teaching), Presentation (Whilst Teaching), and Post Teaching (Practice). In pre teaching consits of many kinds activities such as Greeting, checking the students attendance list, dictionary check and asked the material before.

40|$|It is {{now widely}} {{understood}} {{that teachers are}} the main decision makers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> classroom, so when an innovation is introduced into a teaching and learning setting it seems that teachers‟ beliefs and attitudes may be a major determinant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> success or otherwise of that investment. This case study examines the process of a Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) application being introduced into a university setting. Bax (2003) posited that a new technology is „normalised‟ when it is invisible and fully integrated, just as pens and books have been, into everyday classroom use. To gain further insights into the process of an innovatory CALL application moving „towards normalisation‟ (Chambers & Bax 2006), the present study solicited university teachers‟ opinions and impressions towards the innovation {{over a period of}} five months. The innovation is a software application developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Computer Science Department at the University of Waikato ([URL] The Flexible Language Acquisition Device (FLAX) uses digitalised libraries to provide language learning tasks for students, both texts and tasks being written by teachers or more able students. The English Department at the National University of Timor-Leste (UNTL) was the setting selected for the study, as the researcher had spent fourteen months there as a volunteer teacher in 2005 - 6. The case study is framed within a wider (2006 - 2011) collaborative curriculum project between UNTL and the University of Waikato. It was decided to collect oral, rather than written, data in order to align with the oral traditions of Timor-Leste. Thus, oral reflective journals captured participants‟ perceptions in audio-recorded discussions with a peer over three occasions. Focus groups of participants reflected on key issues at entry and exit points, and the researcher wrote her own daily reflective journal. The findings showed that the participants moved from a position of excitement tinged with concern to a position of confidence and readiness to implement FLAX during the reseacher‟s visit, indicating a positive move towards normalisation. A powerful insight gained by the researcher was that teachers were able to co-construct a range of ways of using the programme with their students in terms of autonomous learning, peer scaffolding and the importance of <b>the</b> affective domain <b>in</b> language learning. These findings reinforced the notion that the introduction of technologies is a social construct, not just a technological one (Bax, 2011). A further lens of investigation of the innovation was provided by Activity Theory, (Engeström 1987), which showed that the process of curricular normalisation is influenced by activity outside <b>the</b> <b>classrom,</b> and may strengthen or reduce the object of activity, in this case improved learning outcomes. The implications of the case study may have resonance in relatable settings. It seems that encouraging a collaborative approach may enable teachers to envision and ideate new ways to teach and learn, and incorporate new technologies into their own settings. This study may also have implications for external change agents as they contemplate assisting learning communities to normalise curriculum innovation...|$|R
