40|$|Abstract. The article {{examines}} the relationship between property value and level of conservation of public urban space. While many {{studies have examined the}} effect of “proximity ” of open space, parks, and trees on property value, there has been few examination of how projects of urban revitalization and ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenances</b> of public spaces can influence property values. While intuition can suggest that a low level of quality and maintenance of a public space can negatively affect property value, even if the standard requirement of public spaces and services are meet, this yet to be empirically proven. We proposes the application of a new econometric models for quantitative analysis of the characteristics of real estate property (Generalized Additive Model), {{to assess the impact of}} maintenance condition on property values, due to the better prevision that these functions can obtain in a real estate market context. The control of the formal and logical adequacy of the proposed theoretical model is referred to the case study under analysis, in the city of Naples. The results obtained show that a “well preserved” urban environment influences property price by approximately 6 %. The experimental test of the model has provided results that, by reason of their formal consistency with the results obtained in other contexts, can be considered representative of the effectiveness of the methodology proposed...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: Nowadays {{high levels}} of {{experience}} have been acquired in the excavation of horizontal tunnels using TBM, especially as far as tunnels with small diameters (about 4 m wide) are concerned. Less experience has been acquired in the excavation of tunnels under difficult alignment conditions, {{as in the case}} of steeply inclined excavations (up-hill tunnels). Approach: This study presented the results of studies which compare the production data collected for tunnels excavated with TBM in "normal" conditions (horizontal tunnel), with those derived from steeply inclined excavations (up-hill tunnels). Results: From an examination of the results obtained in the studied cases a net difference appears evident in terms of productivity between horizontal and up-hill excavations. Conclusion: Such net difference between horizontal and up-hill excavation productions can be attributed to the greater burdens of times necessary for the supply of materials and personnel, the regripping operations with fall preventer systems and, in general, the greater difficulties of carrying out ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance</b> of the machines in particularly difficult altrimetric conditions...|$|E

Practices in design of Maintenance Plans just since a few decades have found new impulses, also due to laws which have introduced mandatory scheduling of maintenance activities even for Cultural Heritage. The result of this trend is the overcoming of traditional categories of ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Therefore, the maintenance is understood as a continuous process in time to ensure the conservation of the built environment. This approach has not always found implementation through suitable tools with the variety and the complexity of Cultural Heritage.

HVAC plant features quite innovative and significant energy savings characteristics. It has been set up by a gas engine reversible heat pump (GEHP) coupled to two condensing boilers. Recently, during the last years some failures of the GEHP have requested <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance.</b> Furthermore, gas engine half-life maintenance is necessary in the next months (approaching 15000 hours working). For these reasons, it is interesting to compare, both from energetic and from economic point of view, the actual solution with a trigeneration plant. The latter provides electrical energy that, depending on the period of the day, can partially or completely satisfy the load of the building or be exchanged with the local distributor grid. Heat recovered from the cogenerator can be suitably used to produce profitable relatively hot water in winter and refrigerated water in summer by means of an absorption chiller. Thermal loads of the building have been determinate by transient simulations by means of Trnsys.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{research}} study on a traffic model developed for analysing the performance of the wireless inductive systems for charging while driving (CWD) fully electric vehicles (FEVs) from both traffic and energy points of view. The design assumptions of the developed traffic model are aimed to simulate in particular a freight distribution service in a fully cooperative traffic environment. In this case, the CWD service could be used to guarantee the minimum state of charge (SOC) of the batteries at the arrival to the depot that allows the vehicles to shortly start with further activities. In this way, the fleet manager could avoid wasting time for the stationary recharge, thus increasing the level of service of the freight distribution. The CWD system is applied to a multilane ring road with several intermediate on-ramp entrances, where the slowest lane is reserved for the dynamic charging activities, when authorized vehicles are present. A specific traffic model has been developed and implemented adopting a mesoscopic approach, where vehicle energy needs and charging opportunities affect drivers’ behavior. Overtaking maneuvers, as well as new entries in the CWD lane of vehicles that need to charge, have been modeled by taking into account a fully cooperative driving system among vehicles which manages adequate gaps between consecutive vehicles. Finally, a speed control strategy in which vehicles can be delayed to create an empty time-space slot in the CWD lane, is simulated at a defined node. This type of control, though is simulated to allow <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance</b> operations, which may require a free charging zone for a given time slot, could also be applied to support merging maneuvers for on ramp vehicles...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn 2013, the Province of Potenza {{has adopted}} its provincial Master Plan, named Territorial Coordination Plan (TCP), that draws the local {{governmental}} proposals {{for the development}} of the provincial territory and, in particular, provides guidelines and support to the local actors (including Communities, private sector and Municipalities) for the correct land planning and use. Province of Potenza has territorial coordination competences over 100 Municipalities and is mostly characterized by all the mayor natural risks whose potential impacts on the community are very serious in case of disasters. For this reason, an important section of the TCP is dedicated to the risk assessment/management and to the mitigation activities as important actions to be performed also at the urban level. An innovative aspect developed in the TCP is the implementation of the “resilience of communities” policy in territorial planning, by introducing risks-mitigation directives and recommendations to be applied to the local and urban planning and strategic actions in order to involve the local actors, the private sector and the community itself in the resilience's implementation processes. The TCP gives some inputs to be followed by the Municipalities in their urban planning activities and Municipalities are asked to demonstrate how the urban planning proposals are resilient. For risks “active” mitigation at local level (namely the “structural” prevention), the Province will contribute - among the national/regional institutional framework - in seeking to promote or facilitate programs of territorial <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance</b> to be implemented by the local governments, through the identification of possible financial mechanisms and procedural facilitation.

40|$|The {{building}} named "San Nicola" {{belongs to}} the public building stock {{in the town of}} Vicenza (IT). It was built in the 15 th century and, after a major refurbishment, from 1999 it hosts the Department of Management and Engineering of the University of Padova (Italy). The core of the HVAC system is a gas engine driven heat pump, integrated with condensing boilers. The paper illustrates how, once the initial problems with the control and management strategies were solved, this system led to significant primary energy savings. Upon the offer from the local district heating (DH) provider for connecting the building to the DH network, an assessment was made to compare the existing plant to this solution. The connection to the DH network would have led to an increase in operational costs on one side and in primary energy consumption on the other hand, as described in a previous work by the authors. After about 10 years of operation, while facing the need for some major maintenance both on the mechanical and the control side, the engine half-life is forthcoming. The general service office of the University of Padova, instead of the half-life maintenance, is considering a replacement of the entire generation system with a traditional electric chiller for summer cooling and the uninterrupted use of condensing boilers for winter heating. It is then worthwhile to compare, on the economic side at first and then from the energetic point of view, the present solution and the option for the future. The comparison has been based on the measured consumptions of the past years and the additional cost for <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance</b> not included in the maintenance contract. The analysis proves that the choice of dismantling the actual plant is wrong, even accounting the complete renewal of the actual system with a new one of the same kind. If the loss of productivity - generated by the machine downtime in summertime - is evaluated in terms of an economic loss, the present and the future solutions are quite similar from the economic point of view...|$|E
40|$|The work is {{the result}} of a long {{research}} process that led to the realization of a BIM system starting from photogrammetric survey. Subject of the investigation is the main spire of Milan Cathedral. In particular, the work has evolved over four years following step by step the evolution of 3 D survey and modeling methodologies with particular attention to the “image based approaches”. This has enabled to produce a complete model of the spire and to create a prototype of BIM useful to manage the huge 3 D data together with images and information to be used during the restoration works. The proposed research was to explore the survey technologies in order to find the most appropriate, fast and low costs methodologies to virtualize a complex architectonic structure. Today (2013) the whole object 'Spire' is represented by a detailed and rich 3 D model that represent all marble constructive blocks, ornaments and decorations and also structural elements. The last research activity was aimed to create a WEB platform in order to visualize the model online and use it as base to collect information. The main aim was to converting the 3 D model from a static representation to a dynamic information tool capable to collect multi-disciplinary external data and to document changes over time. This lets to describe both the ‘status quo’ and the 'history' of alterations(from CAD 2 D to BIM 4 D). The continuous transformations and interventions of the structures can be visualized, explored and investigated directly on the 3 D model. The process of implementation of BIM is carried out in close contact with the “Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo” in order to identify the main processes and to develop an integrated system that helps to support step by step the restoration workflow and the ordinary and <b>extraordinary</b> <b>maintenance</b> of complex objects as the Spire. In particular attention was paid in creating a user friendly system to facilitate the collaboration between operators (in particular yard- technical office) that normally are not expert in 3 D technologies and database management. The system is built following the international standard both in the visualization module and in the information management part. In this way it can be easily updated because compatible with future technological development. Moreover all the BIM is built using free or low cost libraries. The visualization part and the connection tools with the modeling software are, in this way, ready to adapt the system for general CH cases.
