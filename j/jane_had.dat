5|$|In November 1827, Jane {{gave birth}} to Mary Prudentia Hogg after a {{difficult}} pregnancy. Mary Prudentia only lived 18 months, however, dying in May 1829. During Jane's pregnancy, Mary Shelley learned that <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> spoken openly of Percy Shelley's attraction to her and coolness towards Mary late in his life. These revelations significantly hurt Mary's feelings. Their friendship survived, however, and Mary Shelley {{was selected as the}} godmother of Jane's daughter Prudentia Sarah Jefferson Hogg in 1836.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{resignation}} from the Senate, Pierce {{had no intention}} of leaving public life. The move to Concord had given him more opportunities for cases, and allowed Jane a more robust community life. <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> remained in Concord with her young son Frank and her newborn Benjamin for the latter part of Pierce's Senate term, and this separation had taken a toll on the family. Pierce, meanwhile, had begun a demanding but lucrative law partnership with Asa Fowler during congressional recesses. Pierce returned to Concord in early 1842, and his reputation as a lawyer continued to flourish. Known for his gracious personality, eloquence, and excellent memory, Pierce would attract large audiences to hear him in court. He would often represent poor people for little or no compensation.|$|E
5|$|Once Sarah Jane has {{analysed}} {{that the}} Bane ingredient was sentient, she activates her computer, Mr Smith - after some shouting by Kelsey - and contacts Wormwood and politely requests that she leaves Earth. Wormwood refuses, and in retaliation takes {{control of the}} majority of the human race. Sarah Jane races to the factory, but cannot enter until she drives the bus into a wall. Wormwood reveals the Bane Mother, and explains the Archetype is a conglomerate of human DNA designed to be investigated so that Bubble Shock could be improved. The Archetype uses an alien communicator Sarah <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> been given, realising that the signal would be strong enough to kill the Bane Mother, and Sarah Jane, Maria, and the Archetype escape as the factory explodes.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is thought}} to have been {{completed}} as part of a set of paintings of Protestant martyrs. It was in the possession of a collector in Streatham, London, by the early 20th century. In December 2005 the portrait was examined by the art dealer Christopher Foley. He saw it as an accurate, though poorly executed, reproduction of a contemporary painting of <b>Jane,</b> <b>had</b> it verified and on that basis negotiated its sale. The work was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in London for a rumoured Â£100,000. The historian David Starkey was highly critical of the sale and challenged Foley's identifications.|$|E

5|$|On 10July, {{the same}} day as Jane's proclamation, a letter from Mary Tudor arrived in London, saying that she was now queen and {{demanding}} the obedience of the Council. Mary was assembling her supporters in East Anglia; it was decided to take the field against her after some discussion over who should go, in which Jane made sure that her father should not. The Duke of Northumberland marched to Cambridge with his troops and passed a week that saw no action, until he heard on 20July that the Council in London had declared for Mary. Northumberland now proclaimed Mary Tudor himself at the market-place and was arrested the next morning. On 19July, a few hours before Queen Mary I's proclamation in London, the baptism of one of the Gentlemen Pensioners' children took place. <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> agreed to be the godmother and wished the child's name to be Guildford. The Bishop of Winchester, Stephen Gardiner, who had been imprisoned in the Tower for five years, took great offence at this fact as he heard of it.|$|E
5|$|Osborn had {{assembled}} {{a team of}} supervillains, which included Gargan, newly bonded with the Venom symbiote. However, Mary <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> contacted SHIELD, and the villains were faced not only by Spider-Man, but the combined might of Captain America, Iron Man, Yellowjacket, Daredevil and the Fantastic Four. During the fracas, the Green Goblin manages to escape and kidnap Mary Jane Watson, taking her to the George Washington Bridge in order to replay his murder of Gwen Stacy. However, a drugged Doctor Octopus intervenes, attacking the Green Goblin. Spider-Man is able to save Mary Jane after {{a bolt of lightning}} sends the two villains into the river. Following some verbal clues from the Green Goblin, Peter also discovers where he had hidden Aunt May, and rescues her as well. It is revealed that Osborn sent Peter a letter before the fight, thanking Peter for giving his life meaning and purpose, but Peter never received the letter due to moving from his residence. After this battle, Osborn attempts to escape to Paris, but is apprehended by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the accused}} witches, Jane Southworth, was the widow of the disinherited son, John. Relations between John and his father {{do not seem to}} have been amicable; {{according}} to a statement made by John Singleton, in which he referred to Sir John as his [...] "old Master", Sir John refused even to pass his son's house if he could avoid it, and believed that Jane would probably kill her husband. Jane Southworth (nÃ©e Sherburne) and John were married in about 1598, and the couple lived in Samlesbury Lower Hall. <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> been widowed only a few months before her trial for witchcraft in 1612, and had seven children.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, Vonnegut's {{personal}} life was disintegrating. His wife <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> embraced Christianity, which was contrary to Vonnegut's atheistic beliefs, and with five of their six children having left home, Vonnegut {{said the two}} were forced to find [...] "other sorts of seemingly important work to do." [...] The couple battled over their differing beliefs until Vonnegut moved from their Cape Cod home to New York in 1971. Vonnegut called the disagreements [...] "painful", and said the resulting split was a [...] "terrible, unavoidable accident that we were ill-equipped to understand." [...] The couple divorced and they remained friends until Jane's death in late 1986. Beyond his marriage, he was deeply affected when his son Mark suffered a mental breakdown in 1972, which exacerbated Vonnegut's chronic depression, and led him to take Ritalin. When he stopped taking the drug in the mid-1970s, he began to see a psychologist weekly.|$|E
500|$|Jane was {{a devout}} Protestant during the English Reformation, when the Church of England violently {{rejected}} {{the authority of}} the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. Known for her piety and education, she corresponded with Protestant leaders in Continental Europe, such as Heinrich Bullinger. A modest person who dressed plainly, her last words before her execution are reported as [...] "Lord, into thy hands I commend my spirit!" [...] Jane's execution by a Catholic queen made her into what the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography terms a [...] "Protestant martyr", {{and by the end of}} the century <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> become, in the words of the historian Eric Ives, [...] "a Protestant icon". Depictions of Jane in the 16th and 17th centuries, such as in John Foxe's Actes and Monuments (1563), published after Protestant Elizabeth took the throne, [...] "presented [...] as primarily a figure in a national narrative about an elect nation possessed of a pure Protestant faith which had risen supreme over Catholic Europe".|$|E
500|$|Shortly thereafter, General Electric (GE) hired Vonnegut as a {{publicist}} for the company's Schenectady, New York research laboratory. Although the job required a college degree, Vonnegut was hired after claiming {{to hold a}} master's degree in anthropology from the University of Chicago. His brother Bernard had worked at GE since 1945, contributing significantly to an iodine-based cloud seeding project. In 1949, Kurt and <b>Jane</b> <b>had</b> a daughter named Edith. Still working for GE, Vonnegut had his first piece, titled [...] "Report on the Barnhouse Effect", published in the February 11, 1950 issue of Collier's, for which he received $750. Vonnegut wrote another story, after being coached by the fiction editor at Collier's, Knox Burger, and again sold it to the magazine, this time for $950. Burger suggested he quit GE, a course he had contemplated before. Vonnegut moved {{with his family to}} Cape Cod, Massachusetts to write full-time, and left GE in 1951.|$|E
