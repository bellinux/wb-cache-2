The former process {{is of particular interest}} because of the slow convergence evident from the three known terms of its QCD series, which begins with an O(α 2 s) leading-order term. The O(α 5 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> to the H → gg rate is expressed as a degree- 3 polynomial in L ≡ ln(µ 2 /m 2 t(µ)). We find that asymptotic Padé-approximant predictions for the coefficients of L, L 2, and L 3 are respectively within 1 %, 2 %, and 7 % of true values extracted via renormalization-group methods. Upon including the full set of next-order coefficients, the H → gg rate is found to be virtually scale-independent over the 0. 3 MH < ∼ µ < ∼ Mt range of the renormalization scale-parameter µ. We conclude by discussing the small O(α 4 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> to the H → b ¯ b rate, which is obtained from a prior asymptotic Padé-approximant estimate of the O(α 4 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> to the quark-antiquark scalar-current correlation function. 1...|$|R

We find that the asymptotic Padé pre-m 2 t (µ) dictions for the renormalization-group accessible coefficients of L, L 2 and L 3 are within 1 %, 2 % and 7 % of their respective values. The inclusion of the O(α 5 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> renders the full decay rate virtually scale independent over the entire 0. 3 MH ≤ µ ≤ Mt range of the renormalization scale µ...|$|R
