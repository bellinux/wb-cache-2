500|$|... "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] an [...] "A+." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] "one {{of those}} deliciously dense episodes {{in which the}} nourishment of revelation is mixed with huge chunks of sugary intrigue" [...] and speculated that the scene in which Alex is executed will be [...] "sitting very high on this ranking of all-time pivotal Lost moments" [...] by the series' May 2010 end. [...] Before the season finale aired, Jensen ranked this as the second best moment {{of the season and}} put the scene in which the monster attacks the mercenaries in ninth place. [...] Dan Kois and Lane Brown of New York magazine thought that this [...] "episode didn't exactly feel like the usual moderately paced, secret-revealing drama Lost usually is; it felt like an action movie... it was like watching Die Hard on an island". [...] Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9.3/10, concluding that [...] "if 'The Shape of Things to Come' is any indication of the level of quality that [...] should expect <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> <b>out</b> then we are in for some incredible storytelling" [...] and [...] "Alex's death will probably be remembered as one of the more pivotal scenes in the entire series [...] it is such a phenomenally shot, edited and acted moment... it would be incredibly hard not to feel for [...] here." [...] Upon grading the best episodes of the first five seasons, the episode ranked second, beating episodes like [...] "Through the Looking Glass" [...] and the pilot and losing to [...] "The Constant." [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad summed up [...] "The Shape of Things to Come" [...] as [...] "a brilliant episode... tons of action, several big revelations, and more questions to ponder". [...] Don Williams of BuddyTV decided that the episode was [...] "worth waiting five weeks for" [...] and [...] "so jam packed that I need to give my brain time to rest". [...] Williams's colleague Oscar Dahl ranked the scene in which Alex is killed as the fifth best moment of the season, noting that [...] "it was perfectly paced... and provided a huge shock... and some of the best acting you'll ever see". [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post wrote that [...] "'The Shape of Things to Come' was the perfect episode to get everyone back into the swing of Lost. [...] It wasn't a [...] à la 'The Constant'. [...] It was an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride, which to me matched the 'Pilot' bombastic grandeur".|$|E
