50|$|This {{requirement}} {{is referred to}} as the principle of 'specialty' and is intended to ensure that a state cannot seek the surrender of a person for an extraditable offence whilst intending to prosecute that person for a non-extraditable offence once surrendered, or extradite the surrendered person to a third state for an offence which would not have been extraditable offence from the original <b>executing</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Governor is {{the chief}} {{executive}} of the state's government. He or she is responsible for upholding the Alabama Constitution and <b>executing</b> <b>state</b> law. The Governor is elected by popular election every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no limit on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. George Wallace holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.|$|E

50|$|Note, however, that RTC {{does not}} mean that a state machine has to monopolize the CPU until the RTC step is complete. The {{preemption}} restriction only applies to the task context of the state machine that is already busy processing events. In a multitasking environment, other tasks (not related to the task context of the busy state machine) can be running, possibly preempting the currently <b>executing</b> <b>state</b> machine. As long as other state machines do not share variables or other resources with each other, there are no concurrency hazards.|$|E
30|$|Simulations {{running on}} grid nodes receive the <b>executing</b> <b>state.</b> The jobs being edited {{by the user}} have the editing state. After edition, the first job can be scheduled, but {{subsequent}} jobs must wait (waiting state). Jobs receive the ready state when the job ends its execution and the user accepts it.|$|E
40|$|Software {{deployment}} {{process is a}} sequence of related activities for installing an already developed application into its target environment, and bringing it into an <b>executing</b> <b>state.</b> For complex component-based applications that should be deployed into a large distributed environment, several deployment configurations are typically possible. These deployment configurations can have significant impacts on the application’s quality of service properties such as reliability. In distributed systems, {{the reliability of the}} application is highly dependent on the reliability of its network, and network failures can have adverse effects on the application’s reliability. Thus, one possible way to increase the reliability of a distributed component-based application is to deploy it so that the communications among its components are done as local as possible. In this paper, a graph-based deployment planning approach is proposed for this purpose...|$|E

40|$|We present ADDSEN {{middleware}} as {{a holistic}} solution for Adaptive Data processing and dissemination for Drone swarms in urban SENsing. To efficiently process sensed {{data in the}} middleware, we have proposed a cyber-physical sensing framework using partially ordered knowledge sharing for distributed knowledge management in drone swarms. A reinforcement learning dissemination strategy is implemented in the framework. ADDSEN uses online learning techniques to adaptively balance the broadcast rate and knowledge loss rate periodically. The learned broadcast rate is adapted by <b>executing</b> <b>state</b> transitions {{during the process of}} online learning. A strategy function guides state transitions, incorporating a set of variables to reflect changes in link status. In addition, we design a cooperative dissemination method for the task of balancing storage and energy allocation in drone swarms. We implemented ADDSEN in our cyber-physical sensing framework, and evaluation results show that it can achieve both maximal adaptive data processing and dissemination performance, presenting better results than other commonly used dissemination protocols such as periodic, uniform and neighbor protocols in both single-swarm and multi-swarm cases...|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of Alma (a system for program {{visualization}} and algorithm animation), we use an internal representation - based {{on the concept of}} an attributed abstract syntax tree decorated with attribute values, a DAST - to associate (static) figures to grammar rules (productions) and to step over program dynamics <b>executing</b> <b>state</b> changes in order to perform its animation. We do not rely upon any source program annotations (visual/animation statements, or parameters), neither on any special visual data types. On account of such principle, the approach becomes source language independent. It means that we can apply the same visualizer and animator, that is the Alma's back-end, to different programming languages; all that we need is di erent front-ends to parse each program into the DAST we use. In this paper we discuss Alma design goals and architecture, and we present the two mappings that associate to productions figures and rewriting rules to systematically draw a visual representation (exhibiting data and control flow) of a given source program and to animate its execution...|$|E
40|$|The {{political}} {{integration in}} the EU, made {{the rules of the}} mutual legal assistance insufficient. The old model of mutual assistance was replaced approaching the judicial cooperation within the EU to the cooperation between judges from the same State. For this purpose it was necessary to find a balance between unification and diversity. The selective interoperability between the diverse legal systems of the Member States was the {{solution to the problem of}} the fragmentation of the criminal Justice in the European Union. Not all the judicial decisions are interoperable, but only those that were defined as equivalent resolutions in the European common rules. In this system the recognition is widely guaranteed by establishing a compulsory distribution of the competences between executing and issuing judicial authorities, preventing the examination of the internal aspects and basis of the issued resolution by the judge of the <b>executing</b> <b>State,</b> and establishing a strong limitation of the grounds for refusal and of the elements that can be considered by the executing judge. All this together with some limited possibilities offered to the States to reduce the impact of the mutual recognition to protect the national legal identity...|$|E
