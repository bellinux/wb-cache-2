40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to clarify the characteristics and defining factors of the recovery from the " 2000 Dzud (snow damages)," which occurred in three consecutive years from the end of 1999 to 2001. The distinctive features of the " 2000 Dzud" are that the devastating Dzud occurred in three consecutive years and that serious damage was caused, mainly to large livestock. The state of recovery from the 2000 Dzud is characteristic in that, although the total number of livestock recovered to its pre-Dzud level in 2006, four years after the event, large livestock were slow to recover their numbers and the increase in the total number of livestock was solely dependent on the increase of the goat population. The state of recovery is defined by the degree and extent of the Dzud <b>damage</b> (<b>Note</b> 12), and natura 1 and technical factors including the breeding characteristics of livestock. Among other factors pointed out are the teclmical factors including the relative advantage of cashmere production, and individual factors including differences in the impact of the Dzud damage, differences in the situation of the maintenance of the labor force and property acquisition, and differences in expenditures for family members. Large livestock are slow to recover their numbers, presumably because of their breeding characteristics. Also, behind the change in the composition of livestock is a decrease in the demand for large livestock as a result of the shift of transportation means to automobiles and other vehicles, and the change in the demand for livestock products as typified by cashmere. Goats and sheep have been increasing relatively rapidly because of their shorter gestation period compared with larger livestock. In addition, backed by a strong demand for cashmere, goats marked a notable increase due to an effort to make up for the decline in the sales of other livestock. Considering the price slump of cashmere (Note 13) and the small demand for goat meat, the number of goats may decrease. However. as more importance is placed on the economic efficiency of livestock after the shift to a market economy, the recovery in livestock numbers after the Dzud seems to assume a role to facilitate the scrap-and-build system of livestock species...|$|E

5000|$|<b>Damaged</b> <b>notes</b> {{are still}} usable {{so long as}} they are recognisable. In particular, the {{legibility}} of the note's serial numbers is important. The Reserve Bank website notes that {{as a rule of thumb}} if there is more than half a bank note they will pay its full value. In practise banks may pay a quarter of the value for every visible denomination figure on the note, of which there are four. For instance, if a $5 note is ripped in half vertically, two [...] "5" [...] symbols will still be visible on each half, and the amount exchanged will be $2.50 for each half. To receive payment people can return in the note to any commercial bank or the Reserve Bank in Wellington.|$|R

25|$|August 15–17, 1915: A {{hurricane}} made landfall {{just west}} of Galveston. Gales howled throughout Cameron and Vermilion Parishes and as far east as Mobile. It produced storm surge of 11 feet at Cameron (called Leesburg at the time), 10 feet at Grand Cheniere, and 9.5 feet at Marsh Island; Grand Isle reported water 6 feet deep across the city. The lightkeeper at the Sabine Pass lighthouse had to turn the lens by hand, as vibrations caused by the wave action put the clockwork out of order. At Sabine Bank, 17 miles offshore the Mouth of the Sabine, <b>damage</b> was <b>noted.</b> <b>Damage</b> estimates for Louisiana and Texas totaled around $50 million.|$|R

30|$|Our {{study also}} {{involves}} a significantly younger age group than most prior reports. It has been hypothesized that a medial plica may become prominent during the adolescent growth spurt as the extensor mechanism tightens [33]. Prior studies are primarily limited to small retrospective case series in older patients with shorter follow-up [11, 13, 14, 15, 34]. Guney et al. [6] evaluated {{the results of}} plica excision in 76 patients with chondral <b>damage</b> <b>noted</b> {{at the time of}} arthroscopy. They noted a 95  % excellent rate of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) score at 6 -month follow-up [6]. Uysal et al. [17] reported on plica resection in 23 knees {{with a mean age of}} 42 years (range 23 – 60). In their series, 16 / 23 patients had chondral changes on the medial femoral condyle and significant clinical improvement was noted in Lysholm knee scores at an average follow-up of 21  months [17].|$|R
40|$|Kevlar- 49 fairing panels, {{installed}} as flight service components on three L- 1011 s, were inspected after four years' service, {{and found to}} be performing satisfactorily. The Kevlar- 49 components were all found to be performing satisfactorily in service with no major problems, or any condition requiring corrective action. The only defects noted were minor impact damage, and a minor degree of fastener hole fraying and elongation. These {{are for the most}} part comparable to <b>damage</b> <b>noted</b> on fiberglass fairings. A concurrent investigation was conducted on Kevlar- 49 /epoxy coupons exposed to an outdoor environment over a three year period at various locations providing a variety of climatic conditions. Weight changes and retention of mechanical properties were determined after one and three years exposure. A net weight loss occurred due to ultraviolet effects on the unpainted specimens. Mechanical property retentions were satisfactory with most specimens retaining well over 80 % of their original value...|$|R
50|$|The {{bridge was}} closed between May and July 1987 after three {{suspender}} cables (connecting the deck to the overhead suspension cable) failed. All of the suspender cables were X-rayed during the closure, {{and the three}} suspender cables, along with three neighboring suspender cables were replaced, with some <b>damage</b> <b>noted</b> to all suspender cables. A draft root cause investigation identified the potential for fatigue and corrosion damage in the overhead suspension cables. The final root cause concluded in 1990 that the suspender cables had failed in fatigue {{at the top of}} the socket connector to the bridge deck. Since the fatigue was caused by swaying in the overhead suspension cables relative to the bridge deck, all suspender cables were potentially vulnerable to fatigue failure. The most cost-effective repair that would maintain the aesthetic appearance of the current structure was complete replacement of the suspender cables on a periodic basis (estimated at 20-25 years).|$|R
50|$|The track {{then moved}} into Tennessee and {{continued}} south of Huntland. Isolated and minor EF0 tree <b>damage</b> was <b>noted</b> {{at the intersection}} of John Hunter Highway (State Route 122) and Limestone Road near the Lincoln/Franklin county line. More significant <b>damage</b> was <b>noted,</b> starting about 1.4 mi south southwest of Huntland. A cinder block building suffered damage to its flat adobe roof, with some of blocks near the roof (around 20 ft off of the ground) pushed out, resulting in EF2 damage. Surveyors could not directly examine the roof given this building was on the highest ground in the vicinity. Nearby, a single-family home of cinder block construction had its roof totally removed, with another home about 1000 ft away having significant roof damage, with over one half of its roof removed, and some shifting off of its foundation. Damage with the latter was consistent with high-end EF2 damage. A chicken building with metal girding near the second home was completely flattened, consistent with EF2 damage. A farm complex south of Hickory Grove road had damage to a number of structures there. The home and the main car garage had part of their roofs removed. A barn that was protecting bales of hay was destroyed, with a few of bales blown from 100-200 feet from their original location. The worst <b>damage</b> was <b>noted</b> with low-end EF3 damage to a well-built cinder block utility building about 200 ft south of the primary residence. Most of its roof was removed, with over half of its downwind wall pushed outward. An older barn nearby suffered lesser EF0 damage to it roof, while the top half of a silo near that barn was missing. Another barn structure was completely destroyed northwest of the primary home. The width at this point was approximately 1/4 mile. Other <b>damage</b> was <b>noted</b> near the intersection of Hickory Grove Road and Sugar Cove Road, with EF1 damage to some heavy farm equipment and EF0 roof damage to a nearby barn. Scattered trees were downed to the northeast, with 8 in fence posts 18 in deep pulled up near Hickory Grove and Buncombe Road. There was evidence the tornado continued toward mountains a few miles further east before dissipating, with some trees damaged along the ridge.|$|R
