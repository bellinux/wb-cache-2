40|$|Intimate partner {{violence}} (IPV) is {{a complex}} issue. The present study explored how media exposure to female and male victims of IPV affected participants’ support for both groups. It was hypothesized that female victims would be supported more than male victims and that presenting stimuli that <b>drew</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> male victims would not decrease support for female victims. Participants were presented with one of three posters, <b>drawing</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> male victims, female victims, or both. A questionnaire was then used to assess perceptions of support for IPV victims, which was completed by 121 participants. Results indicated that females were supported more than males and that <b>drawing</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> male victims <b>did</b> not decrease participants’ support for female victims. An exploratory analysis also revealed that women, overall, have high support for all victims, while men’s level of support changed {{depending on the type}} of information to which they were exposed...|$|R

The death John Hughes chose was by head-on collision, also killing the driver of the other vehicle. The suicide seemed {{to be the result of}} an argument with his girlfriend. The flight to Washington DC which the elder Hughes made was not an attempt at suicide but it was inspired by the power of uncompromising but misguided dedication. Hughes told the Tampa Bay Times, [...] "He paid far too high a price for an unimportant issue, but if youre willing to take a risk, the ultimate risk, <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> something that <b>does</b> have significance, its worth doing." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{reading of}} the fathering discourses in the Canadian {{equality}} feminist communities and the profeminist fathering communities reveals conflicting interests and beliefs, despite a shared goal of "gender equality. " This thesis argues that identity conflict theory, most often applied to intractable ethnic and religious conflict, is relevant to the epistemological conflict between equality feminist and profeminist fathering communities. Further to this, it is demonstrated that {{the literature on the}} reconciliation of identity conflict can illuminate the challenges and potential for the uptake of a feminist research model focused on reconciliation of this gender-based conflict. Movement along the path toward a reconciliation approach can be seen within equality feminist research communities. The use of a peace and conflict lens to examine gender conflict in Canada <b>draws</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> work being <b>done</b> by reconciliation scholars. This work may provide a map for forward movement toward the reconciliation of gender issues...|$|R

A {{special meeting}} {{was held on}} the 11 th February, 1929, at the Society's Rooms, Tasmanian Museum, Hobart, the President of the Society, Sir James O'Grady, K. C. M. G., presiding. The Chairman of the Council (Dr. A. H. Clarke, M. R. C. S., L. R. C. P.) stated that the meeting had been called in order to bid {{farewell}} to Major L. F.

40|$|Research on curiosity has {{undergone}} 2 waves of intense activity. The 1 st, in the 1960 s, focused mainly on curiosity's psychological underpinnings. The 2 nd, in the 1970 s and 1980 s, {{was characterized by}} attempts to measure curiosity and assess its dimensionality. This article reviews these contributions with a concentration on the 1 st wave. It is argued that theoretical accounts of curiosity proposed during the 1 st period fell short in 2 areas: They did not offer an adequate explanation for why people voluntarily seek out curiosity, and they failed to delineate situational determinants of curiosity. Furthermore, these accounts <b>did</b> not <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to,</b> and thus <b>did</b> not explain, certain salient characteristics of curiosity: its intensity, transience, association with impulsivity, and tendency to disappoint when satisfied. A new account of curiosity is offered that attempts to address these shortcomings. The new account interprets curiosity {{as a form of}} cognitively induced deprivation that arises from the perception of a gap in knowledge or understanding. Curiosity is the most superficial of all the affections; it changes its object perpetually; it has an appetite which is very sharp, but very easily satisfied; and it has always an appearance of giddiness, restlessness and anxiety.

40|$|Stieg Larsson {{has reached}} vast audiences with his popular, page-turning crime novels, the Millennium Series. The series {{tells a story}} not just for fictional purposes, but <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what people <b>did</b> not see about the society that Larsson lived in. In 2009, local actors starred in a film {{adaptation}} of Larsson’s first novel, which went beyond the Swedish public. In December 2011 an English-language remake {{based on the same}} bestseller was released, starring famous Hollywood actors. Considering language can hinder the reach of foreign language movies in international markets and that international and Swedish audiences demands differ, the current research aims to find out how the two movie adaptations diverge in terms of gender representation, production, graphic content, ideological meaning, and cultural representation as they attempt to target their respective audiences. In order to find answers, this thesis adopted a qualitative approach using two different, supporting methods. First a semiotic analysis of a representative scene with a high psychological and graphic impact on the viewer in both movies was conducted. Second, focus group interviews, with International and Swedish audience members, were conducted. The findings suggest that considerable differences exist between the two movies and that audiences have a different pre-conception in the way they perceive the same media product: gender role dynamic has been reversed in the two movies, the American version is more graphic in its display of nudity, and lacks the ideological layer. Furthermore, this study can serve as a basis for future research that could try to statistically represent the way Swedish and international moviegoers draw on the two adaptations...|$|R
40|$|O presente ensaio trata de um resgate do tema ïmagens da infância e da adolescência em Otto Lara Resende. ̈ Para tanto, no cinqüentenário de seu lançamento, destacamos Boca do inferno, segundo livro da obra do autor mineiro. Composto de sete contos, ele o livro - torna-se nosso substrato para a apreensão da vida de um grupo de crianças e adolescentes marcados pela dor. Nas imagens que se oferecem, intimismo, introspecção, recôndito definem um estilo. No trato da mesma infância, o pacto romântico se quebra. Crianças e adolescentes recebem o mal e estão aptos (alguns deles) a praticá-lo e de modo competente. No menos explícito das cenas, a estrutura {{familiar}} em suas falhas se evidencia. O masculino que brutaliza também recebe especial atenção. A voz solidária aos que sofrem oculta-se na ação do narrador. This essay rescues {{the theme}} Ïmages of the Childhood {{and of the}} Adolescence in Otto Lara Resende. ̈ In order <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that, when we celebrate fifty {{years after it was}} published, we <b>draw</b> the <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> Boca <b>do</b> Inferno (Hellś mouth), second book of the work of the author from the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais. Made up of seven short stories, it becomes our basis for the understanding of the life of a group of children and adolescents tainted by pain. In the images that are offered, intimism, instrospection, recondite define a style. In the way the author creates the circumstances of the same childhood, the romantic pact is broken. Children and adolescents receive the evil and are apt (some of them) to practice it in a very competent way. The evidence of the failure of the family structure is implicit in the scenes. The masculine that brutalizes also receives special attention. The voice that is sympathetic to those who suffer is in between the lines of the narrator...|$|R
40|$|The {{health crisis}} which {{in recent years}} has {{depleted}} the ranks of the art community, has not received much formal notice in art education journals. A continuing stigma remains attached to AIDS due to its appearance among gay men and IV drug users. Many people pretend it is not there. My own life has become consumed by it, due to the illness of many, many friends and associates. For nearly two years, because of the enormity of the crisis combined with relatively little action on state and federal levels and the mounting grief and loss in my own life, I began to feel that art education is a silly field contributing very little to society in general and contributing nothing to end this awful disease. I decided, despite my advanced age and status at the university, to work on a nursing degree and leave teaching, finger paint and clay to other people. In nursing, I found an advancing technological approach to treating human organisms, not human beings. Wanting to work with people, I switched to social work. In the meantime, I have been volunteering on the National AIDS Hotline, handing diverse: crisis calls ranging from suicide threats to education about the virus and its effects. I have also volunteered to spend time with the dying at the Brownlie Hospice, in a move <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something else very concrete. I may still complete mv MSW degree to work with PWAs (People with AIDS) as a professional social worker. Curiously, however, this mid-life career crisis hits led to a re-evaluation of the importance of art and art education in the lives of every person I know including myself. As with the dying themselves, there seems little time for game playing and intellectual gymnastics. Our human limitations, our financial constraints and the unrelenting, destructive, lethal character of this particular virus, form a metaphor <b>drawing</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> why we <b>do</b> what we do and why it matters...|$|R
40|$|My {{research}} broadly has two strands. The first {{has contributed}} to work on young children’s use of representational practices, showing how children’s drawing activities are grounded in intention and meaning-making in social contexts. In <b>drawing</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what children <b>do</b> and how they actively use visual representation it added new insights to theoretical work on learning in a socio-cultural framework where learning is understood as participation in social practices; as joint activity, mediated by other people and cultural activities and artefacts. The second strand was based in these understandings of learning but explored, and also developed communicative practices in classrooms and children’s role in decision-making. The research investigated {{the extent of the}} children’s democratic engagement {{and the development of a}} more democratically participatory space where they can exercise agency both as learners and as participants in democratic communities. This work also contributed in new ways to children’s agency as researchers. I argue that these two strands are inter-related, a position also represented in my sole-authored book (Cox 2011). In relation to development in pedagogical practices across important areas of teachers’ work, including classroom interaction and communication, curriculum and assessment, I argue in this book that principles can be based in socio-cultural ways of theorising learning, as well as in democratic values, suggesting more ‘participative’ (empowered) participation. Using research evidence and argument I show how changes in classroom practices can be appropriated by conventional theorisations of learning (person-to-person accounts) and existing cultures of ‘schooling’, limiting children’s learning. I explore the tensions that arise, especially in a wider context of performance-driven, market-led policies. An underlying theme is that a shift towards socio-cultural understandings of learning might help to resolve these tensions and achieve changes in practices in possibly transformative ways, creating a more educational culture and embracing the idea of children as agents of cultural change. I aim, in the commentary, to convey the thematic connections and contributions across my work in relation to my role as teacher educator as well as researcher...|$|R
40|$|The {{central focus}} of the thesis is Alice Arnold (1881 - 1955), women's {{organiser}} for the Workers' Union in Coventry between 1917 and 1931 and Labour councillor on Coventry City Council from 1919. The adoption of a local, biographical approach highlights the need to move beyond generalisations about 'Labour women' and encourages examination of the diverse political experiences of women who worked within trade unionism and municipal labour politics in interwar Britain. Within the context of Coventry's early twentieth century industrial and political development, Arnold's politicisation is explored and her experiences {{compared with those of}} men and women activists who worked in the industrial and political wings of the Coventry Labour movement. Additionally material that allows comparisons to be made with national figures as well as those from other localities is employed. As well as emphasising the influence of factors including gender, class and political affiliation upon Arnold's position within the male dominated labour movement between the wars, there is consideration of the effect that her status as a single woman had upon her career. The thesis advances what is known about the development of regional labour politics and emphasises the effects that local political, economic and social factors had upon both the involvement of women and on the attitudes of male colleagues towards women's participation. The study is situated within a tradition of feminist history that seeks not merely <b>to</b> <b>draw</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> what women <b>did</b> but questions their motivations for doing it and how they were able to pursue their political ambitions. Through analysis of a range of primary sources, it examines the effects that gendered perceptions and sexist stereotypes had on the ways in which women were able to work within trade unionism and municipal politics. It places women's interests first in an area of history that has traditionally been dominated by accounts of men's involvement and it challenges the construction of historical accounts that have ignored or marginalised women. The influence of masculine epistemology on the ways in which women's political work has been recorded both nationally and at a local level is examined throughout the thesis...|$|R
