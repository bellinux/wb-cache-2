40|$|A {{soft metal}} with low wear {{resistance}} (6000 series aluminum), {{was used to}} minimize run time while maximizing wear rate. Two paddle configurations were tested, with the first four paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles. The first configuration was all <b>flat</b> <b>paddles,</b> with the first paddle not aligned with the augers and is consistent with present SPF mixer. The second configuration had helical paddles {{for the first three}} stages after the augers and a <b>flat</b> <b>paddle</b> at the fourth stage. The first helical paddle was aligned with the auger flight for the second configuration. The all <b>flat</b> <b>paddle</b> configuration wear rate was approximately double the wear rate of the helical paddles for the first two sets of paddles after the augers. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on the third and fourth paddle sets based on mass change, indicating that the fully wetted premix materials are much less abrasive than the un-wetted or partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles at higher magnification showed the <b>flat</b> <b>paddles</b> were worn much more than the helical and is consistent with the wear rates. Aligning the auger discharge flight with the first set of helical paddles was effective in reducing the wear rate as compared to the <b>flat</b> <b>paddle</b> configuration. Changing the <b>paddle</b> configuration from <b>flat</b> to helical resulted in a slight increase in rheological properties. Although, both tests produced grout-like material that is within the processing rage of the SPF, {{it should be noted that}} cement is not included in the premix and water was used rather than salt solution, which does affect the rheology of the fresh grout. The higher rheological properties from the helical wear test are most likely due to the reduced number of shearing paddles in the mixer. In addition, there is variation in the rheological data for each wear test. This is most likely due to the way that the dry feeds enter the mixer from the dry feeder.

40|$|Locomotion of animals, {{whether by}} running, flying, {{swimming}} or crawling, {{is crucial to}} their survival. The natural environments they encounter are complex containing fluid, solid or yielding substrates. These environments are often uneven and inclined, {{which can lead to}} slipping during footsteps presenting great locomotor challenges. Many animals have specialized appendages for locomotion allowing them to adapt to their environmental conditions. Aquatically adapted animals have fins and flippers to swim through the water, however, some species use their paddle-like appendages to walk on yielding terrestrial substrates like the beach. Beach sand, a granular medium, behaves like a solid or a fluid when stress is applied. Principles of legged locomotion on yielding substrates remain poorly understood, largely {{due to the lack of}} fundamental understanding of the complex interactions of body/limbs with these substrates on the level of the Navier-Stokes Equations for fluids. Understanding of the limb-ground interactions of aquatic animals that utilize terrestrial environments can be applied to the ecology and conservation of these species, as well as enhance construction of man-made devices. In this dissertation, we studied the locomotion of hatchling loggerhead sea turtles on granular media integrating biological, robotic, and physics studies to discover principles that govern fin and flipper locomotion on flowing/yielding media. Hatchlings in the field modified their limb use depending on substrate compaction. On soft sand they bent their wrist to utilize the solid features of sand, whereas on hard ground they used a rigid flipper and claw to clasp asperities during forward motion. A sea turtle inspired physical model in the laboratory was used to test detailed kinematics of fin and flipper locomotion on granular media. Coupling of adequate step distance, body lift and thrust generation allowed the robot to move successfully forward avoiding previously disturbed ground.

40|$|The Saltstone Production Facility has a 10 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous}} mixer that mixes the premix dry feeds and low-level waste salt solution to make fresh (uncured) saltstone. Inspection of the mixer in January 2013 showed significant wear on the third, {{fourth and fifth}} paddle pairs after the conveying augers. A 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto {{continuous mixer}} {{was used to test}} alternate paddle configurations for use in the 10 -inch mixer to decrease the wear rate on the paddles. Two wear tests were conducted to investigate a method of reducing wear on the mixer paddles. The first test (wear test 2 a) had a paddle configuration similar to the currently installed 10 -inch mixer in the SPF. This test established baseline wear. The second test (wear test 2 b) had a reconfigured paddle arrangement that replaced the <b>flat</b> <b>paddles</b> with helical paddles for paddle pairs 2 � 6 and aligned paddle pair 1 with the augers. The intent of the reconfiguration was to more effectively convey the partially wetted dry feeds through the transition region and into the liquid feed where paddle wear is reduced due to dry feeds and salt solution being mixed at the intended water to premix ratio. The design of the helical paddles provides conveyance through the transition region to the liquid feed inlet. The alignment with the auger is aimed to provide a smoother transition (minimizing the discontinuity between the auger and paddle pair 1) into the downstream paddles. A soft metal with low wear resistance (6000 series aluminum) was used for the wear testing paddles to determine wear patterns while minimizing run time and maximizing wear rate. For the two paddle configurations tested using the scaled 2 -inch Readco-Kurimoto continuous mixer, with the first six paddles after the augers replaced by the wear paddles and the remaining paddles were stainless steel. Since the 10 -inch SPF mixer is designed with the liquid inlet centered over paddle pairs 5 and 6, the scaled 2 -inch mixer was configured the same way. The wear rate from wear test 2 a was approximately double the wear rate from wear test 2 b for paddle pairs 4 and 5. For both configurations, there was little or no wear on paddle pairs 1, 2, 3 and 6 based on mass change, indicating that the un-wetted and fully wetted premix materials cause less wear than the partially wetted premix. Additionally, inspection of the wear surface of the paddles showed more deformation on the <b>flat</b> <b>paddles</b> than the helical paddles which was consistent with the wear rates. Aligning of the auger discharge flight with paddle pair 1 resulted in a lower wear rate paddle pair 1 rather than having them misaligned with the feed augers. During the paddle wear tests, polishing wear was observed on the inside barrel of the mixer. The polishing wear is evident on the upper housing clamshell and the lower housing clamshell primarily at paddle pairs 4 and 5, which is the transition region of the mixer. Wear on the mixer barrel increases the space between the paddles and the barrel, resulting in increased grout build up on the barrel. Since the mixer barrel cannot be reconfigured or replaced in the SPF, the method for mitigating wear on the barrel is to move the more viscous grout through the transition region as quickly as possible. In addition, the location of the liquid inlet does not allow for sufficient cleaning of the mixer since residual grout remains on paddle pairs 1 � 4. As the paddles continue to wear and the self-cleaning capability of the paddles is lost, the lack of sufficient flushing would aid in grout build up between the barrel and the paddles which could eventually lead to decreased throughput capacity of the dry feeds. Changing the <b>paddle</b> configuration from <b>flat</b> to helical resulted in no change to the rheological properties of the grout mixture. Both tests produced a grout that is within the processing range of the SPF. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended for the currently installed SPF mixer that paddle pairs 1 through 6 be helical rather than <b>flat,</b> with the <b>paddle</b> pair 1 aligned with the feed augers in order to minimize the wear occurring in the SPF mixer. Based on the results of this testing, it is recommended that the mixer be inspected and critical measurements be taken whenever the SPF processing schedule allows in order to establish a wear rate of the 10 -inch mixer paddles. 5 Based on these measurements, the lifetime of paddles in the transition region can be established in order to set up a maintenance schedule for the mixer. Since replacing the entire mixer is very expensive and time intensive, replacing the worn paddles after a specific time period would allow for planned shutdowns as well as process optimization such that the mixer throughput is not compromised. In addition, further testing should be performed to determine an alternate liquid inlet location to better flush the mixer of residual grout at the end of processing. Sufficiently cleaning the mixer will help eliminate another potential source of wear. Another potential method for reducing the wear rate in the mixer is to reduce the mixer speed without affecting the throughput capacity. Since wear rate is a function of impact velocity of the grout and mixing paddles, testing could be done using the 2 -inch mixer determine the optimum mixer speed to reduce wear but not adversely impact facility operations (e. g. throughput capacity and grout properties) ...|$|R
