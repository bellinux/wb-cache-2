40|$|In this paper, <b>the</b> {{vibration}} response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{structure on}} the infinite elastic soil mediumwas investigated by using <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> compliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectangular <b>foundation.</b> And so it isassumed that <b>the</b> cross-sectional area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure is rectangular {{and the structure}} is excit-ed by <b>the</b> propagation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> progressive shear and dilatation waves. The vibration responsesof the structure in the following cases, are studied here. 1. Forced vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectangular rigid <b>foundation.</b> 2. Vertical vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rigid <b>foundation.</b> 3. Horizontal and rocking vibration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rigid <b>foundation.</b> 4.

As the results, it is generally {{pointed out that the}} magnification factor and phase differencein the displacement responses between the top and bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure are expressed as thesame formula for a specific vibration mode <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure excited by <b>the</b> propagation <b>of</b> thepure dilatation and shear waves.

50|$|At present, only ruins {{are left}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> castle. These ruins are, however, well preserved, {{existing}} {{out of a}} surrounding wall and a donjon which forms part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, and which is partially surrounded by water. The wall dates from <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 13th century and the main building shortly thereafter. The castle was heavily damaged around 1570 in the Eighty Years' War, and partially restored after that. Around 1675 the donjon was burned in a fire, after which decay set it, and parts were gradually demolished. The lands (and the ruins) were possessions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> province <b>of</b> Holland, and were nationalised in 1795. Shortly after the complex was sold, {{under the condition that}} the ruins would not be demolished, which made the ruins an early example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dutch monumental care. In 1889, the ruins were donated by Jhr. Mr. W. van Teylingen back to the Dutch state, who still owns them. The ruins are under <b>the</b> care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rijksgebouwendienst (state's building service). At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century, the ruins were restored and the moat, which had been partially filled, was restored as well.
