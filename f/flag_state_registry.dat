40|$|International {{shipping}} {{accounts for}} approximately 2 - 3 % percent of global anthropogenic {{greenhouse gas emissions}} (GHG). Under business as usual conditions, emissions from the sector are expected to double by 2050. The quantity of GHG emissions from shipping combined {{with the potential for}} reductions using existing technologies make the sector a strategic target for mitigation measures. In February of 2014, the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law published a white paper that concluded that sovereign states have broad authority under international law to regulate GHG emissions from vessels within their registry. However, many registries are structured such that the <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> has limited connection to or exercises limited control over registered vessels. For example, many <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> franchise their <b>registries</b> to private corporations that manage the registration of ships. In addition, with the rise of “flags of convenience,” a number of <b>flag</b> <b>states</b> have only weak ties with ships registered under their flag. This has led to questions as to how the structure of a registry affects states’ capacity to regulate. This white paper delves further into the issue of <b>flag</b> <b>state</b> authority to regulate GHG emissions particularly with respect to franchised registries and flags of convenience. This white paper assesses how these characteristics may affect the power of states in this regard and concludes that the presence of an open or franchised registry does not affect regulatory authority. However, developing nations with limited resources may face challenges promulgating effective emissions reductions regulations...|$|R
40|$|While the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea {{contains}} {{the requirement that}} there exist a genuine link between a ship and its <b>flag</b> <b>State,</b> neither what constitutes that link, nor the effect of its absence has been determined with unambiguous clarity. In addition, it must be enquired whether the genuine link is a requirement that concerns the opposability of the nationality, or {{the duties of the}} <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> once the nationality is conferred, or both. The fact that the genuine link as a requirement has not been singled out expressly in the relation between a <b>State</b> of <b>registry</b> and an aircraft or a space object calls for an analysis of the legal mechanisms in air law and space law in order to determine what meaningful connections are established between these means of transportation and States. © 2010 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden...|$|R

40|$|The article {{investigates the}} duties of <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> to {{implement}} and enforce international standards and regulations. Two related but still distinct topis are treated: General duties of <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> (applicable especially to merchant vessels) and duties concerning fishing vessels. After scrutinising the reasons for inadequate <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> implementation and enforcement, the author discusses possible counter measures of non-flag States. The article notably evaluates systems of Port State Control and possibilities of non-flag States to enforce RFMO regulations and other fishing vessel responsibilities against non-member vessels. Finally, possible consequences against the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> itself as opposed to merely its vessels are examined {{and if it is}} permissible to non-recognise a vessel’s flag in case the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> consistently violates its duties to control its vessels...|$|R
40|$|The {{starting}} point for this analysis of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibilities is to recall {{the historical development of}} the extant regulatory regime for jurisdiction and control of ships; from the genesis of ship registration in the thirteenth century, through {{to the development of the}} nation State and concept of the <b>flag</b> <b>State,</b> on to the gradual evolution of national law for control of ships, and eventual codification of this law into international law in the twentieth century. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (LOSC) provides for a State to grant its nationality to ships, to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality, to register ships in its territory, and for those ships to fly its flag. With these rights come <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibilities. The <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> has a duty to effectively exercise its jurisdiction and control in administrative, technical, social and environmental protection matters over ships flying its <b>flag.</b> The <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> can undertake these duties or has the ability to entrust them to private organizations. A regulatory framework in international maritime law has been established that allows delegation of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibilities and recognizes the customary role of Classification Societies in inspection, survey and certification of ships. The LOSC also requires that a ship be surveyed before registration. As the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> has the right to fix the conditions for the grant of its nationality it can choose to not require this survey for reasons of expediency and easy entry of ships onto its register. The regulatory framework for jurisdiction and control of ships provides opportunities for the establishment of regulatory inefficient <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> who have the right in law to delegate, or derogate, all of their statutory functions to equally inefficient private organizations. Such <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> are attractive to shipowners seeking minimum compliance costs and regulatory oversight. Issues of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsibility and performance are analysed in depth to test the hypothesis that the extant regulatory framework is adequate in law but, due to inadequate implementation, monitoring and enforcement, does not deliver the intent of the LOSC that <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> exercise effective jurisdiction and control over ships flying their flag. For the purpose of analysis in this thesis <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> are categorized into National, Quasi-National, International and Pseudo-National according to their degree of regulatory efficiency. It is concluded that the regulatory framework is fundamentally sound but that it requires effective implementation and enforcement through strengthening in law, supported by sanctions upon recalcitrant <b>flag</b> <b>States,</b> and a greater degree of global oversight and monitoring of <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> performance by the International Maritime Organization...|$|R

40|$|Na osnovi istraživanja izvornih dokumenata (Hrvatski državni arhiv, Nadbiskupski arhiv Zagreb) rad se bavi problematikom oduzimanja crkvenih matičnih knjiga u Hrvatskoj u doba komunizma. After {{taking the}} power in 1945, {{communist}} leadership created new laws in accordance with communist ideology. Some of these laws regulated relations between state and the Church in way that this infl uenced some of the Church activities that interfered {{with some of the}} state’s affairs. One of these laws regulated issue of registry books that were kept up to this time by the church authorities. According to the Law on <b>State</b> <b>Registry</b> Books (April 1 st, 1946) all church registry books had to be handed over to <b>state</b> <b>registry</b> offi cials. However, since these offi cials often had misunderstood (or misused) the law and seized all kinds of church books, such as State of souls registers or old glagolitic books etc. Therefore, church authorities protested vigorously and requested return of such books. Consequently, New Law on changes and amendments of the Law on <b>State</b> <b>Registry</b> Books was issued in January 1949. By this law state authorities prescribed fi nes in money and forced hard labour for all the church offi cials who would make new entries into registry books, since these were closed by the regulations of the fore-mentioned law. Moreover, this new law anticipated that anyone could take such registers from church representatives and hand them over to nearest authorized <b>state</b> <b>registry</b> offi cials. Furthermore, baptism and funerals, before the newborn or deceased was registered in new <b>state</b> <b>registry</b> books, were forbidden. Since state offi cials and church representatives had different opinions regarding the interpretation and implementation of these laws, they often argued and priests were frequently fi ned. Such policy of state offi cials caused even more protest from the church authorities, and therefore these regulations were cancelled in July 1951 by the Criminal Justice Act. Henceforth baptising or funerals could be preformed even prior to reporting the birth or death to <b>state</b> <b>registry</b> offi cial. However, problem of taken registry books remained and church authorities continued to complain in the following years...|$|R

As has already been noted in the report of the UN Secretary-General to be the submitted to the 63 rd session of the UN General Assembly, there are clear indications that a number of <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> regularly fail to comply with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS), and other relevant international instruments and agreements. Some <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> fail to ratify and implement vital social and environmental instruments, some <b>flag</b> <b>States</b> fail to exercise effective jurisdiction over vessels flying their flag. In addition to the risks posed to seafarers and to the marine environment, this report highlights the failure of the current regime, with its preference for anonymity over accountability, to adequately address potentially catastrophic breaches of security or safety. Open Registers or Flags of Convenience (FOCs) The use of flags of convenience and the establishment of new registers by States with no pre-existing maritime infrastructure is growing. To shipping and fishing interests, the economic attraction of registering a vessel under a flag with lower costs, more relaxed crewing requirements and less vigorous regulation is undeniable. Moreover there can be a competitive disadvantage in registering with more reputable flags. However, the wider consequences should not be underestimated. Without transparency of ownership, without the connection between the beneficial owners of a vessel and the <b>flag</b> <b>State</b> responsible for jurisdiction on board {{it is not possible to}} ensure the highest standards in maritime security and safety.
