5|$|After {{three years}} as Inspector-General, {{and in order to}} gain staff experience, Davies was {{attached}} as an observer to a number of units in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. During this time, he also attended the Imperial Defence Conference and represented the New Zealand forces at the funeral of King Edward VII. At the end of the one-year attachment, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> impressed the British Army that they offered him an appointment as commander of 6th Brigade in October 1910, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. As such, he became the first overseas officer to command a regular brigade, only eleven years after taking up a permanent military commission.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell {{out with some}} of his former Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who had been out of the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E
25|$|He {{retired from}} tournament play at age 35 in 1911. Maxwell {{came out of}} {{retirement}} and played in the Amateur Championship one final time after World War I concluded, but it was largely a ceremonial appearance at Muirfield where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many fond memories of past success.|$|E

25|$|ABC afforded Morgan {{his first}} {{exposure}} on television {{as host of}} a low-key variety series, On The Corner, produced at affiliate station WFIL-TV in Philadelphia (ABC's New York station and production center was still under construction) and aired on the fledgling TV network as a summer series in 1948. True to his iconoclasm, he satirized his sponsors during the short run of that show as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> often done on radio.|$|E
25|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{at one point}} used the PIT maneuver on the suspect's car, but he shot at them with a rifle, wounding Geneva police chief Frankie Lindsey in the arm, and kept going. McLendon reached Reliable Building Products, owned by Ruskin Company, where he had worked in 2003. After engaging in a shootout with police, he committed suicide inside the building. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much ammunition in his car that he appeared to have intended to kill many more people.|$|E
25|$|In 1531 Philip was {{successful}} in accomplishing the purpose for which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> long worked by securing the adhesion of the Protestant powers to the Schmalkaldic League, which was to protect their religious and secular interests against interference from the Emperor. The landgrave and his ally, John, Elector of Saxony, became recognized leaders of this union of German princes and cities. Philip was thoroughly convinced that the Protestant cause depended on weakening {{the power of the}} Habsburg emperors both at home and abroad.|$|E

25|$|Two years later, McLane finally {{received}} the appointment <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> longed for. When U.S. President Andrew Jackson decided {{he needed to}} purge his Cabinet of supporters of U.S. Senator John C. Calhoun, the always helpful Martin Van Buren was able to convince the president to appoint McLane to be the Secretary of the Treasury. He returned from England and served as Secretary from August 8, 1831 to May 28, 1833. The major issues confronting McLane in this new role were the tariffs rates {{and the status of}} the Second Bank of the United States.|$|E
25|$|According to the Old French Continuation of William of Tyre, Reginald of Sidon {{had taken}} charge in Tyre {{and was in}} the process of {{negotiating}} its surrender with Saladin. Conrad allegedly threw Saladin's banners into the ditch, and made the Tyrians swear total loyalty to him. His rise to power seems to have been less dramatic in reality. Reginald went to refortify his own castle of Belfort on the Litani River. With the support of the established Italian merchant communities in the city, Conrad re-organised the defence of Tyre, setting up a commune, similar to those <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> often fought against in Italy.|$|E
25|$|In 1857 {{at the age}} of 18 Busch emigrated {{with three}} of his older {{brothers}} to St. Louis, Missouri which was a major destination for German immigrants in the nineteenth century. Because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> many siblings, Adolphus did not expect to inherit much of his father's estate and had to make his own way. Since St. Louis was home to so many German immigrants, the market for beer was large. The city also had two natural resources essential for manufacturing and storing beer before refrigeration: the river provided an ample water supply; and the city had many caves that would keep beer cool.|$|E

25|$|Five {{years after}} his retirement, Warren died at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C., at 8:10 PM on July 9, 1974. On that date, he was visited by Justices Brennan and Douglas. Warren could not resist asking his friends whether the Court would order President Nixon to release the sixty-four tapes demanded by the Watergate investigation. Both justices assured him that the court had voted {{unanimously}} in United States v. Nixon {{for the release of}} the tapes. Relieved, Warren died just a few hours later, safe in the knowledge that the Court <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> loved would force justice on the man that had been his most bitter foe.|$|E
25|$|Grattan {{supported}} the veto, {{but a more}} radical Catholic party was now arising in Ireland {{under the leadership of}} Daniel O'Connell, and Grattan's influence gradually declined. He seldom spoke in Parliament after 1810, the most notable exception being in 1815, when he separated himself from the Whigs and {{supported the}} final struggle against Napoléon. His last speech of all, in 1819, contained a passage referring to the Union <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> passionately resisted, which exhibits the statesmanship, {{and at the same time}} the equable quality, of Grattan's character. His sentiments with regard to the policy of the Union remained, he said, unchanged; but the marriage, having taken place, it is now the duty, as it ought to be the inclination, of every individual to render it as fruitful, as profitable and as advantageous as possible.|$|E
25|$|Siborne {{questions}} whether Blücher, had he confined himself {{during the latter}} part of the action to the same defensive system <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> successfully carried on up to that time, instead of detaching his reserves to the right, and preparing for an attack upon the French left, might not have fully maintained his original position until dark, and thus have saved his army from defeat by the arrival of the IV Corps (Bülow's) during the night, he would then have been prepared to meet his opponent on the following morning with a greatly preponderating force; whilst, on the other hand, Wellington, having concentrated a considerable portion of his army, would have been placed in an equally advantageous position as regards the already vanquished Ney in his own front.|$|E

25|$|Bad Religion slowly {{reformed}} in 1986 {{out of the}} Back to the Known line-up when Graffin called Bentley {{and asked}} him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from How Could Hell Be Any Worse?, he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back. This lineup recorded the band's third album, Suffer, which was released in 1988. Although the album did not chart on the Billboard 200, it received some positive reviews, and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as Trust, Maximum Rocknroll and Flipside.|$|E
25|$|At this point, in 1707, Peter {{offered to}} retrocede {{everything}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far occupied (essentially Ingria) except Saint Petersburg {{and the line}} of the Neva, to avoid a full-scale war, but Charles XII refused. Instead he initiated a march from Saxony to invade Russia. Though his primary goal was Moscow, the strength of his forces was sapped by the cold weather (the winter of 1708/09 being one of the most severe in modern European history) and Peter's use of scorched earth tactics. When the main army turned south to recover in Ukraine, the second army with supplies and reinforcements was intercepted and routed at Lesnaya—and so were the supplies and reinforcements of Swedish ally Ivan Mazepa in Baturyn. Charles was crushingly defeated by a larger Russian force under Peter in the Battle of Poltava and fled to the Ottoman Empire while the remains of his army surrendered at Perevolochna.|$|E
25|$|As the {{professional}} for Blackpool, {{he was able}} to earn more money than any first class cricketer anywhere in the world. Each League side in Lancashire was permitted to pay only one professional. During the 1950s and early 1960s, in the summer at any one time there were more than 150,000 holidaymakers in Blackpool, and there were very large crowds indeed paying at the turnstiles of Blackpool Cricket Club. Every season, moreover, the Blackpool pro was given a benefit match. Illustrating the value of the Blackpool job, Alley was succeeded as Blackpool's pro by many of the all-time greats of the game. These included Sir Conrad Hunte, Garfield Sobers, Pankaj Roy, Hanif Mohammad and Rohan Kanhai. Playing only 2 days a week would also have given the pro the opportunity to take a second job if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> wanted, including playing for a Minor County or a first class County Second Eleven.|$|E

25|$|He was {{selected}} for the English tour of the West Indies and made his Test debut in the first Test at Bridgetown, Barbados, on 11 January 1930. However, the hard wicket encouraged Voce {{to move to a}} faster style, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> much success that he persisted with the faster method when he returned to England, except on wet pitches. He did not do particularly well as a pace bowler in 1930, but following Australia's tour of England in that summer, when Don Bradman scored freely against the English bowling, Voce was part of a meeting convened between the future English captain, Douglas Jardine, and Nottinghamshire captain, Arthur Carr, {{to come up with a}} tactic to defeat Bradman and the Australians. Voce, and his fellow Nottinghamshire fast bowler, Harold Larwood, agreed to a suggestion by Jardine that bowling fast rising balls into the batsmen's bodies, with several catching fielders on the leg side would be an effective tactic.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 1187, before Peter's arrival, the Pope ordered Baldwin to {{lift the}} {{suspension}} of Prior Honorius, who had already reached Verona. Peter arrived at Verona {{a few days later}} to find the Pope had adjourned the case until 10 April, giving Peter no chance to plead formally while a further series of decrees was issued in the monks' favour. However, Peter was no more successful in open court, suffering a continuing series of defeats. On 9 May the Pope ordered Archbishop Baldwin to cease building his new church at Hackington, abolished the fraternity he had established to staff and support it, and expressed surprise that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> far resisted restoration of the situation to that prevailing before the appeal. Peter remained at Verona, arguing the case, until October, and then followed the papal court to Ferrara. Provocative behaviour back home did not help Peter. Baldwin continued to build his church in defiance of the Pope but with the king's support, although he did move the site some distance to the west, hurriedly putting up a wooden chapel in St Dunstan's parish. In August he seized the chapter's manors, suspending and even excommunicating its members as he saw fit.|$|E
25|$|Aetius campaigned vigorously, {{somewhat}} {{stabilizing the}} situation in Gaul and in Hispania. He relied heavily on his forces of Huns. With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied, the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first Kingdom of the Burgundians. This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier. Eastern troops reinforced Carthage, temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace. Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania. However, his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, Rechiar, began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania. At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae. These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of the vices of a declining empire, of which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>so</b> long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased {{the influence of the}} rich, and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor.|$|E
