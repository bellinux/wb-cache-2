40|$|Background and purpose: Awareness during general {{anesthesia}} is a frightening experience that often causes patients to panic and feel helpless {{even when there}} is no pain and no feel of body movement and manipulation by the surgeon. Awareness monitoring is still complicated and controversial. Now a days this is based on electroencephalography data such as the bispectral index (BIS) or spectral edge frequency (SEF). However, there are not such <b>divices</b> for awareness monitoring during anesthesia at our medical centers. The postoperative interview is most frequently used for awareness monitoring. The validity of this method is questionable however, given the imperfect relation between awareness and memory. Materials and Methods: After approval by the Mazandaran University human investigation committee, we consented and included women ASA I whom undergon caesarian section under {{general anesthesia}}. The anesthetic procedure was standardized. Anesthesia was induced with thiopentone after loss of the evelash reflex, the lungs were ventilated with 100 % oxygen. Patients were interviewed 24 h after operation. The principal investigators classified each patient report as awareness condition for example dreaming, feeling manipulation and etc. p< 0. 05 was considered as significant. Results: One of the most common intraoperative awareness was related to hearing the sound of conversations between personnel or <b>divices</b> and instruments (2. 8 %). The most frequent condition of awareness during anesthesia was being unable to move the body (7. 9 %). Dreaming during general anesthesia for caesarian section was observed in 2. 3 % of the patients. Conclusion: The limited use of drug during caesarian section leads to slight increase in awareness during general anesthesia. We conclude {{that it is important to}} monitor awareness during surgery.

Chapter 2. 1 is a retrospective cohort study and gives insight in the patient reported provoking factors of vitiligo including contact with chemicals. In Chapter 2. 2 the role of 4 -TBP as provoking factor for vitiligo was analysed in a patient with chemically induced contact vitiligo. In Chapter 3. 1 current evidence of the prevalence of thyroid diseases in vitiligo is summarised and critically appraised in a systematic review.

40|$|A set of {{codes for}} the {{numerical}} simulation of a gridded Inductive Output Amplifier {{has been developed}} in close collaboration between BINP and Philips RHW. The following problems are investigated: nonstationary gridded gun simulation, self-consistent solution for beam-cavity interaction and passband calculations. The Finite Element Method {{is used for the}} field calculation in the electron gun. Space charge forces are taken into account by the long-wave approach. A special method is used to obtain a self-consistent solution for the beam-cavity interaction with a reduced number of iterations. 1 IOA MODEL The Inductive Output Amplifier (IOA) is a gridded RF device in which electron beam modulation is achieved by applying a RF voltage to the grid of the electron gun. The electron bunches are accelerated by the anode voltage of the gun and pass through the RF cavity gap interacting with the cavity fields. The output cavity of IOA consists of two coupled cavities to extend the passband. The electron gun of this device is axisymmetric. The design of the gun grid is such that it may be described by set of axisymmetric rings. The region of the cavity, in which the electron beam interacts with the RF fields is axisymmetric too. So, for the simulation of the IOA a set of 2 D, axisymmetric codes was developed and used. There are several steps in the device simulation: 1. Calculation of non-stationary electron emission in the gridded gun. 2. Calculation of the beam dynamics in the gun and of the beam-cavity interaction in the output cavity. 3. Obtaining a self-consistent solution together with the frequency characteristic of the <b>divice.</b> 2 GRIDDED GUN MODEL For the numerical simulation of the electron emission in the gridded gun with applied RF voltage the PIC method is used. The macroparticles are described by the infinite thin rings with uniform charge distribution. The length of the rings is defined by the time step.

But the granules appeared too opaque to see the detailed inner structure of mitochondria. Then, the author tried to retaine the potassium mercuric iodide dye complex through the dehydration process by using a specific dehydration media for electron microscopy. In vitro experiment on the precipitants, the mercuric potassium iodide dye complexes, proved that this complex is dissolved easily in pure ethanol, but is not dissolved in 50 % ethanol. On the author hand, the complex is not dissolved in ethyl-ether, but dissolved ether-ethanol mixture (1. 1). The test done by lowering the ethanol contents in ether proved that the dye does not dissolved in the ether containing 20 % ethanol. On {{the basis of these}} observations the author tried to retain the complex through dehydration and succeeded in observing the mercuric-dye complex in the cells under electron microscope by making the sections from the cells dehydrated through 50 % alcohol, ether containing 10 % of pure ethanol and then pure ether, imbibed with ether-methacrylatemonomer and methacrylatemonomer, and embedded in mathacrylate by the aid of benzoyl peroxide. The electronmicroscope observation on the cells stained supravitally with Janus green B, fixed by the method deviced by SENO, dehydrated and embedded by the method just mentioned, proved that the minute structure of the cells are kept as well as in those fixed with 1 % osmic acid and dehydrated by the routine method. In the series of observation on the cells treated with Janus green B in the different period of staining, the processes of the invasion of dye into mitochondria and the deformation of the inner structure have bean traced. After a short period of staining, the dye has acted as scarecely to increase the opacity of mitochondria but a marked change in they structure occured by the ring formation at one end of mitochondria. More deeply stained ones the appear very dark but in the dark area some opaque droplets are recognized. In this case, too, the less opaque pole were seen at the end of mitochondria, in which the structure of cristae were observed. These observations show that by the action of dye element of mitochondria seems to be segregated into 3 parts, less affine, modercetely affine and strong affine elements to me dye, with the destruction of the inner structure...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{additive}} {{soft tissue}} trauma {{along with a}} fracture results in impaired fracture healing. An accurate quantification has not completely been performed so far. Aim {{of the study was}} the exact histomorphometric analysis of callus formation following closed soft tissue trauma, a fracture of the lower leg and their combination in a rat model. METHODS: 48 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in two groups (3 -week-branch and 6 -week-branch). For each branch a sub-group with isolated soft tissue trauma (n= 6), isolated fracture of the lower leg (n= 6), combined injuries (n= 6) and a sham group (n= 6) was arranged. For a standardized soft tissue trauma the CII technique was used. For the closed fracture of the lower leg a well established model was adapted. The combined injuries were performed sequentially. For analysis of ossification the rats of the 6 -week-branch received an intraperitoneal injection of xylene orange (day 6 po), calcein green (day 20 po) and tetracycline (day 40 po) according to their weight. The rats in the 3 -week-branch did not get fluorochromes. After sacrification the left tibiae were explanted and underwent staining (Masson-Goldner, vKossa/SafraninO, SafraninO/light green) as well as grinding (80 µm) of the tibiae of the 6 -week-branch. Measurements were taken with an opto-electronic <b>divice</b> (AxioVision©/ KS 400, Zeiss/Germany, DMRB microscope, Leica/Germany). Entire callus area, mineralized callus area, callus densitiy (all periosteal/endosteal/combined), cortical density and fluorescence of xylene, calcein and tetracycline (all periosteal/endosteal/combined) were determined. RESULTS: Fluorescence intensity increased from sham, soft tissue trauma, isolated fracture to combined injuries as a result of increased osteoblast activity. Early fracture healing showed the strongest signal, followed by mid- and late healing phase. The standard stains demonstrated generally smaller callus areas after 6 weeks compared to 3 weeks. A clear tendency in the comparison of isolated fracture and combined injuries could not be detected. After 3 weeks the entire callus area of the combination group was bigger than the one with the isolated fracture. However, after 6 weeks this area was bigger in the fracture group than in the combination group. Callus density showed the same phenomenon. It was lower in the combination group than in the fracture group after 3 weeks, but after 6 weeks a reciprocal situation occurred. INTERPRETATION: An additive soft tissue trauma does not forcingly lead to decreased callus quality. In our model we saw a delayed healing process after 3 weeks in the histomorphometric analysis following an additive soft tissue trauma. After 6 weeks a slight osteoblastic stimulation by the soft tissue trauma could be detected. A further investigation with an extended range of soft tissue traumata might be helpful to determine the level of an additive soft tissue trauma needed to result in decreased fracture healing during the late phase in histomorphometry, too...|$|E

Ovoga puta autorica se bavi uočavanjem odjeka anonimnoga hrvatskoga srednjovjekovnoga pjesništva, kojemu su prvi poznati zapisi u glagoljičkoj Pariškoj pjesmarici iz 1380. godine, u Marulićevim hrvatskim stihovima. Između Pariške pjesmarice i Marulićevih stihova vremenski je razmak od bar jednoga stoljeća. U to je vrijeme anonimno srednjovjekovno pjesništvo, uglavnom vjerske tematike, živjelo punim životom, prateći puk u njegovim duhovnim manifestacijama kroz čitavu godinu, te bivalo zapisivano u mnogim i glagoljičkim i latiničkim zbornicima, i to u bogatijem i raznovrsnijem izboru nego što ga pruža Pariška pjesmarica, ali autorica se zaustavlja na pronalaženju tragova upravo tih najstarijih zapisa u Marulićevim stihovima. Ukazuje na zajedničke/opće srednjovjekovne teme i motive te na naslijeđene jezične, stilske i stihotvorne postupke i rekvizite što su služili njihovu pjesničkom iskazu. This paper investigates Marulić’s {{connections}} with the heritage of Croatian medieval literature and the language of literature. Reverence is made to the echoes/ traces of the oldest known writings of anonymous Croatian medieval poetry from the glagolitic Paris Miscellany in Marulić’s Croatian verses. The Paris Codex itself (from the National Library in Paris, shelf number Code slave 11) was probably created in some Benedictine monastery in Split or surrounds around 1380. The dating is determined according to its calendar and paschal tables, and its affiliation to the Benedictine circle of the wider Split area {{is based on an}} analysis of the language and contents of the poems. The main parts of the codex (selected missal, breviary and ritual fragments) are written in a Croatian redaction of Old Church Slavonic common in liturgical works, but the poems written before the end of it belong linguistically to the central Dalmatian Ikavian version of Chakavian, here and there permeated with individual elements of Church Slavonic. The Paris Miscellany contains ten poems, seven of them in folk octosyllabics, one in dodecasyllabics and two in free verse with the occasional rhyme. In Marulić’s verses it is possible to find primarily echoes of that universally known folk medieval octosyllabic poetry, in poems in which he himself inherited the medieval topics, above all those relating to the New Testament and eschatology. There are the fewest traces of these vernacular medieval poems in the most mature of his poems, Judith and Susana (and even in the Miracle Play of the History of Saint Paphnutius), founded on Renaissance poetics and secular sources of poetic images and similes. However, in Marulić it is also possible to find individual traces of the »non-vernacular« poems from the Paris Miscellany. The subject of this investigation is not medieval themes and medieval motifs as such; rather the linguistic and poetic or versification elements of their realisation in the Croatian medieval poetry and in Marulić are considered. Croatian medieval poetry, in creating its poetic utterances and effects, makes use of simple linguistic means (collocations, phrasemes, amplifications, oppositions and contrasts, comparisons and such like linguistic procedures and properties), often using clichés and commonplaces, which enabled the people to take part in public religious events. Such often repeated simple poetic means were put by Marulić too into his verse, and thus he made them close and more easily acceptable to his readers. The numerous parallels drawn between the Paris Miscellany and Marulić show the duality of Marulić’s procedure in making verse: sometimes he draws very directlyon a medieval source, sometimes he transforms it, elaborates it, expresses it with very close and yet different linguistic resources. For example god is always Bogjedini – in the Miscellany and in Marulić, but in the Miscellany he is always ki vse more i vse čini and in Marulić he sve more/može, but also svaka more, and his kripost svaka more; he is also svemog, by him svaka postaju [...] . For Jesus from the Miscellany – ki je zemļu, nebo stežal, Marulić has: zemļu s nebom ovi složi; nebo, zemļu ki je stvorio. For the Mother of god, who in the Miscellany nebes otvorila,Marulić says: Po ńoj se otvoriše taj vrata od raja; compared to the Ti se nebeska kraļica from the Miscellany, in Marulić it is almost literal: nebeska s’ kraļica, but she is also kraļica dvora nebeskog and so on. The inherited medieval linguistic and versification resources that take part in the formation of Marulić’s verses the first known versions of which appear in the Paris Miscellany that are particularly discussed here are: collocations, phrasemes (nominal, adjectival, adverbial and interjectional), syntactemes (subjective and predicative), collocations of two concepts (amplificatory and antithetical), similes, identical grammatical forms and in content the same or similar contexts, and finally, rhyme. In both the Miscellany and in Marulić there are the same verbal collocations. Of them only the collocation smrt/semrt prijeti/prijati from the Miscellany has a direct echo in Marulić. This means that this was a clichéd literary language formula instead of the verb ‘umrijeti’, die. Other groups of collocation - with the verbs imiti, početi, račiti, stvoriti, učiniti (se) -are entirelyindependent in Marulić as with respect to the Miscellany and are not the onlyones that Marulić uses. Among the phrasemes the most used are the nominal. The arrangement of the component parts in Bog jedini, kraļ nebeski is constant with the high style post-positional attribute. Unlike god the Mother of god is nebeska kraļica with the usual word order in both the Miscellany and in Marulić, who also has prislavna kraļice, prislavna <b>Divice.</b> Other nominal phrases do not have or do not have to have any settled order of the component parts – in the Miscellany, for example, sina Božja, but in Marulić always Božji sin (with the usual word order),or vice versa; in the Miscellany nebeska slava and in Marulić slava nebeska and even dvor nebeski. As for the joint adjectival phrases we note only one: grihom gubav – grihom gubavi, but in both places in a marked place, in the rhyme. Marulić inherits the usual or common syntactical links: subject with the same or similar verbal predicate and vice versa – predicate with the same nouns (less often other kinds of word) as syntactic complements (object, adverbial). Thus in the Miscellany we have Trubļa trubi but in Marulić Trubļa će trubiti; as against krv ističe in Marulić there is karv teče; as against ne more se [...] . reći in Marulić: izreći ne može;as against nimaš konca – ni konca; as against vsimi oblada in Marulić, almost literally, svim oblada, and grihu speti – grihom, grisi speti; the same is: na Sud priti and so on. The connections of two concepts may be syndetic and asyndetic, for example nebo, zemļu alongside nebo i zemļa in both the Miscellany and in Marulić; otac, mati in the Miscellany but in Marulić ni otac ni mati; žlči, octa in the Miscellany but in Marulić žuč, ocat, but also: žuči i ļuta octa, octa i žuči, octa tere žuči. Adjectival connections are only syndetic: stari i mladi, veli i mali u oba izvora. The rare common similes are in Marulić not literal but very close: the lice veće slnca svitlo is in Marulić lice [...] . sunca veće prosiva, and as against mladinac je slaji meda in Marulić there is usta slaja meda, rič slaju nere med, kripļenje slaje satja i meda. Of the inherited medieval rhymes from the Paris Miscellany, in Marulic we find only four: tilo / gńilo (once in an outer and once in an inner rhyme), gubav /ļubav – gubavi / ļubavi (with semantic opposition: grihom gubav(i) / Božja ļjubav);probodena / okruńena – okruńena / probodena. This paper continues the author’s research into Marulić’s roots in the Croatian medieval heritage. The point of departure was the Paris Miscellany, the source of the oldest medieval poems. It is possible to carry out consideration of the inherited medieval motifs and poetical linguistic and stylistic procedures and properties in which they appear in Marulić on a much broader set of medieval comparative material, but the author believes that this would bring only a quantitative expansion and not a qualitative enrichment as compared to the actual procedure used, that is, it would probably not essentially supplement the categories of language resources used, only the diversity of them (for example, new connections, new phrasemes, similes and so on) and the number of examples for the categories already studied. And at the end, once again citing Judith with her eye on the Paris Miscellany and its composition, the author comes to the conclusion that in the well known Marulić statement from the dedication to Dujam Balistrić » [...] . I have put this history into verses, according to the custom of our makers, and, to boot, according to the laws of those old poets« one can read a new meaning, that is an expansion of the contents of the activity of začinjavci, the makers, from these octosyllabic verses to the creation of more intricate and complicated versification structures, of the kind that can be found in »these old poets«. For the poem Svit se konča from the Miscellany tells that in Croatian poetry as early as the 14 th century there were dodecasyllabics, and its (relatively refined) versification structure shows that this poem must have been created within the framework of some already existing practice of writing in twelve syllable verses...|$|E
