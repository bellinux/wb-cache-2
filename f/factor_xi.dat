5|$|Normal {{coagulation}} is {{initiated by}} the release of tissue factor from damaged tissue. Tissue factor binds to circulating factor VIIa. The combination activates factor X to factor Xa and factor IX to factor IXa. Factor Xa (in the presence of factor V) activates prothrombin into thrombin. Thrombin is a central enzyme in the coagulation process: it generates fibrin from fibrinogen, and activates {{a number of other}} enzymes and cofactors (factor XIII, <b>factor</b> <b>XI,</b> factor V and factor VIII, TAFI) that enhance the fibrin clot. The process is inhibited by TFPI (which inactivates the first step catalyzed by factor VIIa/tissue factor), antithrombin (which inactivates thrombin, factor IXa, Xa and XIa), protein C (which inhibits factors Va and VIIIa in the presence of protein S), and protein Z (which inhibits factor Xa).|$|E

The inhibitor also inactivates kallikrein and plasmin , also involved in blood coagulation. However it inactivates certain other serine proteases that are not involved in coagulation such as trypsin and the C1s subunit of the enzyme C1 involved in the classical complement pathway.|$|E

We performed a detailed study of parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis in 30 type 1 Gaucher disease patients (14 splenectomized) before and after treatment with enzyme supplementation therapy. Pre-treatment aPTT and PT were prolonged in 42 % and 38 % of patients, respectively.

After 12 months of enzyme supplementation therapy partial correction occurred. Thus, severe disorders of the coagulation system occur in Gaucher disease, contributing to the bleeding tendency.

40|$|It {{is known}} that hibernating animals display a drastic {{reduction}} in metabolic rate, accompanied by reduced heart rate and rate of blood flow through vessels. Sluggish blood flow increases the risk for developing clots, yet {{it has been observed}} that hibernators conclusively display elongated clotting times. This observed impairment may be caused by the decrease in body temperature, due to a negative impact on the functioning of the enzymes involved in coagulation. Some hibernating endotherms, or “warm-blooded” animals, employ biological mechanisms as preventative means to prevent clotting during hibernation, such as the down-regulation of certain clotting factors or the production of an inhibitor. In this study, the hemostatic properties of ectotherms, or “cold-blooded” animals, were studied by comparing the clotting times of non-hibernating and hibernating American bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana) using activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). It was found that blood coagulation in ectotherms is less impacted by the change in temperature than in endotherms, and that the difference in clotting time between non-hibernating and hibernating frogs could not be explained by temperature alone. Bullfrogs appear to down-regulate levels of coagulation <b>factors</b> <b>XI</b> and XII, as well as produce a non-protein coagulation inhibitor.

40|$|To {{demonstrate}} that human [alpha]-thrombin is effectively inactivated by human antithrombin III (AT) during {{the production of}} a fibrin clot we measured the amount of a-thrombin activity which can be recovered from a clot generated from purified human proteins. We discovered that 0. 05 - 0. 07 % of the original a-thrombin activity is recovered from a fibrin clot produced from a reaction mixture where the initial concentrations of AT and [alpha]-thrombin were chosen at a ratio (17. 5) to allow complete conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. These results indicated that [alpha]-thrombin is successfully inactivated by AT during {{the production of a}} fibrin clot. Further, when an amount of [alpha]-thrombin equal to that recovered from a fibrin clot is introduced into a solution of fibrinogen and AT identical to that utilized to produce the clot only 4 % of the fibrinogen is converted to fibrin. These results suggest that i) when a fibrin clot is dissolved during fibrinolytic therapy little active [alpha]-thrombin should be released from the clot and ii) this amount of thrombin is insufficient to catalyze rethrombosis without proposing de novo production of thrombin. The action on <b>factors</b> <b>XI,</b> VIII, and V of the small amount of thrombin released upon thrombolysis, however, may provide the stimulus for de novo production of sufficient thrombin to catalyze rethrombosis...|$|R
