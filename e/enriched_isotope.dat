40|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of carbon stable isotopes to distinguish among potential energy pathways in food webs, their usefulness is limited where potential basal carbon sources are numerous and diverse. We measured carbon isotope values of the major fisheries species, the mostly carnivorous Scylla serrata (giant mud crab), and potential basal, autotrophic sources supporting the food web. Conventional mixing modelling of autotroph and crab isotope data could not differentiate contributions from different sources. Pooling of modelled contributions from sources with similar isotope values indicated a role for organic matter from seagrass meadows or saltmarshes, but still did not define contributions well. Crab isotope data from a subsequent, spatially explicit survey of 14 sites, selected to represent different distances from key habitats, were analyzed using multiple regression. Crab isotope values showed a significant relationship with distance from seagrass (R 2 = 0. 87), but not with distance from mangroves or saltmarsh grass. Alongside seagrass meadows, crabs had very <b>enriched</b> <b>isotope</b> values, demonstrating their reliance on sources with <b>enriched</b> <b>isotope</b> values (seagrass and algae epiphytic on seagrass, 65 – 90 % of their energy intake). At the site furthest from seagrass (21 km), crabs assimilated carbon primarily from depleted sources such as mangroves and terrestrial organic matter from coastal catchments (70 – 85 %). Explicit spatial analysis of isotope data following a comprehensive survey revealed energy pathways not evident in conventional analyses.

The elevated amounts of 15 N, 41 K, 26 Mg and 44 Ca recovered in new seedlings indicate that nutrients released from decomposing roots can make a direct contribution to the growth of new trees on restock sites.

40|$|Proteins and {{peptides}} play a preeminent role in {{the processes}} of living cells. The only way to study structure-function relationships of a protein at the atomic level without any perturbation is by using non-invasive isotope sensitive techniques with site-directed stable isotope incorporation at a predetermined amino acid residue in the protein chain. The method can be extended to study the protein chain tagged with stable <b>isotope</b> <b>enriched</b> amino acid residues at any position or combinations of positions in the system. In order to access these studies synthetic methods to prepare any possible isotopologue and isotopomer of the 22 genetically encoded amino acids have to be available. In this paper the synthetic schemes and the stable <b>isotope</b> <b>enriched</b> building blocks that are available via commercially available stable <b>isotope</b> <b>enriched</b> starting materials are described...|$|R
