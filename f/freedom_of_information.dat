5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials then called the OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E

5|$|Brown began {{researching and}} writing Bodyguard of Lies in 1961. Most of the {{material}} is based on oral testimony from Second World War intelligence personnel, as well as records from the National Archives and declassified American records (although Brown says {{that most of the}} book was written before he was able to access the latter, in 1974). Brown wrote Bodyguard of Lies at a time when details of both cryptography and deception during the war were still classified. His attempts at research was resisted by the British and American governments; he was denied access to British war records and had to undertake considerable work to obtain US records via <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> requests.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Watergate, the Ford administration was engaged {{in a number of}} conflicts with Congress.

Within the administration, Scalia advocated a presidential veto for a bill to amend the <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Act, which would greatly increase the act's scope. Scalia's view prevailed, and Ford vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode it. In early 1976, Scalia argued his only case before the Supreme Court, Alfred Dunhill of London, Inc. v. Republic of Cuba. Scalia, on behalf of the US government, argued in support of Dunhill, and that position was successful.|$|E
40|$|This book {{provides}} a critical and uniquely comprehensive {{examination of the}} main UN standards and mechanisms dealing with the rights to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression and <b>information.</b> It details the chequered history of both rights within the UN system and evaluates the suitability of the system for overcoming contemporary challenges and threats to both rights. The book’s institutional focus comprises five international treaties, UNESCO and the UN Special Rapporteur on <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression. Different aspects <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression and <b>information</b> are foregrounded in different treaties, to ensure the effective enjoyment of both rights by particular groups, eg. children or persons with disabilities, or the meaningful application of the rights in particular situations, eg. combating racism.

According to the New York Times, enough documents were put into a government shredder to jam it. North's explanation for destroying some documents was to protect the lives of individuals involved in Iran and Contra operations. It was not until 1993, years after the trial, that North's notebooks were made public, and only after the National Security Archive and Public Citizen sued the Office of the Independent Counsel under the <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Act.|$|E

5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk. The site {{was used as a}} chemical works for at least 100years, and was decommissioned as such in the late 1980s. Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Act 2000, and he called for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil and groundwater impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and asbestos fibres. There were methane and carbon dioxide land gas readings as well. Mosque officials have stated that allowing the development to proceed would benefit the community, as decontamination of the site is part of their building plan.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} actual legal {{framework}} {{of the right to}} <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression and <b>information,</b> as guaranteed under Article 10 ECHR, with references also to Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), in relation to copyright law.

Next the (recent) case law of the ECtHR regarding these conflicting rights is presented and briefly analysed, with reference also to relevant recent case law by the European Court of Justice (CJEU).

5|$|The Danish foreign {{ministry}} reviewed the 348documents that the BBC obtained in 2001 under the <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> Act. In January 2009, foreign minister Per Stig Møller commissioned {{a study by}} the Danish Institute for International Studies (DIIS) to compare the 348 documents with 317 documents released by the Department of Energy in 1994 in order to determine if the 348 documents contained any new information about an intact nuclear weapon at Thule. In August 2009, DIIS published its report, which contradicted the assertions of the BBC. The report concluded that there was no missing bomb, and that the American underwater operation was a search for the uranium-235 of the fissile core of a secondary. For the first time, the report was able to present an estimate of the amount of plutonium contained in the pits of the primaries.|$|E

According to an Associated Press investigation, certain safety documentation and emergency procedure information, including documentation for the exact incident that later occurred, was absent. The exact number of required monthly inspections performed varied over time; the inspections were carried out as required for the first 40 months, but after that around 25% of inspections were omitted, although the investigation notes this is partly expected, since there are circumstances such as weather and movement which preclude an inspection.

5|$|The {{project has}} been criticised for its delayed {{completion}} date; in 2009 the Department for Transport confirmed that Network Rail was developing High Level Output Specification options for the station, with an estimated date for the re-opening of the platforms of 2014, seven years after their closure. The cost of maintaining the disused platforms up to late 2010 was found via a <b>Freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Information</b> request to have been £4.1million. South West Trains subsequently confirmed that platform 20 would be brought back into use in 2014, hosting certain services to and from Reading, Windsor, Staines and Hounslow. These would be 10-car trains newly formed from refurbished SWT and former Gatwick Express rolling stock. Platform 20 reopened in May, with access via platform 19, and platforms 21 and 22 in October after steps were constructed over the former Eurostar entrance to access the platforms.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{tells the}} story of how the rights to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> {{expression}} and <b>information</b> have been shaped by the United Nations’ (UN) institutional dynamics over the years. It gives an account of how the growth of the rights to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression and <b>information</b> has been both stimulated and stymied by different factors in the particular institutional context of the UN. It traces the broad contours of the two rights by connecting the largest conceptual, normative, historical and institutional dots. The chapter opens with a brief exploration of the contiguous nature of the rights to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression and <b>information.</b> This necessarily involves reflection on the instrumental role that the media and new communications technologies can play in the realization of both rights in practice. The remainder of the chapter has an overtly institutional focus. Its next three substantive sections correspond to three broad - roughly chronological, but occasionally overlapping - phases in the development <b>of</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> expression and <b>information</b> at the UN. Each period is denoted by its key features or aspirations: trail-blazing, consolidation and expansion, and the quest for coherence and consistency. Various thematic challenges have presented themselves during these periods, a number of which are woven into the chapter’s narrative. Finally, after offering some substantive conclusions, the chapter will explain the objectives and structure of the book as a whole...|$|R
