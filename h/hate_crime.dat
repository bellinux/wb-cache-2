5|$|In 2009, President Obama {{signed into}} law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which {{contained}} in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton {{signed into law}} the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.|$|E
5|$|C. J. gets emotionally {{involved}} in {{a story about the}} deadly assault on a homosexual youth. She sees {{this as an opportunity to}} push <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> legislation, but the suggestion finds little support among the others.

30|$|During 1996 - 2011 <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> {{more or less}} {{consistently}} trended downward {{for whites}} and blacks. <b>Hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against whites were 12.64 % of all <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> in 1996 and 8.11 % of all <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> in 2011, with total <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against whites dropping from 1106 to 504. Similarly, <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against African Americans decreased from 42 % of all <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> to 33 % of all <b>hate</b> <b>crimes,</b> with total <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> dropping from 3674 to 2076. For blacks and whites, there were only very minor increases in <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> between 2000 and 2001; in each case, the percentage relative to the total declined. <b>Hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against Jews have more or less remained constant during 1996 - 2011, staying near 12 - 13 % of the annual total but declining from 14 % of the total in 2000 to 11 % during 2001. <b>Hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against Hispanics and Catholics followed a similar pattern; indeed, <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> against Catholics fell from 0.70 % of the total in 2000 to 0.39 % in 2001.|$|R
30|$|By contrast, anti-Islamic <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> sky-rocketed in 2001 {{and have}} {{remained}} high ever since. During 1996 - 2000, anti-Islamic <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> were about 1 / 3 of 1 % of all <b>hate</b> <b>crimes.</b> But, {{for the year}} 2001 this number rose to nearly 5 %. Total anti-Islamic <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> rose from nearly 30 per year to 481 for 2001. Anti-Islamic <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> declined from 4.95 % of the total in 2001 to 2.08 % in 2002, but anti-Islamic <b>hate</b> <b>crimes</b> have shown no signs of returning to pre- 9 / 11 levels.|$|R
50|$|The Montrose Center's anti-violence {{program began}} in 1991 as a {{reaction}} to the murder of Paul Broussard.

5|$|Lépine's {{actions have}} been {{variously}} ascribed to psychiatric diagnoses such as personality disorder, psychosis, or attachment disorder, or societal {{factors such as}} poverty, isolation, powerlessness, and violence in the media. The massacre is regarded by criminologists {{as an example of}} a <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> against women, and by feminists and government officials as misogynist attack and an example of the larger issue of violence against women.|$|E
5|$|Scalia {{maintained}} that every element of {{an offense that}} helps determine the sentence must be either admitted by the defendant or found by a jury under the Sixth Amendment's jury guarantee. In the 2000 case of Apprendi v. New Jersey, Scalia wrote the Court's majority opinion that struck down a state statute that allowed the trial judge to increase the sentence if the judge found the offense was a <b>hate</b> <b>crime.</b> Scalia found the procedure impermissible because {{whether it was a}} <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> had not been decided by the jury. In 2004, he wrote for the Court in Blakely v. Washington, striking down Washington state's sentencing guidelines on similar grounds. The dissenters in Blakely foresaw that Scalia would use the case to attack the federal sentencing guidelines (which he had failed to strike down in Mistretta), and they proved correct, as Scalia led a five-member majority in United States v. Booker, which made those guidelines no longer mandatory for federal judges to follow (they remained advisory).|$|E
5|$|Amnesty International {{called the}} {{conviction}} “a bitter blow {{for freedom of}} expression”. Hugh Williamson, of Human Rights Watch, stated that the “charges and verdict … distort both {{the facts and the}} law.... These women should never have been charged with a <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> and should be released immediately.” ARTICLE 19, Freedom House, and the International Federation for Human Rights also issued statements condemning the sentence. On September 21, 2012, the Feminist Press published an e-book entitled Pussy Riot! A Punk Prayer for Freedom to raise funds for the legal defense team.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, a black LGBT organisation, the Out and Proud Diamond Group (OPDG), in {{association}} with the Peter Tatchell Foundation, organised a protest outside Jamaica's London embassy on 28 August. Talking to press, the OPDG's Marvin Kibuuka condemned Jones' murder and called for supporters to actively oppose the persecution of LGBT people in both Jamaica and elsewhere. Peter Tatchell later asserted that the lack of action by Simpson-Miller and the police was tantamount to colluding with those guilty of an anti-LGBT <b>hate</b> <b>crime.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed {{the repeal of}} the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a bill that would expand federal <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Gabrielle Solis (Eva Longoria) discovers she is pregnant, but is unsure if {{the father}} of her child is her husband, Carlos Solis (Ricardo Antonio Chavira), or her lover and former gardener, John Rowland (Jesse Metcalfe).

5|$|As the day wears on, Michael becomes {{convinced}} {{that what happened}} to his office is a <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> and an act of terrorism. Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him that he does not need to have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E
5|$|On 14 August, Deputy Superintendent of Police Steve Brown {{announced}} that fourteen statements had been collected {{and that the}} investigation was progressing. In October 2013, {{a group of men}} set fire to the place in which Jones had lived as a squatter, forcing its four occupants to flee, in what was also believed to be an anti-LGBT <b>hate</b> <b>crime.</b> Everald Morgan, an officer at the St James Public Health Department, requested that police provide protection for the four youths made homeless by the arson attack, but they declined to do so. Meanwhile, a charity named Dwayne's House was set up in Jones' memory to aid homeless LGBT youth in Jamaica. As of May 2014, however, no one had been arrested or charged, and in August 2015 the crime was still considered unsolved.|$|E
5|$|As Attorney General, Dosanjh {{oversaw the}} {{resolution}} of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff involving the Secwepemc Nation, set up a database for registering violent offenders, established a <b>hate</b> <b>crime</b> division in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and lobbied for more police officers, probation officers, and judiciary. At the same time his office drew criticism for reducing legal aid and closing courthouses. As the Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration he successfully lobbied for laws giving same-sex couples the equal rights and responsibilities for child support, custody and access. In early 1999, a special prosecutor under the RCMP opened an investigation into possible influence peddling by Premier Glen Clark concerning casino licensing. On March 4, after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) raided the Premier's house, they briefed Attorney General Dosanjh, whose office had to assist, and placed him under a gag order. The order was lifted on August 13, he informed Clark, and called a press conference, after which Clark resigned as Premier. Dosanjh's actions were variously criticized for not informing his party caucus and not going public sooner, and applauded for avoiding perceptions of conflict of interest despite his power to intervene.|$|E
