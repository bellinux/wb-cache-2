40|$|ABSTRACT: Future {{launch vehicle}} payload {{fairings}} will be manufactured from advanced lightweight composite materials. The loss of distributed mass causes {{a significant increase}} in the internal acoustic environment, causing a severe threat to the payload. Using piezoelectric (PZT) actuators to control the fairing vibration and the internal acoustic environment has been proposed. To help determine the acoustic control authority of piezoelectric actuators mounted on a rocket fairing, the internal acoustic response created by the actuators needs to be determined. In this work the internal acoustic response of a closed simply-supported (SS) cylinder actuated by PZT actuators is determined using an impedance model for the actuator and boundary element analysis. The experimentally validated model is used to extrapolate results for a SS cylinder that emulates a Minotaur payload fairing. The internal cylinder <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> are investigated for PZT actuation between 35 and 400 Hz. Significant reductions in the structural response due to increased damping do not equate to similar reductions in the <b>acoustic</b> sound pressure <b>levels</b> (SPLs) for the cylinder. The sound <b>levels</b> at the <b>acoustic</b> resonant frequencies are essentially unaffected by the significant increase in structural damping while the <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> at the structural resonant frequencies are mildly reduced. The interior acoustic response of the cylinder is dominated by the acoustic modes and therefore significant reductions in the overall interior <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> will not be achieved if only the structural resonances are controlled. As the actuation frequency is reduced, the number of actuators required to generate <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> commensurate to that found in the fairing increases to impractical values. Below approximately 100 Hz, the current demands reach levels that are extremely difficult to achieve with a practical system. The results of this work imply that PZT actuators do not have the authority to control the payload fairing internal acoustics below 100 Hz...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we discuss a novel {{technique}} to control the spatial distribution of sound level within a synthesized sound field. The problem is formulated by separating the sound field into regions with high <b>acoustic</b> <b>level,</b> so-called bright regions, and zones with low <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> (zones of quiet) by time independent virtual boundaries. This way, the prop-agating sound field obtains a static spatial shape, which we call sound figure. This problem is treated with a generic approach for creating sound figures. We give an analytic solution to the problem and highlight, how our findings can be applied using established sound field synthesis techniques. We furthermore show the limitations of our approach, provide simula-tion results to prove the concept and discuss some application areas...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic {{near field}} data were {{collected}} with model single and twin jet nozzles to determine if closely spaced nozzles produce higher acoustic loading than do single nozzles. The tests were spurred by structural failure of the B- 1 exhaust nozzle external flaps and similar damage on the F- 15. The test was performed using two 5 / 8 in. ID pipes machined and placed side-by-side to mimic B- 1 nozzles. A microphone mounted on the internozzle fairing measured <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> near the nozzle exit plane. The nozzles oscillated significantly more than did a single nozzle {{over a wide range}} of nozzle pressure ratios. <b>Acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> in the dual jets exceeded single jet noise by as much as 20 dB, making acoustic resonance a definite candidate for structural damage in the twin jet configuration...|$|R

Recognition error is defined at string, word, phone, and <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> and {{treated in a}} unified framework in discriminative training. With an <b>acoustic</b> <b>level,</b> high-resolution error measurement, a discriminative criterion of minimum divergence (MD) is proposed. Using speaker-independent, continuous digit databases, Aurora 2, the recognition performance of recognizers, which are trained in terms of different error measures and different training modes, is evaluated under various noise and SNR conditions. Experimental results show that discriminatively trained models perform better than the maximum likelihood baseline systems. Specifically, in MWE and MD training, relative error reductions of 13. 71 % and 17. 62 % are obtained with multi-training on Aurora 2, respectively. Moreover, compared with ML training, MD training becomes more effective as the SNR increases...|$|R

In speech recognition, the goal is communication of information by voice and we will discuss the basics of speech recognition from a communication perspective. The speech signal at the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> has a bit rate of 64 kb/s but the underlying sound patterns have an information rate of less than 100 b/s.

40|$|We {{investigate}} whether infant-directed speech (IDS) could facilitate word form learning {{when compared to}} adult-directed speech (ADS). To study this, we examine the distribution of word forms at two <b>levels,</b> <b>acoustic</b> and phonological, using a large database of spontaneous speech in Japanese. At the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> we show that, as has been documented before for phonemes, the realizations of words are more variable and less discriminable in IDS than in ADS. At the phonological level, we find an effect in the opposite direction: the IDS lexicon contains more distinctive words (such as onomatopoeias) than the ADS counterpart. Combining the acoustic and phonological metrics together in a global discriminability score reveals that the bigger separation of lexical categories in the phonological space does not compensate for the opposite effect observed at the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level.</b> As a result, IDS word forms are still globally less discriminable than ADS word forms, even though the effect is numerically small. We discuss the implication of these findings for {{the view that the}} functional role of IDS is to improve language learnability. Comment: Draf...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{the studies}} on the {{advanced}} solid rocket in JAXA, numerical simulations were carried out to investigate {{the effect of the}} flame deflector (FD) shape on the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> of the launch vehicle at lift-off. The results indicate that there are mainly two types of acoustic sources; 1) “impingement noise ” due to the interaction of the exhaust plume and FD, and 2) Mach wave generated by the flapping motion of the plume flowing over the FD. Since the impingement noise propagates directly to the vehicle, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> of the vehicle is dominated by the impingement noise. Based on the knowledge obtained here, it is found that the initial inclination angle of the FD should be steep to reduce the impingement noise. Besides, it also turns out that the FD is desirable to have a curved surface both for reducing the size of the FD and for preventing another impingement noise caused by the rapid change of the FD contour.

40|$|It is {{important}} to control the acoustic environment inside spacecraft and space habitats to protect for astronaut communications, alarm audibility, and habitability, and to reduce astronauts' risk for sleep disturbance, and hear-ing loss. But {{this is not an}} easy task, given the various design trade-offs, and it has been difficult, historically, to achieve. Over time it has been found that successful control of spacecraft <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> is achieved by levying firm requirements at the system-level, using a systems engineering approach for design and development, and then validating these requirements with acoustic testing. In the systems engineering method, the system-level requirements must be flowed down to sub-systems and component noise sources, using acoustic analysis and acoustic modelling to develop allocated requirements for the sub-systems and components. Noise controls must also be developed, tested, and implemented so the sub-systems and components can achieve their allocated limits. It is also important to have management support for acoustics efforts to maintain their priority against the various trade-offs, including mass, volume, power, cost, and schedule. In this extended abstract and companion presentation, the requirements, approach, and results for controlling <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> in most US spacecraft since Apollo will be briefly discussed. The approach for controlling <b>acoustic</b> <b>levels</b> in the future US space vehicle, Orion Multipurpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), will also be briefly discussed.

Other types of noise, such as launch, landing, and abort noise, intermittent noise, Extra-Vehicular Activity (EVA) noise, emergency operations/off-nominal noise, noise exposure, and impulse noise are important, but will not be discussed because of time limitations...|$|R
40|$|The International Standard ISO 140 - 5 {{on field}} {{measurements}} of airborne sound insulation of façades establishes that the directivity of the measurement loudspeaker should be {{such that the}} variation in the local direct sound pressure level (ΔSPL) on the sample is ΔSPL < 5 dB (or ΔSPL < 10 dB for large façades). This condition is usually not very easy to accomplish nor is it easy to verify whether the loudspeaker produces such a uniform level. Direct sound pressure levels on the ISO standard façade essentially depend on the distance and directivity of the loudspeaker used. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the test geometry for measuring sound insulation and explains how the loudspeaker directivity, combined with distance, affects the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> distribution on the façade. The first sections of the paper are focused on analysing the measurement geometry and its influence on the direct <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> variations on the façade. The most favourable and least favourable positions to minimise these direct <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> differences are found, and the angles covered by the façade in the reference system of the loudspeaker are also determined. Then, the maximum dimensions of the façade that meet {{the conditions of the}} ISO 140 - 5 standard are obtained for the ideal omnidirectional sound source and the piston radiating in an infinite baffle, which is chosen as the typical radiation pattern for loudspeakers. Finally, a complete study of the behaviour of different loudspeaker radiation models (such as those usually utilised in the ISO 140 - 5 measurements) is performed, comparing their radiation maps on the façade for searching their maximum dimensions and the most appropriate radiation configurations...|$|R

Acoustic studies reveal that addition of chevrons to the nozzle reduces the {{sound pressure level}} reasonably with acceptable reduction in performance. In this paper comprehensive numerical studies on acoustic characteristics {{of different types of}} chevron nozzles have been carried out with non-reacting flows for the shape optimization of chevrons in supersonic nozzles for aerospace applications.

We extracted a so-called vocal efficiency feature (VEF) from the autocorrelation function of the steady portion of the isolated French vowel /a/. During the first stage we established by simulation the relationship between the VEF and the shape and duty cycle of the glottal waveform. The simulation showed that the lower the VEF values were, the smaller was the glottal closure quotient and the more symmetric the waveform. In the second stage we collected a set of dysphonic and a set of normal speech samples and computed the VEF for each. The proposed VE measure permitted discrimination between normal and dysphonic speakers. The relevance of the resulting classification was illustrated by its interpretation in the framework of a theoretical model [20]. The proposed parameter is most useful. It permits the detection at the <b>acoustic</b> <b>level</b> of types of pathologies which do not lead to increased perturbation or noise in the speech signal. © 1985.
