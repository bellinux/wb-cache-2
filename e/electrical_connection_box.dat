500|$|The {{stations}} were demolished between 2001 and 2003. The smaller {{buildings and structures}} were first to be demolished. One worker was killed during the demolition work, in May 2001, crushed underneath an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> <b>box</b> which fell from a wall. On 31 October 2001, the ash silo which stood at the ash dock was toppled using explosives to demolish the stilts the structure stood on. The silo was then dismantled by bulldozers. All of the smaller structures had been removed by July 2002. On 11 July 2002, the A Station's boiler house was demolished. The [...] high coal conveyor belt was demolished on 6 February 2003. The station's precipitators were demolished on 27 March and 17 April 2003. On 1 May 2003, the B Station's bunker bay building was demolished, and on 22 May 2003, the stations air heater was demolished. A fire started at the station on 17 June 2003, when a bunker caught fire after hot cutting equipment set fire to coke remnants. All of the larger structures had been demolished by July 2003. It was planned for the stations' chimneys to be demolished in October 2003, but {{that had to be}} postponed due to the complexity of the demolition. However, at noon on 7 December 2003, the four chimneys, each weighing , were demolished using a total of [...] of the industrial explosive Gelemex. The demolition is thought to have been the biggest chimney demolition in 50 years.|$|E

5000|$|The cover has an {{elaborate}} fantasy illustration that makes reference to song titles, previous album covers, {{and a member}} of the group. The artist is not explicitly credited, but his signature, [...] "Sol√©" [...] is visible. The picture, which continues onto the back cover, shows a character on the front with a monkey's head on a human body, chest and one hand visible but otherwise wearing a fantastic multi-coloured suit with cape. On the back there is an unclothed monkey with a human's head, suggesting the heads of a human and a monkey have been exchanged. The character on the front is wearing skates, and the character on the back is holding a large key, referencing the two suite titles. The two characters are connected by a cable which is an <b>electrical</b> <b>connection</b> to a <b>box</b> on the front cover character's chest, similar to the box of dials and cables on the cover of Clearlight Symphony. The cable turns into an umbilical cord where it attaches to the character on the back cover. Other cables from the box lead to the monkey's head and ears, and some lead out of sight, as also seen on the covers of Clearlight Symphony and Forever Blowing Bubbles.|$|R
