Wozniak knew nothing about disk controllers, but while at Hewlett-Packard had designed a simple, five-chip circuit to operate a Shugart Associates drive. Wozniak began studying existing floppy controllers, including North Star and IBM models. Standard floppy controller boards were large devices that used dozens of TTL chips.
