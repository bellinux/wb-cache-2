Other taxes include taxes on life and general insurance premiums, and on property transfers.|$|R
50|$|There are {{the three}} types of {{insurance}} coverage. Replacement cost coverage pays the cost of repairing or replacing your property with like kind & quality regardless of depreciation or appreciation. Premiums for this type of coverage are based <b>on</b> <b>replacement</b> cost <b>values,</b> and not based on actual cash value. Actual cash value coverage provides for replacement cost minus depreciation. Extended replacement cost will pay over the coverage limit if the costs for construction have increased. This generally will not exceed 25% of the limit. When you obtain an insurance policy, the limit is the maximum amount of benefit the insurance company will pay for a given situation or occurrence. Limits also include the ages below or above what an insurance company will not issue a new policy or continue a policy.|$|R
25|$|With the {{election}} of Margaret Thatcher in 1979 the water and sanitation sector initially remained public, but the government attempted to make the enterprises operate more along commercial lines. As a result, {{the number of employees}} in the sector declined from 61,000 in 1976 to 52,000 in 1985, real operating costs declined, tariffs were increased above the inflation rate and the share of self-financing of investments increased. However, government regulators also cut back on investments. While the industry became profitable, the rate of return on assets based <b>on</b> <b>replacement</b> cost <b>values</b> remained low at less than 2%. As part of the attempt to commercialise the service providers, the Water Act 1983 reduced the number of Board members of the water authorities. However, it also eliminated the local government representation on the Boards and made all Board members appointed by Ministers, thus further centralising the sector.|$|R

To this end, we propose a vintage model to analyze the replacement decision in an economy in which high and low income agents trade on a durable good.

In the case of application of the proposed scheme to FG-FFT, the number of the near correction elements is significantly reduced. Therefore, the optimal replacement scheme can dramatically reduce the memory requirement and computing time in FG-FFT.

40|$|This paper studies how the {{difference}} between technical depreciation and tax depreciation affects the firm's optimal investment strategy. The objective is maximization of shareholder value. When tax depreciation differs from technical depreciation, an additional investment not only generates value {{due to the fact}} that the firm can produce more, but also {{due to the fact that}} an additional deferred tax liability arises. Two types of capital stock will therefore affect shareholder value, i. e. the <b>replacement</b> <b>value</b> of the assets and the tax base of the assets. We present a dynamic model of the firm with these two types of capital stock, and study the effects of the tax <b>depreciation</b> rate <b>on</b> the firm's optimal dynamic investment strategy, dividend policy, and long run capital stock level...|$|R

The objective of this research was to evaluate the irrigation requirements of ten newly established cool-season turfgrass species maintained under two different mowing height and nitrogen fertility regimes. The site was treated with glyphosate to eliminate existing plant material, scalped to remove foliage, leveled, and graded to provide adequate surface drainage. All plots were seeded with a blend of three cultivars for all turfgrass species (Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, velvet bentgrass, creeping bentgrass, colonial bentgrass, strong creeping red fescue, chewings fescue, slender creeping red fescue, tall fescue) except for annual bluegrass which was sodded. Plots were mowed at 1. 6 and 5. 1 cm three times and one time per week respectively. Nitrogen was applied at either 0. 45 or 1. 81 kg per 92. 9 m 2 per year. Water moisture stress was assessed visually as well with a Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) moisture probe at a 3. 8 cm depth for the same 45 -day period in 2009 and 2010.

Sweet orange fruit peels were collected from peeled orange sellers and divided into three portions. The first portion was not fermented (SP 0), while the second and third portions were fermented for 24 hrs (SP 24) and 48 hrs (SP 48), respectively. They were separately sun-dried, milled and samples screened and analyzed for phytonutrients. Four different diets namely the control (CD) and three test diets SP 0 D, SP 24 D and SP 48 D in which SP 0, SP 24 D and SP 48 replaced maize in the control diet (CD) at 30 % level in that order were compounded. Seven-day old one hundred and twenty Anak 2000 broiler chicks were randomly assigned to these diet groups to evaluate their performance. There was a decrease in the concentration of each of oxalate, flavonoid, tannin, saponin and phytate detected in the peels as the duration of fermentation increased from 0 to 48 hrs. Thirty percent replacement of maize by the fermented sweet orange fruit peel meal depressed body weight gain (p< 0. 01), feed intake (p< 0. 05) and live weight (p< 0. 01) of broiler starter. The fermentation technique used in this study did not improve the nutritive value of the sweet orange fruit peels to enhance its suitability as a feed resource in broiler starter production...|$|R

The scope of research included 50 facilities located in the southern Poland, which were granted an organic farm certificate. The investigated facilities were the object of research within the development subsidy titled "Innovative influence of technology and information management supporting system on production efficiency in organic farms". The analysed data concerned 2012. For the purpose of comparative analysis the researched facilities were divided into two groups which specialize in plant and animal production. Average area of buildings was 314. 45 m 2 and was comparable in distinguished trend groups. In farms producing plants, storehouses prevailed and in case of animal farms – livestock buildings. Average annual <b>replacement</b> <b>value</b> of buildings was PLN 105. 78 thousand and was also comparable in trend groups.

Average annual operating costs of buildings were PLN 58. 61 thousand. The fact that these costs in animal farms were 2 times higher than in plant farms, should be emphasised.
