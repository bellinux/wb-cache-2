ABSTRACT: The paper discusses <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources as library materials use for information works in contemporary information age by library staff. The paper purposely identified the available <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources and their extent of use by library staff. The study employed a descriptive survey design. The instrument of data collection is questionnaire while, population of the study comprises 19 library staff who work in Kogi State University Library, Anyigba. Data gathered by use of questionnaire were analyzed by simple percentage to determine availability of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources (table, 1) and use of available <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources by library staff (table, 2); while mean {{were used to determine}} the extent of use of available <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources (table, 3). The findings shows that out of 20 itemized <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources 8 (40. 0 %) were considered available while 12 (60. 0 %) were considered not available. More to this, out of population of 19 library staff 6 (31. 6 %) know how to use available <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources while, 13 (68. 4 %) do not know how to use them. Furthermore, out of 8 available <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources 5 were used to great extent while, 3 to low extent. Hence, data analyzed in (table 1, 2 & 3) are presented in charts. Recommendations were proffered on how to make adequate <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources available, examples/ categories / types of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources to be provided (table, 4) as well as uses of them in the library (table, 5...|$|R

The point is whether representatives of all fields of sciences use them with equal intensity and effectiveness. There is an opinion, that EIR are more applicable for physical, biomedical and technological sciences and representatives of these sciences are better prepared and use them much more extensively. It is thought that those, who study liberal arts, are technophobial, moreover, representatives of liberal arts themselves maintain that manuscript material is frequently moreimportant than <b>electronic</b> <b>information,</b> that books are primary and not articles. The aim of the article is to overview the peculiarity of representatives of liberal arts and to present an evaluated qualitative and acknowledged register of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources, which could be useful for representatives of liberal arts, ensure supplying of specific information needs and disseminate <b>information</b> about <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources. To implement this goal the following tasks are solved in the article: problems of typology of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources are discussed and their original classification scheme presented based on theoretical and practical material; assessment criteria of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources are analyzed; an annotated list of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> resources for representatives of liberal arts is presented.

40|$|Networked {{information}} sources and services {{proved to be}} an indispensable part of our everyday lives. We get access {{to a wide variety of}} bibliographic, full-text and multimedia databases through the intranets, extranets and the Internet. Information and communication technologies available in different settings (e. g., workplace, home, library, and Internet cafés) facilitate our access to such online services as ebanking, e-government, e-learning, and e-entertainment. Although some advanced information processing and networking capabilities are available to us, we still experience difficulties in searching, finding, gathering, organizing, retrieving, and using information. Trying to find information among billions of electronic sources is likened to trying to “drink water from a fire hydrant. ” We need well-designed <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> management systems and services to better manage information that we use in our private and professional lives. Availability of such systems and services are of paramount importance to all organizations large and small. <b>Electronic</b> <b>information</b> management can be defined as the management of information that is recorded on printed or electronic media using electronic hardware, software and networks. It includes the description of strategies, processes, infrastructure, information technology and access management requirements as well as that of making economic, legal and administrative policies with regards to the management of <b>electronic</b> <b>information.</b> This publication aims to review current developments in <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> management. It contains ten papers covering a wide range of topics. The titles of papers are as follows: “Internet and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> Management,” “New Initiatives for Electronic Scholarly Publishing: Academic Information Sources on The Internet,” “Information Discovery and Retrieval Tools,” “Electronic Collection Management and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> Services,” “Economics of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> Provision,” “Metadata for <b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> Resources,” “Preservation of and Permanent Access to <b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> Resources,” “Electronic Information Management and Intellectual Property Rights,” “Infrastructure of <b>Electronic</b> <b>Information</b> Management” and “The Digital Library – The Bulgarian Case. ” Papers explore several trends, models, and strategic, operational and policy issues with regards to <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> management. Among them are: customization and personalization of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> services; Davenport’s ecological model of information management; current developments in electronic journals, electronic prints, electronic theses and dissertations; initiatives to create a global network of archives of digital research materials (e. g., Budapest Open Access Initiative); features and capabilities of search engines; use of metatags to describe contents of electronic documents; electronic collection management strategies and models (e. g., “access versus ownership” and “pay-per-view”); economics of preparing and providing published information; alternative models of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> provision; metadata and resource discovery; digital preservation and archiving projects; intellectual property rights in the digital information environment; the European Union directive on copyright and information society; access control devices (e. g., finger-printing and time-stamping); and networking infrastructure for <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> management; and the digital library initiatives in Bulgaria.
