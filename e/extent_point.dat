50|$|Juliana's {{life was}} filled with tumult, largely as a {{consequence}} of the religious and political controversies rampant in Liège: an emerging urban middle class demanding new rights, political rivalries between the Guelphs and the Ghibellines, and internecine quarrels among the lower nobility in Flanders. These conflicts created a context ripe for this type of movement. When Juliana became prioress of the canonry, she re-instated strict Augustinian rules. In 1240, the canonry and adjacent leprosarium came under the supervision of a man named Roger, a vicious man who had gained the position through simony and intrigue. He immediately disliked both Juliana and her reproaches, and incited the citizenry against her, accusing her of diverting and stealing the hospital's funds. She fled to the anchorhold of her friend, Dame Eve, and was then received into Canon John's house, adjacent to the basilica. With the help of Robert of Thourotte, the Bishop of Liège, Juliana was vindicated and restored to her former position in the canonry. Roger was deposed. In 1247, however, upon the death of Bishop Robert, Roger once again regained control of Mont Cornillon under the new bishop, Henry de Gueldre, and Juliana was again driven out. These events in Juliana's biography, to a certain <b>extent,</b> <b>point</b> to the larger historical backdrop of rivalry over the vacated bishopric, amplified by the excommunication of Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{enhancing}} entrepreneurship {{has emerged as}} commonly used policy- measure {{in order to improve}} economic growth. However, is it true that entrepreneurship unambiguously can be claimed to improve economic growth? This paper intends to review the empirical evidence on the relationship between entrepreneurship on three measures of economic growth, employment, productivity and aggregate economic growth. The review shows that the studies that find no positive relationship between entrepreneurship and productivity growth have studied a relatively short period. Most studies that have studied a longer period (about ten years) provide rather clear evidence on the positive relationship between entrepreneurship and growth. Regarding the relationship between entrepreneurship and employment growth, the empirical evidence to some <b>extent</b> <b>point</b> in different directions. However, it must be concluded {{that in the long run}} there seems to be a positive relationship.

30|$|Podravina {{is an area}} of {{relatively}} intensive agriculture where, according to modern agricultural demands, higher doses of organic and mineral fertilizers are applied, causing leaching of the soil and nitrate input in aquatic ecosystems. Considering the large share of arable land in the River Drava basin, the highest possible nitrate pollution of water in this region can be expected. Due to the increasing trend of application of mineral and organic fertilizers in the world (Woo-Jung et al. 2007; Pacheco et al. 2001; Bouwman et al. 2005; Cetindag 2005; Widory et al. 2003) and, on the other hand, due to stricter criteria concerning reduction in nitrate pollutions in water (EU Nitrate Council Directive 1991), the aim of this research was to investigate the annual nitrate concentration variability in the area of an intensive agriculture and dense population of the middle Podravina region. The areas especially prone to pollution are easily permeable soils in drinking water protection zones in shallow unconfined aquifers (Burkart and Stoner 2007; Kraft and Stites 2003). Therefore, the aim was to determine to what <b>extent</b> <b>point</b> sources of pollution from agriculture and septic systems contribute to total pollution, as well as to determine the nitrate concentration variability in individual wells depending on the environmental factors.|$|E
40|$|Water {{quality in}} the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is {{continuing}} {{to be affected by}} land-based activities in adjacent catchments including the Fitzroy River. Principal impacts on water quality relevant to the Fitzroy are the quantities of sediments and nutrients attributed largely to nonpoint sources (agriculture) and to a lesser <b>extent</b> <b>point</b> sources (municipal and industrial discharge). A key issue of interest is the potential for market based instruments, particularly quantity control measures, to mitigate water quality impacts. These have been successfully introduced in the United States and other countries to address water quality issues. A review of quantity control programs relevant to water quality has been undertaken. Key alternative mechanisms include cap-and-trade programs, offset trading and bubble schemes. By drawing upon the design and characteristics of these existing policies that are comparable to characteristics of the Fitzroy, the potential for market based instruments to be applied in the Fitzroy region can be established. Results show that there is some potential to design applications of these mechanisms, but the lack of many point source emitters and some institutional structures, together with political economy issues, will make these difficult. However, if water quality emissions are to be reduced, these may be viable policy alternatives...|$|E

Based on these observations, we suggest that the key difference between dog and wolf behavior is the dogs' ability to look at the human's face. Since looking behavior has an important function in initializing and maintaining communicative interaction in human communication systems, we suppose that by positive feedback processes (both evolutionary and ontogenetically) the readiness of dogs to look at the human face has lead to complex forms of dog-human communication that cannot be achieved in wolves even after extended socialization...|$|R

We and others have shown that treatment of pluripotent stem cells with cisplatin causes a plethora of transcriptional and post-translational alterations that, to a major <b>extent,</b> <b>point</b> to DNA damage response (DDR) signaling. The orchestrated DDR signaling network is important to arrest the cell cycle and repair the lesions or, in case of damage beyond repair, eliminate affected cells.

Here, we performed metabolic profiling by mass spectrometry of embryonic stem (ES) cells treated for different time periods with cisplatin. We then integrated metabolomics with transcriptomics analyses and connected cisplatin-regulated metabolites with regulated metabolic enzymes to identify enriched metabolic pathways. These included nucleotide metabolism, urea cycle and arginine and proline metabolism. Silencing of identified proline metabolic and catabolic enzymes indicated that altered proline metabolism serves as an adaptive, rather than a toxic response. A group of enriched metabolic pathways clustered around the metabolite S-adenosylmethionine, which is a hub for methylation and transsulfuration reactions and polyamine metabolism. Enzymes and metabolites with pro- or anti-oxidant functions were also enriched but enhanced levels of reactive oxygen species were not measured in cisplatin-treated ES cells.

40|$|Existing 3 -dimensional {{acoustic}} {{target tracking}} methods that use wired/wireless networked sensor nodes to track targets based on four sensing coverage {{do not always}} compute the feasible spatio-temporal information of target objects. To investigate this discrepancy in a formal setting, we propose a geometric model of the target tracking problem alongside its equivalent geometric dual model that is easier to solve. We then study and prove some properties of dual model by exploiting its relationship with algebra. Based on these properties, we propose a four coverage axis line method based on four sensing coverage and prove that four sensing coverage always yields two dual correct answers; usually {{one of them is}} infeasible. By showing that the feasible answer can be only sometimes identified by using a simple time test method such as the one proposed by ourselves, we prove that four sensing coverage fails to always yield the feasible spatiotemporal information of a target object. We further prove that five sensing coverage always gives the feasible position of a target object under certain conditions that are discussed in this paper. We propose three extensions to four coverage axis line method, namely, five coverage <b>extent</b> <b>point</b> method, five coverage extended axis lines method, and five coverage redundant axis lines method.

40|$|With stagnating {{growth rates}} among a {{majority}} of its members, soaring unemployment figures and {{an increased risk of}} deflation, the economic conditions of the European economy do not strongly reflect a stronger and more united Europe as was intended by the monetary unification in 2001. On the contrary, the recent painstaking negotiations between Greece and its bailout creditors pushed Greece on the brink of leaving the Eurozone and seriously questioned the sustainability of the European monetary union. This research is an attempt to shed new light on the structural evolution of the main Eurozone economies in the years leading up to and following the monetary unification by means of a detailed data analysis using the recently released World Input-Output Database and adopting an inter-country input-output model. This database offers many insights in the productive structures of economies as well as the international interrelatedness in productive and demand structures. By empirically getting an appraisal on both the historal evolution and current structure of the Eurozone’s economy, this thesis furthermore aims at providing new lines of thought to the European policy makers in their search for industrial policy solutions to reduce the macro-economic imbalances and achieve a sustained recovery of the Eurozone economy. The first part of our findings basically all support the overall message that a substantial economic restructuring among the main Eurozone countries has been taking place in the last two decades. We collected various structural insights which all {{to a greater or lesser}} <b>extent</b> <b>point</b> out that the monetary unification in 2001 reinforced a process of structural divergence between mainly Germany and the peripheral, or Southern European, economies both in terms of their productive and trade structures and reflected on the surface by a growing divergence between their overall current account balances. Germany has gradually been intensifying its technological capabilities by building up a strong comparative advantage in the production and export of high and medium-high technology manufacturing goods, while the periphery has been technologically stagnant and got locked-up in specializing in low and medium-low tech manufacturing industries as well as several non-traded industries including construction and tourism to name just a few. The second part addresses the important question on how to deal with this structural problem, by presenting several broad policy suggests and lines of thought substantiated by empirical and theoretical arguments. These scenario’s include: laissez-faire (let the process happen without strongly interfering), introduce a Eurozone central fiscal stabilization mech- anism, and try to exploit intra-Eurozone trade spillovers. Especially this last scenario is care- fully empirically examined for the year 2011, the most recent year in the World Input-Output Database. A two-folded conclusion can be drawn from this analysis. Firstly, a ‘coordinated Eurozone-level domestic demand-led strategy’ (by targeted industrial and income policies) could potentially be beneficial in supporting a general sustained recovery of the recession in the Eurozone, because the empirical results reveal that the intra-Eurozone spillovers can significantly be exploited to increase the overall gains from coordinated action. Moreover, our analysis points out that stimulation of the manufacturing industries yields significant more benefits for each Eurozone country, in comparison to scenarios in which all industries would be stimulated. Secondly, with regards to reducing the macro-economic imbalances between the core and peripheral countries, our analysis suggests that it is not feasible to help re-balancing the Eurozone industrial structure by such spillover generating coordinated pro- grams of domestic public investments. The results of our stimulus scenarios clearly suggest that the intra-Eurozone spillover effects generate much smaller impacts on the peripheral countries while contributing much more to the core countries.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} report (TAM Report No. 80), the authors {{considered}} the buckling and post-buckling behavior {{of an ideal}} elastic cylindrical shell loaded by uniform external pressure on its lateral surface, and by an axial compressive force. Assumptions were introduced which reduced the shell to a system with one degree of freedom. The present investigation is a generalization and a refinement of this theory. The shell is treated as a system with 21 degrees of freedom. By the imposition of constraints on the 21 generalized coordinates, various end conditions can be realized; for example, simply supported ends with flexible end plates (no axial constraint), simply supported ends with rigid end plates, and clamped ends. Also, effects of reinforcing rings have been incorporated in a more general way than in TAM Report No. 80. The restrictive assumption that the centroidal axis of a ring coincides with the middle surface of the shell has been eliminated. A pressure-deflection curve for an ideal cylindrical shell that is loaded by external pressure has the general form shown in Figure 1. The falling part of the curve (dotted in the figure) represents unstable equilibrium configurations. Also, the continuation of line OE (dotted) represents unstable unbuckled configurations. Actually, the shell snaps from some configuration A to another configuration B, {{as indicated by the}} dashed line in Figure 1. Theoretically, point A coincides with the maximum point E on lhe curve, but initial imperfections and accidental disturbances prevent the shell from reaching this point. Point E is the buckling pressure of the classical infinitesimal theory (called the "Euler crítical pressure", since Euler applied the infinitesimal theory to columns). To some <b>extent,</b> <b>point</b> A is indeterminate, but it is presumably higher than the minimum point C unless the shell has excessive initial dents or lopsidedness. In TAM Report No. 80. a hypothesis of Tsien was used to locate point A. In the present investigation, point A is not considered. Rather, attention is focused on the development of a theory that will determine the en tire load-deflection curve. For short thick shells, such as the inter-ring bays of a submarine hull, the Euler critical pressures, determined by TAM Report No. 80, are too high, presumably because the assumption that the shell buckles without incremental hoop strain is inadmissible in this range. The present report corrects this error. Numerical data on the Euler critical pressures of shells with simply supported ends and flexible end plates have been obtained with the aid of lhe Illiac, an electronic digital computer. The data are tabulated {{at the end of this}} reporto For short shells without rings, the buckling pressures are appreciably lower than those determined by von Mises' theory. The numerical data for the Euler buckling pressures of sheUs with uniformly spaced reinforcing rings are sufficiently extensive to permit interpolation to estimate effects of various ring sizes. Some exploratory numerical investigations of post-buckling behavior have been conducted with the Illiac. lt is not feasible, at the present time, to handle nonlinear equilibrium problems for systems with 18 degrees of freedom. Consequently, for the numerical work, some higher harmonics were discarded so that the system was reduaed to 7 degrees of freedom. Even then, the numerical problem is formidable. The calculations were confined principally to the determination of the minimum point C on the post-buckling curve (Figure 1). The pressure at point C is the minimum pressure at which a buckled form can exist. It is found that the ordinate of point C, determined by TAM report No. 80, is somewhat too high. The two theories are compared by a table anq curves at the end of this report...|$|E

Experiments with spatial object datasets show that the BA-tree has the most robust performance. At the expense of some limited extra space, it offers a drastic improvement in query performance when compared with the R-tree approach (even when the nodes of the R-tree are augmented with aggregation information). Furthermore, we examine a novel variation of the box-sum problem, namely, the functional box-sum aggregation. Here object values are not constant but are described by functions. The participation of an object in the aggregation is then proportional to the intersection area between the object's extent and the query.

It appear however that the description of the flow through the glottis is usually oversimplified. To some <b>extent</b> this <b>point</b> could explain the limits of the model. This paper proposes a more precise description of the flow through the glottis. In particular a quasi-steady moving flow separation point is introduced. A validation of the theory under unsteady-flow conditions is presented here. The importance of the revised flow model for phonation modelling is evaluated and discussed using a simple model for the vocal cords based on the well-known two-mass model...|$|R
