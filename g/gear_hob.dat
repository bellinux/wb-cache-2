Abstract: {{numerical control}} system {{is used to}} control the <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> and gear blank in autorotation and linkage generative movement, to realize the machining of teeth shape and teeth dividing; {{and at the same}} time it controls the vertical displacement of the <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> and the horizontal displacement of gear blank, to make a circular arc track whose radius is the sum of gear blank’s radius and gear hob’s radius, thus realizing the NC machining of circular-arc aligned gear. Before and after the machining of teeth form, transition arc is used to finish the trimming and thinning of the teeth thickness at the teeth end; on the prerequisite of machining the circular-arc aligned gear, this method successfully solves the puzzle of gear chamfering, and discharges all gear burr into the lower end of the teeth. The advantage of this machining method lies in that when the hob cuts deeper, as the both side-blades are cutting the work-piece at the same time, the thinning on both sides are quite symmetrical, and the fine symmetry remains during the uniform change of the teeth thickness. So, the machining precision of the parts is prior to the requirements in the drawing, and this method yields good effect, which broadens the application of NC technology...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{the process}} chain for <b>gear</b> manufacturing, <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> {{is one of}} the most {{productive}} processes for soft machining of gears. To reach a high quality after the soft machining, for example in <b>gear</b> finish <b>hobbing,</b> the requirements on the hobbing process increases significantly. To get a high quality part after soft machining, the process of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> is mostly divided in a roughing and a finishing cut. In the roughing process, the most amount of the material needs to get machined. The finishing process is used to get a high quality shape of the gear and to get low surface roughness. To get low cutting forces in the finishing step, the material stock after the roughing process has to be minimized. A low amount of stock on the flank offers the possibility to use high cutting speeds. This paper deals with the investigation of the two cut processes in the <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing.</b> Especially, the tool life of different tool concepts are taken into account. The process design offers the opportunity to use the same tool for the roughing and the finishing cut or the choice of different tools.

40|$|Invalid {{measurement}} {{data are}} phenomena that plague {{the reliability of}} Coordinate Measurement Systems. The best-fit algorithms used for feature computation all amplify {{the influence of the}} points most distant from the mean. As a result, a single invalid point can significantly skew the computed feature parameters, even for large data sets. If the feature happens to be a datum, the error propagates through the measurement of the entire part. A measurement consisting of thousands of measured points can be ruined by a single bad piece of data. It is therefore desirable that invalid data be identified and removed before feature evaluation is performed. Three separate cases are considered. The first case is the problem of contact occurring on undesired surfaces. This type of problem can occur when measuring complex parts such as a <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> or when using a non-spherical probe. This case is the best suited for solution through the use of surface normal data since the change in surface normal between surfaces is large and easily detected. The remaining problem, the detection of invalid data due to dirt, burrs, porosity or external factors, is divided into 2 cases. The division is made based upon the spacing of the data collected. If the spacing is large, each point can only be considered independently. If the measurement data are dense we can use the relationship between points to refine the analysis...|$|E
40|$|The {{industrial}} development of metal cutting processes in gear manufacturing aims at continuously increasing productivity, including increased tool reliability. Basically, the parameters {{that have an}} influence on the cutting processes should be known and possible to control. Gear manufacturing is highly important for the automotive industry. The prevalent manufacturing method is gear hobbing with hobs consisting of solid Powder Metallurgical High Speed Steel (PM HSS) with Physical Vapor Deposited (PVD) coatings. The hob teeth have to be reconditioned before wear reaches such levels that the gear quality becomes impaired. Such wear often results in a total breakdown of the tool. One crucial {{reason for this is}} that hobbing processes for the present often lack reliability; which makes it difficult for the gear manufacturers to predict the tool wear on the hob teeth and decide when the tool should be replaced in order to avoid severe damages. A consequence of catastrophic tool wear is that it leads to an instantaneously changed geometry of the cutting edge, which in turn implies that the machined gears do not comply with the stipulated properties on the machined gear products. A single tooth milling test (STMT) with tools of PM-HSS in a conventional milling machine has been developed in this research project, aiming at characterizing the effect of tool preparation on the type of wear mechanism. The experience and conclusions from these tests may probably be transferred to real PM-HSS hob tooling (HT). The advantages of such a test, compared to a real <b>gear</b> <b>hob</b> test, are primarily the cost reductions and time saving aspects with respect to both the design and the manufacturing of the cutting teeth The research presented in this thesis is based on experimental investigations and theoretical studies of significant parameters, i. e. the surface roughness and edge rounding, contributing to the robust and reliable design of a PM-HSS cutting tool. The research work has in addition to, the development of the milling test method, also comprised development of measuring methods and a simulation model based on the Finite Element Model (FEM).

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{processes}} for producing transmission <b>gears</b> involve <b>hobbing,</b> milling or shaping of a forged stock {{to obtain the}} gear shape. Gears are typically formed by hobbing tools made from solid tooling material, such as tungsten carbide, and have dozens of teeth. The <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> process entails several teeth in cut simultaneously. Generation of in-volute tooth profiles results in varying chip loads from pass to pass. In this paper, details are provided for a finite element-based model of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> and milling processes. The model explicitly meshes gear cutter geometries with dozens of teeth. These cutters are used to simulate the complicated kinematic motion between tool and workpiece. Thermo-mechanical coupled calculations within an explicit dynamic formulation are per-formed on the tool and workpiece during chip removal. The complex geometry of involute tooth profiles results in complicated contact scenarios on the evolving workpiece geometry during tooth profile generation. Tooth-workpiece-chip contact is enforced rigorously and is particularly complicated with the confined space of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing.</b> Advanced adaptive meshing strategies are developed and employed to maintain {{the resolution of the}} tool-workpiece interaction while multiple teeth are in contact. Cutting forces, temperatures and stresses in the tool and workpiece are predicted for steel workpiece materials. Models are validated through a set of initially simplified experiments where incremental complexity is added, allowing for direct comparison between predicted and measured forces and chip shapes...|$|R

ArcelorMittal has developed specific programs for machinability testing in turning, {{low and high}} speed drilling and gear machining.

Gear machining {{is one of the}} main machining operations involved in powertrain manufacturing operations. The literature proposes many papers dealing with this process however there are too few studies interested in steel machinability evaluation while gear machining. This paper focuses on a particular gear manufacturing process, i. e. <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing,</b> and more precisely on steel machinability for <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> applications. Tools as well as kinematics of <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> are quite complex. This paper proposes a comprehensive experimental protocol for machinability testing.

This paper analyses the influence of steel composition and structure on machinability.

40|$|AbstractGear hobbing {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{productive}} manufacturing processes for cylindrical gears. The quality of the gears is a result of the tool quality, the precision of the workpiece, tool clamping and kinematics of the machine. The dry <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> process allows machining of gears with a quality according to the DIN standard of up to IT 5. To evaluate which gear quality is possible to machine with a given clamping and hob it is useful to simulate the process in advance. This is also an opportunity to order the required quality of the hob according to its application. The objective presented in this paper is to simulate non-ideal <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> processes and to calculate the geometry and topography of the workpiece. To achieve this goal, a simulation for continuous <b>gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> was developed. By calculating planar intersections of transverse sections of both gear and tool, the resulting gear geometry is determined. Beside it is possible to calculate different characteristic values for the hobbing process such as chip thickness and cutting volume. By an evaluation of tool and clamping tolerances these deviations can be used to modify the simulation model. Afterwards a non-ideal hobbing simulation can be performed and the resulting gear geometry can be analyzed using a virtual measurement machine. An advantage of this non-ideal simulation is also the possibility of calculating the tool load taking these deviations into account and to use the results for further process designs to reduce the risk of tool failure. The virtual measurement machine analyses the geometry according to VDI/VDE  2612 / 2607 and DIN  3961. The resulting measurements of the flank and lead lines can be used for a classification of the gear quality. By using this simulation program it is possible to reduce the costs and time effort of setting up a new hobbing process...|$|R

To reduce lubricant, especially for dry machin- ing of large modulus, it is necessary to compensate these thermal deviations. <b>Gear</b> <b>hobbing</b> is a very complex technology, where chip geometries are changing continuously.

For a better understanding, in addition numerical simulations are performed to calculate the heat flow and thermal distribution. Thereby, a two step simulation procedure was applied. The generated heat during chip formation was evaluated in the first step. The second step is a heat flow simulation, where the generated heat from the first step was used. In this simulation part, the heat flow and thermal deviations are calculated, and also chip removal is taken into account.

In this paper, the tooth quality of a <b>gear</b> manufactured by <b>hobs</b> with different quality classes is analysed using a simulation model in combination with Monte-Carlo methods. A statistical analysis of a commercial hob provides input to the Monte-Carlo model, where the axial and the radial deviations of these inserts are considered. Simulations are performed with different hob quality classes according to DIN 3968. The results from simulation are compared with experimental results of this actual <b>hob</b> at a <b>gear</b> manufacturer...|$|R
