5|$|Horses have a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> balance, due {{partly to}} their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly {{developed}} proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.|$|E
5|$|The Beagle is a {{breed of}} small hound {{that is similar}} in {{appearance}} to the much larger foxhound. The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare. With a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell and superior tracking instinct, the beagle is employed as detection dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world. The beagle is intelligent but single-minded. It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and lack of inherited health problems.|$|E
5|$|Hudson {{explained}} {{that they wanted to}} evolve the pseudo-turn-based combat of Knights of the Old Republic into a real-time third-person shooter interface. The combat was meant to offer the tactics and customization of a role-playing game, but through a simpler and more intuitive user interface. It was also designed so that players would not need to press many buttons to pull off the squad's different attack combinations. The team worked closely with Microsoft on several elements of the interface to make sure the combat was tactical enough, and went through a lot of trial and error to balance the combat between role-playing game and shooter. Creating a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> discovery was a major goal. Developers wanted the game to feature an actual galaxy that could be explored beyond the core story locations. Although a very large team manually built several parts of the galaxy, the tools and technologies they developed helped them extend the playable space significantly.|$|E

5|$|The {{house on}} Hadley Common was a citadel of riotous insolvency—not just at Christmas but every weekend. There was a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> {{in-depth}} back-up, a cellar, {{a barrel of}} malt whisky, a walk-in larder: proof against snowstorm or shutdown. I think it was that Christmas morning , that all four Amises, with breakfast trays on their laps, watched Journey to the Centre of the Earth—then the visit to the pub, then the day-long, the week-long lunch. And with Kingsley the hub of all humour and high spirits, like an engine of comedy... I felt so secure in that house—and, clearly, so insecure elsewhere—that I always experienced a caress of apprehension as I climbed into the car on Sunday night, any Sunday night, {{and headed back to}} the motorway and Monday, to the flat or the flatlet, the street, the job, the tramp dread, the outside world.|$|E

25|$|Tomb figurines in the Tang dynasty {{were made}} to be {{visually}} compelling and it is especially obvious when they are seen in an entire set, or when compared with figurines of other dynasties. The intricate details of each figurine’s craftsmanship imbue them with a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> physical presence and identity. Their personalised facial expressions and postures distinguish each figurine in an imaginable time and space.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{release of}} Barber's Symphony No. 2 was widely criticized for various reasons. Several critics {{felt that the}} work {{was little more than}} war time propaganda. Many people complained about the inclusion of the electronic tone-generator in a symphonic work. Despite much criticism, the work also received many positive reviews. The work was generally viewed as Barber's most ambitious and contemporary work. There was a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> tension and energy in the work that was palpable to audiences.|$|E
25|$|Muto {{went to war}} in China {{flying with}} the 12th Air Group. He earned his first air victory on 4 December 1937 during the Battle of Nanking when he shot down a Soviet-made Polikarpov I-16. Muto {{continued}} fighting in China, flying many sorties over Hankou to become an ace with five victories. For his distinguished service, he was honored with an official commendation on 30 April 1938. Among his fellow pilots on the ground, he was well-liked for his <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor.|$|E

25|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field: A {{number of}} moths use the Earth's magnetic field to navigate, as {{a study of}} the stray heart and dart suggests. Another study, this time of the migratory behaviour of the silver Y, showed that this species, even at high altitudes, can correct its course with changing winds, and prefers flying with favourable winds, which suggests a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> direction. Aphrissa statira in Panama loses its navigational capacity when exposed to a magnetic field, suggesting it uses the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|The young O'Keefe was {{intelligent}} and perceptive, with a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour, although his school grades fluctuated {{due to his}} misbehaviour {{and the fact that}} he was easily distracted; Sydney radio personality Gary O'Callaghan, who was a classmate, later recalled that O'Keefe was often in trouble. During his time at high school Johnny joined the school cadets, where he made good progress learning trumpet, and he (reluctantly) sang solo in the school choir. He was also a keen swimmer, surfer and sailor and often sailed with the Vaucluse Juniors sailing club.|$|E
25|$|Howard White's friend Kenny Raught, who {{had worked}} in Howard's Bake Shop in Scranton, had a talent for words and a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humor. He joined the group in New York and became their writer. He later married their sister Mildred. The trio moved their parents and sister to New York, and soon older sister Edith and her husband {{followed}} to be near them. The family remained very close, living either {{in the same house}} or within a few blocks of each other throughout most of their career. The family's closeness was reflected in the style of their performance, which was always family-friendly and had a certain wholesomeness that was appealing to much of their audience.|$|E

25|$|After several {{releases}} on the Bugge Wesseltoft label Jazzland, {{he released}} the album Dream Logic (2012) {{on the label}} ECM, where he collaborated closely with Jan Bang and Erik Honoré on the production and timbral design of melodies, sound sculptures and soundscapes. Aarset is a pioneering guitarist with a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> electronics sound and expressiveness, and often the guitar plays a role as manipulable sound source and tool for layer-by-layer routing more than a traditional melody. His style {{is often associated with}} that of nu jazz, and his performance, improvising and albums feature, a strong 21'st century electronic influence. He is considered {{to be one of the}} unique re-interpretations of what the role and sound of the electric guitarist can be.|$|E
25|$|Pressburger was a diffident {{and private}} person who, at times, {{particularly}} {{later on in}} his life, could be hypersensitive and prone to bouts of melancholia. He loved French cuisine, enjoyed music, and possessed a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> humour. In appearance he was short, wore glasses, and had a sagacious, bird-like facial expression. He was a keen supporter of Arsenal F.C., a passion he developed soon after arriving in Britain. From 1970 he lived in Aspall, Suffolk and he died {{in a nursing home}} in nearby Saxtead on 5 February 1988, due to the complications of old age and pneumonia. He is interred in the cemetery of Our Lady of Grace Church, Aspall. His is the only grave in that Church of England graveyard with a Star of David.|$|E
25|$|From his {{writings}} and {{the testimony of}} all who knew him, Ryelandt appears first and foremost as {{a man with a}} <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> duty. Duty towards God above all: he was a deeply religious man, who tried to go to mass every day, who was knowledgeable about his religion, and who conceived of his music making as a religious duty. Duty towards his music: he was privileged in being able to devote himself exclusively to music, but he was highly conscious this was a privilege and worked very hard, both as a student of Tinel (who drove him hard) and as a composer. Towards his family: he was always extremely solicitous of his wife, but especially during her illness, when he would organize serenades for her as she could no longer attend concerts; he made time for his children, considering their education extremely important, and encouraging them; and he was “Bon-Papa Musique” for his grandchildren, for whom he played his Scènes Enfantines. Towards his students, whose work he corrected with respect instead of denigrating it, and who greatly appreciated his teaching qualities: “Even though he followed the classical method of teaching harmony and counterpoint …, you never had the impression that you were learning something boring,” wrote one of them.|$|E

500|$|Labradors are an {{intelligent}} breed {{with a good}} work ethic and generally good temperaments. [...] Common working roles for Labradors include: hunting, tracking and detection (they have a <b>great</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell which helps when working in these areas), disabled-assistance, carting, and therapy work. Approximately 60–70% of all guide dogs in Canada are Labradors; other common breeds are Golden Retrievers and German Shepherds.|$|E

He had this blasting genius of instinctively looking at a show and knowing if it should be on the air. He could also be ruthless and distant ... But Bill was intuitive about both the business and creative sides of TV. And he genuinely disliked Beverly Hillbillies. I put it on the schedule anyway.|$|E
