Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946.

Global aid organizations contributed to the subsequent recovery effort; immediate life-saving needs were met within days, but the damage to Jamaica's infrastructure and economy took much longer to repair. With loans and <b>grants</b> <b>from</b> the local government, the European Union, and the United Nations, normality was restored by the following summer.|$|E
