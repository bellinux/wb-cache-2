Then their common resolve to be as spirited as possible had obliterated all minor considerations. But that was the limit of their unanimity. Amanda loved wild and picturesque things, and Benham strong and clear things; the vines and brushwood amidst the ruins of Salona that had delighted her had filled him with a sense of tragic retrogression. Salona had revived again in the acutest form a dispute that had been smouldering between them throughout a fitful and lengthy exploration of north and central Italy. She could not understand his disgust with the mediaeval colour and confusion that had swamped the pride and state of the Roman empire, and he could not make her feel the ambition of the ruler, the essential <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> of his aristocratic idea. While his adventurousness was conquest, hers, it was only too manifest, was brigandage. His thoughts ran now into the form of an imaginary discourse, that he would never deliver to her, on the decay of states, on the triumphs of barbarians over rulers who will not rule, on the relaxation of patrician orders and the return of the robber and assassin as lordship decays. This coast was no theatrical scenery for him; it was a shattered empire. And it was shattered because no men had been found, united enough, magnificent and steadfast enough, to hold the cities, and maintain the roads, keep the peace and subdue the brutish hates and suspicions and cruelties that devastated the world.|$|E

What reusable and interchangeable means is also somewhat vague; although several approaches to build modelling frameworks have been developed, little attention has been dedicated to the intrinsic re-usability of components, in particular between different modelling frameworks. In this paper, we focus on how models can be linked together to build complex integrated models. We stress that even if a model component interface is clear and reusable from a software standpoint, this is not a sufficient condition for reusing a component across different integrated modelling frameworks. This reveals the need for adding rich semantics in model interfaces. © 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Clinical research has been conducted on 50 respondents to view the individual breathing pattern rate of alteration.

The first is a degree of antipathy to informal finance, exemplified by Rozental's complaint that: [Moneylenders in the unorganized sector] create a pattern of interest rates which weigh heavily on those least able to bear the explicit or imputed costs of borrowing [...] . they perpetuate forms of behaviour not conducive to social <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> (Rozental 1970 : 18). The second is the notion that economic development can be encouraged by promoting financial develop-ment. This was presumably the intent of the ILO's recommendation that: [...] . the total scale of financial resources in the organized sector must be greatly expanded so that those who are at present using the unorganized system, and those who have had to rely on self-finance, can be accom-modated (ILO 1974 : 242). Both these views suffered from tunnel vision. Those who criticized informal finance either were not aware of, or simply chose to ignore, the wide variety of financing arrangements which characterized it [...] preferring instead {{to think in terms of}} the harsh moneylender stereotype.

(2000, Journal of Financial Economics 58 (1 – 2), 81 – 112) {{show that}} {{corporate}} control is substantially enhanced by using pyramid structures and cross-holdings by firms in nine East Asian countries. Claessens et al. (1999, SSRN Working Paper; 2002, Journal of Finance 57 (2), 2741 – 2771) provide empirical evidence regarding expropriation {{arising from the}} separation of cash flow from voting rights in Asian firms. Their analysis suggests {{a high degree of}} expropriation in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand. We re-examine the problem of expropriation in Asian firms reported by earlier research. We explore firm-level governance-control structure interactions, and control-legal environment interaction for a set of Asian firms for which we are able to obtain relevant data for all the required variables. The major contribution of this paper is that it jointly examines ownership-control structure, firm level governance and country-level legal protection available to external suppliers of capital. Using post-crisis data, we find a strong country effect in governance. In general, high control firms in countries with weak legal protection have lower firm-level governance scores in general. On the other hand, high control firms, in countries which have a stronger legal protection environment, signal their intention to not expropriate minority shareholders' wealth by voluntarily adopting measures to strengthen their <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> scores. Contrary to earlier findings, we do not find a relationship between control-ownership wedge and firm value. Furthermore, we do not find any relation between firm-level governance and firm value as measured by Tobin's Q. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The lung {{transplant}} is {{the only}} option of survival of the patient affected by a deadly lung disease. The outpatient clinic follow-up requires the patient <b>discipline</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> {{in the face of}} complex care suggested by the multidisciplinary team.   Objectives: Meet aspects related to adhesion to treatment and self-care of patients submitted to the lung transplant, accompanied, in outpatients, in a referral hospital in Fortaleza-Ceará-Brazil. Methods: Exploratory research with qualitative approach, in a referral hospital in cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases in Fortaleza-Ceará, in the period September 2015 to January 2016. 10 patients transplanted lung were interviewed, after approval by the ethics committee of this institution. The Organization and analysis of the data was backed up on phenomenological and theoretical saturation used to meet the significant units. Results: It was noticed the strong bond established by patients and professionals of the team that accompanies them. That bond is characterized by a relationship of trust between patient and professional, stimulating attendance and adhesion of the transplanted in outpatient visits. Outpatient consultations in lung transplant marked commitment, the accuracy of both periodical transplanted as part of some professional multidisciplinary team. On the other hand, it was observed the lack of autonomy of some categories. Conclusion: The treatment is complex and requires a commitment of both transplanted and the professionals who make up the lung transplant team. There was the patient's commitment in to adhere to consultations and interest in following the guidance of care. Is necessary joint participation and integral of all categories, in order to promote multiple interventions and educational practices in the singular therapeutic plan of transplanted...|$|R
