5|$|During the Civil War, the {{infrastructure}} of St. Louis suffered from neglect; another cholera epidemic struck in 1866, and typhoid fever raged. In response, St. Louis improved its water system and established a Board of <b>Health</b> <b>to</b> regulate polluting industries. St. Louis's park system was expanded during the 1860s and 1870s, {{with the creation of}} Tower Grove Park and Forest Park.|$|E

An advocate of healthy living, Hsu often gave public talks at schools, welfare homes, and hospitals in Singapore and overseas about health and service to the needy. When asked about the secret of her good health and longevity, Hsu attributed her good <b>health</b> <b>to</b> a spartan lifestyle, vegetarian diet, and to her positive attitude towards life.|$|E

5|$|After much delay, the new Massachusetts Constitution {{finally went}} into effect in October 1780. To no one's surprise, Hancock was elected Governor of Massachusetts in a landslide, garnering over 90% of the vote. In the absence of formal party politics, the contest was one of personality, popularity, and patriotism. Hancock was immensely popular and unquestionably {{patriotic}} given his personal sacrifices and his leadership of the Second Continental Congress. James Bowdoin, his principal opponent, was cast by Hancock's supporters as unpatriotic, citing among other things his refusal (which was due to poor <b>health)</b> <b>to</b> serve in the First Continental Congress. Bowdoin's supporters, who were principally well-off commercial interests from Massachusetts coastal communities, cast Hancock as a foppish demagogue who pandered to the populace.|$|E
5|$|Betances, who had {{collected}} {{more money in}} France for the Party than the plan's potential cost, grew weary of the Cuban revolutionary movement's diminishing support of the Puerto Rico independence cause.

At least two of them insulted him publicly, and even took advantage of Simplicia Jiménez's mental <b>health</b> <b>to</b> have her harass her husband systematically.|$|E

40|$|Health {{literacy}} {{has emerged}} as an important factor related <b>to</b> <b>health</b> in older persons. The reason for the link between health literacy and health outcomes is not clear. Possible explanations include common relations among income, education, access <b>to</b> <b>health</b> care, health-promotion behaviors, frequency of reading, and perceptual impairments. In this study we investigate the relation of <b>health</b> literacy <b>to</b> self-reported <b>health</b> status and explore {{the impact of these}} explanatory variables on this relation in persons aged 40 years and older who participated in the 2003 U. S. National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL). Using regression models, we evaluated the impact of potential explanatory variables on the relation of <b>health</b> literacy <b>to</b> self-reported <b>health</b> status. Regression models confirmed previously-observed relations of health literacy, age, income, and education <b>to</b> <b>health.</b> The inclusion of income and education significantly decreased the relation of <b>health</b> literacy <b>to</b> <b>health.</b> While other variables, such as health maintenance and preventive health behaviors, were significantly related <b>to</b> <b>health,</b> they did not change the relation of <b>health</b> literacy <b>to</b> <b>health.</b> Even after taking multiple explanatory variables into account, the relation between health literacy and health status remained significant, suggesting that they alone do not completely account for the observed relation. Some other factor or combination of factors may account for the relation of <b>health</b> literacy <b>to</b> <b>health...</b>|$|R
5|$|Blaine {{had always}} {{believed}} his <b>health</b> <b>to</b> be fragile, {{and by the}} time he joined Harrison’s cabinet he truly was unwell. The years at the State Department also brought Blaine personal tragedy as two of his children, Walker and Alice, died suddenly in 1890. Another son, Emmons, died in 1892. With these family issues and his declining health, Blaine decided to retire and announced that he would resign from the cabinet on June 4, 1892. Because of their growing animosity, and because Blaine’s resignation came three days before the 1892 Republican National Convention began, Harrison suspected that Blaine was preparing to run against him for the party’s nomination for president.|$|E
5|$|By 1795, Bonaparte {{had become}} engaged to Désirée Clary, {{daughter}} of François Clary. Désirée's sister Julie Clary had married Bonaparte's elder brother Joseph. In April 1795, {{he was assigned}} to the Army of the West, which was engaged in the War in the Vendée—a civil war and royalist counter-revolution in Vendée, a region in west central France on the Atlantic Ocean. As an infantry command, it was a demotion from artillery general—for which the army already had a full quota—and he pleaded poor <b>health</b> <b>to</b> avoid the posting.|$|E

She was too overcome to speak and John Makini Kapena, one of her brother's minister, had to address the people on her behalf. After the visit, {{in the name of}} her brother, Liliʻuokalani made Father Damien a knight commander of the Royal Order of Kalākaua for his service to her subjects. She also convinced the governmental board of <b>health</b> <b>to</b> set aside land for a leprosy hospital at Kakaʻako. She made a second visit to the settlement with Queen Kapiolani in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{was obsessed}} with his <b>health</b> <b>to</b> the point of hypochondria, {{consulting}} many doctors and other practitioners for what he described to his captors in Britain as {{a long list of}} ailments involving the kidneys, colon, gall bladder, bowels and heart. Like Hitler, Hess was a vegetarian, and he did not smoke or drink. He brought his own food to the Berghof, claiming it was biologically dynamic, but Hitler did not approve of this practice, so he discontinued taking meals with the Führer.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, {{the sector}} was in crisis, {{characterized}} by low investment, poor cost recovery and poor service quality {{in most of}} the country. As a result, the government decided to break up INSFOPAL {{at the end of the}} 1980s and to devolve the responsibility for service provision back to the municipalities after four decades, except for some cases like the Valle de Cauca department, where the regional companies continued providing the services. Furthermore, the institutional responsibility for the sector was transferred from the Ministry of <b>Health</b> <b>to</b> the Ministry of Economic Development. This change was not only an administrative change, but it introduced a different focus and perspective to the sector.|$|E

In December 2009, Nicholas suffered serious spinal injuries in a horse riding accident. He crushed his vertebrae in the fall.
