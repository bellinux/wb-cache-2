A quasi-experimental trial involving pre- and post-intervention mapping of routes to school by active and <b>inactive</b> <b>mode</b> of travel and surveys of "stage of behaviour change" and motivations for and barriers to actively commuting to school. The intervention school participated in a school-based active travel project for one school term. Active travel was integrated into the curriculum and participants used interactive travel-planning resources at home. The control school participated in before and after measurements but did not receive the intervention. Setting: Two primary schools in Scotland with similar socioeconomic and demographic profiles. Two classes of primary 5 children and their families and teachers. Main results: Post intervention, the mean distance travelled to school by walking by intervention children increased significantly from baseline, from 198 to 772 m (389 % increase). In the control group mean distance walked increased from 242 to 285 m (17 % increase). The difference between the schools was significant (t (38) = 4. 679, p< 0. 001 (95 % confidence interval 315 to 795 m)). Post intervention, the mean distance travelled to school by car by intervention children reduced significantly from baseline, from 2018 to 933 m (57. 5 % reduction).

40|$|AbstractBased upon an {{extensive}} single-channel data set, a Markov model for types I and II inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP 3 R) is developed. The model aims to represent accurately the kinetics of both receptor types of IP 3 R {{depending on the}} concentrations of inositol trisphosphate (IP 3), adenosine trisphosphate (ATP), and intracellular calcium (Ca 2 +). In particular, the model takes into account that for some combinations of ligands the IP 3 R switches between extended periods of inactivity alternating with intervals of bursting activity (mode changes). In a first step, the <b>inactive</b> and active <b>modes</b> are modeled separately. It is found that, within modes, both receptor types are ligand-independent. In a second step, the submodels are connected by transition rates. Ligand-dependent regulation of the channel activity is achieved by modulating these transitions between active and <b>inactive</b> <b>modes.</b> As a result, a compact representation of the IP 3 R is obtained that accurately captures stochastic single-channel dynamics including mode changes in a model with six states and 10 rate constants, only {{two of which are}} ligand-dependent...|$|R

In <b>inactive</b> <b>mode,</b> sensor nodes do not sense and transmit any data, which makes the energy consumption to be minimized.

40|$|In {{the present}} work, we study the {{vibrational}} spectrum of ammonia in full dimensionality (6 D), with {{special emphasis on}} the tunneling splitting. The inversion motion, i. e., the active mode v(2), is indeed relatively well decoupled from the other five <b>inactive</b> <b>modes.</b> Therefore, an adiabatic separation in an active wave function and an inactive one, approximated with a 5 D-harmonic basis function, is certainly well adapted to describing this motion. This separation leads to several 1 D-effective Hamiltonians for each 5 D-harmonic basis function or adiabatic channel. Two models have been tested: the harmonic adiabatic approximation (HADA), when only one channel is used and the coupled HADA (cHADA), when several channels are coupled. In order to get reliable values for tunneling splitting, our calculations have shown that: (i) the calculation of the electronic potential has to be performed with a large atomic basis set (up to quintuple zeta) with a method including core-valence correlation; (ii) the cHADA is required since the HADA overestimates the energy levels. Furthermore, our values for the tunneling splitting are in good agreement with the experimental data of ammonia and several isotopomers. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

Each cluster chooses its transmission frequency band based on its knowledge of the interference that it experiences.

For some specific cases of spatial distributions of the clusters in the network, asymptotic bounds on the performance of the algorithm are derived and comparisons to the performance of optimal centralized solutions are made. These analytic results and additional simulation studies verify performance close to that of an optimum centralized frequency allocation algorithm.

The molecule has active CH local modes interacting with an <b>inactive</b> reservoir of <b>modes.</b> It is shown that the anharmonicity of these local modes and the intermolecular effects can conspire to make the relationship between the linewidth of the overtone and the intramolecular decay time nonstraightforward, especially at high energies...|$|R
40|$|A {{new group}} of {{chemical}} agents with pronounced antibacterial activities is pre-sented. Different nitrothiazole derivatives, but not all, exhibit antibacterial activi-ties {{similar to that of}} niridazole (AmbilharR), a nitrothiazolyl-imidazolidinone. Certain aerobic bacteria are moderately susceptible to these agents. The efficacy of these agents is almost comparable to that of ampicillin and tetracyline. It is much better than the efficacy of nitrofuran derivatives, the nitroimidazole deriva-tives being <b>inactive.</b> The <b>mode</b> of action of the nitrothiazole derivatives is bacteri-cidal. Against anaerobic bacteria the nitrothiazole derivatives are unique, since the extremely low MIC's are not approached by any other of the nitro-compounds nor by any other of the common antibiotics tested, such as clindamycin, ampi-cillin and tetracycline. It is suggested that the nitrogroup of the nitrothiazole ring moiety represents the chemical structure responsible for their excellent antibacterial activities...|$|R
