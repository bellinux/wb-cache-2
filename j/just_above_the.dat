5|$|All known {{cnidaria}} can reproduce asexually {{by various}} means, {{in addition to}} regenerating after being fragmented. Hydrozoan polyps only bud, while the medusae of some hydrozoans can divide down the middle. Scyphozoan polyps can both bud and split down the middle. In addition to both of these methods, Anthozoa can split horizontally <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> base. Asexual reproduction makes the daughter cnidarian a clone of the adult.|$|E

5|$|Connecting the {{forebrain}} to the midbrain is the diencephalon (in the diagram, {{this structure}} {{is below the}} optic lobes and consequently not visible). The diencephalon performs functions associated with hormones and homeostasis. The pineal body lies <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> diencephalon. This structure detects light, maintains circadian rhythms, and controls color changes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} months, the city {{regularly}} hosts WaterFire, an environmental art installation {{that consists of}} about 100 bonfires which blaze <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface of the three rivers that pass {{through the middle of}} downtown Providence. There are multiple Waterfire events that are accompanied by various pieces of classical and world music. The public art displays change on a regular basis, most notably the sculptures.|$|E

5|$|Some Cryolophosaurus bones have pathologies {{that show}} {{evidence}} of scavenging. Broken teeth {{from at least}} two different theropods have also been found nearby. Another possible pathology {{is found in the}} astragalus (ankle bone) of Cryolophosaurus. This bone was preserved with a small splint from the fibula located <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ankle. The splint, however, may also be just a unique morphological feature of Cryolophosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The larvae have silk glands {{which are}} located on the labium. These glands are {{modified}} salivary glands. They use these silk glands to make silk for cocoons and shelters. Located below the labrum are the mandibles. On {{each side of the}} head there are usually six stemmata <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> mandibles. These stemmata are arranged in a semicircle. Below the stemmata there is a small pair of antennae, one on each side.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> {{far end of}} the tube to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. The tube is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once {{there is no longer a}} need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E

(Substellar objects below this limit are known as brown dwarfs.) The radius of Wolf 359 is {{an estimated}} 16% of the Sun's radius, or about 110,000 km. For comparison, the equatorial radius of the planet Jupiter is 71,492 km, which is 65% as large as Wolf 359's.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca and the {{surrounding}} area (Cluj County) had a rate of 268 criminal convictions per 100,000 inhabitants during 2006, <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> national average. After the revolution in 1989, the criminal conviction rate in the county entered a phase of sustained growth, reaching a historic high of 429 in 1998, when it began to fall. Although the overall crime rate is reassuringly low, petty crime can be an irritant for foreigners, as in other large cities of Romania. During the 1990s, two large financial institutions, Banca Dacia Felix and Caritas, went bankrupt due to large-scale fraud and embezzlement.|$|E

5|$|He {{made his}} debut in {{international}}-class chess at the strong London 1932 tournament, which World Champion Alexander Alekhine won. Milner-Barry's best results in international competition were achieved in three straight {{years at the}} Margate tournaments from 1937–39, and at Hastings 1938. In all four events he finished <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> middle against strong fields, with performance ratings (as calculated by Chessmetrics) between 2538 and 2565. This places him at a solid International Master standard, although he never received this title. He reached as high as No. 65 in the world between June and August 1941, according to Chessmetrics, which ranks historical chess performances retrospectively, using modern algorithms.|$|E
5|$|In June 1956 {{some more}} {{wreckage}} from G-ALYP was accidentally trawled up {{from an area}} about 15 miles south of where the original wreckage had been found. This wreckage was from the starboard side of the cabin <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> three front windows. Subsequent examination at Farnborough suggested that the primary failure was probably near to this area {{rather than at the}} rear automatic direction finding window {{on the roof of the}} cabin as had been previously thought. These findings were kept secret until the details were published in 2015.|$|E

Three coats of arms also decorate the postern gate; the central arms is that of Sir Robert Knolles, who Edward Dalyngrigge had fought for in the Hundred Years' War, but those flanking it are blank.|$|E

5|$|Just {{two and a}} {{half months}} later, though, the MTA stated that it was unable to open the subway {{extension}} for service until April to July 2015, due to the failure to get the inclined elevators to work properly. Problems with the security and fire alarm systems were also blamed for the delays. A December 2014 New York Post article attributed the delay to Hudson Yards' developer, The Related Companies', need to dig caissons for the foundations, <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> subway station, and the foundation work needed to be complete before the MTA could open the station. Continuing trouble with the fire and security alarms in March 2015 would delay the opening until summer.|$|E
5|$|Keynsham {{is located}} where the River Chew meets the River Avon. Fishing {{rights for the}} Millground and Chewton {{sections}} of the Chew are owned by Keynsham Angling Club. The Mill Ground stretch of the River Chew consists of the six fields on the western bank from Chewton Place at Chewton Keynsham to the Albert Mill. The water is home to Chub, Roach, European perch and Rudd, along with good numbers of Gudgeon, Dace and Trout. Keynsham Lock on the Avon opened in 1727. <b>Just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> lock are some visitor moorings and a pub, on an island between the lock and the weir. The weir {{side of the island}} is also the mouth of the River Chew.|$|E
5|$|Late in 1910, the BX {{fulfilled}} {{a heroic}} role. The Chilco {{had been on}} its way up from Quesnel to Fort George in late November with Fort George's winter food supply when it met with an accident <b>just</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Cottonwood Canyon and the food had to be transported back to Quesnel. When news of this reached Fort George, pioneers Al Johnson and Russell Peden snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne to make one last run with the BX with the necessary supplies. By then ice had begun to form along the river, but Captain Browne consented and brought the BX to Fort George, without {{as much as a}} scratch on her paint.|$|E
