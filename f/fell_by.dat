5|$|Crime {{increased}} between 1981 and 1995, but <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 42% in {{the period}} 1995–2006. The prison population doubled over the same period, giving it the highest incarceration rate in Western Europe at 147 per 100,000. Her Majesty's Prison Service, reporting to the Ministry of Justice, manages most prisons, housing over 85,000 convicts.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{positive}} reviews however, The Swarm failed to increase attendance. In fact, park gate figures <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 200,000 following {{the addition of}} the coaster. The park as well as many others have blamed the park's branding from 2009 to 2012 as the issue.|$|E
5|$|Eight {{percent of}} the English adult male {{population}} is estimated to have died during the war, a rather large percentage by most standards. The impact on the Native Americans was far higher, however. So many were killed, fled, or shipped off as slaves that the entire Native American population of New England <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> sixty to eighty percent.|$|E

5|$|Like {{other large}} whales, the {{humpback}} was {{a target for}} the whaling industry. Once hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction, its population <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, entanglement in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.|$|E

5|$|The average {{household}} size has decreased, with more people living {{alone or in}} smaller households. Between 2005 and 2010, the number of households containing just one adult increased by five per cent {{and the number of}} two adult households increased by eight per cent, while the number of households containing one adult <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 11 per cent and the number of households containing two or more adults with children <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> three per cent. The number of households containing three or more adults increased by 11 per cent. These changes in household composition contributed to a four per cent {{increase in the number of}} households in Scotland between 2005 and 2010, which was higher than the increase in the population over this time (2.5 per cent).|$|E
5|$|Thus 65 new county {{seats and}} 65 new borough seats {{were created in}} England and Wales. The total number of English members <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 17 and the number in Wales {{increased}} by four.

5|$|Alfonsín {{began his}} term with many {{economic}} problems. The foreign debt was nearly 43billion dollars {{by the end}} of the year, and the country had narrowly prevented a sovereign default in 1982. During that year, the gross domestic product <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 5.6%, and the manufacturing profits by 55%. Unemployment was at nearly 10%, and inflation was nearly 209%. It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive the needed foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion. Possible solutions such as a devaluation of the currency, privatization of industry, or restrictions on imports, would probably have proven to be unpopular.|$|E

Al Arabiya reported that the military council said it would sack the cabinet and dissolve parliament, although they only did the latter. Celebrations and car honking were reported in Alexandria and Cairo. Celebratory gunfire in Gaza.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries exacerbated the sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|For several years, for {{a variety}} of reasons, Buxton's study of botany <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> the wayside, but in 1833 he {{attended}} a botanical meeting in Prestwich, where he met his old acquaintances. He became a regular attendee at local botanical meetings, including one at Blackley, where he met James Crowther. They became firm friends and, in search of plants, explored Chorlton, Withington, Didsbury and many other regions of Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Wales.|$|E

5|$|In September 2009 a {{trial was}} {{undertaken}} {{to turn off}} traffic lights in Portishead. It was conducted in association with North Somerset Council, Martin Cassini and Colin Buchanan. The change was made permanent after some journey times reportedly <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> over 50% with no measured reduction in pedestrian safety, despite greater numbers now using the route (over 2000 vehicles and 300 pedestrians an hour).|$|E
5|$|In late 2000, Juniper {{formed a}} joint venture with Ericsson to develop and market network {{switches}} for internet traffic on mobile devices, and with Nortel for fiber optic technology. In 2001, Juniper introduced a technical certification program and was involved in the first optical internet network in China. Juniper's growth slowed in 2001 as the telecommunications sector experienced a slowdown and revenues <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> two-thirds during the dot-com bust. 9 to 10% of its workforce was laid off.|$|E
5|$|It was {{announced}} on May 18, 1998 {{that the show}} would debut on Tuesdays at 9:30 as part of ABC's comedy block, following Home Improvement, The Hughleys and Spin City. The series debuted on ABC in the opening week of the 1998–99 television season, on September 22, 1998. ABC finished behind CBS in viewing figures for the opening week of programming, while ratings across the networks <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 4million compared to the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Late on October23, {{radar imagery}} {{depicted}} {{the formation of}} a secondary outer eyewall, indicative of an eyewall replacement cycle. By 20:30UTC, the final pass by reconnaissance, the hurricane's flight-level winds <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 60mph (95km/h) and its central pressure rose at 8mbar (hPa; 0.24inHg) per hour. Coinciding with the eyewall replacement cycle was an increase in southwesterly wind shear, a factor that further accelerated Patricia's degradation. The hurricane's eye soon became cloud-filled and rapid weakening ensued at an unprecedented pace.|$|E
5|$|No {{recession}} of the post-World War II era has come {{anywhere near the}} depth of the Great Depression. In the Great Depression, GDP <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 27% (the deepest after demobilization is the recession beginning in December 2007, during which GDP has fallen 5.1% as of the second quarter of 2009) and unemployment rate reached 10% (the highest since was the 10.8% rate reached during the 1981–82 recession).|$|E
5|$|Social changes also {{occurred}} in this time, most markedly {{with the decline}} in authority of the Catholic Church. The financial crisis that began in 2008 dramatically ended this period of boom. GDP <b>fell</b> <b>by</b> 3% in 2008 and by 7.1% in 2009, the worst year since records began (although earnings by foreign-owned businesses continued to grow). The state has since experienced deep recession, with unemployment, which doubled during 2009, remaining above 14% in 2012.|$|E
