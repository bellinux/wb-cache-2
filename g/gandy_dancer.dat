50|$|In the United States, early section {{crews were}} often {{made up of}} recent {{immigrants}} and ethnic minorities who vied for steady work despite poor wages and working conditions, and hard physical labor. The Chinese, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans in the Western United Stares, the Irish in the Midwestern United States, and East Europeans and Italians in the Northeastern United States all worked as <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers.</b> Though all <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> sang railroad songs, {{it may be that}} African American <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> from the Southern United States, with a long tradition of using song to coordinate work, were unique in their use of task-related work chants.|$|R
50|$|While most {{southern}} railroad maintenance {{workers were}} African American, <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> were not strictly southern or African American. Section crews were often {{made up of}} recent immigrants and ethnic minorities who vied for steady work despite poor wages and working conditions, and hard physical labor. The Chinese, Mexican Americans, and Native Americans in the West, the Irish in the Midwest, and East Europeans and Italians in the Northeast laid and maintained track as well. Though all <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> sang railroad songs, {{it may be that}} black <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers,</b> with a long tradition of using song to coordinate work, were unique in their use of task-related work chants.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Gandy</b> <b>dancer</b> is a slang {{term used}} for early {{railroad}} workers, more formally {{referred to as}} [...] "section hands", who laid and maintained railroad tracks {{in the years before}} the work was done by machines.The British equivalents of the term <b>gandy</b> <b>dancer</b> are [...] "navvy" [...] (from [...] "navigator"), originally builders of canals or [...] "inland navigations", for builders of railway lines, and [...] "platelayer" [...] for workers employed to inspect and maintain the track. In the Southwestern United States and Mexico, Mexican and Mexican-American track workers were colloquially [...] "traqueros".|$|E

5000|$|... "The Gandy Dancers' Ball" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by Frankie Laine in 1951, but with <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> as actual dancers at a railroad workers' ball. Laine sang it with a chorus of dancers in the 1955 comedy film Bring Your Smile Along.|$|R

50|$|Field hollers, {{cries and}} hollers {{of the slaves}} and later sharecroppers working in cotton fields, prison chain gangs, railway gangs (<b>Gandy</b> <b>dancers)</b> or {{turpentine}} camps are seen as the precursor to the call and response of African American spirituals and gospel music, to jug bands, minstrel shows, stride piano, and ultimately to the blues, to rhythm and blues, jazz and to African American music in general.|$|R
5000|$|In early May 1883, {{the push}} {{was on to}} {{complete}} the Canadian Pacific Railway line from just east of Walsh to Medicine Hat. Crews of <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> worked hard, building the rail line through 20 Mile Post, and reaching Medicine Hat on May 31. [...] Trains brought Europeans with high hopes for their futures to the area. Today, lengthy freight trains roll through Irvine {{in the blink of}} an eye.|$|R
50|$|Handcars {{have been}} {{normally}} used by railway service personnel (the latter {{also known as}} <b>Gandy</b> <b>dancers)</b> for railroad inspection and maintenance. Because of their low weight and small size, they can be put on and taken off the rails at any place, allowing trains to pass. Handcars have since been replaced by self-propelled vehicles {{that do not require}} the use of manual power, instead relying on internal combustion engines or electricity to move the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Singer/political activist Bruce [...] "Utah" [...] Phillips, in Moose Turd Pie, told a tall tale {{of working}} as a <b>gandy</b> <b>dancer</b> in the American southwest.

5000|$|The <b>Gandy</b> <b>Dancer</b> State Trail is a 47-mile rail {{trail for}} hiking, biking and other {{recreational}} uses, {{that follows the}} old Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie railroad grade from St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin, through a bit of eastern Minnesota and terminating in Superior Wisconsin. In Danbury, Wisconsin, the <b>Gandy</b> <b>Dancer</b> Trail is sought by many visitors and tourists who want to walk the same trail that hunter James Jordan used to track a record book buck in 1914. Jordan ended up harvesting the record setting white-tailed deer with his [...]25-20 Winchester rifle along the Yellow River. The James Jordan Buck has reigned as the largest Boone and Crockett Club typical scoring white-tailed deer in the United States since 1914.|$|E
50|$|He first {{worked for}} the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at McKeesport as a <b>gandy</b> <b>dancer,</b> one who stamps down stones between the {{railroad}} ties. Next he worked {{a stint in the}} steel industry at the National Tube Company in McKeesport, but soon left for a job in Connellsville, Pennsylvania at the coke ovens of Henry Clay Frick.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1940s when the U.S. was {{involved}} in the fighting of World War II, the days of Rosie the Riveter, a few women worked as <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers.</b> During the war years so many of the men were away that the U.S. developed a severe labor shortage and women stepped in to do what, to that time, had been done exclusively by men. A 1988 article in The Valley Gazette carried the story of several local women who had worked on the Reading Railroad in Tamaqua, Pennsylvania as <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers.</b> In an interview one of the women, Mary Gbur, said that it was the money, about $55 a week, that had attracted her to the job: “Money was short and I wanted to help my children continue their education after high school. And the railroad beat the $18 a week the dime store paid.” Gbur called the work [...] "gruesome and boring" [...] and apparently it was seen by the townspeople as degrading for a woman to be doing manual labor, leaving the women feeling embarrassed about the work they were doing. However, she said, [...] "One day attitudes changed when a voice boomed out, 'I am sure proud of you ladies!'" [...] The voice was that of the village priest.|$|R
2500|$|At this time, Laine {{had become}} more popular in the United Kingdom than in the USA, as many of his hit records in the UK were only minor hits in his native country. Songs like [...] "The <b>Gandy</b> <b>Dancer's</b> Ball", [...] "The Rock of Gibraltar", and [...] "Answer Me, O Lord" [...] were much bigger hits for him abroad. [...] "Answer Me" [...] would later provide the {{inspiration}} for Paul McCartney's composition [...] "Yesterday". It was also there that he broke attendance records when appearing at the Palladium, and where he launched his first successful television series (with songstress Connie Haines).|$|R

50|$|Before we can list railroads, we needs must {{understand}} what consisted a railway as an emerging technology. Understanding todays mature industry technology cannot suffice {{to see the}} past in its proper context clearly; to appreciate the explosive progress, one almost need join a track gang as a <b>gandy</b> <b>dancer</b> and lay-hold heave within a team replacing a cracked rail or two.|$|E
5000|$|Others have {{suggested}} that the term <b>gandy</b> <b>dancer</b> was coined to describe the movements of the workers themselves, i.e., the constant [...] "dancing" [...] motion of the track workers as they lunged against their tools in unison to nudge the rails, often timed by a chant; as they carried rails; or, speculatively, as they waddled like ganders while running on the railroad ties.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Quinion {{identified}} {{the first known}} (printed) {{use of the term}} <b>gandy</b> <b>dancer</b> as 1918, but with so little understanding of the origin of the term {{it is impossible to know}} when it came into being. An article in the May 1918 edition of the weekly publication The Outlook (New York) asks the question, [...] "What is a [...] "gandy dancer"?" [...] Using the exact words from the publication: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "So gandy dancing goes in {{with the}} music. That's the way it’s been since way back. In the {{beginning}} of the railroad, you had to line it up. That’s where the <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> come in. And you even gandy danced behind a maul. Even spiking, you make the spike maul talk; you sing to it. Like when you’re driving a spike down. SINGING “Big cat, little cat, teeniny kitten. Big cat!” That’s you driving the spike as hard as you could. He’d holler, “Make a wheel out of that maul.” And that means spike fast. And so, with two of us spiking, you make that maul talk! “Big cat, little cat, teeniny kitten,” and that spike would be down." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1939 John Lomax {{recorded}} {{a number of}} railroad songs which contain {{an example of an}} [...] "unloading steel rails" [...] call, and it is available at the American Memory site. The Lead Belly song [...] "Take This Hammer" [...] (available on YouTube) may be based on railroad chants. [...] There is no doubt that country singer Jimmie Rodgers was influenced by the working songs of the <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers.</b> His father, a section foreman in Meredian, Mississippi, brought his son with him to work as a water boy where he would have been exposed to their musical chants. Rodgers went on {{to be known as the}} [...] "Singing Brakeman" [...] and the Father of Country Music.|$|R
5000|$|But most {{researchers}} {{have identified a}} [...] "Gandy Shovel Company" [...] or, variously, [...] "Gandy Manufacturing Company" [...] or [...] "Gandy Tool Company" [...] reputed to have existed in Chicago {{as the source of}} the tools from which <b>gandy</b> <b>dancers</b> took their name. Some sources even list the goods manufactured by the company, i.e., [...] "tamping bars, claw bars, picks, and shovels." [...] But others have cast doubt on the existence of such a company. The Chicago Historical Society has been asked for information on the company so many times that they have said, [...] "It's like a legend, [...] " [...] but they {{have never been able to}} find a Gandy company in their old records.|$|R
