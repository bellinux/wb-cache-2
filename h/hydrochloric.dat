5|$|Concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> acid (fuming <b>hydrochloric</b> acid) forms acidic mists. Both {{the mist}} and the {{solution}} have a corrosive effect on human tissue, {{with the potential}} to damage respiratory organs, eyes, skin, and intestines irreversibly. Upon mixing <b>hydrochloric</b> acid with common oxidizing chemicals, such as sodium hypochlorite (bleach, NaClO) or potassium permanganate (KMnO4), the toxic gas chlorine is produced.|$|E
5|$|Free <b>hydrochloric</b> acid {{was first}} {{formally}} {{described in the}} 16th century by Libavius, who prepared it by heating salt in clay crucibles. Other authors claim that pure <b>hydrochloric</b> acid was first discovered by the German Benedictine monk Basil Valentine in the 15th century, when he heated common salt and green vitriol, whereas others {{argue that there is}} no clear reference to the preparation of pure <b>hydrochloric</b> acid {{until the end of the}} 16th century.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid can {{therefore}} be used to prepare salts called chlorides. <b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is a strong acid, since it is completely dissociated in water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to <b>hydrochloric</b> acid exist. The large-scale production of <b>hydrochloric</b> acid is almost always integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, the Leblanc {{process was}} {{effectively}} {{replaced by the}} Solvay process without a <b>hydrochloric</b> acid by-product. Since <b>hydrochloric</b> acid was already fully settled as an important chemical in numerous applications, the commercial interest initiated other production methods, {{some of which are}} still used today. After the year 2000, <b>hydrochloric</b> acid is mostly made by absorbing by-product hydrogen chloride from industrial organic compounds production.|$|E
5|$|Personal {{protective}} {{equipment such as}} latex gloves, protective eye goggles, and chemical-resistant {{clothing and}} shoes will minimize risks when handling <b>hydrochloric</b> acid. The United States Environmental Protection Agency rates and regulates <b>hydrochloric</b> acid as a toxic substance.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid as {{the binary}} (two-component) mixture of HCl and H2O has a constant-boiling {{azeotrope}} at 20.2% HCl and 108.6°C (227°F). There are four constant-crystallization eutectic points for <b>hydrochloric</b> acid, between the crystal form of HCl·H2O (68% HCl), HCl·2H2O (51% HCl), HCl·3H2O (41% HCl), HCl·6H2O (25% HCl), and ice (0% HCl). There {{is also a}} metastable eutectic point at 24.8% between ice and the HCl·3H2O crystallization.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid {{can be used}} to {{regulate}} the acidity (pH) of solutions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is {{frequently}} used in chemical analysis to prepare ("digest") samples for analysis. Concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> acid dissolves many metals and forms oxidized metal chlorides and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with basic compounds such as calcium carbonate or copper(II) oxide, forming the dissolved chlorides {{that can be}} analyzed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is {{used for}} {{a large number of}} {{small-scale}} applications, such as leather processing, purification of common salt, household cleaning, and building construction. Oil production may be stimulated by injecting <b>hydrochloric</b> acid into the rock formation of an oil well, dissolving a portion of the rock, and creating a large-pore structure. Oil well acidizing is a common process in the North Sea oil production industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{industry}} demanding purity (food, pharmaceutical, drinking water), high-quality <b>hydrochloric</b> acid is used {{to control}} the pH of process water streams. In less-demanding industry, technical quality <b>hydrochloric</b> acid suffices for neutralizing waste streams and swimming pool pH control.|$|E
5|$|It also dissolves in <b>hydrochloric</b> acid, {{but only}} with oxygen present.|$|E
5|$|Many {{chemical}} reactions involving <b>hydrochloric</b> acid are {{applied in the}} production of food, food ingredients, and food additives. Typical products include aspartame, fructose, citric acid, lysine, hydrolyzed vegetable protein as food enhancer, and in gelatin production. Food-grade (extra-pure) <b>hydrochloric</b> acid can be applied when needed for the final product.|$|E
5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, <b>hydrochloric</b> acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering {{oxidation-reduction}} reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength <b>hydrochloric</b> acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus {{the fact that it is}} available as a pure reagent, make <b>hydrochloric</b> acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{properties}} of <b>hydrochloric</b> acid, such as boiling and melting points, density, and pH, {{depend on the}} concentration or molarity of HCl in the aqueous solution. They range from those of water at very low concentrations approaching 0% HCl to values for fuming <b>hydrochloric</b> acid at over 40% HCl.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, {{hydrogen}} chloride is a colourless gas, {{like all the}} hydrogen halides apart from hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the larger electronegative chlorine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline {{hydrogen chloride}} at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised. <b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is a strong acid (pKa = −7) because the hydrogen bonds to chlorine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HCl/H2O system has many hydrates HCl·nH2O for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Beyond a 1:1 mixture of HCl and H2O, the system separates completely into two separate liquid phases. <b>Hydrochloric</b> acid forms an azeotrope with boiling point 108.58°C at 20.22g HCl per 100g solution; thus <b>hydrochloric</b> acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.|$|E
5|$|Bastnäsite, LnIIICO3F, {{is usually}} lacking in thorium {{and the heavy}} {{lanthanides}} beyond samarium and europium, and hence the extraction of cerium from it is quite direct. First, the bastnäsite is purified, using dilute <b>hydrochloric</b> acid to remove calcium carbonate impurities. The ore is then roasted {{in the air to}} oxidize it to the lanthanide oxides: while most of the lanthanides will be oxidized to the sesquioxides Ln2O3, cerium will be oxidized to the dioxide CeO2. This is insoluble in water and can be leached out with 0.5M <b>hydrochloric</b> acid, leaving the other lanthanides behind.|$|E
5|$|Gastric acid {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{secretions}} of the stomach. It consists mainly of <b>hydrochloric</b> acid and acidifies the stomach content to a pH of 1 to 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid {{has been}} an {{important}} and frequently used chemical from early history and was discovered by the alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan around the year 800 AD.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is a corrosive, strong {{mineral acid}} with many {{industrial}} uses. A colorless, highly pungent solution of hydrogen chloride (HCl) in water, when it reacts with an organic base {{it forms a}} hydrochloride salt.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid is {{a strong}} {{inorganic}} acid that is used in many industrial processes such as refining metal. The application often determines the required product quality.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydrochloric</b> acid was {{historically}} called acidum salis, muriatic acid, {{and spirits}} of salt {{because it was}} produced from rock salt and green vitriol (by Basilius Valentinus in the 15th century) and later from the chemically similar common salt and sulfuric acid (by Johann Rudolph Glauber in the 17th century). Free <b>hydrochloric</b> acid was first formally described in the 16th century by Libavius. Later, it was used by chemists such as Glauber, Priestley, and Davy in their scientific research.|$|E
5|$|In bulk {{form and}} at room {{temperature}} and atmospheric pressure, the element resists alkalis, sulfuric acid, <b>hydrochloric</b> acid, dilute (but not concentrated) nitric acid, and aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{products}} {{can be produced}} with <b>hydrochloric</b> acid in normal acid-base reactions, resulting in inorganic compounds. These include water treatment chemicals such as iron(III) chloride and polyaluminium chloride (PAC).|$|E
5|$|Other {{inorganic}} compounds produced with <b>hydrochloric</b> acid include road application salt calcium chloride, nickel(II) chloride for electroplating, and zinc chloride for the galvanizing industry and battery production.|$|E
5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all {{non-metal}} elements (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. <b>Hydrochloric</b> and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than <b>hydrochloric</b> acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
5|$|With major {{production}} {{starting in}} the Industrial Revolution, <b>hydrochloric</b> acid {{is used in the}} chemical industry as a chemical reagent in the large-scale production of vinyl chloride for PVC plastic, and MDI/TDI for polyurethane. It has numerous smaller-scale applications, including household cleaning, production of gelatin and other food additives, descaling, and leather processing. About 20 million tonnes of <b>hydrochloric</b> acid are produced worldwide annually. It is also found naturally in gastric acid.|$|E
5|$|A {{solution}} of tin(II) chloride containing a little <b>hydrochloric</b> acid {{is used for}} the tin-plating of steel, in order to make tin cans. An electric potential is applied, and tin metal is formed at the cathode via electrolysis.|$|E
5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with <b>hydrochloric</b> acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|Actinium trichloride is {{obtained}} by reacting actinium hydroxide or oxalate with carbon tetrachloride vapors at temperatures above 960°C. Similar to oxyfluoride, actinium oxychloride {{can be prepared}} by hydrolyzing actinium trichloride with ammonium hydroxide at 1000°C. However, {{in contrast to the}} oxyfluoride, the oxychloride could well be synthesized by igniting a solution of actinium trichloride in <b>hydrochloric</b> acid with ammonia.|$|E
5|$|Aqua regia, {{a mixture}} {{consisting}} of <b>hydrochloric</b> and nitric acids, prepared by dissolving sal ammoniac in nitric acid, {{was described in}} the works of Pseudo-Geber, a 13th-century European alchemist. Other references suggest that the first mention of aqua regia is in Byzantine manuscripts dating {{to the end of the}} 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Because it {{was used}} in glassmaking, {{manganese}} dioxide was available for experiments by alchemists, the first chemists. Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1770) and Johann Glauber (17th century) discovered that manganese dioxide could be converted to permanganate, a useful laboratory reagent. By the mid-18th century, the Swedish chemist Carl Wilhelm Scheele used manganese dioxide to produce chlorine. First, <b>hydrochloric</b> acid, or a mixture of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium chloride was made to react with manganese dioxide, later <b>hydrochloric</b> acid from the Leblanc process was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the Weldon process. The production of chlorine and hypochlorite bleaching agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.|$|E
5|$|Bupropion is a {{substituted}} cathinone. It is synthesized in two chemical steps {{starting from}} 3'-chloro-propiophenone. The alpha position {{adjacent to the}} ketone is first brominated followed by nucleophilic displacement of the resulting alpha-bromoketone with t-butylamine and treated with <b>hydrochloric</b> acid to give bupropion as the hydrochloride salt in 75–85% overall yield.|$|E
5|$|Copper(I) chloride, {{commonly}} called cuprous chloride, is the lower chloride of copper, with the formula CuCl. The substance {{is a white}} solid sparingly soluble in water, but very soluble in concentrated <b>hydrochloric</b> acid. Impure samples appear green due {{to the presence of}} copper(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|High-quality <b>hydrochloric</b> acid {{is used in}} the {{regeneration}} of {{ion exchange}} resins. Cation exchange is widely used to remove ions such as Na+ and Ca2+ from aqueous solutions, producing demineralized water. The acid is used to rinse the cations from the resins. Na+ is replaced with H+ and Ca2+ with 2 H+.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not react with concentrated nitric acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with <b>hydrochloric</b> acid.|$|E
