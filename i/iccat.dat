40|$|<b>ICCAT’s</b> {{most recent}} stock {{assessments}} of blue marlin and white marlin indicate both species are overfished {{and continue to}} suffer over-fishing; unfortunately, effective management of these species is hindered by {{the high degree of}} uncertainty in the stock assessments. One of the major sources of uncertainty in these assessments has been the lack of precise life-history data. Without information such as growth rates, mortality, and the age composition of the catch, we are forced to use simple production models with biological parameters estimated from other, similar species. Validated age and growth models would provide these missing data and help improve the precision and accuracy of stock assessments for these species. In this paper, we present some details of current research intended to develop such models for blue marlin and white marlin. Fin spines are being collected for both species, along with data on lower jaw-fork length, weight, and sex, from individuals caught by artisanal and commercial fleets {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic as well as in the Caribbean.

Large oceanic migrants play important roles in ecosystems, yet many species are of conservation concern as a result of anthropogenic threats, of which incidental capture by fisheries is frequently identified. The last large populations of the leatherback turtle, Dermochelys coriacea, occur in the Atlantic Ocean, but interactions with industrial fisheries could jeopardize recent positive population trends, making bycatch mitigation a priority. Here, we perform the first pan-Atlantic analysis of spatio-temporal distribution of the leatherback turtle and ascertain overlap with longline fishing effort. Data suggest that the Atlantic probably consists of two regional management units: northern and southern (the latter including turtles breeding in South Africa). Although turtles and fisheries show highly diverse distributions, we highlight nine areas of high susceptibility to potential bycatch (four in the northern Atlantic and five in the southern/equatorial Atlantic) that are worthy of further targeted investigation and mitigation. These are reinforced by reports of leatherback bycatch at eight of these sites. International collaborative efforts are needed, especially from nations hosting regions where susceptibility to bycatch is likely to be high within their exclusive economic zone (northern Atlantic: Cape Verde, Gambia, Guinea Bissau, Mauritania, Senegal, Spain, USA and Western Sahara; southern Atlantic: Angola, Brazil, Namibia and UK) and from nations fishing in these high-susceptibility areas, including those located in international waters.

5000|$|The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (<b>ICCAT)</b> is an {{intergovernmental}} organization {{responsible for the}} management and conservation of tuna and tuna-like species in the Atlantic Ocean and adjacent seas.

The organisation has been strongly criticised by scientists for its repeated failure to conserve the sustainability of the tuna fishery by consistently supporting over-fishing - an internal review branded ICCAT's policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery a [...] "travesty of fisheries management", and an [...] "international disgrace".

50|$|Overfishing {{continues}} {{despite repeated}} warnings {{of the current}} precipitous decline. In 2007, researchers from the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)—the regulators of Atlantic bluefin fishing—recommended a global quota of 15,000 tonnes to maintain current stocks or 10,000 tonnes to allow the fisheries recovery. <b>ICCAT</b> then chose a quota of 36,000 tonnes, but surveys indicated that up to 60,000 tonnes were actually being taken (a third of the total remaining stocks) and the limit was reduced to 22,500 tonnes. Their scientists now say that 7500 tonnes are the sustainable limit. In November 2009, <b>ICCAT</b> set the 2010 quota at 13,500 tonnes and said that if stocks were not rebuilt by 2022, it would consider closing some areas.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2008, <b>ICCAT</b> {{ignored the}} advice of their {{scientists}} that quotas should not exceed 15,000 tonnes per year - which had been determined as the maximum sustainable yield - and instead set quotas at 22,000 tonnes. An independent review of <b>ICCAT,</b> commissioned by the organisation themselves, concluded that their policies on the eastern Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery are a [...] "travesty of fisheries management", and an [...] "international disgrace". Dr Sergi Tudela, head of WWF Mediterranean's fisheries programme, said [...] "Today's outcome {{is a recipe for}} economic as well as biological bankruptcy with the European Union squarely to blame. ICCAT's string of successive failures leaves us little option now but to seek effective remedies through trade measures and extending the boycott of retailers, restaurants, chefs and consumers".|$|E
5000|$|The report {{attracted}} {{the support of}} several major advocacy groups. For example, World Wide Fund for Nature (formerly, World Wildlife Fund) embraced the report and called the fishery [...] "grossly out of control." [...] Greenpeace indicated that it [...] "believes that EU and Mediterranean fishing countries should {{bear the brunt of}} the criticism for having taken bluefin to the brink of collapse, adding that the countries have placed again and again the short term financial gain ahead of the long-term survival of the species and of the livelihood of fishermen that depend on it." [...] <b>ICCAT</b> indicated that, in response to the report, it reviewed the compliance record of each country with a particular focus on eastern bluefin tuna. As of November 2010, however, <b>ICCAT</b> has not agreed to suspend fishing on bluefin tuna.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2009, ICCAT's {{scientific}} advisors {{announced that}} a total ban on international trade in Atlantic tuna was justified, based on {{the decline in the}} tuna fishery population to less than 15% of its original size. However, later in the same month, <b>ICCAT</b> recommended catch quotas of 13,500 tonnes per year. This was met by sharp criticisms from environmental organisations, and prompted calls for alternative methods to regulate Atlantic tuna fisheries, such as protection under CITES. Susan Lieberman, Director of International Policy for the Pew Environment Group said Since its inception, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas has been driven by short-term commercial fishing interests, not the conservation ethic implied by its name....ICCAT's actions and inactions highlight the need to take these issues to CITES—the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The <b>ICCAT</b> fisheries managers have shown scant interest in the long-term preservation of the key resources they are supposed to manage. It is now time to turn to other bodies to seek the needed protections that <b>ICCAT</b> has failed to provide.The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) released a statement with strongly worded criticism, saying that the new agreement was [...] "a marked improvement over the current rules, but it is insufficient to guarantee the long-term viability of either the fish or the fishery".|$|E
50|$|On 18 March 2010, the United Nations {{rejected}} a U.S.-backed effort {{to impose a}} total ban on Atlantic bluefin tuna fishing and trading. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) vote was 68 to 20 with 30 European abstentions. The leading opponent, Japan, claimed that <b>ICCAT</b> was the proper regulatory body.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2012 Susan Lieberman, {{international}} policy director of Pew Environment Group stated that [...] "It is encouraging that <b>ICCAT</b> {{listened to the}} recommendations of its own scientists and agreed to keep catch limits for bluefin tuna within their advice. This decision will give this depleted species a fighting chance to continue {{on the path to}} recovery after decades of overfishing and mismanagement".|$|E
50|$|However, {{in recent}} years the {{organization}} seems to be turning around. For the most iconic species within its management, the Eastern Bluefin Tuna, a very strict recovery plan was adopted. It is too early to judge its final outcome, but initial indications are encouraging. In general, <b>ICCAT</b> contracting parties seem to have agreed to steer the organization into a direction of relying on sound science, insisting on compliance and following a good governance model.|$|E
50|$|Tuna and {{tuna-like fishes}} are highly migratory, and stocks cross {{numerous}} international boundaries. <b>ICCAT</b> {{is involved in}} management of 30 species, including the Atlantic bluefin (Thunnus thynnus thynnus), yellowfin (T. albacares), albacore (T. alalunga) and bigeye tuna (T. obesus); from the billfishes, swordfish (Xiphias gladius), white marlin (Tetrapturus albidus), blue marlin (Makaira nigricans), sailfish (Istiophorus albicans); mackerels such as spotted Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus maculatus) and king mackerel (S. cavalla); and, small tunas like skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis).|$|E
5000|$|In 2011, Sea Shepherd launchd [...] "Operation Blue Rage 2011." [...] They found a {{fleet of}} fishing boats {{containing}} thousands of illegally caught Bluefin Tuna. They attempted to cut the nets, but several Sea Shepherd crew members were injured when a fisherman threw a steel chain {{at one of the}} delta boats. A French naval jet flew over to document the incident. Eventually, a plane from <b>ICCAT,</b> the group responsible for Bluefin management, ordered Sea Shepherd to leave.|$|E
5000|$|The {{concept of}} MSY as a {{fisheries}} management strategy developed in Belmar, New Jersey, {{in the early}} 1930s. [...] It increased in popularity in the 1950s {{with the advent of}} surplus-production models with explicitly estimate MSY. [...] As an apparently simple and logical management goal, combined with the lack of other simple management goals of the time, MSY was adopted as the primary management goal by several international organizations (e.g., IWC, IATTC, <b>ICCAT,</b> ICNAF), and individual countries.|$|E
50|$|No {{conservation}} measures specifically protecting the great hammerhead have been enacted. It is listed on Annex I, Highly Migratory Species, of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, though no management schemes have yet been implemented under this agreement. The banning of shark finning by countries and supranational entities such as United States, Australia, and the European Union, and international regulatory bodies {{such as the}} International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (<b>ICCAT),</b> should reduce fishing pressure on the great hammerhead.|$|E
5000|$|The report {{criticized the}} {{performance}} of <b>ICCAT</b> noting that the performance by ICCAT's members in managing bluefin tuna fisheries in the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean is [...] "widely regarded as an international disgrace" [...] and [...] "a travesty in fisheries management." [...] Indicating that {{the collapse of the}} bluefin tuna stock in those areas [...] "could be a real possibility in the foreseeable future," [...] the panel recommended that fishing on bluefin tuna be suspended until ICCAT's members agree to abide by certain recommendations and international law.|$|E
