40|$|This paper, {{the last}} {{from a series}} of three papers on the {{application}} of coded excitation signals in medical ultrasound, investigates the possibility of increasing the frame rate in ultrasound imaging by using modulated excitation signals. Linear array-coded imaging and sparse synthetic transmit aperture imaging are considered, and the trade-offs between frame rate, image quality, and SNR are discussed. It is shown that FM codes can be used to increase the frame rate by a factor of two without a degradation in image quality and by a factor of 5, if a slight decrease in image quality can be accepted. The use of synthetic transmit aperture imaging is also considered, and it is here shown that Hadamard spatial encoding in transmit with <b>FM</b> <b>emission</b> signals can be used to increase the frame rate by 12 to 25 times with either a slight or no reduction in signal-to-noise ratio and image quality. By using these techniques a complete ultrasound-phased array image can be created using only two emissions. © 2005 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Combining the {{detection}} range capability of passive radar using <b>FM</b> radio <b>emissions</b> with the range resolution obtained {{through the use}} of DVB-T signals and the elevation coverage capability provided by DAB Tx yields a high-performance hybrid passive radar sensor. Increasing the coherent integration time of the high-resolution DVB-T component in a track-before-detect approach, cued by the Doppler information obtained through the FM radio component, provides high-range resolution at extended detection ranges. In addition, the DAB-using component, cued by Doppler information provided by FM radio, extends the high-resolution detection volume to elevation ranges not illuminated by DVB-T. The heart of such a hybrid passive radar sensor will be the cued track-before-detect procedure, which is currently being developed at Fraunhofer Institute for High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques in Wachtberg, Germany. © 2014 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the effects of multiple injections (pilot, split, and, post injection) on the combustion process and specific NOx and soot engine-out <b>emissions</b> <b>fm</b> Heavy-Duty DI diesel engine (displacement 2. 02 l), equipped with an advanced two-actuator, Electronic Unit Injector (EUI) system. Investigated parameters were the amount of fuel injected during each injection pulse, the dwell time between the injection pulses, and the start of injection (SOl). Two engine loads (25 % and 75 %) at 1200 rpm, conforming to European Stationary C (ESC) measuring points, were selected for the experiments. Both "conventional" measuring techniques and flame imaging using the AVL VisioScopeTM system were used. A key characteristic of the EUI system is that the injection pressure increases during the injection (ramp shape) which allows the second injection to be injected at a higher injection pressure than the first. It was found that a reduction in soot emission could be obtained at low load with a long dwell between the and second pulses. In contrast, at high load the multiple injections did not show any improvement, and soot emissions were even worse with very late injection...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1993 Two-year old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) {{seedlings}} {{from two}} seed {{lots of different}} predicted hardiness levels were grown in two separate nurseries. Seedlings were lifted every four weeks from early October 1991 through March 1992 and exposed to controlled freezing temperatures. Fluorescence emissions of the seedlings were measured prior to freezing tests. After freezing, seedlings were measured one and three days following each freezing event and destructive morphological assessments were made seven days after the freezing events. Unstressed seedlings were measured six additional test periods from May through September 1992. The relationship between variable chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv) and stage of development {{and the effects of}} freezing injury on Fv were determined in Douglas-fir seedlings. Ten seedlings from each of the test temperatures were measured for F 0 (ground fluorescence), F, and <b>Fm</b> (maximum fluorescence) <b>emissions</b> after being subjected to freezing events. There was no significant linear relationship between the control Fv/Fm ratio and the hardening development of the seedlings. The LT 50 (lethal temperature to 50 % of the seedlings) fluorescence measurements, however, appeared to be lower when the seedlings were not hardened off and higher once the seedlings were hardened off. Fv/Fm had a significant linear relationship to needle damage and survival...|$|R
