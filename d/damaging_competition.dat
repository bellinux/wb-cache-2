50|$|Hammerstein's {{company was}} a huge success, and {{provided}} <b>damaging</b> <b>competition</b> to the Metropolitan Opera; eventually {{this led to the}} resignation of Heinrich Conried as the latter company's general director, after which it was greatly reorganized. Nevertheless, after giving 463 performances of 49 different operas during its existence, the Manhattan Opera Company suddenly folded in 1910. For years the reason remained a mystery; more recently it has been discovered that Hammerstein and the directors of the Metropolitan, led by Otto Kahn, entered into a contractual agreement which led to the dissolution. Under the terms of the contract, negotiated by his son Arthur, Hammerstein was paid a flat sum of $1,200,000, in exchange for which he promised to stage no opera in the United States for the following ten years. It is widely believed that Hammerstein took the deal because the mounting costs of running the company were taking their toll on his finances, and he was going bankrupt.|$|E

50|$|The first {{main line}} railway in {{southern}} England was the London and Southampton Railway, (renamed LSWR in 1838), which completed its line in May 1840.

The LSWR branched out to destinations including Portsmouth, Salisbury and later Exeter and Plymouth. It grew {{to be the largest}} of the four constituent companies. The LBSCR was a smaller railway than its LSWR neighbour, serving the port of Newhaven and several popular holiday resorts on the south coast and operating much of the south London suburban network. It had been almost bankrupt in 1867, but during the last twenty-five years of its existence it had been well-managed and profitable. It had begun to electrify routes around London (using an overhead line system) from 1909 to compete with the new electric trams that were taking away some of its traffic. Finally, the SECR had been created after years of wasteful and <b>damaging</b> <b>competition</b> between the two companies involved, with duplication of routes and services. Both companies had been unpopular with the travelling public and operated poorly maintained vehicles and infrastructure. Nevertheless, real progress had been made in rectifying this during the period 1899-1922.|$|E

40|$|Education lies at {{the very}} {{epicentre}} of professional formation, professional behaviour, and professional values. Far-reaching institutional and curricular changes occurred {{in the education of}} doctors in the nineteenth century. These changes were related, I argue, to two long-term historical processes - the 'professionalisation' and the 'scientification' of medicine. England is the main geographical focus, but the thesis also encompasses a brief comparative historical sociology of the emergence of 'hospital' and 'laboratory' medical education in France and Germany respectively. Doctors were the first occupational community to claim that their 'professional' status rested on the sure foundation of 'scientific' knowledge and expertise; but the thesis adopts an attitude of anthropological scepticism towards both the alleged cognitive supremacy of 'scientific' medicine and its assumed role in conferring 'professional' privileges. Nevertheless, the rhetorical appeal of scientific culture proved strategically useful to doctors in their collective pursuit of upward social mobility in three particular contexts: the efforts of rank-and-file practitioners to usurp the professional privileges of elite consultants; regular doctors' attempts to eliminate professionally <b>damaging</b> <b>competition</b> from a variety of alternative and irregular healers conventionally labelled as Oquacks'; and the emergent relationship being forged between the medical profession and the modern state. A finely-textured analysis of intra-professional conflict is necessary to account for the politics of medical reform and for prolonged disputation over the future direction of medical education. There were two principal axes of internal conflict between medical interest-groups: the first between general practitioners and consultants; the second between traditional clinicians, many of whom actively opposed the introduction of experimental procedures into medical education, and those who vigorously promoted progressive scientific reform. The latter conflict, which has often been underestimated, is characterised in terms of a structural opposition between the scientific 'word' and the clinical I ward'. Such an explanatory framework offers the historian a more valuable resource than the simple antithesis between 'empiricism' and 'rationalism'. At the end of the Victorian period, apprenticeship had been eliminated and all aspiring doctors were educated in a university. It was through education that doctors were imbued with a set of professional value-orientations, and forged feelings of common identity and solidarity. The instance of Victorian doctors suggests that the historic role of the professions in English society is far less marginal and peripheral than has often been supposed...|$|E

40|$|Este trabalho tem por objetivo analisar o comportamento da Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos (ECT) no âmbito {{judicial}} diante de seus concorrentes e os clientes destes, buscando verificar se há evidências de que a empresa estaria praticando um ilícito concorrencial e utilizando o judiciário para prejudicar concorrentes no mercado e dificultar a entrada de novos agentes (ou seja, se haveria litigância predatória pelos Correios), mediante a criação de novos custos aos seus rivais e, assim, prejudicando a competição no setor postal. No âmbito jurídico, há pouca clareza quanto à extensão do monopólio postal e verifica-se, uma carência de política pública para o setor. Para realizar o estudo, foi analisado o contexto no qual se insere a conduta da ECT e foi elaborada uma base de dados a partir da análise de processos judiciais movidos pela ECT. Na análise empírica dos dados coletados, buscou-se avaliar como a decisão do STF sobre a existência e validade de uma exclusividade da ECT na prestação de certos serviços postais, tais quais definidos por lei, afetou a probabilidade de uma decisão final em 1 ª instância ser favorável aos Correios. Os resultados indicaram que tal probabilidade é significativamente menor após a decisão do STF em 2009, o que serve de evidência de que a ECT vinha extrapolando seus direitos nos pedidos realizados judicialmente. Apesar de o contexto no qual a conduta se insere, especialmente quanto aos custos de litigar, indicarem racionalidade na conduta e de a análise empírica ir no mesmo sentido, as evidências não são fortes o suficiente para se concluir que a ECT praticou litigância predatória. The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze the behavior of the Empresa Brasileira de Correios e Telégrafos (Brazilian Post and Telegraph Company - ECT) before its competitors and related customers, seeking to verify if there is evidence that the company would be practicing an antitrust illicit by using the judiciary to harm competitors in the market and hinder the entry of new players (ie, if ECT was practicing predatory litigation). Through the filing of lawsuits, ECT would be creating new costs to its rivals, which were superior to those supported by itself when adopting such strategy and thus <b>damaging</b> <b>competition</b> in the postal sector. However, in the juridical sphere there is an uncertainty regarding the extension of the postal monopoly, in spite of the decision by the Supreme Court (STF) on a claim of breach of fundamental precept (Arguição de Descumprimento de Preceito Fundamental - ADPF) about this subject on late 2009. There is also a need for public policy on the postal sector. In order to do the study, the context of ECT’s behavior was analyzed, as well as a data base was created from the analysis of claims filed by ECT against its rivals and their clients to end any sort of mail delivery by companies other than ECT. The empirical analysis of the collected data aimed at checking how the Supreme Court’s decision affirming the existence and validity of an exclusivity right of ECT on rendering certain services affected the probability of a lower court deciding in favor of ECT. The results indicate that said probability is significantly lower after the Supreme Court’s decision in 2009, which serves as evidence that ECT had been extrapolating its rights when making its claims. Although the context in which the behavior takes place (especially as to litigation costs) indicates rationality in the ECT enduring predatory litigation, as does the empirical analysis, the evidence is not strong enough to conclude that ECT has actually practiced predatory litigation...|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{dominance}} in EC competition {{law is a}} mixture of criteria relevant to determining the presence of market power and criteria relevant to finding commercial power. The current concept of dominance is consistent with an ordoliberal interpretation of Article 82 whereby dominant firms have special responsibilities because their presence in the market <b>damages</b> <b>competition</b> as an institution. The Commission appears intent upon narrowing the concept of dominance to instances where an undertaking has substantial market power. The effect of this is that the scope of application of Article 82 is narrowed down considerably. However the Commission's position is enigmatic because the Discussion Paper is an ambiguous mixture of passages that restate the current law and passages that seem to develop new approaches, with no explanation of where the policy changes occur or an explanation of why they take place. In fact, on another reading, the Discussion Paper seems to widen the concept of dominance.

[...] In some cases, if the preference is for a non-native, invasive plant, rabbit grazing may benefit the community by reducing non-native abundance and creating room for the native plant species to fill. When rabbits graze in moderation they can create a more complex ecosystem, by creating more variable environments that will allow for more predator-competitor relationships between the various organisms. [...] However, besides the effect on wild vegetation, rabbits destroy crops, compete with other herbivores, and can result in extreme ecological <b>damage.</b> <b>Competition</b> can be direct or indirect. The rabbits may specifically eat the competitions target food or it may inhibit the growth of grasses that other species eat.
