40|$|The hot hand {{phenomenon}} {{refers to}} the popular notion that the performance of sports players is punctuated by streaks of exceptional performance. During these streaks, the player {{is said to be}} ‘hot’, or even ‘on fire’. Unfortunately, when it comes to assessing evidence for the hot hand phenomenon, human intuition is inadequate—people are known to perceive streaks even in sequences that are purely random. Here we develop a new statistical test for the presence of the hot hand phenomenon for binary sequences of successes and failures. The test compares a constant performance model to a hidden Markov model with two states (one representing <b>hot</b> <b>performance,</b> and one representing cold performance) and one probability of switching from one state to the other. We assume appropriately restricted uniform priors on the model parameters and compute the Bayes factor by integrating the likelihood over the prior. The test is assessed in a simulation study and applied to real data sets from basketball and from psychology. Our analysis suggests {{that it is difficult to}} find compelling evidence for and against streakiness except for very long data sequences and extreme forms of streakiness...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{concepts}} of cold and hot herbal properties in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), reflecting the efficacy trends of medicinal herbs, have the Fuzzy characteristics. It is {{suited for the}} application of Fuzzy mathematics in research of herbal properties. For a comprehensive evaluation of herbal properties, this work constructed and made a practice of the Fuzzy discrimination model regarding the biological performance of Chinese materia medica. METHODS: Firstly, TCM formulas of cold or hot property were employed for setting the reference values and calculating the membership functions of cold and hot Fuzzy sets with Fisher discriminant. Then the model parameters of cold performance function (CPF) and <b>hot</b> <b>performance</b> function (HPF) were acquired. Second, the experimental data from studies on changes in multisystem indicators of animals given the classical cold formula (Sanhuang Fang) and hot formula (Jiangfugui Fang) were collected to calculate CPF and HPF. Then an experiment of administration of hot property herbs, Rougui (Cortex Cinnamomi) and Xianmao (Rhizoma Curculiginis), and cold property herbs, Huangbai (Cortex Phellodendri) and Zhizi (Fructus Gardeniae) to normal animals and animals with glucocorticoid-induced yang-deficiency or yin-deficiency state was designed. The relative changes in animal states were analyzed by the evaluation model to find the way in which herbal properties are represented. RESULTS: The HPF values of biological performance were higher than the CPF values in administration of Rougui to animals of normal (0. 528 > 0. 221), yang-deficiency (0. 203 >－ 0. 490) and yin-deficiency (1. 750 >－ 0. 479) states, and in administration of Xianmao to animals of normal (0. 474 >－ 1. 601) and yang-deficiency (0. 288 >－ 1. 923) states, which represented the hot property. The HPF values of biological performance were lower than the CPF values in administration of Huangbai to animals of normal (－ 0. 870 < 0. 798) and yang-deficiency (－ 0. 339 < 0. 194) states, and in administration of Zhizi to animals of yin-deficiency (－ 1. 802 < 0. 354) state, which represented the cold property. CONCLUSION: The herbal properties and the biological performance characteristics of herbal formulas are ascertained by using the Fuzzy evaluation model. The personalities, as well as commonalities of herbal properties are key areas for focus because of the multi-approach biological performance of cold and hot property...|$|E

5000|$|Linda Barnard from Toronto Star {{gave the}} film {{two out of}} four stars, saying: [...] "While Besson knows his way around an action film, he’s not as adept at comedy.

[...] Mack Rawden from Cinema Blend gave the film three out of five stars, saying: [...] "It uses irregular De Niro voiceovers on occasion. It reads segments {{of a book on}} occasion. It even uses bad dreams and flashbacks, all of which, when used together, make the film seem disorganized and poorly put together. All of that, coupled with more than a few jokes that fall flat and a plot that’s windy and strangely paced keep The Family from being anything more than a likeable enough way to spend an hour and forty-five minutes."
