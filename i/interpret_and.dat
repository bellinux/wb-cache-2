5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s and 1940s, economists (notably John Hicks, Franco Modigliani, and Paul Samuelson) {{attempted}} to <b>interpret</b> <b>and</b> formalise Keynes's writings {{in terms of}} formal mathematical models. In what had {{become known as the}} neoclassical synthesis, they combined Keynesian analysis with neoclassical economics to produce neo-Keynesian economics, which came to dominate mainstream macroeconomic thought for the next 40 years.|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to <b>interpret</b> <b>and</b> understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Studies on induced animal {{models of}} human diseases. Here, an animal is treated {{so that it}} {{develops}} pathology and symptoms that resemble a human disease. Examples include restricting {{blood flow to the}} brain to induce stroke, or giving neurotoxins that cause damage similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease. Such studies can be difficult to <b>interpret,</b> <b>and</b> it is argued that they are not always comparable to human diseases. For example, although such models are now widely used to study Parkinson's disease, the British anti-vivisection interest group BUAV argues that these models only superficially resemble the disease symptoms, without the same time course or cellular pathology. In contrast, scientists assessing the usefulness of animal models of Parkinson's disease, as well as the medical research charity The Parkinson's Appeal, state that these models were invaluable and that they led to improved surgical treatments such as pallidotomy, new drug treatments such as levodopa, and later deep brain stimulation.|$|E
5|$|The prerogatives and {{authority}} {{granted to the}} legislature within the Constitution meant that it could and would play a major and indispensable role in {{the functioning of the}} government—it was not just a rubber stamp. The General Assembly alone could enact, revoke, <b>interpret</b> <b>and</b> suspend laws under Article13 of the Constitution. The legislature also held the power of the purse and was required to annually authorize expenditures and taxes. It alone approved and exercised oversight of government loans and debts. Other responsibilities entrusted to the Assembly included setting the size of the military's forces, the creation of offices within the government, monitoring the national welfare and ensuring that the government was being run in conformity to the Constitution. This last provision allowed the legislature wide authority to examine and debate government policy and conduct.|$|E

Collecting contributions from major scholars in the field of dialogue <b>interpreting</b> <b>and</b> interaction studies, the volume offers new insights into the relationship between <b>interpreting</b> <b>and</b> mediating. It addresses a wide readership, including students and scholars in translation <b>and</b> <b>interpreting</b> studies, mediation <b>and</b> negotiation studies, linguistics, sociology, communication studies, conversation analysis, discourse analysis...|$|R

Jean-François Gerbillon and Thomas Pereira served as translators for the negotiations of the Treaty of Nerchinsk. The Kangxi Emperor was grateful to the Jesuits for their contributions, the many languages they could <b>interpret,</b> <b>and</b> the innovations they offered his military in gun manufacturing and artillery, the latter of which enabled the Qing Empire to conquer the Kingdom of Tungning.|$|E
25|$|The main {{benefits}} of L-estimators {{are that they}} are often extremely simple, and often robust statistics: assuming sorted data, they are very easy to calculate and <b>interpret,</b> <b>and</b> are often resistant to outliers. They thus are useful in robust statistics, as descriptive statistics, in statistics education, and when computation is difficult. However, they are inefficient, and in modern times robust statistics M-estimators are preferred, though these are much more difficult computationally. In many circumstances L-estimators are reasonably efficient, and thus adequate for initial estimation.|$|E
