40|$|Highly {{compressible}} clayey and peaty (soft) soils may expose structures (e. g. buildings) and infrastructures (e. g. {{roads and}} embankments) resting {{on them to}} absolute/differential settlements. These latter, with passing of time, can induce damages whose level of severity depends on several factors such as: the spatial distribution of the thickness pertaining to soft soil layers; the groundwater regime; {{the characteristics of the}} exposed structures and infrastructures along with their state of maintenance. The analysis of damages and the resulting management of the built-up environment usually require high costs due to the amount of data necessary for setting up reliable forecasting models as well as for defining the most suitable restoration works. This paper presents a multi-scale procedure tailored to analyze the settlement-induced building damage. The selected case study deals with an urban area in The Netherlands where, at medium scale, the role of soft soils in predisposing the occurrence of ground surface settlements is first investigated. Then, at large scale the relationship between cause (i. e. settlements) and effects (i. e. damage) is analyzed for building aggregates via the combination of high-resolution advanced differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) and in-situ damage survey data. Finally, as main novelty of the proposed multi-scale procedure, both the above datasets are used to generate, at detailed scale, empirical fragility curves for single buildings that, once further validated, could be valuably adopted for <b>damage</b> <b>forecasting</b> purposes in similar urban areas...|$|E
40|$|Wheat {{bulb fly}} (WBF) (Delia coarctata, Fallén, Diptera: Anthomyiidae) is a pest of {{commercial}} importance in cereal crops. Control {{is dependent on}} organophosphates {{some of which are}} restricted in the UK, while current oviposition monitoring techniques are labour intensive and subjective. Eggs are not laid in association with a host-plant, therefore, prompt location of a suitable host is critical to the survival of the newly hatched larvae. Wheat bulb fly larvae have been shown to exhibit a positive chemotactic response to wheat and other host-plant seedlings and their root exudates. The objective {{of this study was to}} improve the control and population monitoring methodology associated with WBF, by investigating the ecology and specifically the chemical ecology of the WBF. Bioassays were used to investigate the behavioural response of WBF to known chemical constituents of host-plant exudates. Four secondary metabolites were found to be attractive while CO 2 was found to alter the behaviour of larvae. Wheat bulb fly oviposition was assessed in field situations to describe egg laying spatially and through time. Geostatistical and ecological techniques were used to observe the spatial dependence and dispersion of oviposition and construct contour maps or scale-sized dot graphs of oviposition density. The traditional single line transect sampling pattern was compared against a more intensive sampling regime. Oviposition monitoring was conducted over a three year period to ascertain the time of peak egg density of this fly. A molecular based diagnostic test to assess WBF egg populations for <b>damage</b> <b>forecasting</b> was developed. A real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol was produced to estimate field populations of WBF eggs through the quantification of eggs from field samples. In addition endpoint PCR was used to identify the presence or absence of eggs from samples. This study gives the potential to advance current control methodology by providing the basis for the development of a lure and kill or confusion/disruption strategy, while offering a more accurate sampling system and a molecular diagnostic test, for improvement of the management of WBF...|$|E

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the delineation of seismic risk reduction strategies, there is the need to identify priorities for interventions based on seismic risk evaluations through the most updated scientific knowledge of its three components: seismic hazard, vulnerability and exposed value. On the other hand, the limited resources available strongly suggest to search for methodologies which, providing generally same results and validity, reduce the time and costs associated with such assessments, particularly for seismic hazard when a list is required for defining priorities in retrofitting on a huge number of buildings located on a wide territory (Grimaz et al., 2010 a). This lead the scientists to focus on research, testing and tuning of screening methods to characterize the seismic response of sites and structures because, in <b>damage</b> <b>forecasting</b> at a territorial level, the quantification of the ground shaking is of limited utility, unless it is not coupled with estimation of site effects and building vulnerability. Consequently, the identification of the most damageable buildings, taking also into account the site effects and the dynamic behaviour of the site-building system, seems to be the most correct and rational way to follow (Grimaz et al., 2010 a). This approach has been adopted by the Italian legislation (Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, 2003), even though the principal focus is addressed to the vulnerability assessment. This is made using evaluation forms organized on two levels of knowledge, conversely, site effects and exposed values are only roughly estimated considering, respectively, the soil class and the occupancy. The Civil Protection of the Friuli Venezia Giulia Region financed the ASSESS project (Analysis of the seismic scenarios of the school buildings for a definition of retrofitting priorities for seismic risk reduction), aimed at evaluating the seismic risk of all the schools located in the regional territory.

40|$|International audienceUsing {{data from}} the California Strong Motion Instrumentation Program, we studied the {{relationship}} between building response and parameters describing the noxiousness of ground motion. According to vulnerability methods that use structural drift as damage criteria, we estimated the building response {{on the basis of}} the normalized relative roof displacement (NRRD), considered as damage criteria. The relationships between the NRRD and the intensity measures of the ground motion are developed using simulated annealing method. Grouping buildings by typology (defined according to their main construction material and height) reduces the variability of the building response. Furthermore, by combining IMs, the NRRD can be predicted more accurately by a Building Damage Prediction Equation. A functional form is thus proposed to estimate the NRRD for several building typologies, calibrated on the building responses recorded in California. This functional form can be used to obtain a fast and overall <b>damage</b> <b>forecast</b> after an earthquake...|$|R

30|$|Earthquakes, {{despite being}} a mostly natural phenomenon, {{may also be}} induced by {{a wide range of}} {{anthropogenic}} activities such as mining, fluid injection and extraction, hydraulic fracturing and geothermal reservoir processes. In recent years, the occurrence of induced and triggered seismicity and its potential impact on the built environment have heightened both public concern and regulatory scrutiny, motivating the need for an integrated risk management framework. Non-standard monitoring approaches provide valuable tools for mitigating the risk associated with earthquakes. These solutions include the use of advanced sensors and the implementation of performance-based rapid response systems for infrastructure, as well as monitoring the structural response of buildings and infrastructure in real time. Such technical solutions can be further used for validating <b>damage</b> <b>forecasts</b> determined by probabilistic approaches. The goal {{of this study is to}} establish a performance-driven monitoring system for induced seismicity. For this purpose, it is necessary to integrate analytical fragility curves in real time. These fragility curves can be derived by simplified vulnerability models that require input obtained from advanced exposure-monitoring techniques. Considering the case of induced seismicity, this also requires the expected damage to refer to non-structural components. Hence, the derived fragility curves are based on the non-structural damage criteria of typical residences. Therefore, a new approach is presented for defining analytical fragility curves of traditional or historic masonry structures, which can be found in large numbers near the geothermal platforms considered in this work.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{this paper}} it is shown how the {{accumulated}} fatigue in steel structures {{can be estimated}} with high accuracy by continuously measuring the accelerations in a few points of the structure. First step is to ob-tain a good estimate of the mode shapes by performing a natural input modal analysis. The so obtained mode shapes are then used to calibrate a Finite Element model of the structure and to obtain the modal coordinates of the active modes by inverting the mode shape matrix. If the number of active modes is smaller {{than the number of}} measurement points, then the problem is solved by regression. If the number of active modes is larger then the number of measurement points, then the number of active modes is reduced by band pass fil-tering. Once the modal coordinates are identified and thus the complete response is established in the modal domain, then the information is mapped to the physical domain by applying the mode shapes of the calibrated Finite Element model and strains are obtained using the shape functions for the actual elements. The tech-nique has been applied on a model frame structure in the laboratory and on a wind loaded lattice pylon struc-ture. In both cases the estimated stresses has been compared with direct strain gauge measurements and it ap-pears that the difference between the strains measured by strain gauges and the strains estimated by the presented technique is quite small. Looking at the fatigue of the lattice pylon it appears that the estimated damage is significantly smaller than the <b>damage</b> <b>forecasted</b> by commonly accepted design rules.

In this paper, observed {{daily maximum temperature}} data at 6 representative stations in the Middle-Lower Yangtze River Valley (MLYRV) from 1984 to 2013 was analyzed to examine the daily relationship between rice seed setting rate (RSSR) and the maximum temperature by {{using data from the}} mid-season late-maturing indica rice variety regional experiments conducted in field conditions at the same representative stations from 2004 to 2011 (totally using 615 samples and 69 rice varieties). The results indicated that RSSR appears to be sensitive to high temperature from 36 days before full heading to 4 days before full heading (with the significance of the negative correlation between RSSR and maximum temperature in this period above 99  % confidence level) and the most sensitive at about 14 days before full heading (near the meiosis phase), indicating that for the mid-season late-maturing indica rice variety in the MLYRV, more attention should be paid to the high temperature damage at the meiosis stage. According to the extracted high temperature sensitive period, statistical forecast models were established to predict the regional rice high temperature damage in the MLYRV by using atmospheric circulation indices in preceding 12  months with a correlation coefficient between the predicted and observed heat stress index of 0. 95 and a normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 28. 4  %. In addition, a high temperature-induced rice sterility simulation model was also used to quantitatively forecast the meiosis phase high temperature influence on rice at the site scale.

David turned to the northwest along the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, and re-intensified to a Category 2 hurricane while over the Bahamas, where it caused heavy <b>damage.</b> Despite initial <b>forecasts</b> of a projected landfall in Miami, Florida, the hurricane turned to the north-northwest just before landfall to strike near West Palm Beach, Florida on September 3. It paralleled the Florida coastline just inland until emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean at New Smyrna Beach, Florida later on September 3. David continued to the north-northwest, and made its final landfall just south of Savannah, Georgia as a minimal hurricane on September 5. It turned to the northeast while weakening over land, and became extratropical on the 6th over New York. As an extratropical storm, David continued to the northeast over New England and the Canadian Maritimes. [...] David intensified once more as it crossed the far north Atlantic, clipping northwestern Iceland before moving eastward well north of the Faroe Islands on September 10.|$|R
40|$|Monitoring the {{movements}} and deformations of buildings, industrial objects and other constructions {{is of great}} importance because their damage may endanger human life and can cause environmental catastrophes. The movements and deformation of a building depend among others on its own construction, local ground motions, on the variation of environmental parameters and {{is influenced by the}} ordinary use e. g. variation of loading of the walls, etc. The main object of the present research was the investigation of the coupling between building and ground movements regarding to the safety of dangerous industrial objects. Results can contribute to the planning of more stable, reliable and motion-proof constructions and eventually to <b>forecast</b> <b>damages.</b> To get insight into the mechanical coupling between a building and its close vicinity the TV tower in Sopron was chosen. High towers move due to strong wind or could change their centre of gravity caused by heating and dilatation while the sun radiates onto the walls of the tower and is going around it. The movements of the tower are transmitted to the ground and therefore the coupling between ground and building can be investigated in a broad perio...|$|R
