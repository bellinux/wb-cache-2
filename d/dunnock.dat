5|$|The {{call of the}} Siberian accentor is a trisyllabic ti-ti-ti. The male's song, given {{from the}} top of a bush or tree, is a loud, high chirichiriri, {{variously}} described as {{similar to that of the}} Japanese accentor, the <b>dunnock</b> or the black-throated accentor. Breeding birds sing most vigorously early in the season, particularly at dawn, and some individuals may also sing on migration.|$|E

5|$|The {{accentors}} are {{a family}} of small ground-living insectivorous birds, {{most of which are}} found in mountainous habitats in Eurasia, although the <b>dunnock</b> is a lowland species. Their relationships with other bird families are uncertain. All accentors are placed in a single genus, Prunella, but within that genus, the Siberian accentor is most similar in appearance to the black-throated, brown, Kozlov's, Radde's and Arabian accentors. These are of comparable in size and typically have a pale supercilium and dark markings on the head or throat. However, a 2013 phylogenetic study indicates that the closest relative of the Siberian accentor is actually the physically dissimilar Japanese accentor.|$|E
25|$|In 1948, Miller built a small {{studio in}} Roxbury, Connecticut. There, {{in less than}} a day, he wrote Act I of Death of a Salesman. Within six weeks, he {{completed}} the rest of the play, one of the classics of world theater. Death of a Salesman premiered on Broadway on February 10, 1949, at the Morosco Theatre, directed by Elia Kazan, and starring Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred <b>Dunnock</b> as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. The play was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, winning a Tony Award for Best Author, the New York Drama Circle Critics' Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama. It was the first play to win all three of these major awards. The play was performed 742 times.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Broadway {{production was}} produced by Kermit Bloomgarden and Walter Fried. The play opened at the Morosco Theatre on February 10, 1949, closing on November 18, 1950, after 742 performances. The play starred Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman, Mildred <b>Dunnock</b> as Linda, Arthur Kennedy as Biff, Howard Smith as Charley and Cameron Mitchell as Happy. Albert Dekker and Gene Lockhart later played Willy Loman during the original Broadway run. It won the Tony Award for Best Play, Best Supporting or Featured Actor (Arthur Kennedy), Best Scenic Design (Jo Mielziner), Producer (Dramatic), Author (Arthur Miller), and Director (Elia Kazan), {{as well as the}} 1949 Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the New York Drama Critics' Circle Award for Best Play. Jayne Mansfield performed in a production of the play in Dallas, Texas, in October 1953. Her performance in the play attracted Paramount Pictures to hire her for the studio's film productions.|$|E

2500|$|Proud of this accomplishment, Dean {{referred}} to the Actors Studio in a 1952 letter to his family as [...] "the greatest school of the theater. It houses great people like Marlon Brando, Julie Harris, Arthur Kennedy, Mildred <b>Dunnock,</b> Eli Wallach... Very few get into it ... It {{is the best thing}} that can happen to an actor.

2500|$|Widmark's {{first movie}} {{appearance}} was in Kiss of Death (1947), as the giggling, sociopathic villain Tommy Udo. In his most notorious scene, Udo pushed a wheelchair-bound woman (played by Mildred <b>Dunnock)</b> {{down a flight}} of stairs to her death. Widmark was almost not cast. He said, [...] "The director, Henry Hathaway, didn't want me. I have a high forehead; he thought I looked too intellectual." [...] Hathaway was overruled by studio boss Darryl F. Zanuck. [...] "Hathaway gave me kind of a bad time," [...] recalled Widmark. Kiss of Death was a commercial and critical success: Widmark won the Golden Globe Award for New Star Of The Year - Actor, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance. Widmark played [...] "Dude" [...] in the Western film Yellow Sky (1948), with Gregory Peck and Anne Baxter. His name was billed third, above the title.|$|E
2500|$|Ford's last {{completed}} {{feature film}} was 7 Women (MGM, 1966), a drama about missionary women in China ca. 1935 {{trying to protect}} themselves from the advances of a barbaric Mongolian warlord. Anne Bancroft took over the lead role from Patricia Neal, who suffered a near-fatal stroke two days into shooting. The supporting cast included Margaret Leighton, Flora Robson, Sue Lyon, Mildred <b>Dunnock,</b> Anna Lee, Eddie Albert, Mike Mazurki and Woody Strode, with music by Elmer Bernstein. Unfortunately it was a commercial flop, grossing only about half of its $2.3million budget. Unusual for Ford, it was shot in continuity {{for the sake of the}} performances and he therefore exposed about four times as much film as he usually shot. Anna Lee recalled that Ford was [...] "absolutely charming" [...] to everyone and that the only major blow-up came when Flora Robson complained that the sign on her dressing room door did not include her title ("Dame") and as a result Robson was [...] "absolutely shredded" [...] by Ford in front of the cast and crew.|$|E
50|$|The Heart of the Valley is a {{novel by}} British author Nigel Hinton. It was first {{published}} in 1986 and was his first and to date only book written for adults. The story focuses on the nature of an English valley especially the <b>dunnocks.</b>|$|R
40|$|Alpine {{accentors}} and <b>dunnocks</b> bred in polygynandrous {{groups in}} which two or more unrelated males shared two or more females. In both species, a female solicited actively to both alpha and subordinate males whereas an alpha male attempted to guard the female to monopolize paternity. Females combated the restrictions imposed by alpha male guarding by increasing their solicitation rate to males who had gained less mating access. Males increased their copulation rate in response, but alpha males ignored more of the offers. In both species, even when a female mated with both alpha and beta males she often gained just one male’s help with chick feeding. Under these conditions, alpha male alpine accentors reduced their amount of help with a decreased mating share, whereas beta males did not. In <b>dunnocks,</b> however, neither alpha nor beta males reduced their help provided a critical share of the matings was exceeded. As predicted if females attempted to maximize male help, female alpine accentors preferred to give more matings to the alpha male while female <b>dunnocks</b> preferred alpha and beta equally. There was no evidence for either species that alpha males sired fitter offspring; within broods of mixed paternity, {{there was no difference}} in the weights of chicks sired by alpha versus subordinate males. Female <b>dunnocks</b> competed with other females by territory defence whereas female alpine accentors had overlapping ranges and competed directly for male attention, increasing their solicitation rate to the alpha male if other females in the group were fertile. We suggest that the extraordinarily high rates of solicitation by females, refusal by males and copulation rates (up to a thousand per clutch) in the two species are the outcome of sexual conflict over the control of mating...|$|R
25|$|Polyandrous {{behavior}} is quite {{widespread in the}} animal kingdom. It is prominent in many species of insects and fish (for example pipefish; see Polyandry in fish). It {{is also found in}} other animals such as birds (for example <b>dunnocks),</b> whales, and in some mammals such as house mouse.|$|R

60|$|In October, I started {{feeding the}} birds {{at the house}} where I was staying as a guest, {{throwing}} the scraps on a lawn at the back which sloped down towards the estuary. First came all the small birds in the immediate neighbourhood--robin, <b>dunnock,</b> wagtail, chaffinch, throstle, blackbird, and blue and ox-eye tits. Then followed troops of starlings, and soon all the rooks and daws in the village began {{to see what was}} going on and come too, and this attracted the gulls from the estuary--I wished that it had drawn the curlews; and all these big ones were so greedy and bold, so noisy and formidable-looking that the small birds were quite driven out; all except the starlings that came in hungry crowds and were determined to get their share.|$|E
60|$|To {{return to}} the downs. Their very {{emptiness}} and desolation, which frightens the stranger from them, only serves {{to make them more}} fascinating to those who are intimate with and have learned to love them. That dreary aspect brings to mind the other one, when, on waking with the early sunlight in the room, you look out on a blue sky, cloudless or with white clouds. It may be fancy, or the effect of contrast, but it has always seemed to me that just as the air is purer and fresher on these chalk heights than on the earth below, and as the water is of a more crystal purity, and the sky perhaps bluer, so do all colours and all sounds have a purity and vividness and intensity beyond that of other places. I see it in the yellows of hawkweed, rock-rose, and birds'-foot-trefoil, in the innumerable specks of brilliant colour--blue and white and rose--of milk-wort and squinancy-wort, and in the large flowers of the dwarf thistle, glowing purple in its green setting; and I hear it in every bird-sound, in the trivial songs of yellow-hammer and corn-bunting, and of <b>dunnock</b> and wren and whitethroat.|$|E
50|$|In many monogamous bird species, the {{dominant}} pairs {{tend to get}} the best territories, which in turn promote offspring survival and adult health. In <b>dunnocks,</b> a species of birds that experiences many mating systems, sometimes individuals will form a group that will have one dominant male who achieves all of the mating in the group.|$|R
50|$|The area {{is deemed}} {{important}} {{as it is}} inhabited by the second-largest roost of hen harriers in Europe; a bird that descends on the area during the winter months. Other birds include peregrine falcons, merlins, robins, willow warblers, song thrushes and <b>dunnocks</b> among others. There is also a subspecies of wren, possibly unique to the Isle.|$|R
60|$|These three broods over {{my window}} {{were not the}} only ones in the place; there were at least twenty other pairs in the garden and {{outhouses}} of the inn--sparrows, thrushes, blackbirds, <b>dunnocks,</b> wrens, starlings, and swallows. Yet the inn was in the very centre of the village, and being an inn was the most frequented and noisiest spot.|$|R
6000|$|The willow wren {{is one of}} the commonest and {{undoubtedly}} the most generally diffused of the British songsters. A summer visitor, one of the earliest to arrive, usually appearing on the South Coast in the last week in March; a little later he may be met with in very nearly every wood, thicket, hedge, common, marsh, orchard, and large garden throughout the kingdom--it is hard to say, writes Seebohm, where he is not found. Wherever there are green perching-places, and small caterpillars, flies and aphides to feed upon, there you will see and hear the willow wren. He is a sweet and constant singer from the date of his arrival until about the middle of June, when he becomes silent for a season, resuming his song in July, and continuing it throughout August and even into September. This late summer singing is, however, fitful and weak and less joyous in character than in the spring. But in spite of his abundance and universality, and the charm of his little melody, he is not familiarly known to the people generally, as they know the robin redbreast, pied wagtail, <b>dunnock,</b> redstart, wheatear, and stonechat. The name we call him by is a very old one; it was first used in English by Ray, in his translation of Willughby's Ornithology, about three centuries ago; but it still remains a book-name unknown to the rustic. Nor has this common little bird any widely known vernacular name. If by chance you find a country-man who knows the bird, and has a name for it, this will be one which is applied indiscriminately to two, three, or four species. The willow wren, in fact, is one of those little birds that are [...] "seen rather than distinguished," [...] on account of its small size, modest colouring, and its close resemblance to other species of warblers; also on account of the quiet, gentle character of its song, which is little noticed {{in the spring and summer}} concert of loud, familiar voices.|$|E
50|$|A similar {{strategy}} has been observed in the <b>dunnock,</b> a small bird. Before mating with the polyandrous female, the male <b>dunnock</b> pecks at the female's cloaca in order to peck out the sperm of the previous male suitor.|$|E
5000|$|Most of {{the species}} live {{together}} in flocks. The <b>dunnock</b> is an exception since it prefers to be solitary except when feeding. The <b>dunnock</b> also earned a nickname of [...] "shuffle-wing" [...] since it most strongly displays the characteristic wing flicks used during courtship and other displays.|$|E
40|$|In birds, fat {{accumulation}} {{before and}} during migration {{has been shown to}} be endogenously controlled and tuned by, among other factors, the Earth's magnetic field. However, our knowledge about the influence of the geomagnetic field on the fuelling in migrating birds is still limited to just a few nocturnally migrating passerine species. In order to study if variations of the magnetic field can also influence the fuelling of both day- and night-migrating passerines, we caught first-year <b>dunnocks</b> (Prunella modularis) and subjected them to three magnetic field conditions simulated by a system of magnetic coils: (1) local geomagnetic field of southern Sweden, (2) magnetic field corresponding to the centre of the expected wintering area, and (3) magnetic field met at the northern limit of the species' breeding distribution. We did not find a difference in mass increase between the birds kept in a local magnetic field and a field resembling their wintering area, irrespectively of the mode of magnetic displacement, i. e. direct or step-wise. However, the <b>dunnocks</b> magnetically displaced north showed a lower rate of fuelling in comparison to the control group, probably due to elevated activity. Compared with previous studies, our results suggest that the fuelling response to magnetic displacements during the migration period is specific to the eco-physiological situation. Future studies need to address if there is an effect of magnetic field manipulation on the level of migratory activity in <b>dunnocks</b> and how widespread the influence of local geomagnetic field parameters is on fuelling decisions in different bird species, which have different migratory strategies, distances and migration history...|$|R
50|$|<b>Dunnocks</b> are {{territorial}} and may {{engage in}} conflict with other birds that encroach upon their nests. Males sometimes share a territory and exhibit a strict dominance hierarchy. Nevertheless, this social dominance is not translated into benefits to the alpha male in terms of reproduction, since parternity is usually equally shared between males of the group. Furthermore, {{members of a group}} are rarely related, and so competition can result.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study found}} that male <b>dunnocks</b> tend to not {{discriminate}} between their own young and those of another male in polyandrous or polygynandrous systems. However, they increase their own reproductive success through feeding the offspring {{in relation to their}} own access to the female throughout the mating period, which is generally a good predictor of paternity. [...] This indiscriminative parental care by males is also observed in redlip blennies.|$|R
