40|$|Abstract. Conventionally, Marx {{generators}} {{are used}} {{for the production of}} short duration, high voltage pulses but since many discharge gap switches are utilized for stepping up the voltage, there are many disadvantages. Here, an alternative and much simpler technique for the multiplication of nanosecond high voltage pulses has been presented in which multiplication takes place by switching single spark gap providing voltage gain of ‘nxV ’ where n is the subsequent number of stages. Stepped up high voltage pulse with fixed voltage gain of defined shape with fast rise time and good flat top is produced without using additional pulse-forming network. Its operation has been made repetitive by switching single spark gap. Multipurpose use, low cost, small size, light weight (weighing less than 50 kg) and portability are the additional benefits of the system. The reported nanosecond pulser has been made by cascading three stages of Blumlein. To cross check its performance the parasitic impedance of the system has been evaluated to realize its adverse effect on the voltage gain and pulse shape. Also its operation has been simulated by PSPICE circuit simulator program and good agreement has been obtained between simu-lated and experimental results. Applications of this pulse generator include X-ray <b>generation,</b> <b>breakdown</b> tests, ion implantation, streamer discharge studies and ultra wideband generation, among others...|$|E
40|$|An unusual {{nonlinear}} resonance was experimentally {{observed in}} a ruby phonon laser (phaser) operating at 9 GHz with an electromagnetic pumping at 23 GHz. The resonance is manifested by very slow cooperative self-detunings in the microwave spectra of stimulated phonon emission when pumping is modulated at a superlow frequency (less than 10 Hz). During the self-detuning cycle new and new narrow phonon modes are sequentially ``fired'' {{on one side of}} the spectrum and approximately the same number of modes are ``extinguished'' on the other side, up to a complete <b>generation</b> <b>breakdown</b> in a certain final portion of the frequency axis. This is usually followed by a short-time refractority, after which the generation is fired again in the opposite (starting) portion of the frequency axis. The entire process of such cooperative spectral motions is repeated with high degree of regularity. The self-detuning period strongly depends on difference between the modulation frequency and the resonance frequency. This period is incommensurable with period of modulation. It increases to very large values (more than 100 s) when pointed difference is less than 0. 05 Hz. The revealed phenomenon is a kind of global spin-phonon self- organization. All microwave modes of phonon laser oscillate with the same period, but with different, strongly determined phase shifts - as in optical lasers with antiphase motions.

The laser pulse focused at a small area creates an optical breakdown followed by plasma formation. This induced shock wave formation followed by acoustic wave in the liquid medium. The acoustic wave generated was detected using a Piezo sensor coupled with preamplifier of 1 GO input impedance. Difference distances of source to transducer were configured. Difference sample solutions such as distilled water, sodium chloride (NaCl) solutions and white grape juice were used. Properties of acoustic wave, such as the attenuation (amplitude voltage), transient pressure, and dominant component frequency were observed. It was found experimentally that spatial extent of the <b>generation</b> <b>breakdown</b> can affect the acoustic signature and Fourier spectrum of photo-acoustic response where the amplitude and the transient pressure of the signals increase when {{the distance of the}} source-sensor decrease. The voltage amplitude for white grape juice and distilled water samples at a distance of 10 mm, were 4. 57 V and 4. 75 V respectively while for the transient pressure, the value were 481. 46 kPa and 500. 42 kPa respectively. The presence of ions in aqueous solution can also affect its photo-acoustic response due to water molecule association, where OH band strongly attached to hydrogen-bond water molecule and the other part of band deals with free molecules. The attenuation effect in electrolyte solutions (NaCl) was found to be larger, compared to other samples where the amplitude at lower concentration was 0. 40 V, with pressure of 42. 14 kPa.

Scaled to the full number of SDDs in Ontario, this might mean as much as an 18 % demand spike, but more likely we would see somewhere around 3 – 5 % increase in demand due to the least expensive heat pump being favoured along with the common balanced control (corresponding to scenario SS-B). Most importantly, we cannot expect full adoption of heat pumps amongst all SDDs in Ontario to occur anytime soon. The very significant effect of TOU pricing should also be noted as an effective method of managing heat pump electricity demand if energy-price-aware (advanced) controls are installed in most homes.|$|R
40|$|The {{understanding}} of the role of hyaluronan in physiology and various pathological conditions has changed since the complex nature of its synthesis, degradation and interactions with diverse binding proteins was revealed. Initially perceived only as an inert component of connective tissue, it is now known to be involved in multiple signaling pathways, including those involved in cancer pathogenesis and progression. Hyaluronan presents a mixture of various length polymer molecules from finely fragmented oligosaccharides, polymers intermediate in size, to huge aggregates of high molecular weight hyaluronan. While large molecules promote tissue integrity and quiescence, the <b>generation</b> of <b>breakdown</b> products enhances signaling transduction, contributing to the pro-oncogenic behavior of cancer cells. Low molecular weight hyaluronan has well-established angiogenic properties, while the smallest hyaluronan oligomers may counteract tumor development.

Optimization of the Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) signal with respect to carrier gas flow rate, analyte, acid (HCl) and reductant (NaBH 4) concentrations and flow rates was performed by using spectral emission intensity from the neutral Sn(I) line at 284. 0 nm under atmospheric pressures. With flow rates of 5. 0 mL/min for NaBH 4 and 2. 5 mL/min for HCl, optimum NaBH 4 and HCl concentrations were determined as 2. 0 % (w/v) and 1. 0 % (v/v), respectively. The hydride generation efficiency of the system was tested for tin hydride, stannane (SnH 4), by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS). It was found that higher than 99 % of the analyte was released into the gaseous phase. Upon optimization, the minimum detectable Sn concentration was found as 0. 3 mg/L in water samples. That corresponds to more than two orders of increase in sensitivity compared to methods that employ common sample introduction techniques in liquids analysis by LIBS. Over 90 % recoveries were obtained from spiking experiments with river, tap and drinking water samples.

40|$|This work spans {{nearly a}} decade of {{industrial}} research in the reliability physics of deeply scaled SiO 2 and SiON gate dielectrics. In this work, we will present our following original contributions to the field: • Below 5 V stress, the dominant mechanism for stressed induced leakage current in the off-state is tunneling via interface traps in films less than 35 Å thick. This finding enhances the value of SILC measurements as a probe of trap generation. LV-SILC is a two-trap process and senses interface states at both top and bottom interfaces. • A conclusive experimental proof of the IBM energy driven breakdown theory, showing that breakdown is indeed voltage rather than field driven in ultra-thin oxides. This work {{has been instrumental in}} ending the long running controversy in the industry on breakdown models. • Experimental verification of the Bell Labs theory that anode hole injection through minority ionization remains a plausible breakdown mechanism down to 3. 6 V. This finding shows that holes continue {{to play a role in}} the degradation physics at low voltages. However, our experiments eliminate anode hole injection as the mechanism for breakdown below about 2. 7 V. • Plasma nitridation of oxides significantly extends the reliability scaling limit of SiO 2 based films. Bulk trap generation rates are minimized and the film reliability is optimized when the nitrogen profile is uniform. Plasma nitrided SiON films are now widely used throughout the industry in high volume manufacturing. • Reaction-diffusion theory applies for TDDB stress of ultra-thin NMOS SiON films. Measurable recovery effects are present, showing that quasi-equilibrium exists for NMOS under substrate injection conditions. This finding enables the determination of the mechanisms for trap <b>generation</b> and <b>breakdown,</b> showing that they are controlled by the release of two species of hydrogen (H+ and H 0) from the anode in two separate anode reactions. H+ and H 0 both create interface traps at the poly interface when they are released. After migrating into the dielectric, H+ subsequently creates SiON bulk traps while H 0 subsequently creates interface traps at the pwell interface. The hydrogen species that controls breakdown is voltage dependent. The mechanism for breakdown transitions from hole induced H+ desorption to electron induced H 0 desorption below the 2. 7 V threshold for vibrational excitation of Si-H bonds. • Bulk traps control breakdown in SiO 2 dielectrics below 30 Å. However, bulk traps are not always the defects that control breakdown in SiON films below 20 Å. Below the 2. 7 V threshold energy for vibrational excitation of silicon-hydrogen bonds, the rate limiting step is the generation of interface traps. However, a minimum of two traps is required to cause breakdown in SiON films down to 10 Å EOT. At least one trap must be an interface state and at least one must be a bulk state. • Our experimentally obtained trap generation power law exponent m being about 0. 3, which is lower than the numbers reported by other researchers, is the only value that is consistent with the temperature and voltage dependence of trap <b>generation</b> and <b>breakdown.</b> This leads to the SiON bulk trap diameter being about 4 Å, which is significantly lower than earlier estimates and results in the Weibull slope to remain greater than 1 down to the 12 Å limit for physical oxide thickness...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{intends to}} provide new {{insight into the}} aerodynamics of wings in ground effect under dynamic motion. This work represents a new step forward {{in the field of}} race car aerodynamics, in which steady aerodynamics are well understood. As the first comprehensive study on oscillating wings in ground effect, several modes of oscillation were studied numerically, including heaving, pitching and combined motion of an airfoil and heaving of a wing fitted with endplates. A wide range of reduced frequencies were tested for the simulations at different ride heights, which showed appreciable differences with respect to a stationary wing. The flowfield around the airfoil was obtained by solving the Reynolds-Averaged Navier- Stokes equations, while Detached Eddy Simulation was used for the wing. A dynamic mesh model was implemented to adapt the grid to the wing motion. The results showed other aerodynamic mechanisms in addition to the ground effect, namely the effective incidence and added mass. Stall can be postponed to lower ride heights by increasing the frequency of heaving, while a pitching airfoil can stall below the static stall incidence when placed close to the ground. A stability analysis showed that flutter can occur at low frequencies in heaving motion but increasing the frequency always stabilises the motion. The behaviour of the vortex formed on the inboard face of the endplate is altered by the heaving motion and has an important effect on the downforce <b>generation.</b> Vortex <b>breakdown</b> can be induced or suppressed depending on the frequency and effective incidence. At high frequencies, these vortices interact with counter-rotating trailing edge vortices to form vortex loops that transform into omega vortices in the wake. Additional experiments for a stationary wing serve to qualitatively validate and complement the reference cases. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
30|$|Several {{limitations}} {{exist in}} this study. For all experiments, {{at least three}} different cell donors were used to correct for donor variability. Although this is not uncommon within in vitro literature, the power of our study is limited. Another possible limitation {{is the use of}} 20 % O 2 as a control for the experiments, because the endothelial cells were isolated and cultured under these conditions. 20 % O 2 is however already hyperoxic for endothelial cells in vivo [62]. However, performing experiments using physiological levels of oxygen exposure as a control would require endothelial cells to be isolated and cultured continuously within a hypoxic chamber. This is not feasible within an in vitro setup. Performing experiments using 20 % O 2 as a control is common practice and a limitation within in vitro literature in general. We did consider this point and repeated the eNOS and ET- 1 experiments by exposing them to 10 % O 2 (= 76  mmHg) (Additional file 1 : Figure S 2). This did not lead to significantly different outcomes of the experiments. A limitation of this study {{was the fact that the}} cells could only be cultured under hyperoxia for a maximum of 72  h. After 72  h, the culture media needed to be refreshed and the airtight boxes opened. This would decrease the oxygen concentration within the boxes back to atmospheric conditions. Experiments investigating hyperoxic exposure for short time periods (i.e., < 1  h) were also not performed in this study. In addition, cell proliferation and viability experiments were not performed under mild hyperoxic (30 % O 2) conditions. Furthermore, this study investigated ET- 1, via mRNA and eNOS, via mRNA and protein levels and did not investigate downstream pathways of NO <b>generation</b> or <b>breakdown.</b> Neither were other pathways investigated such as 20 -HETE or prostaglandin production. Finally, our isolated hMVEC model precluded measuring hyperoxic effects mediated by the interaction between endothelial cells, leukocytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells and excluded the interaction with flow and circulating mediators.|$|R
30|$|Several {{lines of}} evidences suggest that, {{from among the}} {{generated}} ROS, H 2 O 2 plays {{a central role in}} these plant defense responses (Mehdy et al. [1996]). On the other hand ROS exhibit deleterious impact on the cellular components and so plants possess effective mechanisms for detoxification of ROS in order to protect themselves from the toxic effects. SOD catalyze the dismutation of O 2.- radicals to O 2 and H 2 O 2, and CAT and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) remove H 2 O 2, thus playing a role of antioxidative key enzymes. Moreover, the Guaiacol type peroxidases may use H 2 O 2 in the process of cell wall reinforcement by catalyzing the polymerization of cinnamyl groups into lignin, suberization and deposition of phenolic compounds. Hence the balance between ROS <b>generation</b> and <b>breakdown</b> may be critical for the outcome of plant-pathogen interaction. After failure of this balance, ROS accumulation occurs. Recently, the prominent role of ROS has been revealed in the induction, signalling and execution of plant cell death (Jabs [1999]; Apel and Hirt [2004]; Karuppanapandian et al. [2011]). The initial lower level of ROS may stimulate the production of higher amount of ROS through feedback regulation. The change of ROS content can trigger different signalling cascades leading to cell death (Breusegem and Dat [2006]). Moreover, there was a strong interplay between ROS and other signalling molecules (phytohormones) such as ethylene and salicylic acid (SA) during cell death (Overmyer et al. [2005]). Toxic level of ROS usually react with numerous cell components, causing a cascade of oxidative reactions and the consequent inactivation of enzymes, protein degradation and nucleic acid damage. In addition, excessive ROS can react with membrane lipids, generating lipid peroxides that can in turn lead to further damaging intermediates, such as malondialdehyde (MDA), to the point of inducing cellular dysfunction and/or cell death (Paciolla et al. [2004]; Maksymiec and Krupa [2006]; Schraudner et al. [1998]).|$|R
40|$|The energy {{dependence}} of competing fragmentation pathways of protonated peptide molecules is studied via laser desorption—chemical ionization in a Fourier transform {{ion cyclotron resonance}} spectrometer. Neutral peptide molecules are desorbed by the technique of substrate-assisted laser desorption, followed by post-ionization with a proton transfer reagent ion species. The chemical ionization reaction activates the protonated peptide molecules, which then fragment {{in accordance with the}} amount of excess energy that is deposited. Chemical ionization forms a protonated molecule with a narrower distribution of activation energy than can be formed by activation methods such as collision activated dissociation. Furthermore, the upper limit of the activation energy is well defined and is approximately given by the enthalpy of the chemical ionization reaction. Control over the fragmentation of peptide ions is demonstrated through reactions between desorbed peptide molecules with different reagent ion species.

Simulation results were validated and have revealed {{the significance of}} each relevant electron-molecule reaction. Self-sustaining discharge and ionization were reproduced numerically under sufficient voltage bias, and the predicted trends of breakdown voltage are similar to prior results. Experimentally, the atmospheric field emission and ionization capabilities of highly graphitic polycrystalline diamond (HGPD) film were characterized. The HGPD sample was activated by applying a moderate voltage bias for an extended period. After activation, a smaller turn-on voltage and a larger, more sustainable current of 10 μA were observed. A hydrogen plasma treatment after long-term operation was shown to restore emission current back to or even exceeding the original level, which suggests an important role of surface termination in electron emission processes. ^ An atomistic Green 2 ̆ 7 s function (AGF) method was developed to simulate nanoscale phonon transport {{in the second part}} of this dissertation. The theory of the AGF method was established with a full derivation of transmission function and heat flux expressions based on lattice dynamics and Green 2 ̆ 7 s function theories. Basic implementations were demonstrated using simple homogeneous and heterogeneous atomic chain examples. The thermal impact of lattice strain was studied in a strained Si/Ge thin film and was shown to be less important than the heterogeneous material effect. The thermal boundary resistance of a single Si/Ge interface was obtained and compared well with the acoustic mismatch model (AMM) at low temperatures. Ballistic behavior of phonons was illustrated through length-dependence and multi-interface case studies. The AGF method was also extended to calculate the thermal conductance of a nanowire-plane junction structure. A method to evaluate self-energy matrices of the abrupt interface was introduced. The dependence of thermal transport on nanowire diameter and length were investigated. Normalized thermal conductance of nanowire-plane junction structure converges with thin-film conductance at large nanowire diameters. Increasing nanowire length reduces thermal conductance due to the weakened coupling between contacts and the device. ...|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{experimental}} observations, the mechanisms {{for reducing the}} breakdown threshold {{may be due to}} possible charging of the nanoparticles within the gap, which may reduce the effective distance. Since the current across the gap does not vary with and without nanoparticle seeding, the increased conductivity due to the presence of metal nanoparticles is small. Additionally nanoparticles do not start to combust before the breakdown. The Joule heating due to the presence of metal nanoparticles is slow compared to <b>breakdown</b> <b>generation.</b> However, evidence of charging of the metal nanoparticles within the gap has been observed in these experiments. For example in Figure  5, the attraction of the nanoparticles to the cathode and the subsequent ignition near the cathode region indicate that the nanoparticles were positively charged. In addition, the chemiluminescence image at 2  ms shows a brighter glow near the cathode, which suggests that the evolution of the breakdown started from anode and turned toward the cathode. The nanoparticles charging and shifting toward the cathode might allow the nanoparticles to serve as effective electrodes within the gap, which could mimic a reduction in the gap distance. It is speculated that the Paschen curve may still hold for the particle laden flow with the addition of the conducting nanoparticles near the cathode leading to an effective reduction in distance between the electrodes, i.e., the PD values on the x axis are reduced.|$|R

Although {{there is some}} previous work on vapor breakdown by microsecond laser pulses, {{there have been no}} attempts made on vapor breakdown by nanosecond laser pulses. This work intends to fill the gap. A kinetic model is developed considering following factors: (1) two temperatures of both electrons and heavy-body particles (ions, neutrals, and excited states of neutrals), (2) absorption mechanisms of laser energy include inverse bremstrahlung (IB) processes and photoionization of excited states, (3) ionization acceleration mechanisms included are electron-impact excitation of ground state neutrals, electron-impact ionization of exited states of neutrals, photoionization of excited states of neutrals, and all necessary reverse processes. The rates of various processes considered are calculated according to the formula given by Zel`dovich and Raizer. The authors use a second order predictor-corrector numerical scheme for iterations of the rate equations. The rate equations are solved for five quantities, namely, densities of electrons, neutrals, and excited states of neutrals, and the temperatures of electrons and heavy-body particles. The total breakdown times (sum of evaporation time and vapor breakdown time) at different energy fluences are then calculated.

Sheep rumen microbiome is specialized in degradation of plant material, but most members of this complex community are non-cultivable in laboratory. Therefore, the search for new lignocellulolytic enzymes in microbial communities naturally evolved in the biomass degradation, in environments such as the rumen, using {{the exploration of the}} metagenome, is a promising strategy for the exploration of genes. In this context, this study aimed to obtain plant biomass-degrading genes, selected from the sheep rumen microorganisms. The rumen samples were collected from 6 fistulated animals (Ovis aries), divided into two groups and subjected to two diets: control and sugarcane bagasse, 60 days after the beginning of the experiment. To characterize biomass-degrading genes, the metagenomic DNA was extracted from the solid contents of rumen followed by sequencing in MiSeq Personal Sequencer platform (Illumina®). We analyzed, 4, 68 gigabases of metagenomic total DNA from microbes adherent to plant fiber, using on the CLC Genomic Workbench v. 5. 5. 1 platform (CLC Bio, Denmark). The assembled contigs that allowed identification of 27 putative partial carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAE) (NCBI-nr) representing a total of 11 lignocellulases, 13 amylases and 3 other putative CAE from animals fed with control diet and 106 putative partial CAE representing a total of 52 lignocellulases, 46 amylases and 8 other putative CAE from animals fed with diet amended with sugarcane bagasse. These data sets shows the sheep rumen microbiome as an untapped source of potential new fibrolytic enzymes. Using a diet amended with sugarcane bagasse increases the abundance of CAE and provide a substantially expanded catalog of genes participating in the deconstruction of plant biomass 201...|$|R
40|$|In the rat balloon injury model, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors prevent {{vascular}} remodelling by inhibiting angiotensin II <b>generation</b> and kinin <b>breakdown.</b> We investigated if ACE inhibition also {{prevents the}} structural vascular responses to disruption of carotid artery blood flow and if kinin potentiation {{plays a role}} in such a protection. Morphometric analysis of the structural alterations caused by ligation of the left carotid artery was performed 14 days after surgery in J 129 Sv wild-type mice (B 2 +/+) drinking normal tap water or water containing captopril (120 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 per day). In addition, the effect of captopril on vascular remodelling was tested in B 2 +/+ given the bradykinin (BK) B 1 receptor antagonist des-Arg 9 -[Leu 8]-BK (DALBK, 50 [*]nmol[*]kg− 1 per day, intraperitoneally) or the BK B 2 receptor antagonist D-Arg,[Hyp 3,Thi 5 D-Tic 7,Oic 8]-BK (icatibant, 1 [*]μmol[*]kg− 1 per day, intraperitoneally), and in B 2 receptor gene knockout mice (B 2 −/−). Interruption of blood flow resulted in carotid artery intimal hyperplasia and media thickening in untreated B 2 +/+, these responses being partially suppressed by captopril. The inhibition of intimal thickening exerted by captopril was reduced in B 2 +/+ given DALBK or icatibant (P< 0. 05 for both comparisons) as well as in B 2 −/− (P< 0. 05). Neither antagonism of kinin receptors nor disruption of the B 2 receptor gene altered the suppressive effect of captopril on media thickening. The protection of vascular wall structure was independent of the reduction in blood pressure by captopril. These results demonstrate that kinins participate in the inhibitory effect of captopril on intimal hyperplasia via B 1 and B 2 receptor signalling. Our findings may have important implications in treating vascular remodelling evoked by altered shear stress conditions...|$|R
40|$|Early {{events in}} both T-cell {{receptor}} (CD 3) - and CD 4 -induced signal transduction pathways include tyrosine phosphorylation of protein substrates, the <b>generation</b> of phosphatidylinositol-phosphate <b>breakdown</b> products, and {{the mobilization of}} intracellular Ca 2 +. Oxidative stress in T cells mediated by sulfhydryl-reactive nonpolar maleimides was shown previously to down-regulate both receptor-mediated Ca 2 + mobilization and interleukin 2 production. Here we show that N-ethylmaleimide suppresses both CD 3 - and CD 4 -induced Ca 2 + responses in human T cells correlating with {{a reduction in the}} level of phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1) tyrosine phosphorylation. The inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC gamma 1 and additional protein substrates was observed at concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide above 20 microM, whereas lower concentrations of oxidant appeared to increase tyrosine kinase activity following cell stimulation. Sulfhydryl oxidation did not directly affect the catalytic activity of PLC gamma 1, since immunopurified enzyme from N-ethylmaleimide-treated T cells was fully active. Although N-ethylmaleimide treatment of T cells did not cause a direct effect on total pp 56 lck kinase activity measured in vitro, the interaction between CD 4 and pp 56 lck was oxidation-sensitive in vivo. However, CD 3 -induced signaling was inhibited at N-ethylmaleimide concentrations lower than that required for CD 4 /pp 56 lck dissociation, suggesting that CD 3 -associated tyrosine kinase activity involves acutely sensitive regulatory thiols. In addition to chemically induced sulfhydryl oxidation, naturally regulated cellular redox states appear to dictate the potential for T-cell responsiveness, since degranulating human peripheral blood neutrophils inhibited CD 3 -induced Ca 2 + mobilization in T lymphocytes. These data indicate that signal transduction in T cells involves the activation of PLC gamma 1 by tyrosine phosphorylation through an oxidation-sensitive intermediate between surface receptors and tyrosine kinases, perhaps including the interaction between CD 4 and pp 56 lck...|$|R
40|$|Amorphous dielectrics of {{different}} thicknesses (nm to mm) {{are used in}} various applications. Low temperature processing/deposition of amorphous thin-film dielectrics often result in defect-states or electronic traps. These traps are responsible for increased leakage currents and bulk charge trapping in many associated applications. Additional defects may be generated during regular usage, leading to electrical breakdown. Increased leakage currents, charge trapping and defect generation/breakdown are important and pervasive reliability concerns in amorphous dielectrics. ^ We first explore the issue of charge accumulation and leakage in amorphous dielectrics. Historically, charge transport in amorphous dielectrics has been presumed, depending on the dielectric thickness, to be either bulk dominated (Frenkel-Poole (FP) emission) or contact dominated (Fowler-Nordheim tunneling). We develop a comprehensive dielectric charging modeling framework which solves for the transient and steady state charge accumulation and leakage currents in an amorphous dielectric, and show that for intermediate thickness dielectrics, the conventional assumption of FP dominated current transport is incorrect, and may lead to false extraction of dielectric parameters. We propose an improved dielectric characterization methodology based on an analytical approximation of our model. Coupled with ab-initio computed defect levels, the dielectric charging model explains measured leakage currents more accurately with lesser empiricism. ^ We study RF-MEMS capacitive switches {{as one of the}} target applications of intermediate thickness amorphous dielectrics. To achieve faster analysis and design of RF-MEMS switches in particular, and electro-mechanical actuators in general, we propose a set of fundamental scaling relationships which are independent of specific physical dimensions and material properties; the scaling relationships provide an intrinsic classification of all electro-mechanical actuators. However, RF-MEMS capacitive switches are plagued by the reliability issue of temporal shifts of actuation voltages due to dielectric charge accumulation, often resulting in failure due to membrane stiction. Using the dielectric charging model, we show that in spite of unpredictable roughness of deposited dielectrics, there are predictable shifts in actuation voltages due to dielectric charging in RF-MEMS switches. We also propose a novel non-obtrusive, non-contact, fully electronic resonance based technique to characterize charging driven actuation shifts in RF-MEMS switches which overcomes limitations in conventionally used methods. ^ Finally, we look into the issue of defect <b>generation</b> and <b>breakdown</b> in thick polymer dielectrics. Polymer materials often face premature electrical breakdown due to high electric fields and frequencies, and exposure to ambient humidity conditions. Using a field-driven correlated defect generation model, coupled with a model for temperature rise due to dielectric heating at AC stresses, we explain measured trends in time-to-breakdown and breakdown electric fields in polymer materials. Using dielectric heating we are able to explain the observed lifetime and dielectric strength reduction with increasing dielectric thicknesses. Performing lifetime measurements after exposure to controlled humidity conditions, we find that moisture ingress into a polymer material reduces activation barriers for chain breakage and increases dielectric heating. ^ Overall, this thesis develops a comprehensive framework of dielectric charging, leakage and degradation of insulators {{of different}} thicknesses that have broad applications in multiple technologies. ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{experimental}} and computational techniques must be improved {{in order to}} advance the prediction capability of the longitudinal vortical flows shed by underwater vehicles. The <b>generation,</b> development, and <b>breakdown</b> mechanisms of the shed vortices at high Reynolds numbers are not fully understood. The ability to measure hull separated vortices associated with vehicle maneuvering does not exist at present. The existing point-by-point measurement techniques can only capture approximately the large 'mean' eddies but fail to meet the dynamics of small vortices during the initial stage of generation. A new technique, which offers a previously unavailable capability to measure the unsteady cross-flow distribution in {{the plane of the}} laser light sheet, is called Particle Displacement Velocimetry (PDV). PDV consists of illuminating a thin section of the flowfield with a pulsed laser. The water is seeded with microscopic, neutrally buoyant particles containing imbedded fluorescing dye which responds with intense spontaneous fluorescence with the illuminated section. The seeded particles in the vortical flow structure shed by the underwater vehicle are illuminated by the pulse laser and the corresponding particle traces are recorded in a single photographic frame. Two distinct approaches were utilized for determining the velocity distribution from the particle traces. The first method is based on matching the traces of the same particle and measuring the distance between them. The direction of the flow can be identified by keeping one of the pulses longer than the other. The second method is based on selecting a small window within the image and finding the mean shift of all the particles within that region. The computation of the auto-correlation of the intensity distribution within the selected sample window is used to determine the mean displacement of particles. The direction of the flow is identified by varying the intensity of the laser light between pulses. Considerable computational resources are required to compute the auto-correction of the intensity distribution. Parallel processing will be employed to speed up the data reduction. A few examples of measured unsteady vortical flow structures shed by the underwater vehicles will be presented...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{transfer}} of contaminants from waste rock dumps and mineralised ground into soils, sediments, waters and plants at the rehabilitated Mary Kathleen uranium mine in semi-arid northwest Queensland. Numerous waste rock dumps were partly covered with benign soil and the open pit mine was allowed to flood. The mineralised and waste calc-silicate rock in the open pit and dumps has major (> 1 wt%) Ca, Fe and Mg, minor (> 1, 000 ppm) Ce, La, Mn, P and S, subminor (> 100 ppm) Ba, Cu, Th and U, and trace (< 100 ppm) As, Ni, Pb, Y and Zn values. Consequently, chemical and physical weathering processes have acted on waste rock and on rock faces within the open pit, mobilising many elements and leading to their dispersion into soils, stream sediments, pit water and several plant species. Chemical dispersion is initiated by sulfide mineral <b>breakdown,</b> <b>generation</b> of sulfuric acid and formation of several soluble, transient sulfate minerals as evaporative efflorescent precipitates. Radiation doses associated with the open pit average 5. 65 mSv year− 1; waste dumps commonly have lower values, especially where soil-covered. Surface pit water is slightly acid, with high sulfate values accompanied by levels of U, Cu and Ni close to or above Australian water guideline values for livestock. Dispersion of U and related elements into soils and stream sediments occurs by physical (erosional) processes and from chemical precipitation. Plants growing in the mine void, on waste dumps and contaminated soil display evidence of biological uptake of U, LREE, Cu and Th {{and to a lesser}} degree of As, Ni, Pb, Y and Zn, with values being up to 1 – 2 orders of magnitude above background sites for the same species. Although rehabilitation procedures have been partly successful in reducing dispersion of U and related elements into the surrounding environment, it is apparent that 20 years after rehabilitation, there is significant physical and chemical mobility, including transfer into plants...|$|R

Moreover, results from the commissioning and the first testphase of the installation are depicted. The background of wind energy in general, the current conditions of legislative regulations, {{and the state of}} the art technologies in use forwind energy converters are included in this research study. In addition, the change of theelectrical power grid due to the increasing share of renewable power generation is illustrated and suggestions which currently are discussed for addressing the resultingproblems in grid operation are presented. This study characterizes the advantages and technical aspects of Hardware in the Loopi nvestigation with focus on Multi-Physics Power Hardware in the Loop. Furthermore, its use for the certification and testing of wind turbine nacelles with emphasis on test-benchbasedexamination of nacelles is delineated. Examples of interfaces for power-level Hardware in the Loop testing are given. Firstly, a flexible interface solution for the testing of components at household power levels is introduced that has been developed at the Institute ACS. Secondly, the challenges of power-level interfaces for high power test benches are depicted. Moreover, the 1 -MW system-level nacelle test bench is outlined including an exposition of the involved technologies regarding the electrical as well as the mechanical and signal level domain. The test bench setup is compared to other ground-level wind turbine testing installations and the characteristics of the different approaches are evaluated.

40|$|The {{processes}} {{that govern the}} formation, existence and consumption of ions in gases have been studied both experimentally and theoretically. The aim {{of the work is}} targeted at increasing the understanding of these phenomena in the working gases inside an engine. Both the cause and the application of ionized gases inside the cylinder of a spark ignited (SI) engine has been studied. The spark discharge process that eventually leads to a favorable combustion has been studied {{in order to determine the}} total amount of energy that enters the gas. A simplified theoretical model has been developed that includes the most dominant effects. The model includes molecular and atomic processes such as ionization, dissociation and thermal heating together with diffusion of cold gas molecules into the hot spark kernel. The energy input is then calculated from the electrical properties of the ignition system and the gas conditions between the electrodes. Electrode effects have not been included since the energy released close to the electrodes to a major extent is lost. In order to gain even more knowledge about the dynamic spark behavior, a hydrodynamic model for the description of the generated flow patterns emanating from a fast spark discharge was used. In addition, a detailed model for the <b>generation</b> of initial <b>breakdown</b> conditions was also used. The experimental techniques that have been used to support the model have been various, e. g. electrical power measurements, calorimetric measurements and interferometric measurements. The spark, that has been intensively studied, inflames a small region of gas in the vicinity of the electrode gap. This flame kernel will then develop into a propagating flame. While growing, the high gas temperature close to the spark gap reflects the progress of the combustion process. This fact has been used for engine diagnostics by measuring the current flowing through the spark plug gap. The phenomenon has been described in a model for flame ionization in order to deduce the cylinder pressure and the air/fuel ratio in vicinity of spark plug. There are mainly three contributing parameters, which are required for a correct description of the current namely; the ion/electron concentrations, the electric field distribution in space and the drift velocity of the electrons. It has been shown that the current is carried by the electrons to a higher extent than the ions although the electrons are easily attached to electronegative species, such as oxygen (O) and the hydroxyl radical (OH). A detailed chemical kinetic code has been used in order to calculate the concentrations of the most significant species in both the reaction zone and the postflame region. In addition to the theoretical work a large amount of experimental data has been collected for the purpose of model validation and obtaining a deeper understanding. Statistical treatment of the experimental data has also been performed. By this method the influence from some additional parameters such as the amount of EGR and variable fuels have been investigated...|$|R
