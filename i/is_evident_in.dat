5|$|British {{cultural}} {{influence on}} the island <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> its use of English as the main language and the British pound as its primary currency. Additional cultural commonalities include driving on the left, access to the BBC and ITV regions, a school curriculum following that of England, and the popularity of British sports, including football, cricket and rugby.|$|E

The two may have still felt mutual affection, and Isabeau exchanged gifts and letters with {{him during his}} periods of lucidity, but distanced herself during the prolonged attacks of insanity.

5|$|Film critic Ben Zipper {{believes}} that Kiarostami’s {{work as a}} landscape artist <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the composition of distant shots of the dry hills throughout {{a number of his}} films. He points out that Kiarostami’s use of rural locations and remote settings is reminiscent of Sohrab Sepehri’s attention to landscape as represented in his poems such as Golestaneh, in which the poet treats the rural environment realistically and imbues it with a poetic aura.|$|E
5|$|Glarentza {{was founded}} in the mid-13th century by William II of Villehardouin (ruled 1246–78), the ruler of the Principality of Achaea, a Frankish state {{established}} after the Fourth Crusade and encompassing the Peloponnese or Morea peninsula in southern Greece. Its Frankish foundation <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> its name, Clarence or Clairence in French, Chiarenza or Clarenza in Italian, Clarentia or Clarencia in Latin, rendered Κλαρέντσα (Klarentsa), Κλαρίντζα (Klarintza), or Γλαρέντζα (Glarentza) in contemporary Greek documents.|$|E

Nearly 10% of the town's inhabitants in 2010 were born outside Greenland, a decline from 16.5% in 1990 and 11.8% in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The hall has a hammerbeam roof; {{the louvre}} in the centre is now glazed, but was {{originally}} {{the only means}} of escape for smoke rising from a fireplace in the centre of the floor. The wooden panelling was designed by Ninian Comper and was erected in 1911 in place of some previous 19th-century Gothic type, though even earlier panelling, dating from 1710, <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the Buttery.|$|E
5|$|The {{influence}} of Bond in the cinema and in literature <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> films and books {{as diverse as}} the Austin Powers series, Carry On Spying and the Jason Bourne character. In 2011 Fleming became the first English-language writer to have an international airport named after him: Ian Fleming International Airport, near Oracabessa, Jamaica, was officially opened on 12 January 2011 by Jamaican Prime Minister Bruce Golding and Fleming's niece, Lucy.|$|E

5|$|The main {{thrust of}} William Paley's {{argument}} in Natural Theology is that God's {{design of the}} whole creation {{can be seen in}} the general happiness, or well-being, that <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the physical and social order of things. This sets the book within the broad tradition of the Enlightenment's natural theology; and this explains why Paley based much of his thought on John Ray (1691), William Derham (1711) and Bernard Nieuwentyt (1750).|$|E
5|$|The series' {{impact on}} Dalí <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> Soft Construction with Boiled Beans (Premonition of Civil War), painted in 1936 in {{response}} to events leading to the Spanish Civil War. Here, the distorted limbs, brutal suppression, agonised expressions and ominous clouds are reminiscent of , Grande hazaña! Con muertos! (A heroic feat! With dead men!), in which mutilated bodies are shown against a backdrop barren landscape.|$|E

5|$|According to {{writer and}} film {{director}} Jukka Virtanen, Vainio usually wrote his lyrics {{at the same}} time as the music. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the song Vanhojapoikia viiksekkäitä, written as a waltz and whose lyrics feature an aged bachelor who never got to dance at his own wedding. Virtanen has said that while Vainio worked at a fast pace, songs were never easy for him to write. His work did not become easier when he quit drinking, but it did become more emotional.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added as <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), the flowing roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo Shrine), hachiman-zukuri (Usa Shrine) and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to be the more popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period. At {{the end of the}} Heian period torii and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential shinden-zukuri style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as Itsukushima Shrine.|$|E
5|$|Frakes {{believes}} that the main themes of First Contact—and Star Trek as a whole—are loyalty, friendship, honesty and mutual respect. This <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the film when Picard chooses to rescue Data rather than evacuate the ship {{with the rest of}} the crew. The film makes a direct comparison between Picard's hatred of the Borg and refusal to destroy the Enterprise and that of Captain Ahab in Herman Melville's novel Moby-Dick. The moment marks a turning point in the film as Picard changes his mind, symbolized by his putting down his gun. A similar Moby-Dick reference was made in , and although Braga and Moore did not want to repeat it, they decided it worked so well they could not leave it out.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational {{disruption}} {{from the}} outer planets' migration would have sent large numbers of asteroids into the inner Solar System, severely depleting the original belt until it reached today's extremely low mass. This event may have triggered the Late Heavy Bombardment that occurred approximately 4billion years ago, 500–600million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System. This period of heavy bombardment lasted several hundred million years and <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the cratering still visible on geologically dead bodies of the inner Solar System such as the Moon and Mercury. The oldest known evidence for life on Earth dates to 3.8billion years ago—almost immediately {{after the end of the}} Late Heavy Bombardment.|$|E
5|$|Mesopotamian {{influence}} {{continued to}} affect Mari's culture during the Amorite period, which <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> the Babylonian scribal style {{used in the}} city. However, it was less influential than the former periods and a distinct Syrian style prevailed, which is noticeable in the seals of kings, which reflect a clear Syrian origin. The society was a tribal one, it consisted mostly of farmers and nomads (Haneans), and in contrast to Mesopotamia, the temple had a minor role in everyday life as the power was mostly invested in the palace. Women enjoyed a relative equality to men, queen Shibtu ruled in her husband's name while he was away, and had an extensive administrative role and authority over her husband's highest officials.|$|E
5|$|Paul Taylor’s {{review in}} The Independent hails American Idiot as “the Hair of its generation”. Yet, {{as noted by}} Harry Lou in The Indianapolis Business Journal, “ts female {{characters}} are sketched even lighter than the main men are”. Although intended to empower the disillusioned youth of early 21st century America, American Idiot excludes the female voice from this discourse. This disempowering of the female <b>is</b> <b>evident</b> <b>in</b> {{the fact that the}} female leads are denied identity, let alone agency. Just one of the three is given a name, and all represent a stereotypical form of ‘woman’; the mother, the artistic muse, and the object of the voyeuristic male gaze.|$|E
