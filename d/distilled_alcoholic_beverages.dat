Outside India, such a drink would more likely be labelled a rum. According to the Scotch Whisky Association's 2013 annual report, [...] "there is no compulsory definition of whisky in India, and the Indian voluntary standard does not require whisky to be distilled from cereals or to be matured." [...] Ninety percent of the whisky consumed in India is molasses-based, although whisky wholly distilled from malt and other grains, is also manufactured and sold.

50|$|Moonshine is {{a generic}} term for <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> made {{throughout}} the globe from indigenous ingredients reflecting the customs, tastes, {{and raw materials}} for fermentation available in each region. The term commonly applies to small-scale production, which is often illegal or tightly regulated in many countries.|$|E
50|$|In Sudan, all {{domestically}} produced <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> can {{be considered}} moonshine, on account of a general prohibition of alcohol pursuant {{to the demands of}} Islamists for the establishment of Sharia. Nevertheless, production remains widespread, particularly in rural areas of the country, predominantly in the form of araqi, produced from dates.|$|E

50|$|In the {{alcoholic}} beverages industry, congeners are substances, {{other than the}} desired type of alcohol, ethanol, produced during fermentation. These substances include small amounts of chemicals such as methanol and other alcohols (known as fusel alcohols), acetone, acetaldehyde, esters, tannins, and aldehydes (e.g. furfural). Congeners are {{responsible for most of}} the taste and aroma of <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages,</b> and contribute to the taste of non-distilled drinks. It has been suggested that these substances contribute to the symptoms of a hangover. Congeners are also used by forensic toxicologists to determine what a person drank in a sub-discipline called alcohol congener analysis.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative {{analysis of the}} major indicators of both the world and domestic markets of alcoholic beverages. Namely, for the last 21 years, for the observed subperiods, the method of comparative analysis were used to study quantitative and structural differences in the production and trade of analyzed product groups, at both the world and {{at the level of}} continents and some countries. The leading manufacturers and flows of international trade and the leading exporters and importers of wine, beer and <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> were defined, with special emphasis on the importance of Serbia, i. e. its position in the global market for all these products. Pursuant to the above, and importance of analyzed product groups for the domestic market, i. e. agroindustry and the economy as a whole, this paper specially studies balances, structure, dynamics and regional orientation of foreign trade exchange in wine, beer, and <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> In addition, the paper points to the needs, capabilities, measures and directions of further development of domestic production and export of products analyzed...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} whether the non-alcohol content of <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> affects the carcinogenicity of the beverage, we conducted an epidemiologic study of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. We interviewed 384 cases (or spouses, for deceased cases), and compared their responses {{with those of}} 876 controls. We classed distilled liquors as dark or light, a rough division according to content of potentially carcinogenic compounds in the beverages. The relative effect on hypopharyngeal cancer risk was much stronger for those who reported high consumption of dark liquor (relative risk = 4. 4, 90 % confidence interval = 2. 9, 6. 8) than for those reporting comparable consumption of light liquor (relative risk = 1. 3, 90 % CI = 0. 8, 2. 1). For laryngeal cancer, consumption of dark liquor had a smaller effect, and there was little distinction between the effects of dark and light liquor. The data appear consistent with {{the theory that the}} non-alcoholic content of <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> is a determinant of cancer risk, and that alcoholic beverages act topically rather than systemically in their carcinogenic action...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{low-cost}} chemiresistive gas sensor is described, made by {{the deposition}} of a thin film of a conductive polymer, poly(2 -dodecanoylsulfanyl-p-phenylenevinylene), doped with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (10 %, w/w), onto interdigitated electrodes. The sensor exhibits linear electrical conductance changes in function of the concentration of methanol present in sugar-cane spirit in the range between 0. 05 % and 4. 0 %. Since the sensor is cheap, easy to fabricate, durable, presents low power consumption, and is not sensitive to ethanol, acetic acid or water, {{it can be used}} in portable equipments for monitoring methanol levels in <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> such as Brazilian sugar-cane spirit (cachaça) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceLevels of copper, zinc, {{calcium and}} {{magnesium}} were measured in alcoholic beverages (whiskies, gins, rums, liquors, brandies, wines and beers) and by-products (non-alcoholic liquors and vinegars) using the flame {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} technique (FAAS). Mineral concentrations {{were found to be}} significantly different between the nine alcoholic and non alcoholic by-products studied (p < 0. 001). In <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages,</b> concentrations measured in rums and brandies were statistically lower than those determined in gins and alcoholic liquors (p = 0. 001). For Cu, measured concentrations were statistically different for each of the 5 groups of <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> studied (p < 0. 001). In fermented beverages, Zn, Ca and Mg levels were significantly higher than those concentrations determined in distilled drinks (p < 0. 005). Contrarily, Cu concentrations were statistically lower (p < 0. 001). Wines designated as Sherry had significantly higher Ca and Mg levels (p < 0. 005). White wines had significantly higher Ca and Zn levels (p < 0. 05) compared to red wines and contrarily, Cu concentrations were significantly lower (p < 0. 005). In wine samples and corresponding by-products (brandy and vinegar), statistical differences were established for all minerals analysed (p < 0. 01). Remarkably, for Cu, the concentrations determined in brandies were statistically higher. On the basis of element levels and the official data on consumption of alcoholic beverages and by-products in Spain, their contribution to the daily dietary intake (DDI) was calculated to be 123. 5 Μg Cu/day and 204. 5 Μg Zn day- 1, 41. 7 mg Ca day- 1 and 20. 8 mg Mg day- 1. From all studied elements, Cu was the one for which alcoholic beverages constitute a significant source (more than 10 % of recommended daily intake). These findings are of potential use to food composition tables...|$|E

40|$|The {{national}} treatment obligation, {{along with the}} most favored nation obligation, is an important principle of non-discrimination adopted by the World Trade Organization. It requires that foreign products be treated no less favorably than national products. This paper empirically examines the 1996 WTO recommendation that a Japanese distilled alcoholic beverage, shochu, be classed as a "directly competitive or substitutable product" with regard to other distilled drinks, and thus that not taxing similarly be in violation of its {{national treatment}} obligation. Demand estimates obtained from a random-coefficient discrete-choice model reveal that a substitution pattern of shochu is far {{more complicated than that}} presumed by the WTO. Upon the WTO recommendation, Japan made all <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages</b> be taxable at the same level in 2000.

40|$|Abstract: Knowledge of {{physical}} properties and phase equilibria {{is necessary for}} the design and optimization of the equipment for the production of <b>distilled</b> <b>alcoholic</b> <b>beverages.</b> In this paper the temperature dependence of the excess molar volumes of the ternary system ethanol + water + 1 -pentanol in the temperature range 228. 15 – 323. 15 K and atmospheric pressure, are presented, due to the importance of 1 -pentanol among the flavour compounds contained in this type of beverages. The excess molar volumes are negative over the whole homogeneous composition range, but tend to positive values towards the binaries ethanol + 1 -pentanol and water + 1 -pentanol. Because the design of current processes is strongly computer oriented, consideration was also given to how accurate the predictions of the SRK equations of state are. Different derived properties were computed due to their importance in the study of specific molecular interactions...|$|E
