5|$|After {{weeks of}} exchanging taunts and each side {{predicting}} victory for their side, {{the two teams}} faced off at SummerSlam. Jesse Ventura had been appointed as a supposedly impartial guest referee by Jack Tunney. It was strongly hinted leading up the event that Ventura, who provided commentary for many WWF events and was a strong critic of Hulk Hogan but yet was a supporter of Randy Savage <b>even</b> (<b>if</b> <b>only</b> to a somewhat lesser extent) during his face days, had been paid an undisclosed amount by DiBiase.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four {{hydraulic}} systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final emergency system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>only</b> a single engine was active. The majority of hydraulic components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E

5|$|The rule {{evolved from}} the {{principle}} of unanimous consent, which derived from the traditions of decision-making in the Kingdom of Poland, and it developed under the federative character of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Each deputy to a Sejm was elected at a sejmik (the local sejm for a region) and represented the entire region. He thus assumed responsibility to his sejmik for all decisions taken at the Sejm. Since all noblemen were considered equal, a decision taken by a majority against the will of a minority (<b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>only</b> one sejmik) was considered {{a violation of the}} principle of political equality.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on the Ski Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in ski flying also count towards the Ski Jumping World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – the Ski Flying World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely ski flying competitions, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>only</b> one took place. In contrast to the Ski Flying World Championships, the Ski Flying World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to the Ski Jumping World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during the Ski Jumping World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from neither are included as part of the World Cup standings.|$|E
5|$|The Il-40 first flew on 7 March 1953, {{and flight}} tests {{revealed}} no serious shortcomings in the air. The operational CG {{was too far}} aft, but this was only a minor problem when landing, taking off and taxiing, especially when coupled with the rather short wheelbase. The biggest problem {{proved to be the}} guns and their effect on the engines. During the first aerial test of the cannons at the end of March 1953 the muzzle flash temporarily blinded the pilot and both engines flamed out. The pilot was able to restart the engines and returned safely, but Sergey Ilyushin immediately started an investigation into the cause of the engine problems. Ground tests with high-speed cameras revealed that none of the muzzle brakes or blast suppressors tested made any difference; the engines would hiccup <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>only</b> a single gun fired just five to ten rounds.|$|E

25|$|The {{first chapter}} {{of the history of}} neuroimaging traces back to the Italian neuroscientist Angelo Mosso who invented the 'human {{circulation}} balance', which could non-invasively measure the redistribution of blood during emotional and intellectual activity.

25|$|The River Basin Committees (RBC) are {{connected}} organizations that bring together stakeholders {{to discuss and}} decide on their own problems {{with the objective of}} protecting water resources in the river basin region.

25|$|The {{term was}} {{originally}} {{used to refer}} to any person who holds a general power of attorney to represent a principal in all matters. In the common law tradition, anyone who represents the state, especially in criminal prosecutions, is such an attorney.

Section Brunnei contains species which produce spores which can both have a different shape and be more covered in warts.

25|$|Reports {{regarding}} {{the prevalence of}} anal sex among gay men and other {{men who have sex}} with men vary. A survey in The Advocate in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner. Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms. A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>only</b> between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.|$|E
25|$|Another {{institutional}} {{factor that}} may have an important effect is proportionality, i.e., how closely the legislature reflects {{the views of the}} populace. Under a pure proportional representation system the composition of the legislature is fully proportional to the votes of the populace and a voter can be sure that he will be represented in parliament, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>only</b> from the opposition benches. (However many nations that utilise a form of proportional representation in elections depart from pure proportionality by stipulating that smaller parties are not supported by a certain threshold percentage of votes cast will be excluded from parliament.) By contrast, a voting system based on single seat constituencies (such as the plurality system used in North American, the UK and India) will tend to result in many non-competitive electoral districts, in which the outcome is seen by voters as a foregone conclusion.|$|E
