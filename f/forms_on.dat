5|$|Star Wars Headspace is an {{electronic}} music compilation album executively produced by Rick Rubin and Kevin Kusatsu. It compiles electronic dance tracks of acts including Claude VonStroke, Flying Lotus and Röyksopp. It featured sound effects and {{samples from the}} Star Wars films, but does not contain any sample of John Williams' music for the series. Hollywood Records and American Recordings released Star Wars Headspace in digital <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> February 19, 2016 and in physical <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> March 18, to decent commercial performance, beginning at {{number one on the}} United States Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart and becoming the second various artists compilation to top the chart. However, it also garnered a mixed response from music critics, praise going towards its eccentric concept and criticism that it would likely only be enjoyed by fans of the film series.|$|E

5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective oxide layer on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{does not}} react with water, {{but it does}} slowly react with {{atmospheric}} oxygen to form a layer of brown-black copper oxide which, unlike the rust that <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> iron in moist air, protects the underlying metal from further corrosion (passivation). A green layer of verdigris (copper carbonate) can often be seen on old copper structures, such as the roofing of many older buildings and the Statue of Liberty. Copper tarnishes when exposed to some sulfur compounds, with which it reacts to form various copper sulfides.|$|E
30|$|Similar to FF {{three factors}} that are {{constructed}} using the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and B/M equity ratio 4, the FF five factors are constructed on Chinese A-share stock market using the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and book-to-price (Size-B/P portfolios), the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and operating profitability (Size-OP portfolios), and the 6 value-weighted portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and investment (Size-Inv portfolios). The Size-OP portfolios and Size-Inv portfolios are formed {{in the same way}} as the Size-B/M portfolios, except that the second sort variable is operating profitability or investment. At the end of each June, the intersections of two portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size, small (S) and big (B), and three portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> profitability, weak profitability (W), neutral profitability (N), and robust profitability (R), are constructed into six “Size-OP” portfolios: SW, SN, SR, BW, BN, and BR 5. Similarly, the “Size-Inv” portfolios, which are also constructed at the end of each June, are the intersections of two portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> size and three portfolios <b>formed</b> <b>on</b> investment, conservative investment (C), neutral investment (N), and aggressive investment (A).

5|$|Nickel is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. Nickel belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure nickel, powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> the surface and prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native nickel is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The {{measurements}} use highly polished {{spheres of}} silicon {{with a mass}} of one kilogram.

The common view among research scientists is that water would have existed for about 600million years on the surface before evaporating, though some such as David Grinspoon believe that up to 2billion years could also be plausible.|$|E

5|$|To inhibit corrosion, {{at least}} 11% {{chromium}} {{is added to}} steel so that a hard oxide <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> the metal surface; {{this is known as}} stainless steel. Tungsten slows the formation of cementite, keeping carbon in the iron matrix and allowing martensite to preferentially form at slower quench rates, resulting in high speed steel. On the other hand, sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus are considered contaminants that make steel more brittle and are removed from the steel melt during processing.|$|E
5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that <b>forms</b> <b>on</b> the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
