5|$|On February 5, 2009, TNT {{announced}} {{the addition of}} H–O–R–S–E to its All-Star Weekend coverage. The competition was held outdoors on a half-sized court during the special Inside the NBA show prior to the All-Star Saturday Night events. The objective of this competition is to accrue as few of the five letters as possible. A player is given a letter every time they fail to <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> shot of another player. Each player was given 24 seconds to make or <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> shot (dunking was prohibited). Each player who fails to duplicate five shots was eliminated from the competition. An NBA referee was assigned to rule whether the shot was done properly.|$|E

50|$|The {{direct effect}} of this {{optimization}} is to improve time performance(by eliminating call overhead), {{at the cost of}} worsening space usage (due to <b>duplicating</b> <b>the</b> function body).

5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope.

5|$|Lower-class {{citizens}} used common {{forms of}} funerary art—including shabti figurines (to perform any labor {{that might be}} required of the dead person in the afterlife), models of the scarab beetle and funerary texts—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife.

5|$|Recognizing at {{an early}} age that he had an incisive mind for politics, Marcas had allied himself with an unnamed man of some fame who lacked wisdom and insight. They became a team, with the other man serving as the public face and Marcas as the advisor.

Marcas was left poor and unknown, resigned to <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> writing of others for very little pay.|$|E

The character of Milburn was criticized, since no biologist would touch an unidentified, extraterrestrial organism displaying hostility. Spall defended his character, citing a deleted scene where Millburn holds a smaller, docile Hammerpede.|$|E

5|$|Accompanied {{in theaters}} by the Mickey Mouse {{featurette}} The Prince and the Pauper, The Rescuers Down Under (1990) was Disney's first animated feature sequel and the studio's first film {{to be fully}} colored and composited via computer using the CAPS system. However, the film did not <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> success of The Little Mermaid. The next Disney animated feature, Beauty and the Beast, had begun production in London but was moved back to Burbank after Disney decided to shutter the London satellite office and retool the film into a musical-comedy format similar to The Little Mermaid. Alan Menken and Howard Ashman were retained to write the song score, though Ashman died before production was completed.|$|E
5|$|Replacement of the ship's -tall, -wide lower masts in {{wood was}} not feasible, {{so they were}} made of steel tube cut and welded to shape, with a ladder inside each mast to allow access to the {{platforms}} on the masts. The three masts and the bowsprit were stepped in place between September 1984 and February 1985. Warriors engines, boilers and auxiliary machinery were considered too expensive to rebuild, so replicas were built from sheet steel with a few components made from cast iron to <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> look of the real equipment. The replica engines can rotate slowly, using electrical power, to allow visitors to imagine how they might have looked in operation.|$|E
5|$|A kitsune {{may take}} on human form, an ability learned {{when it reaches}} a certain age—usually 100 years, {{although}} some tales say 50. As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a broad leaf, or a skull over its head. Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys. Sometimes young adult males These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or gender, and a kitsune can <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> appearance of a specific person. Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in medieval Japan was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox. Kitsune-gao or fox-faced refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form. Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of The Legend of Boggy Creek, Pierce was {{encouraged}} to film a sequel, but resisted {{because he wanted to}} prove himself as a filmmaker rather than <b>duplicate</b> <b>the</b> same idea. He continued to make inexpensive regional films set in the southern United States, primarily targeting small-town and rural audiences. His family said Pierce liked to be continuously working and would start a new film immediately after finishing the last. His sophomore effort was Bootleggers (1974), a period action-comedy film about rival families making moonshine in the Ozark Mountains. It featured Slim Pickens and the first major performance of Jaclyn Smith, who went on to play Kelly Garrett in the television series Charlie's Angels. Pierce followed that film up with two Westerns released in 1976. The first, Winterhawk, was about violence erupting between Blackfoot Native Americans and white villagers. The film proved difficult for Pierce to shoot due to challenges from the weather and problems with the horses on the set. However, according to Pierce, Winterhawk was more widely seen than The Legend of Boggy Creek. His second Western was Winds of Autumn. Pierce co-wrote both films with his Boggy Creek partner, Earl E. Smith. Pierce made a trademark of casting his friends in his films, and Pierce himself performed minor roles in both Winterhawk and Winds of Autumn. During this period, Pierce continued working as a set decorator for films such as Black Belt Jones (1974).|$|E
5|$|The 1st Armoured Division was {{subsequently}} reformed, {{and became a}} mobile reserve in south eastern England. It was tasked with counter-attacking an invading German army, and the 1st Support Group was given two Canadian infantry battalions for this purpose. In November 1940 Morgan was appointed Brigadier General Staff (BGS) at II Corps, based in Norfolk. Morgan was promoted major-general in 1941 and in late February given command of the Devon and Cornwall County Division, a static formation created for coastal defence, lacking artillery, engineers and divisional troops. In October he assumed command of the 55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division, a first-line TA formation serving as part of Southern Command and later Northern Command. Despite being a first-line formation, the division included {{a large number of}} second-line units, due mainly to the division splitting with its second-line <b>duplicate,</b> <b>the</b> 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division, on a geographical basis. The division was placed on the Lower Establishment in January 1942, losing much of its artillery, engineers and divisional troops and receiving a low priority for modern equipment.|$|E
