40|$|Given a {{recorded}} {{image as a}} continuous or discrete array of measured or computed intensities, display is {{the process by which}} that image is presented to the human viewer as a light image. PACS imposes certain requirements on display {{such as the use of}} digital, electronic display devices, the provision of wide-ranging interactions, and the presentation of multiple images simultaneously so that they can be compared. At the same time the digital displays give one considerable flexibility in specifying the display process, providing options that importantly affect the information transmitted from the recorded image to the observer. Essentially one must match the display process to the needs of the observer and capabilities of the display devices. In this paper the parameters of display will be set forth, relevant properties of the human visual system and of display devices will be surveyed, and display processes to provide the required match will be described. In particular, matters related to the size of the display, the number of display pixels, interpolation, the <b>display</b> <b>scale,</b> and the assignment of recorded intensity levels to the <b>display</b> <b>scale</b> will be covered. 1...|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of mobile and Web technologies, {{there has been an}} increasing number of map-based mushups which display different kinds of POI data in volunteered geographic information. Due to the lack of suitable mechanisms for multi-scale visualization, the display of the POI data often result in the icon clustering problem with icons touching and overlapping each other. This paper introduces a multi-scale visualization method for urban facility POI data by combing the classic methods of generalization and on-line environment. Firstly, we organize the POI data into hierarchical structure by preprocessing in the server-side; the POI features then will be obtained based on the <b>display</b> <b>scale</b> in the client-side and the displacement operation will be executed to resolve the local icon conflicts. Experiments show that this approach can not only achieve the requirements of real-time online, but also can get better multi-scale representation of POI data...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} report the {{direction}} of apparent motion when an array of random dots is displaced fails when the displacement exceeds a limiting value (dmax). We find that dmax increases rapidly with retinal eccentricity, in a manner different from spatial measures such as acuity which are believed {{to depend on the}} "magnification factor" of projection to area 17. The minimum displacement giving detectable motion (dmin) shows a shallower increase with eccentricity which is more compatible with the variation of cortical magnification. The dependence of apparent motion on the timing variables (exposure duration, inter-stimulus interval) changes negligibly with eccentricity. Consequently the dynamic range and the upper limit of detectable velocities increases greatly with eccentricity. The increase of dmax with eccentricity means that the perception of apparent motion will show an approximate invariance with <b>display</b> <b>scale,</b> even though dmax has a locally fixed value depending on receptive field structure...|$|E

40|$|Finding {{a balance}} between data {{redundancy}} and manipulation efficiency can sometimes be problematic when building multi-scale spatial databases (MSDBs). In order to render MSDBs real-timely, coarser representations with fewer vertices should be invoked once the response time exceeds the tolerable limitation. Of course, this would result in faster response speeds. With the vertex histogram {{making it possible to}} simulate the change in the number of vertices queried (NVQ) for the most complex area when the <b>display</b> <b>scale</b> shrinks, a NVQ-based approach is set forward to fix the representations by comparing the NVQ of the most complex area with the tolerable NVQ. This causes the number of levels and definite scales to be determined not only by the dataset itself but also by the generalization method. As a result, the arbitrary appointment of levels or scales when building multi-scale spatial datasets is avoided. It is argued that this approach facilitates the use of fewer representation levels to build a multi-scale database with a reasonable scale-setting scheme. Furthermore, the response time is restricted within the limit set in advance. A case study with a real spatial dataset verifies the effect of the proposed approach. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Neural Network This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} identifying the large-scale topology of gene regulation networks from features that {{can be derived from}} microarray data sets. Understanding large-scale structures of gene regulation is fundamentally important in biology. Three main classes of network models, exponential network, scale-free network, and small-world network, have been used to describe topological features of various naturally occurring systems. Recent analysis of network properties of known biological networks have shown that they <b>display</b> <b>scale</b> free features, {{but it is not clear}} yet whether the scale free features are generic to all biological networks due to the limited availability of information on pathways and connectivity. To overcome these limitations and to expand the knowledge of biological network topology, we propose a novel method for network topology inference from microarray data. The proposed method is more robust than current reverse engineering approaches because it does not require inferring individual connectivity. Preliminary results with simulated data are encouraging. The trained neural network is able to classify networks as random network or scale free network with 90 % accuracy and the mean connectivity can be predicted with around 85 % to 90 % accuracy. Our work shows that the neural network based topology inference method can predict the class of network topology and mean connectivity of network without knowing the underlying connectivity of structures from measured time series data...|$|E
40|$|The {{flow cytometry}} data file {{standard}} provides the specifications needed to completely describe flow cytometry data sets {{within the confines}} of the file containing the experimental data. In 1984, the first Flow Cytometry Standard format for data files was adopted as FCS 1. 0. This standard was modified in 1990 as FCS 2. 0 and again in 1997 as FCS 3. 0. We report here on the next generation flow cytometry standard data file format. FCS 3. 1 is a minor revision based on suggested improvements from the community. The unchanged goal of the standard is to provide a uniform file format that allows files created by one type of acquisition hardware and software to be analyzed by any other type. The FCS 3. 1 standard retains the basic FCS file structure and most features of previous versions of the standard.

Digital Globe’s Quickbird II satellite images were acquired between 2004 and 2006 and georeferenced to within 1. 6 m of their true positions. Reef ecosystem features were digitized directly into a GIS at a <b>display</b> <b>scale</b> of 1 : 4000 using a minimum feature size of 1000 square meters. Benthic features were categorized according to a classification scheme with attributes including zone (location, such as lagoon or forereef, etc.), structure (bottom type, such as sand or patch reef, etc.) and percent hard bottom. Ground validation of habitat features was conducted at 311 sites in 2009. Resulting maps consisted of 1829 features covering 366 square kilometers. Results demonstrate that reef zones occurred in a typical progression of narrow bands from offshore, though forereef, reef flat, shoreline, land, backreef, and lagoon habitats. Lagoon was the largest zone mapped and covered nearly 80 % of the atoll, although {{much of it was}} too deep to have structures identified from the satellite imagery. Dominant habitat structures by area were pavement and aggregate reef, which covered 29 % and 18 % of the mapped structures, respectively. Based on the number of features, individual and aggregated patch reefs comprised over 40 % of the features mapped. Products include GIS based maps, field videos and pictures, satellite imagery, PDF atlas, and this summary report.

40|$|Due to {{the unique}} design of the Parallel Rod Test Object (PRoTO) and the {{associated}} semi-automated analysis program, {{it was necessary to}} test it extensively for precision and accuracy, and preliminarily for utility, before its distribution for wider use in MRI system quality control (QC). The test object and analysis program measured the desired quantities reproducibly and they accurately measured predicted changes from intentionally adjusted imaging system parameters, yielding sensitivity of the various test measures to deviation in the system operating parameters. From a single scan of the most recent revision of the test object, multiple quantitative quality control measures were obtained throughout the scanning volume on two MR imaging systems over periods of six and twelve months, respectively. From these and earlier trials, an initial indication was obtained of which performance measures are worth monitoring for QC. This experience suggests that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and distortion (including <b>display</b> <b>scale)</b> should be monitored but not necessarily the resolution. The latter was only found to alter at the same time or later than other parameters such as SNR had changed. Slice thickness was found to vary on some units and this measure was also used in normalizing the SNR by voxel volume. SNR, distortion, and resolution measurements using field-echo sequences were less stable than those using spin-echo sequences. Use of this QC program to test a wide variety of image quality measures allowed timely assessment of the long-term variability of the units tested. Long-term variability may become among the most important measures for comparison of system performance and maintenance. Results are still inconclusive on the importance of tracking measures from sequences that are potentially most sensitive to small system misadjustments...|$|E
