2500|$|Orwig was the {{athletic}} director at Indiana University from 1961 to 1975. [...] He took over as athletic director in February 1961, ten months into a four-year NCAA probation. [...] On accepting the post, Orwig said: [...] "No strong athletic department has been built on fraud. [...] We'll never have {{a part of that}} as long as I am the director at Indiana University. [...] I know there have been mistakes made here, but I think they've been honest ones. [...] These are mistakes to be corrected." [...] In the 61 years preceding Orwig's arrival, Indiana had won 49 conference championships and seven NCAA championships. [...] During Orwig's 15 years, the Hoosiers won 37 Big Ten championships in seven sports and six NCAA titles including a tie for the Big Ten football title in 1967 and a Rose Bowl appearance. [...] Home football attendance at Indiana averaged 25,854 the year before Orwig arrived, and by 1969 it had more than doubled to 53,319. [...] Orwig also guided the expansion of the school's athletic facilities, including the Assembly Hall basketball facility. [...] Among the coaches hired by Orwig were John Pont in football and Bobby Knight in basketball. [...] Bobby Knight said of Orwig: [...] "Bill Orwig, {{the athletic}} director who hired me, was a man of exceptional intelligence and class who knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with people and work with coaches. He had a great arrogance, in a positive way—he knew he was damned good at what he did. [...] I think more than anybody else in the school's history, Bill Orwig developed Indiana's athletic program into a major league operation—facilities, teams, coaches. [...] Sam Bell was a nationally respected track coach. Doc Counsilman {{was one of the great}} coaches of all time; John Pont took a team to the Rose Bowl; and Jerry Yeagley started the soccer program and built it from nothing into the best one going. [...] The architect of all that, Bill Orwig, is in the college athletic directors hall of fame." [...] He was also one of the founders and the first president from 1969-1970 of the National Athletic Directors of America.|$|E

40|$|Thesis Theme "Bullying at School" has me very {{interested}} in beginning, because it deals with a collective of children and the relationships between its members. As your work I have resolved to study the characteristics of pupils of primary school, that when {{there are signs of}} bullying in your neighborhood side with the victims and try to help. In particular, I wonder what the families of these students come from, what their interests and <b>how</b> able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with adults in your area...|$|R

60|$|George said he {{had often}} longed to take to punting for a change. Punting is {{not as easy as}} it looks.

60|$|But {{it was not}} {{altogether}} an unhappy bondage. There was much to interest him. Something was always happening.

Obedience, rigid, undeviating obedience, was what was exacted of him; and in return he escaped beatings and his existence was tolerated.|$|E

They merely wish you to hand him over to them so they can make him work for them for little or no pay.

60|$|The other negro, Mok, {{could speak}} no more English {{than when we}} first met him, but he could {{understand}} some things which were said to him, and was very quick, indeed, to catch the meanings of signs, motions, and expressions of countenance. At first Edna {{did not know what to}} do with this negro, but Ralph solved the question by taking him as a valet, and day by day he became more useful to the youth, who often declared that he did not know <b>how</b> he used <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> without a valet. Mok was very fond of fine clothes, and Ralph liked to see him smartly dressed, and he frequently appeared of more importance than Cheditafa. He was devoted to his young master, and was so willing to serve him that Ralph often found great difficulty in finding him something to do.|$|R
60|$|I {{know not}} how far Cadmus had gone, nor could he himself have told you, when at no great {{distance}} before him, he beheld a brindled cow. She was lying {{down by the}} wayside, and quietly chewing her cud; nor did she take any notice {{of the young man}} until he had approached pretty nigh. Then, getting leisurely upon her feet, and giving her head a gentle toss, she began to move along at a moderate pace, often pausing just long enough to crop a mouthful of grass. Cadmus loitered behind, whistling idly to himself, and scarcely noticing the cow; until the thought occurred to him, whether this could possibly be the animal which, according to the oracle's response, was to serve him for a guide. But he smiled at himself for fancying such a thing. He could not seriously think that this was the cow, because she went along so quietly, behaving just like any other cow. Evidently she neither knew nor cared so much as a wisp of hay about Cadmus, and was only thinking <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her living <b>along</b> the wayside, where the herbage was green and fresh. Perhaps she was going home to be milked.|$|R

"Wal, Tom {{he was in}} high feather 'cause Miry took him, so that he didn't reelly {{know how}} to behave; and so, as they was walkin' along past Parson Lothrop's apple-orchard, Tom thought he'd try bein' familiar, and he {{undertook}} to put his arm round Miry. Wal, if she didn't jest take that little fellow by his two shoulders and whirl him over the fence into the orchard quicker 'n no time. 'Why,' says Tom, 'the fust I knew I was lyin' on my back under the apple-trees lookin' up at the stars.' Miry she jest walked off home and said nothin' to nobody,--it wa'n't her way to talk much about things; and, if it hedn't ben for Tom Beacon himself, nobody need 'a' known nothin' about it. Tom was a little fellow, you see, and 'mazin' good-natured, and one o' the sort that couldn't keep nothin' to himself; and so he let the cat out o' the bag himself. Wal, there didn't nobody think the worse o' Miry. When fellers find a gal won't take saace from no man, they kind o' respect her; and then fellers allers thinks ef it hed ben them, now, things 'd 'a' been different. That's jest what Jim Moss and Ike Bacon said: they said, why Tom Beacon was a fool not to know better <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with Miry,--they never had no trouble. The fun of it was, that Tom Beacon himself was more crazy after her than he was afore; and they say he made Miry a right up-and-down offer, and Miry she jest wouldn't have him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was true}} that he wanted employment, but then {{he wanted to see}} Stunin'tun too; he doubted whether monkeys would make good sailors; it was no joke to run in among the ice, and it might be still less of one to find our way back again; he had seen the bodies of dead seals and bears that were frozen as hard as stone, and which might, for {{anything}} he knew, have lain in that state a hundred years, and, for his part, he should like to be buried when he was good for nothing else. How did he know these monikins might not catch the men, when they had once fairly got them in their country, and strip them, and make them throw summersets, as the Savoyards had compelled the Doctor, and even the Lady Chatterissa to do?--he knew he should break his neck the very first flap-jack; if he were ten years younger, perhaps he should like the frolic; he did not believe the right sort of craft could be found in England, and for his part, he liked sailing under the stars and stripes; he didn't know but he might go if he had a crew of Stunin'tunners; he always knew <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with such people; he could scare one by threatening to tell his marm how he behaved, and bring another to reason by hinting that the gals would shy him if he wasn't more accommodating; then there might be no such place as Leaphigh, after all; or, if there was, he might never find it; as for wearing a bison-skin under the equator, it was quite out of the question, a human skin being a heavy load to carry in the calm latitudes; and finally that he didn't exactly see what he was to get by it.|$|E
50|$|Smith preempts {{the start}} of the {{interview}} by giving a summary of what he sees as the three inescapable problems that have faced humans from the earliest development of civilization: how to earn a living, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with our fellow humans, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>along</b> with our selves.

With his short, evocative stories - told with simplicity and beauty - he pulls his readers closer to him, as if he were speaking directly to us. For the good fishermen of Tancay, life was better yesterday than it is today. It was better to live in harmony with the sea. When they lived in harmony with the natural world, there was harmony in the human world, too. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 With a nostalgic feel, yet reflecting Peru 2 ̆ 7 s current political instability, this is a delightful book with an important message.

5000|$|Mcleod {{was also}} quizzed {{on what he}} makes of the Robron craze, which began when his {{predecessor}} Kate Oates decided to put the pair together in 2014. Mcleod said: [...] "I {{have never seen anything}} like it, to be honest. It is a phenomenon - the Robron phenomenon. I was aware of it before I came to Emmerdale and you think you understand it. But it's only when you are immersed in it you realise how passionately our audience care about those two characters. They have been through so much and survived it, so the audience are rooting for them and so am I fundamentally. I should also say a quick word on the Robron episode you watched this week. The writer Maxine Alderton, one of our very many talented writers, is a huge Robron fan. She has got Robron dolls and stickers on her laptop, so there was never any doubt about who would write that particular episode as she is a massive superfan.In September 2016, it was announced that former star of The Inbetweeners actress Emily Head had been cast as Rebecca White, the half-sister of Chrissie White (Louise Marwood). Before long Robert is struggling against temptation when Rebecca offers him half of everything at Home Farm and tries to seduce him. Speaking about the scenes, Emily Head revealed: [...] "Years ago there was something between Rebecca and Robert, whilst Chrissie and Robert were together. Not ideal! Chrissie doesn't know that. I think Robert can be very charming and when he knows what he wants, he knows <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it. Rebecca, <b>along</b> with many others, has been drawn into that because he's charismatic. She does know that Robert and Aaron are together, though. She meets them as a couple quite early on and finds it quite difficult. It's difficult finding anyone you've ever had a loving relationship with is in a new loving relationship - and they are. I think Rebecca finds that hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her head around." [...] An episode aired on 16 November 2016, showed Robert and Rebecca share a [...] "shocking" [...] kiss despite Robert being with Aaron. This kiss caused a lot of frenzy from [...] "Robron" [...] fans on Twitter.|$|R
