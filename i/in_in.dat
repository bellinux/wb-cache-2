5|$|Despite {{a series}} of {{commercial}} failures, Grant was now more popular than ever and in high demand. According to Vermilye, in 1939, Grant played roles that were more dramatic, albeit with comical undertones. He played a British army sergeant opposite Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in the George Stevens-directed adventure film Gunga Din, set at a military station in India.

Apart from having his bust placed in the University of the Free State, the Bloemfontein municipal authorities named a street after him.|$|E
5|$|Ermac is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Mortal Kombat fighting game franchise by Midway Games. The character originated due to rumors over a diagnostics menu listing that displayed the text ERMACS, followed by claims of an alleged glitch in the first game. Rumors of the alleged character were perpetuated by video game magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM), and due to the growing interest, he was added by the series developers to the roster of playable characters in Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3, as a red palette swap of Scorpion. Ermac has become a recurring {{character in the}} Mortal Kombat games after playing a central role <b>in</b> , <b>in</b> which he had a distinctive redesign and joined forces with series protagonist Liu Kang, but he has had smaller roles in subsequent series releases.|$|E

5|$|I've {{always been}} drawn to her story. More than anything, drawn to her {{commitment}} to what she believed <b>in.</b> <b>In</b> the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|Ibn al-Ash'ath {{remained}} {{safe under}} the protection of the Zunbīl, but al-Hajjaj, fearing that he might raise another revolt, sent letters to the Zunbīl, mixing threats and promises, to secure his surrender. Finally, in 704 the Zunbīl gave <b>in,</b> <b>in</b> exchange for lifting the annual tribute for 7 or 10 years. Accounts of Ibn al-Ash'ath's end differ: one version holds that he was executed by the Zunbīl himself, or that he died of illness, and that his head was cut off and sent to al-Hajjaj. The more widespread account, however, holds that he was confined to a remote castle at Rukhkhaj in anticipation of his extradition to al-Hajjaj, and chained to his warden, but that he threw himself {{from the top of the}} castle (along with his warden) to his death.|$|E
5|$|Mutations that {{disrupt the}} reading frame {{sequence}} by indels (insertions or deletions) of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases {{are known as}} frameshift mutations. These mutations usually result {{in a completely different}} translation from the original, and likely cause a stop codon to be read, which truncates the protein. These mutations may impair the protein's function and are thus rare <b>in</b> <b>in</b> vivo protein-coding sequences. One reason inheritance of frameshift mutations is rare is that, if the protein being translated is essential for growth under the selective pressures the organism faces, absence of a functional protein may cause death before the organism becomes viable. Frameshift mutations may result in severe genetic diseases such as Tay-Sachs disease.|$|E

5|$|The Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act {{provide for}} a minimum of nine {{opposition}} representatives in Parliament.

5|$|The final {{problem was}} the poor {{financial}} situation that Nicola was <b>in.</b> <b>In</b> {{a letter to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time. During that same month and struggling for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps. Even that, however, failed to give the Invalid Corps its money.|$|E
