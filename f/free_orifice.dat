40|$|An {{experimental}} study was undertaken to investigate low Reynolds number effects on mixing characteristics and turbulent transport phenomena {{in the near}} and intermediate regions of <b>free</b> <b>orifice</b> jets. The cross-sections examined were round, square and ellipse of aspect ratio 3. For each orifice cross-section, detailed velocity measurements were obtained at the following 4 Reynolds number based on the equivalent diameter and maximum velocity: 2500, 4300, 8500 and 17000. A high resolution particle image velocimetry was used to conduct measurements in the symmetry planes that extend from the exit to 15 equivalent diameters. Preliminary results show that an axis-switching happens at 2. 7 equivalent diameters {{in the case of}} ellipse nozzle which leads to a higher spread rate compared to square and round ones. Also increase in Reynolds number decreases the jet widths...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is {{well known}} that the {{transfer}} of heat, mass and momentum to a wall by an impinging jet is partially linked {{to the way in which}} jet generation is realized. The organization of the vortices at the jet exit depends on the upstream conditions and on the geometry of the nozzle. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) and electrodiffusion techniques were used to investigate the characteristics of different impinging jets and the resulting wall shear rates and mass transfer. Two cross-shaped orifice jets, one produced by a plane orifice nozzle (i. e. a cross-shaped orifice made on a flat plate, CO/P) and the second by a hemispherical orifice nozzle (i. e. a cross-shaped orifice made on a hemisphere, CO/H), were compared to a reference round jet produced by a convergent nozzle. The distance between the jet exit and the target wall was equal to two nozzle equivalent diameters (D e), based on the <b>free</b> <b>orifice</b> area. The Reynolds number, based on D e and on the exit bulk-velocity, was 5620 for each flow. PIV measurements give an overall view of the flow characteristics in their free and wall regions. The switching-over phenomena observed in the CO/P nozzle case, and already described in the literature with similar nozzles, did not occur in the jet from the CO/H nozzle. Electrodiffusion measurements showed differences in the shape and level of radial distribution of the wall shear rates and mass transfer. One of the most important observations is the large difference in wall shear stress between the three jets. For the same exit bulk-velocity, the maximum wall shear rate in the CO/P and CO/H nozzle jets was almost two and three times higher, respectively, than that of the reference convergent jet. This higher wall shear rate is accompanied by higher mass transfer rate. It is demonstrated that the cross-shaped orifices enhance the mass transfer not only locally but also globall...|$|E

40|$|Characteristics of free-jet vapor {{expansions}} {{created by}} the pulsed-laser vaporization of some refractory materials are examined. Such expansions were generated from planar surfaces at laser power densities up to 2. 5 MW/sq cm. Time-integrated and time-resolved photography were used {{to show that the}} structure and pressures of such flows are correlated by the same relationship that is valid for <b>free</b> jets from <b>orifice</b> flows. Data show that the vapor velocity becomes sonic at or very near the vaporizing surface. A method is presented for deriving vaporization pressure from flow-field photos; such pressures from carbon-vaporization data for temperatures to 4500 K are in good agreement with extrapolated equilibrium vapor pressures. It is shown that this technique may be a means to determine vapor pressures of refractory materials at high temperatures...|$|R
40|$|Extreme {{rainfall}} events {{associated with}} global warming {{are likely to}} produce {{an increasing number of}} flooding scenarios. A large magnitude of hydrologic events can often result in submerged orifice flow (also called pressure flow) or embankment and bridge overtopping flow, in which the foundation of a bridge is subjected to severe scour at the sediment bed. This phenomenon can cause bridge failure during large floods. However, current laboratory studies have focused on only cases of free-surface flow conditions, and they do not take bridge submergence into account. In this study, abutment scour experiments were carried out in a compound channel to investigate the characteristics of abutment scour in free-surface flow, submerged orifice flow, and overtopping flow cases. Detailed bed contours and three components of velocities and turbulent intensities were measured by acoustic Doppler velocimeters. The results show that the contracted flow around an abutment because of lateral and/or vertical contraction and local turbulent structures at the downstream region of the bridge are the main features of the flow responsible for the maximum scour depth around an abutment. The effects of local turbulent structures on abutment scour are discussed in terms of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles measured {{in a wide range of}} flow contraction ratios. The experimental results showed that maximum abutment scour can be predicted by a suggested single relationship even in different flow types (i. e., <b>free,</b> submerged <b>orifice,</b> and overtopping flow) if the turbulent kinetic energy and discharge under the bridge can be accurately measured.

40|$|Objectives. This study {{sought to}} {{investigate}} the applicability of a current implementation of a three-dimensional echocardiographic reconstruction method for color Doppler flow convergence and regurgitant jet imaging. Background. Evaluation of regurgitant flow events, such as flow convergences or regurgitant jets, using two-dimensional imaging ultrasound color flow Doppler systems may not be robust enough to characterize these spatially complex events. Methods. We studied two in vitro models using steady flow to optimize results. In the first constant-flow model, two different orifices were each mounted to produce flow convergences and <b>free</b> jets—a circular <b>orifice</b> and a rectangular orifice with orifice area of 0. 24 cm^ 2. In another flow model, steady flows through a circular orifice were directed toward a curved surrounding wall to produce wall adherent jets. Video composite data of color Doppler flow images from both free jet and wall jet models were reconstructed and analyzed after computer-controlled 180 ° rotational acquisition using a TomTec computer. Results. For the free jet model there was an excellent relation between actual flow rates and three-dimensional regurgitant jet volumes for both circular and rectangular orifices (r = 0. 99 and r = 0. 98, respectively). However, the rectangular orifice produced larger jet volumes than the circular orifice, even at the same flow rates (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|A {{shock wave}} {{propagating}} in {{air in a}} shock tube was reflected from an orifice plate, and the strength or Mach number of the transmitted wave was measured {{for a range of}} incident shock Mach numbers from 3 to 9 for several types of orifices. Also schlieren photographs of the starting flow pattern were made for some of the orifices investigated. The measured values of transmitted shock strength are compared with predicted values based on a theoretical one-dimensional flow model for both an ideal gas and a real gas. The agreement between the measured values of transmitted wave Mach number and the theoretically predicted values is extremely good in the Mach number range investigated for a wedge type orifice at an ambient shock tube pressure of 5. 0 mm Hg, and also for a conical type orifice at an ambient shock tube pressure of 2. 5 mm Hg. For both orifices the ratio of outlet area to inlet area is 7. 67. The data also indicate that for a wedge type orifice of area ratio of 23. 0 and for a plate (<b>free</b> expansion) type <b>orifice</b> of area ratio 23. 0 possible boundary layer and shock wave interactions downstream of the orifice result in measured values of transmitted wave Mach number somewhat greater than that predicted by the one-dimensional flow model. Investigation of the conical orifice with an area ratio 7. 67 at a low ambient pressure in the shock tube (0. 4 mm Hg) also yields measured values of transmitted wave Mach number greater than that predicted by the one-dimensional flow model, indicating the probable development of a thick boundary layer behind the transmitted wave downstream of the orifice...|$|R

Calculated flow rates by the hemispheric model using one axial measurement of the flow convergence isovelocity surface from two-dimensional color flow images under-estimated actual flow rate by 35 % for the circular orifice and by 44 % for the rectangular orifice, whereas a hemielliptic method implemented using three axial measurements of the flow convergence zone derived using three-dimensional reconstruction correlated well with and underestimated actual flow rate {{to a lesser degree}} (22 % for the circular orifice, 32 % for the rectangular orifice). In the wall jet model, the jets were flattened against and spread along the wall and had reduced regurgitant jet volumes compared with free jets (p < 0. 01). Conclusions. Three-dimensional reconstruction of flow imaged by color Doppler may add quantitative spatial information to aid computation methods that have been used for evaluating valvular regurgitation, especially where they relate to complex geometric flow events...|$|R
