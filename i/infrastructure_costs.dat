40|$|Abstract–The most {{prominent}} problem in providing any-where, anytime wideband mobile access is the towering <b>infrastructure</b> <b>cost</b> {{as it is}} basically proportional to the bandwidth provided. In this paper, we provide a simple, initial, analysis of the various <b>infrastructure</b> <b>cost</b> factors. This analysis shows that, contrary to what one may expect, the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>cost</b> is not dominated by electronic equipment, but rather by other deployment related costs (towers, wiring, building, network connections) and maintenance costs. In the paper some novel architectural approaches for future wideband mobile access focusing on these dominant cost factors are described and the related key research issues are discussed. I...|$|R

25|$|However, {{nuclear power}} is {{relatively}} inflexible; although nuclear power can reduce its output reasonably quickly. Since {{the cost of}} nuclear power is dominated by its high <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs,</b> the cost per unit energy goes up significantly with low production. Because of this, nuclear power is mostly used for baseload. By way of contrast, hydroelectricity can supply peak power at much lower cost. Hydroelectricity is thus often used to complement nuclear or other sources for load following.|$|E
25|$|A related {{approach}} is the solar updraft tower, which heats air in glass enclosures at ground level and sends the heated air up a tower driving turbines at the base. Updraft towers do not pump water, which increases their efficiency, but do require large amounts of land for the collectors. Land acquisition and collector construction costs for updraft towers must be compared to pumping <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> for downdraft collectors. Operationally, maintaining the collector structures for updraft towers must be compared to pumping costs and pump infrastructure maintenance.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Previous {{studies have}} shown that {{multihop}} tech-niques can improve the capacity/coverage of a hybrid cellular system, but the economic gain is still an open question. An <b>infrastructure</b> <b>cost</b> analysis is performed in this paper on two hybrid cellular architectures: one using terminals as relays and one using fixed relays. For the first architecture we show numerical examples in which the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>cost</b> is 20 % to 40 % higher when multihopping is not used. The size of the gain depends on the density of relaying terminals. For the second architecture the cost ratio between deploying a new macro base station and deploying a wireless relay.

This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit, the metallurgy and ore recoverability, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs,</b> finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the {{economics}} of railroading began to change. With {{the advent of the}} internal combustion engine, trains slowly began to lose their advantage as a transportation option. Automobiles and trucks began to increase in popularity as highways improved, siphoning ridership and freight traffic off railroads. The advent of the Interstate Highway System tipped the economic balance by increasing mobility as factories and offices were now able to be located further away from the fixed routes of the railroads. The decline in both passenger and freight traffic occurred at a point when the B, like most other railroads, had just switched over to diesel locomotives, meaning that they had large debts. The pressure from the debts and the large <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> associated with operating a disparate passenger and freight network amongst declining traffic forced the B to cut costs. The most noticeable effect to the general public was the reductions in passenger operation. In the late 1950s the B began to eliminate routes and substituted Multi-Unit diesel-powered passenger cars on many of its routes. The effort did not succeed, as the B was bankrupt by 1976.|$|E
25|$|Based on The ACS-Zachry Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C) {{funding the}} TTC-35 Corridor awarded to ACS-Zachry showed that 22%(1) {{of the initial}} <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> were shown to be funded with equity {{provided}} by ACS-Zachry. The other 78% was to be provided by bank loans or bonds arranged by ACS-Zachry. Based on then-current federal regulations these bonds could have been tax-exempt. It was also noted in the financial plan that ACS-Zachry expected to have 12% return on investment for their equity partners. The 12% return was after taxes, {{which would have been}} approximately equivalent to 16% before taxes. The plan called for paying off the bank loans and the bonds prior to retiring the equity as shown in cash flow diagrams of the Preliminary Financial Plan (TTC-35 Development Agreement, Exhibit C). With usual bond financing there is a 3:1 ratio between total fees collected and value of capital infrastructure built. With TTC-35 the ratio was in the order of magnitude of 13:1. So while TTC-35 committed to construct $8 billion in infrastructure ACS-Zachry expected to collect $114 billion in toll revenues as shown in the preliminary plan. A report by the Texas State Auditor estimated the toll to be collected for TTC-35 to be $104 billion or more, confirming the order of magnitude of tolls collected.|$|E

500|$|The {{energy density}} per unit volume of both liquid {{hydrogen}} and compressed hydrogen gas at any practicable pressure is {{significantly less than}} that of traditional fuel sources, although the energy density per unit fuel mass is higher. Nevertheless, elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy, as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy-wide scale. For example, [...] sequestration followed by carbon capture and storage could be conducted at the point of [...] production from fossil fuels. Hydrogen used in transportation would burn relatively cleanly, with some NOx emissions, but without carbon emissions. However, the <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> associated with full conversion to a hydrogen economy would be substantial.

500|$|The sea holds {{enormous}} {{quantities of}} valuable dissolved minerals. The most important, Salt for table and industrial use has been harvested by solar evaporation from shallow ponds since prehistoric times. Bromine, accumulated after being leached from the land, is economically {{recovered from the}} Dead Sea, where it occurs at 55,000 parts per million (ppm). Other minerals on or within the seabed can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialized shipyards and <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up, and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead, zinc, and trace metals which were only discovered in the 1960s. They form when geothermally superheated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as [...] "black smokers": {{in contact with the}} cold waters of the deep ocean, the minerals precipitate and settle around the vent. The ores are of high quality but currently very costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.|$|E

The first was the breach of the former line by the Edinburgh City Bypass which intersected the trackbed at a shallow angle resulting in more than [...] of the alignment being buried. Two further breaches were reported {{as a result of}} improvements to the A7 road between Eskbank and Gorebridge. A small housing estate had been built on the line in Gorebridge. Even more encroachments were found on the line south of Tweedbank which would take <b>infrastructure</b> <b>costs</b> over £100 million. The Scott Wilson report also indicated that patronage projections for a new line were not encouraging, with none of the route options examined producing a positive cost-benefit value. The option which came closest to a neutral cost-benefit assessment was a reopening only as far as Gorebridge. Nevertheless, Scott Wilson did indicate that the reopening of the line would benefit the Borders region by providing better links with Edinburgh and creating up to 900 new jobs. Wilson also suggested that part of the Border Counties Railway as far as Kielder Forest could be reinstated at a cost of £26 million to allow timber traffic to be carried on {{the southern part of the}} new Borders line. Furthermore, line speeds of 70–90mph could be achieved on a single line, resulting in a journey time from the Borders to Edinburgh of 45 minutes compared to 55 minutes by car.|$|E
