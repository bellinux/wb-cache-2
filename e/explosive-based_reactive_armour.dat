50|$|<b>Reactive</b> <b>armour</b> {{consists}} of small explosive-filled metal boxes that detonate when {{hit by the}} metallic jet projected by an exploding HEAT warhead, causing their metal plates to disrupt it. Tandem warheads defeat <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> by causing the armour to detonate prematurely. Modern <b>Reactive</b> <b>armour</b> protects itself from Tandem warheads by having a thicker front metal plate to prevent the precursor charge from detonating the explosive in the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour.</b> <b>Reactive</b> <b>armours</b> can also reduce the penetrative abilities of kinetic energy penetrators by deforming the penetrator with the metal plates on the <b>Reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> thereby reducing its effectiveness against the main armour of the tank.|$|R
50|$|However, tandem-charges {{are useful}} only against ERA ({{explosive}} <b>reactive</b> <b>armour)</b> types of <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> much less so against the non-explosive <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> (NxRA) types, since their inner liner is not explosive itself and thus not expended {{by the small}} forward warhead of tandem-charge attack.|$|R
50|$|Reactive armor {{is a type}} {{of vehicle}} armor that reacts in some way to the impact of a weapon to reduce the damage done to the vehicle being protected. It is most {{effective}} in protecting against shaped charges and specially hardened kinetic energy penetrators. The most common type is explosive <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> (ERA), but variants include self-limiting explosive <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> (SLERA), non-energetic <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> (NERA), non-explosive <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> (NxRA), and electric <b>reactive</b> <b>armour.</b> NERA and NxRA modules can withstand multiple hits, unlike ERA and SLERA, but a second hit in exactly the same location may potentially penetrate any of those.|$|R

50|$|Tandem {{charges are}} {{effective}} against <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> {{which is designed}} to protect an armoured vehicle (mostly tanks) against anti-tank munitions. The first stage of the weapon is typically a weak charge that either pierces the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> of the target without detonating it leaving a channel through the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> so that the second warhead may pass unimpeded, or simply detonating the armourplate causing the timing of the counter-explosion to fail. The second detonation from the same projectile (which defines it as a tandem charge) attacks the same location as the first detonation where the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> has been compromised. Since the regular armour plating is often the only defence remaining, the main charge (second detonation) has an increased likelihood of penetrating the armour.|$|R

5000|$|Explosive <b>reactive</b> <b>armour,</b> {{initially}} {{developed by}} German researcher Manfred Held {{while working in}} Israel, uses layers of high explosive sandwiched between steel plates. When a shaped-charge warhead hits, the explosive detonates and pushes the steel plates into the warhead, disrupting {{the flow of the}} charge's liquid metal penetrator (usually copper at around 500 degrees Celsius; it can be made to flow like water by sufficient pressure).

50|$|It was {{designed}} in 1988 by the Soviet Union weapons company Bazalt {{and based on}} the RPG-7 but modified to penetrate explosive <b>reactive</b> <b>armour.</b> The small precursor charge {{at the tip of the}} rocket is designed to hit the <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> before the main charge and detonate it. The <b>reactive</b> <b>armour</b> plate should deploy, exploding and disrupting the precursor charge's HEAT jet. As reactive armor is usually single usage only, this renders that particular block of reactive armor useless and unable to protect against the much larger and more powerful main shaped charge. The main shaped charge is a full calibre warhead (filled with 1.43 kg OKFOL), explodes and is supposed to penetrate the target through the weak spot created by the precursor charge.|$|R
