500|$|Another opening {{cinematic}} {{takes place}} in which Riddick is being transported for collection on the bounty. He and Johns have a brief conversation in which Riddick tells Johns {{that there is no}} way he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> price he wants. Riddick wakes up as they land and stands out front of Butcher Bay waiting for the warden. He sneaks up behind Johns and breaks his neck and proceeds to escape. After getting his hands on a gun, he goes through the ventilation ducts and seemingly escapes into the desert. Everything fades to white as Riddick hears Johns saying [...] "Rise and shine, Riddick." [...] It turns out this escape was simply a dream.|$|E
500|$|Although Gervais came up {{with the}} plot of the episode and wrote parts of it on his own, the whole writing team of The Simpsons worked on the script and pitched ideas, as is done with all episodes. Gervais has said in {{interviews}} that he thinks he received too much credit for writing the episode, claiming he merely sent his plot ideas, along with some written scenes, to Jean through email, and it was then the staff of the show that [...] "made it look like a Simpsons script." [...] He commented in a Dazed & Confused article that [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort." [...] One of the scenes that Gervais wrote himself was Charles' love song for Marge, which later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album [...]|$|E
500|$|Andrew Taylor, {{director}} of the animal rights group Animal Aid, called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: [...] "It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event." [...] The RSPCA's equine consultant David Muir stated: [...] "I was gutted that two horses died... What I will do now is go back {{and have a look}} at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, to see if the jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, but the one thing I can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there." [...] Muir did however add: [...] "There's no way I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> National banned." ...|$|E

500|$|From Autumn to Ashes {{formed on}} Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals) — Perri {{provided}} screaming vocals, while Mark sung clean vocals. Commenting {{on the name}} of their band, Scott Gross (guitar) said, [...] "you are absolutely not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band" [...] and that [...] "no one is going to know the reason {{and we are going to}} keep it that way." [...] The term [...] "Autumn" [...] refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created. Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book. For the first few months as a touring band, From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment, a car, and spent between $3,000 and $4,000 making demos and hand distributing them.|$|E
500|$|After {{the success}} of {{previous}} live-action promotional shorts, Landfall and The Life, 343 Industries, the studio in charge of development for the Halo franchise, wanted to use a live action series to appeal {{to an audience of}} people unfamiliar with the Halo games. The director of franchise business management at 343 Industries, Matt McClosky, explained the intended audience by saying that, [...] "You see something that looks like a video game, you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same crowd you always get." [...] The live-action format was also chosen for its ability to better develop characters; the series is used to introduce the character Thomas Lasky to the Halo universe before his role in the video game Halo 4. The developers wanted a protagonist with more emotion than Master Chief (whose face is never seen), to not only convey an understanding of the universe, but to better engage unfamiliar viewers.|$|E
500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] is {{an urban}} and dance-pop song that alludes to Spears {{conflict}} with the paparazzi, which is perceived in lines such as [...] "Mr. Photographer / I think I'm ready for my close-up / Tonight / Make sure you catch me from my good side". Jon Pareles of The New York Times said the song features [...] "amid electronic blips and ominous artificial strings and horns", while Spears [...] "alternately invites photographers closer and fends them off. 'They all wanna see', she warns prospective stars. 'Is life <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best of you?'". [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] features a similar theme to Spears' [...] "Piece of Me" [...] (2007) and was considered its sequel, while Caryn Ganz of Rolling Stone said the song [...] "recalls the synth crush of 2007's Blackout." [...] Music critics criticized the fact that Spears is introduced by Danja as [...] "Our very own Pop princess / Now Queen of Pop", commenting that the honorific nickname [...] "Queen of Pop" [...] is attributed to American recording artist Madonna, while describing her vocals as heavily produced.|$|E

500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and who could get away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's {{not the first time}} this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew {{that this is going to}} happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

2500|$|Ian Beale {{has gone}} on to be the longest running {{character}} in the soap's history and, until the returns of Sharon Watts in August 2012, Kathy Beale in February 2015 and Michelle Fowler in December 2016, was the only remaining original character. Woodyatt confirmed his desire to remain with the show in 2010, during the show's 25th anniversary: [...] "Why would I want to leave when I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> chance to portray even half the range of emotions I get to here in a one-off drama or a six-part series? And you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> same viewing figures either. You have your moments when things go wrong and you perhaps don't want to work with a certain person. In any office {{there are going to be}} people who don't get along but you get on with it and on the whole I enjoy it. Over the last couple of years we've had a really tight crew and it's the best atmosphere I can remember. There have been peaks and troughs, like with any show, but right now things are good." ...|$|E

2500|$|Their first {{project was}} to assess the {{administration}} of voter registration and elections in Montgomery, Alabama. [...] But they immediately ran into resistance. Circuit Judge George C. Wallace, who was elected as governor in support of white supremacy, ordered voter registration records to be impounded. [...] "They are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> records," [...] he said. [...] "And if any agent of the Civil Rights Commission comes down to get them, they will be locked up. ... I repeat, I will jail any Civil Rights Commission agent who attempts to get the records." [...] The hearing went forward with no shortage of evidence. Witness after witness testified to inappropriate interference with his or her right to vote. The Commissioners spent the night at Maxwell Air Base, because all the city's hotels were segregated.|$|E
2500|$|Gervais guest-starred in {{an episode}} of The Simpsons {{entitled}} [...] "Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife". He is the only British comic to write and star in a Simpsons episode. The episode was the highest rated in Sky One's history; it revolved around the angle that Gervais was the episode's sole writer (and the first guest star on the show to also receive a writing credit for the episode of his appearance). Gervais clarified {{the extent of his}} input in a joint interview (with Christopher Guest) for Dazed and Confused magazine (January 2006): [...] "No, all I did was put down a load of observations on an email and they made it look like a Simpsons script. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> credit, but I think everyone in the industry knows it was a joint effort".

2500|$|Dr Sam Coulter-Smith, a {{consultant}} in {{obstetrics and gynaecology}} and a university master in the Rotunda Hospital, {{one of the largest}} maternity hospitals in Ireland, said that it would be preferable to introduce legislation to bring in clarity, saying, [...] "We really do need legislation in this area, otherwise we're going to be at risk of doctors working outside the law, and that's not appropriate." [...] Dr Rhona Mahony, Master of the National Maternity Hospital, said: [...] "It is very disappointing that, 20 years after the 'X-Case', we don't have legislation" [...] and that women [...] "need to know that they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> appropriate health care that they need" [...] while doctors [...] "need to know that they are also protected in their ability to do their job." [...] Peter Boylan, of the Irish Institute of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said: [...] "The current situation is like a sword of Damocles hanging over us. If we do something with a good intention, but {{it turns out to be}} illegal, the consequences are extremely serious for medical practitioners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her {{following}} effort, Klondike Annie (1936) dealt, as best {{it could}} given the heavy censorship, with religion and hypocrisy. Some critics called the film her screen masterpiece, {{but not everyone}} felt the same way. Press baron and would-be film mogul William Randolph Hearst, ostensibly offended by an offhanded remark West made about his mistress, Marion Davies, sent a private memo to all his editors stating, [...] "That Mae West picture 'Klondike Annie' is a filthy picture...We should have editorials roasting that picture, Mae West, and Paramount...DO NOT ACCEPT ANY ADVERTISING OF THIS PICTURE." [...] At one point, Hearst asked aloud, [...] "Isn't it time Congress did something about the Mae West menace?" [...] Paramount executives felt they had to tone down the West characterization, or face further recrimination. This may be surprising by today's standards, as West's films contained no nudity, no profanity, and very little violence. Though raised {{in an era when}} women held second-place roles in society, West portrayed confident women who were not afraid to use their sexual wiles to get what they wanted. [...] "I was the first liberated woman, you know. No guy was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best of me. That's what I wrote all my scripts about." ...|$|E
2500|$|Schedeen awarded Arrows episode an 8.7 out of 10, stating, [...] "This Arrow episode worked {{much better}} as a 100th episode celebration than it did the middle act of the Invasion crossover. The Cisco/Team Arrow subplot did little to advance the larger narrative. On the other hand, the dream prison premise served as an emotionally rich and action-packed way to {{celebrate}} the show's first 100 episodes. But with only one episode left to go in this crossover, the pacing really needs to pick up if fans are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> epic superhero mash-up they deserve." [...] Alasdair Wilkins for The A.V. Club gave Arrow an [...] "A", saying, [...] ""Invasion!" [...] {{could have been an}} unholy mess, balancing the needs of a three-part crossover with the Arrow-specific celebration of the 100-episode milestone. But the decision to focus on the show's past and bring back old favorites like Moira, Deathstroke, Robert, and Moira—Moira is worth listing twice—ends up giving the show a way to develop the power and the threat of the Dominators without this crossover just being three straight episodes of heroes and aliens punching each other. Tonight's episode also once again proves that Arrow doesn't need to be gloomy or choked by petty interpersonal conflict to tell effective stories". Wilkins concluded: [...] "If this is how Arrow marks 100 episodes, then here's to 100 more. If this isn’t the best episode in Arrows history, it's damn close." ...|$|E
