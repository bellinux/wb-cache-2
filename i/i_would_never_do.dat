500|$|Following its release, {{there was}} media {{speculation}} that Spears {{had written a}} song {{as a response to}} [...] "Cry Me a River"; she denied the rumors, explaining, [...] "You know, it's funny. I read that I wrote this song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not my style. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that." [...] Annet Artani, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song [...] "Everytime", stated that the song was written as a response to [...] "Cry Me a River". When asked during an interview with Diane Sawyer on PrimeTime in 2003, if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, Spears responded, [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." ...|$|E
500|$|Craig has {{described}} {{his portrayal of}} Bond as an anti-hero: [...] "The question I keep asking myself while playing the role is, 'Am I the good guy or just a bad guy {{who works for the}} good side?' Bond's role, after all, is that of an assassin when you come down to it. I have never played a role in which someone's dark side shouldn't be explored. I don't think it should be confusing {{by the end of the}} film, but during the film you should be questioning who he is." [...] Craig has stated that his own favourite previous Bond actor is Sean Connery, but says, [...] "I'd never copy somebody else. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> an impression of anybody else or try and improve on what they did. That would be a pointless exercise for me." [...] His own favourite Bond film is From Russia with Love. On an episode of The South Bank Show, Connery divulged his thoughts on Craig's casting as Bond, whom he described as [...] "fantastic, marvellous in the part". When told that Craig had taken particular note of his performances, Connery said that he was [...] "flattered" [...] and that Craig really gets the [...] "danger element" [...] to Bond's character. Craig has remarked that Bond is [...] "...actually a misogynist... A lot of women are drawn to him chiefly because he embodies a certain kind of danger and never sticks around for too long." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{was very}} hard on me because I was outed and I {{think you have to}} do it in your own time. Fifty percent of gay people know who they are by the age of 13, I was in the other 50%. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have married Larry if I'd known. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done</b> that to him. I was totally in love with Larry when I was 21.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the end of}} shooting, Schenck {{announced}} the dissolution of Buster Keaton Productions. Keaton shot the risky stunt, not caring if he lived or died, later saying [...] "I was mad at the time, or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done</b> the thing." [...] The mark on the ground telling Keaton exactly where to stand to avoid being crushed was a nail. Keaton later said that filming the shot {{was one of his}} greatest thrills.|$|R
2500|$|The {{film was}} not storyboarded and was made without a shot list. The camp fire scene was {{originally}} a short, three-page scene that Phoenix re-wrote into an eight-page scene where Mike professes {{his love for}} Scott {{so that it was}} more apparent that his character was gay whereas Van Sant had originally made it more ambiguous. Reeves reportedly was not comfortable with this aspect of the film as he said in an interview, [...] "I'm not against gays or anything, but I won't have sex with guys. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that on film. We did a little of it in Idaho and, believe me, it was hard work. Never again".|$|E
2500|$|Though {{he started}} writing his lyrics during his lower league days in Japan, {{it was not}} until 2006 that he {{released}} his first commercial single [...] "Accepterais-tu", a French song with lyrics that fit well with his present personal status—asking his loved one to marry him. On February 19, 2007, Villeneuve released his first album entitled Private Paradise. The launch was held at his café where he performed two songs in front of a crowd largely composed of news reporters. When asked about his expectations on the album he released the following statement: [...] "I hope the album makes a great success. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> something hoping to get criticized." [...] His new record had very low sales; as of March 9, 2007, only 233 copies were sold in the entire province of Quebec and about 30 outside of Quebec and Canada– excluding digital sales.|$|E
2500|$|Allen {{campaign}} officials referred {{reporters to}} Dan Cragg, a former acquaintance of Webb's. Cragg said that Webb told him in 1963 that Webb {{and members of}} his ROTC unit at the University of Southern California would [...] "hop into their cars, and would go down to Watts", taking fake rifles, and yell out epithets, [...] "point the rifles at them , pull the triggers and then drive off laughing." [...] Cragg had recorded the interview in which he claimed the anecdote was related, but it is absent from the tape. Spokeswoman Kristian Denny Todd quoted Webb as saying: [...] "In 1963, you couldn't go to Watts and {{do that kind of}} thing. You'd get killed. So of course I didn't do it. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that. I would never want to do that." [...] Webb also produced a friend from the time who claimed that the two had never driven to Watts as claimed.|$|E

It was a foolish {{thing for me to}} have drawn the revolver, but I was in liquor or <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>never</b> <b>done</b> it. <b>I</b> could not control the event. I went there purely on a matter of business and my business was very simple and very plain. The result was as it was. I am prepared to die.|$|R
5000|$|Hwang Hyun-chang, a {{commercial}} photographer, {{was inspired to}} create a girl group after seeing T-ara's [...] "Roly Poly" [...] on television. Before that, he had never paid attention to pop idols and only listened to classical music. After an initial investment of 10 million won, he converted his photography studio, Chrome Creative, into Chrome Entertainment. To finance this venture, Hwang sold his camera gear, used up all his savings, and went into debt. He later said, [...] "If I had known how much it <b>would</b> cost, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>done</b> it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Martha Wright {{replaced}} Martin in {{the role}} of Maria on Broadway in October 1961, followed by Karen Gantz in July 1962, Jeannie Carson in August 1962 and Nancy Dussault in September 1962. Jon Voight, who eventually married co-star Lauri Peters, was a replacement for Rolf. The national tour starred Florence Henderson as Maria and Beatrice Krebs as Mother Abbess. It opened at the Grand Riviera Theater, Detroit, on February 27, 1961, and closed November 23, 1963, at the O'Keefe Centre, Toronto. Henderson was succeeded by Barbara Meister in June 1962. Theodore Bikel was not satisfied playing the role of the Captain, because of the role's limited singing, [...] and Bikel did not like to play the same role over and over again. In his autobiography, he writes: [...] "I promised myself then that if I could afford it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> a run as long as that again." [...] The original Broadway cast album sold three million copies.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, Comăneci {{is highly}} {{involved}} in fundraising {{for a number}} of charities. She personally funded the construction and operation of the Nadia Comăneci Children's Clinic in Bucharest that provides low-cost and free medical and social support to Romanian children. In 2003, the Romanian government appointed her as an honorary consul general of Romania to the United States to deal with bilateral relations between the two nations. In addition, both Comăneci and Conner are involved with The Special Olympics. One of the public methods Comăneci used to raise funds for the Special Olympics in 2008 was to participate in [...] Donald Trump's reality show, [...] Prior to the airing of the season, Trump announced {{that it was going to}} be the [...] "nastiest version that we've done" [...] and [...] "a very vicious show" [...] because of the unusual combination of celebrities who were each competing to raise money for a favorite charity. Comăneci was a member of [...] "The Empresario" [...] team (all women), which lost to [...] "The Hydra" [...] team (all men) in the second episode. Trump responded to this loss by firing Comăneci, thus preventing her from raising money for the Special Olympics. [...] Comăneci later commented on her participation in the show, stating, [...] " [...] had great fun. I only did it because it was all for charity. If I had to do that to apply for a job with Donald Trump, no, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that." ...|$|E

5000|$|Chicago {{strives to}} push herself, {{exploring}} {{new directions for}} her art; she even attended car-body school to learn to air-brush and has recently begun to work in glass. Taking such risks is easier to do when one lives by Chicago's philosophy: [...] "I'm not career driven. Damien Hirst's dots sold, so he made thousands of dots. <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> like, <b>never</b> <b>do</b> that! It wouldn't even occur to me." [...] Chicago's subject matter, however, has broadened from the focus of The Dinner Party.

6000|$|I {{come now}} to the day prior to Gilray's return. I had just reached the office when I remembered about the chrysanthemum. It was my last chance. If I watered it once I {{should be in a}} {{position}} to state that, whatever condition it might be in, I had certainly been watering it. I jumped into a hansom, told the cabby to drive to the inn, and twenty minutes afterward had one hand on Gilray's door, while the other held the largest water-can in the house. Opening the door I rushed in. The can nearly fell from my hand. There was no flower-pot! I rang the bell. [...] "Mr. Gilray's chrysanthemum!" [...] I cried. What do you think William John said? He coolly told me that the plant was dead, and had been flung out days ago. I went to the theatre that night to keep myself from thinking. All next day I contrived to remain out of Gilray's sight. When we met he was stiff and polite. He did not say a word about the chrysanthemum for a week, and then it all came out with a rush. I let him talk. With the servants flinging out the flower-pots faster than I could water them, what more could I have done? A coolness between us was inevitable. This I regretted, but my mind was made up on one point: <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> Gilray a favor again.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O, I {{should like}} to be good and to do right,' Janet burst forth; 'but indeed, indeed, my lot {{has been a very}} hard one. I loved my husband very dearly when we were married, and I meant to make him happy--I wanted nothing else. But he began to be angry with me for little things and ... I don't want to accuse him ... but he drank and got more and more unkind to me, and then very cruel, and he beat me. And that cut me to the heart. It made me almost mad {{sometimes}} to think all our love had come to that ... I couldn't bear up against it. I had never been used to drink anything but water. I hated wine and spirits because Robert drank them so; but one day when I was very wretched, and the wine was standing on the table, I suddenly ... I can hardly remember how I came to do it ... I poured some wine into a large glass and drank it. It blunted my feelings. and made me more indifferent. After that, the temptation was always coming, and it got stronger and stronger. I was ashamed, and I hated what I did; but almost while the thought was passing through my mind that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>do</b> it again, I did it. It seemed as if there was a demon in me always making me rush to do what I longed not to do. And I thought all the more that God was cruel; for if He had not sent me that dreadful trial, so much worse than other women have to bear, I should not have done wrong in that way. I suppose it is wicked to think so ... I feel as if there must be goodness and right above us, but I can't see it, I can't trust in it. And I have gone on in that way for years and years. At one time it used to be better now and then, but everything has got worse lately. I felt sure it must soon end somehow. And last night he turned me out of doors ... I don't know what to do. I will never go back to that life again if I can help it; and yet everything else seems so miserable. I feel sure that demon will always be urging me to satisfy the craving that comes upon me, and the days will go on as they have done through all those miserable years. I shall always be doing wrong, and hating myself after--sinking lower and lower, and knowing that I am sinking. O can you tell me any way of getting strength? Have you ever known any one like me that got peace of mind and power to do right? Can you give me any comfort--any hope?' ...|$|E
