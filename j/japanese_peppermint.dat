50|$|Mint {{essential}} oil and menthol are extensively used as flavorings in breath fresheners, drinks, antiseptic mouth rinses, toothpaste, chewing gum, desserts, and candies, such as mint (candy) and mint chocolate. The substances {{that give the}} mints their characteristic aromas and flavors are menthol (the main aroma of peppermint and <b>Japanese</b> <b>peppermint)</b> and pulegone (in pennyroyal and Corsican mint). The compound primarily responsible for the aroma and flavor of spearmint is L-carvone.|$|E
40|$|Essential oil {{components}} of 20 Indian peppermint accessions were analyzed through GC and GC/MS and com-pared with the reported components found in oil samples of different countries (22 locations of 19 countries) {{to check the}} commercial potential of the germplasm collection. The comparative oil component analyses revealed the close relation of P 4 and P 5 (Indian collections) with Chinese and P 9 to <b>Japanese</b> <b>peppermint.</b> Some of the analyzed samples (P 6, P 8, P 11 and P 17) were close to American, Canadian, European and South African oils. Essential oilprofiles of Indian accessions P 10, P 14, P 19 and P 20 were quite different from others as revealed by component plot analysis. In addition to the similarities, distinct chemotypes in the germplasm were detected with unique essential oil component profiles, which have been discussed in details in this investigation. Further, Amplified fragment lengthpolymorphism (AFLP) analysis of these 20 Indian accessions differentiated them genetically with a diversity ranging between 17 - 95 %...|$|E
