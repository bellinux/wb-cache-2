500|$|As Betty Francis (January Jones) packs for {{a family}} ski vacation, Sally {{complains}} that she would rather spend the weekend with Don and Megan (Jessica Paré). An angry Betty calls Don to say she is dropping Sally off at his apartment. To Megan's surprise, Sally {{shows up at the}} apartment and informs her that she will be staying for the weekend. Megan later complains to Don for not telling her about Sally's visit. Don confides that he had to <b>fire</b> <b>Lane</b> for embezzlement. Lane arrives home drunk to find that Rebecca has surprised him with a new Jaguar. She tells him her reasoning — he never spends on himself. He vomits, but, the next morning, reassures Rebecca (Embeth Davidtz) that he likes the car. Lane attempts to commit suicide {{in the middle of the}} night using the new car's exhaust, but, in an ironic confirmation of Cooper's earlier retort of Jaguars that [...] "They don't start!", the car fails to start. He then walks into SCDP's empty office and types a letter at his desk.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{preferable}} for a <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> {{to have access}} at both ends to a road. If that is not possible and a <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> must {{be made into a}} dead end, a <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> turnaround is put in. It must be large enough for a fire truck to turn around to head out the same way it came in. They can be made as a large circle, or {{in the shape of a}} Y, T or a sideways T. They must be marked with either paint striping, signs, or the use of both. Striping consists of a six-inch red stripe painted on the curb with four-inch white letters indicating that this is a <b>fire</b> <b>lane.</b> [...] "No Parking, Fire Lane" [...] is to be printed every 25 feet along the <b>fire</b> <b>lane.</b>|$|E

50|$|Fire lanes may be any width {{larger than}} 20 feet across. This gives {{enough room to}} {{maneuver}} the truck into position. They must also be at least ten feet away from any building or structure overhang to allow overhead clearance. If trees are near a <b>fire</b> <b>lane,</b> they must be trimmed to allow a 14-foot clearance over the <b>fire</b> <b>lane.</b> The <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> must be within 150 feet of {{the ends of the}} buildings that it serves.If a <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> goes around a curve or corner, it must have an outside turning radius of 54 feet, and an inside turning radius of 30 feet. These numbers can be a little different depending on the jurisdiction, but are usually roughly the same. The fire lanes must also be approved to carry at least 35 tons of weight.|$|E

5000|$|All fire lanes must {{be marked}} as such, {{although}} {{the manner of}} marking may be different. If the lane is 20 feet across, it must be marked {{on both sides with}} red paint on the curb. If the <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> is between 20 and 24 feet, it may only be marked {{on one side of the}} roadway. If the access road is greater than 28 feet wide, no markings need to be present.Fire lanes in front of commercial buildings may have yellow paint to mark the <b>fire</b> <b>lane.</b> The curb should be painted yellow with the words [...] "No Parking, Fire Lane" [...] painted in black. On the pavement, yellow lines should be painted the width of the <b>fire</b> <b>lane,</b> with the words 12 inches tall and painted in yellow.|$|E
25|$|Switch: A switch is an {{area that}} is blocked off after the ball passes through it once. An example of this is the initial firing lane: as a ball passes through the <b>firing</b> <b>lane,</b> it hits a switch and cannot reenter that chute.|$|R
2500|$|A {{key element}} of {{intermediate}} and advanced strategy {{is the concept of}} [...] "firing lanes". These are clear lines of sight between obstacles on the field and thus potentially between opposing players on the field behind them. A lane is [...] "occupied" [...] if at least one player of the opposing team can fire along it, and it's [...] "active" [...] if any player is firing along it, friend or foe. Occupied and active lanes hinder player movement as the player risks getting hit and eliminated. Open fields with sparse cover often have long open lanes between most or all bunkers on the field, most of which will be occupied if not active. Therefore, players have to keep track of which lanes to and from their bunker become occupied by the other team, so the player can make sure the bunker is between himself and the opponent(s). This becomes harder the more occupied <b>firing</b> <b>lanes</b> there are; when most available <b>firing</b> <b>lanes</b> on the field are occupied, each team has to create cover in at least one direction using suppressing fire (rounds sent to the opponent's location designed to keep their head down more than to eliminate them). Speedball, which tends to use small open fields with relatively few obstacles, requires each player to use hundreds of paintballs {{in the course of a}} game to keep his opponents pinned down, lest he be pinned himself. Conversely, if most <b>firing</b> <b>lanes</b> on the field are clear, players on each team have greater mobility and the use of covering fire to pin an opponent is less useful as the player can stay behind cover while moving long distances, so players tend to fire less and move more to gain clear shots. Urban scenarios and woodsball fields tend to be larger and with more cover, shortening <b>firing</b> <b>lanes</b> and requiring players to move more to get good shots against their opponent.|$|R

Asclepias curtissii is usually found with other plants including Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides), Chapman oak (Quercus chapmanii), myrtle oak (Q. myrtifolia), and sand live oak (Q. geminata), amongst other plants. Curtiss's milkweed has a very high tolerance for soil disturbance, often being found {{along the edges of}} <b>fire</b> <b>lanes</b> and sand roads.|$|R

5000|$|In a {{unanimous}} decision {{on behalf of}} Franks, the court affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded in part, for further judicial ruling (Section 5, para. 2). The court said that Lane’s speech was protected under the first amendment. However, [...] "previous precedent, specifically Morris v. Crow, had held that public employee testimony was unprotected speech, and thus when Franks <b>fired</b> <b>Lane,</b> he was not violating a clearly established constitutional right" (Para. 4).|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} reports of {{violence}} occurring between shoppers on Black Friday. Since 2006, there have been 7 reported deaths and 98 injuries throughout the United States. It is common for prospective shoppers to camp out over the Thanksgiving holiday {{in an effort to}} secure a place in front of the line and thus a better chance at getting desired items. This poses a significant safety risk, {{such as the use of}} propane and generators in the most elaborate cases, and in general, the blocking of emergency access and <b>fire</b> <b>lanes,</b> causing at least one city to ban the practice.|$|R

5000|$|In {{urban areas}} in the United States, a <b>fire</b> <b>lane</b> is a marked lane {{in a parking lot}} that is near a {{structure}} or, in New York City, a traffic lane marked [...] "Fire Lane" [...] that runs along the centre of a street. Parking is prohibited in fire lanes to ensure the access of safety equipment to the structure {{in the event of an}} emergency.Fire lanes are defined as passageways or access roads that allow fire apparatuses to pass through. They are not intended for normal vehicle traffic. There are certain requirements that must be met when designing a <b>fire</b> <b>lane.</b> Because fire trucks and other apparatuses are so large, there must be certain accommodations made for them. Though these can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they are generally similar. Fire Lanes also provide clear space for egress from a burning building and should therefore be wider for larger occupancy buildings.|$|E

50|$|There are a {{total of}} 32 <b>firing</b> <b>lanes</b> and targets can be set as far as 75 ft from the shooter. For safety, each lane is {{separated}} from the adjacent lanes by bullet-resistant glass. The range's backstop can handle most calibers of rifle and handgun; anything that produces less than 8100 pound/feet of force. Each lane has an advanced system that controls that lane's respective target, increasing safety. This system is also more time efficient because it removes the need to walk down range to check or change targets. The range utilizes 180 air filters to keep the air fresh and clean by moving gasses away from shooters immediately.|$|R
