25|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1949 (as {{unveiled}} {{and demonstrated}} in October at the Motor Cycle Show at Earls Court, London) an optional mechanical reversing device became available which comprised a long lever with a ratchet and a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>socket</b> on the end which fitted onto {{the centre of the}} driver's side rear wheel hub. This device could then be operated from the driving seat and allowed the car to be cranked backwards by hand to assist with maneuvering.|$|E
50|$|Rotary {{broaching}} {{is another}} common operation. The broach holder is mounted stationary while its internal live spindle and end cutting broach tool {{are driven by}} the workpiece. As the broach is fed into or around the workpiece, the broach's contact points are constantly changing, easily creating the desired form. The most common form made this way is a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>socket</b> {{in the end of}} a cap screw.|$|E

5000|$|A hex key, Allen key or Allen wrench {{is a tool}} used {{to drive}} bolts and screws with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>sockets</b> in their heads.|$|R
50|$|Head {{designs that}} overlap both are the Allen or Torx heads; <b>hexagonal</b> or splined <b>sockets.</b> These modern designs span a large range of sizes and {{can carry a}} {{considerable}} torque.|$|R
40|$|Addition of PTFE {{pressure}} pad increases utility of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>socket</b> wrench. Pad presses against opposing inside socket walls, causing frictional force that retains socket-head screw against gravitational and handling forces. Developed for spacecraft repairs, tool is useful wherever tight clearance prevents insertion or removal of screw by hand...|$|E
