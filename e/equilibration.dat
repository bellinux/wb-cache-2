5|$|The Horner–Wadsworth–Emmons {{reaction}} favours {{the formation}} of (E)-alkenes. In general, the more <b>equilibration</b> amongst intermediates, the higher the selectivity for (E)-alkene formation.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before <b>equilibration</b> as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|The trans diastereoselectivity {{observed}} {{results from}} the reversibility of the initial addition, allowing <b>equilibration</b> to the favored anti betaine over the syn betaine. Initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges; density functional theory calculations {{have shown that the}} rate-limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the conformer necessary for backside attack on the sulfonium.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of the Saegusa–Ito oxidation involves coordination of palladium to the enol olefin followed by loss of the silyl group and formation of an oxoallyl-palladium complex. β-hydride elimination yields the palladium hydride enone complex which upon reductive elimination yields the product along with acetic acid and Pd0. The reversibility of the elimination step allows <b>equilibration,</b> leading to the thermodynamic E-selectivity in acyclic substrates. It {{has been shown that}} the product can form a stable Pd0-olefin complex, which may be responsible for the difficulty with re-oxidation seen in catalytic variants of the reaction.|$|E
25|$|Woodworking: when wood {{is used as}} a {{construction}} material, whether as a structural support in a building or in woodworking objects, it will absorb or desorb moisture until it is in equilibrium with its surroundings. <b>Equilibration</b> (usually drying) causes unequal shrinkage in the wood, and can cause damage to the wood if <b>equilibration</b> occurs too rapidly. The <b>equilibration</b> must be controlled to prevent damage to the wood.|$|E
25|$|With these {{electrode}} designs, the voltmeter is detecting {{potential differences}} of ±1400 millivolts. The electrodes are further designed to rapidly equilibrate with test solutions to facilitate ease of use. The <b>equilibration</b> times are typically {{less than one}} second, although <b>equilibration</b> times increase as the electrodes age.|$|E

25|$|There are a {{total of}} four phases in Piaget's {{research}} program that included books on certain topics of developmental psychology. In particular, during one period of research, he described himself studying his own three children, and carefully observing and interpreting their cognitive development. In one of his last books, <b>Equilibration</b> of Cognitive Structures: The Central Problem of Intellectual Development, he intends to explain knowledge development as a process of <b>equilibration</b> using two main concepts in his theory, assimilation and accommodation, as belonging not only to biological interactions but also to cognitive ones.|$|E
25|$|Polystyrene resins – These allow {{cross linkage}} which {{increases}} {{the stability of the}} chain. Higher cross linkage reduces swerving, {{which increases the}} <b>equilibration</b> time and ultimately improves selectivity.|$|E
25|$|CHARMM also {{includes}} polarizable force fields using two approaches. One {{is based on}} the fluctuating charge (FQ) model, also termed Charge <b>Equilibration</b> (CHEQ). The other {{is based on the}} Drude shell or dispersion oscillator model.|$|E
25|$|Left to <b>equilibration,</b> many {{compositions}} {{will form}} a uniform single phase, but {{depending on the}} temperature and pressure even a single substance may separate into two or more distinct phases. Within each phase, the properties are uniform but between the two phases properties differ.|$|E
25|$|In general, kinetic enolates are {{favored by}} cold temperatures, {{conditions}} that give relatively ionic metal–oxygen bonding, and rapid deprotonation using a slight excess of a strong, sterically hindered base. The large base only deprotonates the more accessible hydrogen, {{and the low}} temperatures and excess base help avoid <b>equilibration</b> to the more stable alternate enolate after initial enolate formation. Thermodynamic enolates are favored by longer <b>equilibration</b> times at higher temperatures, conditions that give relatively covalent metal–oxygen bonding, and use of a slight sub-stoichiometric amount of strong base. By using insufficient base to deprotonate all of the carbonyl molecules, the enolates and carbonyls can exchange protons {{with each other and}} equilibrate to their more stable isomer. Using various metals and solvents can provide control over the amount of ionic character in the metal–oxygen bond.|$|E
25|$|In static methods {{a mixture}} {{is brought to}} {{equilibrium}} and the concentration of a species in the solution phase is determined by chemical analysis. This usually requires separation of the solid and solution phases. In order to do this the <b>equilibration</b> and separation should be performed in a thermostatted room. Very low concentrations can be measured if a radioactive tracer is incorporated in the solid phase.|$|E
25|$|Borate ions (commonly {{supplied}} as boric acid) {{are used}} in biochemical and chemical laboratories to make buffers, e.g. for gel electrophoresis of DNA and RNA, such as TBE buffer (borate buffered tris-hydroxymethylaminomethonium) or the newer SB buffer or BBS buffer (borate buffered saline) in coating procedures. Borate buffers (usually at pH 8) are also used as preferential <b>equilibration</b> solution in dimethyl pimelimidate (DMP) based crosslinking reactions.|$|E
25|$|Under certain conditions, the {{equilibrium}} solubility can be exceeded {{to give a}} so-called supersaturated solution, which is metastable. Metastability of crystals {{can also lead to}} apparent differences in the amount of a chemical that dissolves depending on its crystalline form or particle size. A supersaturated solution generally crystallises when 'seed' crystals are introduced and rapid <b>equilibration</b> occurs. Phenylsalicylate is one such simple observable substance when fully melted and then cooled below its fusion point.|$|E
25|$|For example, in a {{multiple}} addition of ethyl bromide to benzene, ortho and para substitution is expected {{after the first}} monosubstitution step because an alkyl group is an activating group. However, the actual reaction product is 1,3,5-triethylbenzene with all alkyl groups as a meta substituent. Thermodynamic reaction control makes sure that thermodynamically favored meta substitution with steric hindrance minimized takes prevalence over less favorable ortho and para substitution by chemical <b>equilibration.</b> The ultimate reaction product is thus {{the result of a}} series of alkylations and dealkylations.|$|E
25|$|The air {{contained}} within the alveoli has a semi-permanent volume of about 2.5-3.0liters which completely surrounds the alveolar capillary blood (Fig.12). This ensures that <b>equilibration</b> of the partial pressures of the gases in the two compartments is very efficient and occurs very quickly. The blood leaving the alveolar capillaries and is eventually distributed throughout the body therefore has a partial pressure of oxygen of 13-14kPa (100mmHg), and a partial pressure of carbon dioxide of 5.3kPa (40mmHg) (i.e. {{the same as the}} oxygen and carbon dioxide gas tensions as in the alveoli). As mentioned in the section above, the corresponding partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the ambient (dry) air at sea level are 21kPa (160mmHg) and 0.04kPa (0.3mmHg) respectively.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is commonly {{carried out in}} a volume of 10–200μl in small reaction tubes (0.2–0.5ml volumes) in a thermal cycler. The thermal cycler heats and cools the reaction tubes to achieve the temperatures required at {{each step of the}} reaction (see below). Many modern thermal cyclers make use of the Peltier effect, which permits both heating and cooling of the block holding the PCR tubes simply by reversing the electric current. Thin-walled reaction tubes permit favorable thermal conductivity to allow for rapid thermal <b>equilibration.</b> Most thermal cyclers have heated lids to prevent condensation {{at the top of the}} reaction tube. Older thermal cyclers lacking a heated lid require a layer of oil on top of the reaction mixture or a ball of wax inside the tube.|$|E
25|$|Expanded-bed {{adsorption}} (EBA) chromatography is {{a convenient}} and effective technique for {{the capture of}} proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of <b>equilibration</b> buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends {{on the characteristics of}} the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.|$|E
500|$|The {{thermodynamic}} <b>equilibration</b> temperatures, {{corresponding to}} the chemical composition of the discharged gases, ranged from this {{is a measure of}} the temperature at which the gases equilibrated within the volcano. The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano in the space above the magma, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.|$|E
500|$|Drawing on the {{substituent}} effects compiled over various {{trials of}} the reaction, Professor Alison Frontier of the University of Rochester developed a paradigm for [...] "polarized" [...] Nazarov cyclizations in which electron donating and electron withdrawing groups are used to improve the overall selectivity of the reaction. Creation of an effective vinyl nucleophile and vinyl electrophile in the substrate allows catalytic activation with copper triflate and regioselective elimination. In addition, [...] the electron withdrawing group increases the acidity of the α-proton, allowing selective formation of the trans-α-epimer via <b>equilibration.</b>|$|E
500|$|In November 1985, {{volcanic}} activity once again increased as magma neared the surface. The volcano began releasing increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elementary sulfur. The water {{content of the}} fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs {{in the vicinity of}} Nevado del Ruiz became enriched in magnesium, calcium and potassium, which were leached from the magma. [...] The thermodynamic <b>equilibration</b> (stationary heat energy) temperatures, corresponding to the chemical composition of the discharged gases, were from [...] to [...] The extensive degassing of the magma caused pressure to build up inside the volcano, which eventually resulted in the explosive eruption.|$|E

2500|$|Advantages of the {{perforated}} patch method, {{relative to}} whole-cell recordings, include {{the properties of}} the antibiotic pores, that allow <b>equilibration</b> only of small monovalent ions between the patch pipette and the cytosol, but not of larger molecules that cannot permeate through the pores.

2500|$|This {{linkage disequilibrium}} in Europeans {{explains}} why A1, A2, A3, [...] "A7", and [...] "A8" [...] were identified, first.

2500|$|Mechanistic {{studies have}} focused on {{unstabilized}} ylides, because the intermediates can be followed by NMR spectroscopy. The existence and interconversion of the betaine (3a and 3b) is [...] subject of ongoing research. Phosphonium ylides 1 react with carbonyl compounds 2 via a π²s/π²a [...] cycloaddition to directly form the oxaphosphetanes 4a and 4b. The stereochemistry of the product 5 is due to the addition of the ylide 1 to the carbonyl 2 and to the <b>equilibration</b> of the intermediates.P, 1H, and 13C NMR Spectroscopy. Insight into Kinetic vs. Thermodynamic Control of Stereochemistry", J. Am. Chem. Soc., 107, 1068–1070 (1985) Maryanoff and Reitz identified the issue about <b>equilibration</b> of Wittig intermediates and termed the process [...] "stereochemical drift". For many years, the stereochemistry of the Wittig reaction, in terms of carbon-carbon bond formation, had been assumed to correspond directly with the Z/E stereochemistry of the alkene products. However, certain reactants do not follow this simple pattern. Lithium salts can also exert a profound effect on the stereochemical outcome.|$|E
2500|$|The pH meter is {{calibrated}} with solutions {{of known}} pH, typically before each use, to ensure accuracy of measurement. [...] To measure the pH of a solution, the electrodes {{are used as}} probes, which are dipped into the test solutions and held there sufficiently long for the hydrogen ions in the test solution to equilibrate with the ions {{on the surface of}} the bulb on the glass electrode.

2500|$|The {{simulation}} of annealing as {{an approach that}} reduces a minimization of a function of large number of variables to the statistical mechanics of <b>equilibration</b> (annealing) of the mathematically equivalent artificial multiatomic system [...] was first formulated by Armen G. Khachaturyan, Svetlana V. Semenovskaya, Boris K. Vainshtein in 1979 and by Armen G. Khachaturyan, Svetlana V. Semenovskaya, Boris K. Vainshtein in 1981. These authors used computer simulation mimicking annealing and cooling of such a system to find its [...] global minimum.|$|E
2500|$|Bicarbonate is an {{intermediate}} in {{the transport of}} CO2 out of the body by respiratory gas exchange. The hydration reaction of CO2 is generally very slow {{in the absence of}} a catalyst, but red blood cells contain carbonic anhydrase, which increases the reaction rate, producing bicarbonate (HCO3−) dissolved in the blood plasma. This catalysed reaction is reversed in the lungs, where it converts the bicarbonate back into CO2 and allows it to be expelled. [...] This <b>equilibration</b> plays an important role as a buffer in mammalian blood. A 2016 theoretical report suggests that carbonic acid may play a pivotal role in protonating various nitrogen bases in blood serum.|$|E
2500|$|Piaget defined {{knowledge}} {{as the ability}} to modify, transform, and [...] "operate on" [...] an object or idea, such that it is understood by the operator through the process of transformation. Learning, then, occurs as a result of experience, both physical and logical, with the objects themselves and how they are acted upon. Thus, knowledge must be assimilated in an active process by a learner with matured mental capacity, so that knowledge can build in complexity by scaffolded understanding. Understanding is scaffolded by the learner through the process of <b>equilibration,</b> whereby the learner balances new knowledge with previous understanding, thereby compensating for [...] "transformation" [...] of knowledge.|$|E
2500|$|Barotrauma {{can affect}} the external, middle, or inner ear. [...] Middle ear {{barotrauma}} (MEBT) {{is the most common}} being experienced by between 10% and 30% of divers and is due to insufficient <b>equilibration</b> of the middle ear. [...] External ear barotrauma may occur on ascent if high pressure air is trapped in the external auditory canal either by tight fitting diving equipment or ear wax. [...] Inner ear barotrauma (IEBT), though much less common than MEBT, shares a similar mechanism. [...] Mechanical trauma to the inner ear can lead to varying degrees of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss as well as vertigo. It is also common for conditions affecting the inner ear to result in auditory hypersensitivity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the {{respiratory}} system is the <b>equilibration</b> of the partial pressures of the respiratory gases in the alveolar air with those in the [...] pulmonary capillary blood (Fig. 11). This process occurs by simple diffusion, across a very thin membrane (known as the blood–air barrier), which forms the walls of the pulmonary alveoli (Fig.10). It consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the alveolar capillaries (Fig.10). This blood gas barrier is extremely thin (in humans, on average, 2.2μm thick). It is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) branching off from the respiratory bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (approximately 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
2500|$|These {{time and}} length-scales {{can be used}} to {{understand}} the dependence of the conduction velocity on the diameter of the neuron in unmyelinated fibers. For example, the time-scale τ increases with both the membrane resistance rm and capacitance cm. [...] As the capacitance increases, more charge must be transferred to produce a given transmembrane voltage (by the equation Q=CV); as the resistance increases, less charge is transferred per unit time, making the <b>equilibration</b> slower. [...] In similar manner, if the internal resistance per unit length ri is lower in one axon than in another (e.g., because the radius of the former is larger), the spatial decay length λ becomes longer and the conduction velocity of an action potential should increase. If the transmembrane resistance rm is increased, that lowers the average [...] "leakage" [...] current across the membrane, likewise causing λ to become longer, increasing the conduction velocity.|$|E
2500|$|Both Sraffa and Wittgenstein {{influenced}} {{each other}} deeply. [...] They continually corresponded and discussed {{each other in}} their journals and notebooks. [...] Both authors were dealing with a form of positivism dominant in their respective disciplines, economics and philosophy. [...] While Wittgenstein made his famous turn from the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus to the Philosophical Investigations wherein he jettisoned the previous idea that the world comprised an atomistic set of propositional facts for the notion that meaning derives from its use within a holistic self-enclosed system. [...] Analogously, Sraffa was rebutting the Neoclassical paradigm which was similarly atomistic, individualistic and derivational (see Criticisms of neoclassical economics). [...] While there are disputes about how to interpret Sraffa—falling primarily into the neo-classical camp of Paul Samuelson and the Neo-Ricardian of Pierangelo Garegnani—none dispute Sraffa's influence [...] and {{it can be argued that}} Sraffa's critique of neo-classical economics is analogous to that of Wittgenstein's of philosophy, in that Sraffa sought to replace the individualistic and positivistic account of price as the result of an <b>equilibration</b> of supply and demand, for instead as price serving a social function, namely to reproduce a stationary or expanding economy given a distribution of income.|$|E
2500|$|In the 60s and 70s {{a simple}} creationist model {{proposed}} that, [...] "The Flood split the land mass {{into the present}} continents." [...] Steve Austin and other creationists proposed a preliminary model of catastrophic plate tectonics (CPT) in 1994. Their work built on earlier papers by John Baumgardner and Russell Humphreys in 1986. Baumgardner proposed a model of mantel convection that allows for runaway subduction and Humphrey associated mantle convection with rapid magnetic reversals in earth history. Baumgardner's proposal holds that the rapid plunge of former oceanic plates into the mantle (caused by an unknown trigger-mechanism) increased local mantle pressures {{to the point that}} its viscosity dropped several magnitudes according to known properties of mantle silicates. [...] Once initiated, sinking plates caused the spread of low viscosity throughout the mantle resulting in runaway mantle-convection and catastrophic tectonic motion which dragged continents {{across the surface of the}} earth. Once the former ocean plates, which are thought to be denser than the mantle, reached the bottom of the mantle an equilibrium resulted. [...] Pressures dropped, viscosity increased, runaway mantle-convection stopped, leaving the surface of the earth rearranged. [...] Proponents point to subducted slabs in the mantle which are still relatively cool, which they regard as evidence that they have not been there for millions of years which would result in temperature <b>equilibration.</b>|$|E
