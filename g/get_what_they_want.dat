It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that. Part of it was because of our own tenacity, and part of it was because we were lucky.|$|E

Lamounier declared he was not surprised that things turned out {{the way they did}} as, in his words, [...] "with what I knew of them, I think it's quite normal that one brother should betray another in that family, they don't measure the consequences to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want.</b> So, a brother backstabbing the other, deceiving their mother, cheating a friend...

500|$|A socialist {{from his}} {{undergraduate}} days, Childe was an atheist and critic of religion, viewing it as a false consciousness based in superstition. In History (1947) he commented that [...] "Magic {{is a way}} of making people believe they are going to <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> whereas religion is a system for persuading them that they ought to want what they get." [...] Archaeologist Colin Renfrew noted that Childe was liberal minded on social issues, but thought that although Childe deplored racism, he did not entirely escape the pervasive 19th century view on distinct differences between different races.|$|E

J.D. breaks the moment asking her who was the best singer in her head, much {{to the rest of}} the staff's (and especially Dr. Cox's) dismay. J.D. reflects in voiceover that in musicals everyone <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> but in reality, after having made a choice we may miss the way things were; as Elliot realizes she misses her roommate, Carla realizes she wishes she spent more time with her daughter, and Ms. Miller realizes she misses the music in her head.|$|E
500|$|Singapore has a one person, {{one vote}} system: plural voting– that is, voting {{more than once}} in the electoral {{division}} that one is assigned to, or voting in more than one electoral division– is illegal. Following a relative swing in votes against the ruling People's Action Party government in the general election of 1984, the Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew raised the possibility of modifications to the one person, one vote system and said: [...] "It is necessary to try and put some safeguards into the way in which people use their votes to bargain, coerce, to push, to jostle and <b>get</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> without running the risk of losing the services of the government, because one day, by mistake, they will lose the services of the government." [...] Subsequently, in an interview to the US magazine Foreign Affairs in January 1994, Lee, now Senior Minister, suggested that a person between the ages of 40 and 60 with a family should be given two votes because [...] "he is likely to be more careful, voting also for his children. He is more likely to vote in a serious way than a capricious young man under 30. But we haven't found it necessary yet. If it became necessary, we should do it. ... I'm not intellectually convinced that one-man, one-vote is the best. We practise it because that's what the British bequeathed us and we haven't really found a need to challenge that."
