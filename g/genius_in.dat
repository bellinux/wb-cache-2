5|$|Memories of {{more than}} a score of years of devoted service enhance the sense of {{personal}} loss which Miss LeHand's passing brings. Faithful and painstaking, with charm of manner inspired by tact and kindness of heart, she was utterly selfless in her devotion to duty. Hers was a quiet efficiency, which made her a real <b>genius</b> <b>in</b> getting things done. Her memory will ever be held in affectionate remembrance and appreciation, not only by all the members of our family but by the wide circle of those whose duties brought them into contact with her.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} {{video game}} developed by id Software {{and published by}} Softdisk in 1991 for DOS. It is the fourth episode of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child <b>genius,</b> <b>in</b> an adventure in his dreams as he journeys through a vegetable kingdom to defeat the evil potato king Boobus Tuber and free enslaved children from the Dream machine. The game features Keen running and jumping through various levels while opposed by various vegetable enemies; unlike the prior three episodes, Keen does not use a pogo stick to jump higher, and throws flower power pellets to temporarily turn enemies into flowers rather than shooting a raygun to kill them.|$|E

5|$|Daggoth was the {{commander-in-chief}} {{of the entire}} zerg swarm war-machine. As the highest ranking cerebrate, Daggoth was a tactical <b>genius</b> <b>in</b> command of the Tiamat Brood, {{the largest and most}} powerful brood in the Zerg Swarm. Voiced by Micky Neilson, Daggoth is the most strong-willed and ferocious of the cerebrates. It trains the player character in the Zerg campaign of StarCraft and dispenses forces to protect Kerrigan following her transformation. Daggoth was charged with protecting the Overmind itself. In the wake of the Overmind's death, Daggoth immediately takes command of the fractured Zerg broods, annihilated several renegade zerg broods, and ordered several cerebrates to merge to form a new Overmind.|$|E

5|$|Matt Damon is an American actor, {{producer}} and screenwriter. He made his screen debut {{at the age}} of 18 with a minor role in the 1988 film Mystic Pizza. After appearing in a series of supporting parts in much of the 1990s, Damon was cast by Francis Ford Coppola as the lead of the 1997 legal drama The Rainmaker. His breakthrough came later that year when he played the title role of an unrecognized <b>genius</b> <b>in</b> Good Will Hunting, a drama which he also co-wrote with Ben Affleck. Damon and Affleck won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Damon was nominated for Best Actor. He followed it by playing the title roles of a soldier in Steven Spielberg's war drama Saving Private Ryan (1998) and of the criminal Tom Ripley in the thriller The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999), both of which gained critical and commercial success. Damon's profile continued to expand in the 2000s, as he took on starring roles in two lucrative film franchises. He featured as a con man in Steven Soderbergh's Ocean's Trilogy (2001–07) and played the titular spy Jason Bourne in four of the five films in the Bourne series (2002–16).|$|E

25|$|A {{significant}} part of his book is {{about the nature of}} genius.

25|$|Iraqi {{artists have}} {{consistently}} {{been at the}} forefront of new and innovative works of creative <b>genius</b> <b>in</b> the Middle East.

However, during the past 40 years, the art of Iraq and the voices of the artists has certainly paralleled the tumultuous political and social history of the country, creating an inextricable union that has been displayed in all forms of art.|$|E

50|$|We {{know for}} certain that the nuns of the ancient convent of San Gregorio Armeno were {{considered}} to be <b>geniuses</b> <b>in</b> the complex preparation of the Pastiera. They used to prepare a great quantity for the rich families during Easter time.|$|R
25|$|This {{complex concept}} is {{reflected}} in Martianus Capella's division of heaven, found in Book I of his De Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae, which places the Di Consentes Penates in region I with the Favores Opertanei; Ceres and <b>Genius</b> <b>in</b> region V; Pales in region VI; Favor and Genius (again) in region VII; Secundanus Pales, Fortuna and Favor Pastor in region XI. The disposition of these divine entities and their repetition in different locations {{may be due to}} the fact that Penates belonging to different categories (of Jupiter in region I, earthly or of mortal men in region V) are intended. Favor(es) may be the Etruscan masculine equivalent of Fortuna.|$|E

25|$|Galton was {{interested}} at {{first in the}} question of whether human ability was hereditary, and proposed to count the number of the relatives of various degrees of eminent men. If the qualities were hereditary, he reasoned, there should be more eminent men among the relatives than among the general population. To test this, he invented the methods of historiometry. Galton obtained extensive data from a broad range of biographical sources which he tabulated and compared in various ways. This pioneering work was described in detail in his book Hereditary <b>Genius</b> <b>in</b> 1869. Here he showed, among other things, that the numbers of eminent relatives dropped off when going from the first degree to the second degree relatives, and from the second degree to the third. He took this as evidence of the inheritance of abilities.|$|E
