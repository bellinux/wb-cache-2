40|$|Abstract. By using a dipole-layer {{model for}} the {{scattering}} of electrons at a metal surface in a laser field, we show that, at relatively moderate laser intensities of some 1010 W cm− 2 of a Nd:YAG laser, photo-electrons of very high nonlinear order are generated having energies of up to about 500 eV. Similarly, we predict harmonics of very high order under the same parameter conditions. The high-order electron-energy spectrum agrees very well with recent observations by Farkas et al (Phys. Rev. A 41 4123 (1990); Opt. Eng. 32 2476 (1993)).
