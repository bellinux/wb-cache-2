25|$|For a {{long time}} it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Eichendorff's view of Romanticism <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{subordinate}} to religious beliefs. More recently, however, Christoph Hollender has pointed that Eichendorff's late religious and political writings were commissioned works, while his poetry represents a highly personal perspective.|$|R
60|$|I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> {{the size}} and {{manageability}} of all political states is finally a matter of transport and communications. They grow to a limit strictly determined by these considerations. Beyond that limit they are unstable. Let us now apply these ideas to the British Empire.|$|R

5|$|In practice, the MSE is a {{blend of}} empathic {{descriptive}} phenomenology and empirical clinical observation. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the term phenomenology has become corrupted in clinical psychiatry: current usage, as a set of supposedly objective descriptions of a psychiatric patient (a synonym for signs and symptoms), is incompatible with the original meaning which was concerned with comprehending a patient's subjective experience.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this rests on the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|The Roman era of Switzerland is {{traditionally}} held to have ended in 401AD, when Stilicho withdrew all {{troops from the}} Rhine and the Danube. However, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the withdrawal was only temporary and partial, and that Roman control of these rivers was reestablished in 411–413 {{with the assistance of}} tribes moving south from Germania.|$|E

50|$|For years Anderson <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> {{by their}} nature large {{databases}} {{will never be}} free of abuse by breaches of security. He has said that if a large system is designed for ease of access it becomes insecure; if made watertight it becomes impossible to use. This is sometimes known as Anderson's Rule.|$|R
5|$|After Adolf Hitler came {{to power}} in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have {{proposed}} to France a preventive war against Germany. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany. Lack of French interest may have been a reason why Poland signed the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934. Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Arabic {{astronomer}} and polymath Ibn al-Haytham (Alhacen) presented a development of Ptolemy's geocentric epicyclic models in terms of nested spheres. Despite the similarity of this concept to that of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, al-Haytham's presentation differs in sufficient detail that it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> it reflects an independent development of the concept. In chapters 15–16 of his Book of Optics, Ibn al-Haytham also said that the celestial spheres do not consist of solid matter.|$|E
5|$|Hill forts {{developed}} in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age, roughly {{the start of the}} first millenniumBC. The reason for their emergence in Britain, and their purpose, has been a subject of debate. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> they could have been military sites constructed in response to invasion from continental Europe, sites built by invaders, or a military reaction to social tensions caused by an increasing population and consequent pressure on agriculture.|$|E
40|$|While Scholtes (1999) has {{proposed}} interdependence and interaction as a fifth element to Deming’s (1994) system of profound knowledge (SPK) {{because of the}} importance of these notions by themselves, this author <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>arguing</b> <b>that</b> public policy should be added as another element (a sixth one) in because policy either directly or indirectly shape...|$|R

5|$|Likely of Balkan origin, Basiliscus was {{the brother}} of Aelia Verina, wife of Leo I. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Basiliscus was uncle to the {{chieftain}} of the Heruli, Odoacer. This link {{is based on the}} interpretation of a fragment by John of Antioch (209.1), which states that Odoacer and Armatus, Basiliscus' nephew, were brothers. However, not all scholars accept this interpretation, since sources do not say anything about the foreign origin of Basiliscus. It is known that Basiliscus had a wife, Zenonis, and at least one son, Marcus.|$|E
5|$|Other {{commentators}} {{have suggested that}} the manner of St Edmund's death, veneration and culthood define him as a sacral king. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> St Edmund's story was informed by common Celtic and Germanic notions of sacred kingship. Comparable kings who also embodied theories of divinely-ordained rule, rightful sovereignty and the binding links between king, land and society, include: Conaire Mór, Cormac mac Cuilennáin, King Dómaldi and Halfdan the Black.|$|E
5|$|While it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the damage}} {{attributed}} to this storm {{may have been}} caused by an earthquake following the Thera Eruption, it has also been suggested that it was caused during a war with the Hyksos, and the storm reference is merely a metaphor for chaos upon which the Pharaoh was attempting to impose order. Documents such as Hatshepsut's Speos Artemidos depict storms, but are clearly figurative not literal. Research indicates that the Speos Artemidos stele is a reference to her overcoming the powers of chaos and darkness.|$|E
50|$|At the Supreme Court, it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> {{the fifth}} point was flawed {{and that there}} was a purpose to {{requiring}} evidence of any other EAWs, even if withdrawn, in that they could constitute the basis of, or be relevant to, a decision by the executing court to set side (or consider whether to set aisde) the subsisting EAW as an abuse of process.|$|R

5|$|A weary emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, discontent among ruling circles who were dismissive of the Imperial role in {{national}} affairs: all seemed to presage the monarchy's impending doom. Nevertheless, Pedro II was unconcerned that times and conditions were changing. After more than five decades on the throne, he had become complacent in a belief that the devotion and support of his subjects was immutable. Because of these factors, and the lack of an energetic response on the part of Pedro II, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> prime responsibility for the monarchy's overthrow rested with the Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|As the {{disaster}} in New Orleans intensified, critics charged that Bush was misrepresenting his administration's role {{in what they}} saw as a flawed response. Leaders attacked Bush for having appointed apparently incompetent leaders to positions of power at FEMA, notably Michael D. Brown; it was also argued that the federal response was limited {{as a result of the}} Iraq War and Bush himself did not act upon warnings of floods. Bush responded to mounting criticism by accepting full responsibility for the federal government's failures in its handling of the emergency. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> with Katrina, Bush passed a political tipping point from which he would not recover.|$|E

40|$|So, {{after months}} and months of refusing to even discuss about doing the obvious, the ECB has now signalled that they will do a debt swap with Greece – this weekend.

The cause of this hazard are numerous, two of them are here reflected. incertitude, financial prevision, risk...|$|R
5|$|Changing clocks and DST rules has {{a direct}} {{economic}} cost, entailing extra work to support remote meetings, computer applications and the like. For example, a 2007 North American rule change cost an estimated $500million to $1billion, and Utah State University economist William F. Shughart II has estimated the lost opportunity cost at around $1.7 billion USD. Although it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> clock shifts correlate with decreased economic efficiency, and that in 2000 the daylight-saving effect implied an estimated one-day loss of $31billion on U.S. stock exchanges, the estimated numbers depend on the methodology. The results have been disputed, and the original authors have refuted the points raised by disputers.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal bands {{exist in}} most of the subgenres of heavy metal music, and the only common link among most Christian metal bands are the lyrics. The Christian themes are often melded with the {{subjects}} of the genre the band is rooted in, regularly providing a Christian take on the subject matter. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> the marginal yet transnational Christian metal subculture provides its core members an alternative religious expression and Christian identity, and that the music serves the purpose of offering a positive message through lyrical content. This may not necessarily show a direct connection or reference to the Christian faith but often it does.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} no {{contemporary}} Byzantine account of the Tabuk expedition, {{and many of the}} details come from much later Muslim sources. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>argued</b> <b>that</b> there is in one Byzantine source possibly referencing the Battle of Mu´tah traditionally dated 629, but this is not certain. The first engagements may have started as conflicts with the Arab client states of the Byzantine and Sassanid empires: the Ghassanids and the Lakhmids of Al-Hirah. In any case, Muslim Arabs after 634 certainly pursued a full-blown invasion of both empires, resulting in the conquest of the Levant, Egypt and Persia for Islam. The most successful generals were Khalid ibn al-Walid and 'Amr ibn al-'As.|$|E
