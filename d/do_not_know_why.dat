25|$|The {{giant panda}} has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The {{rest of the}} animal's coat is white. Although {{scientists}} <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> these unusual bears are black and white, speculation suggests that the bold coloring provides effective camouflage in their shade-dappled snowy and rocky habitat. The giant panda's thick, wooly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat. The panda's skull shape is typical of durophagous carnivorans. It has evolved from previous ancestors to exhibit larger molars with increased complexity and expanded temporal fossa. A 110.45kg (243.5lb) giant panda has a 3D canine teeth bite force of 2603.47 newtons and bite force quotient of 292. Another study had a 117.5kg (259lb) giant panda bite of 1298.9 newtons (BFQ 151.4) at canine teeth and 1815.9 newtons (BFQ 141.8) at carnassial teeth.|$|E
500|$|... "House of the Rising Sun" [...] is {{the sixth}} {{episode of the}} first season of the American {{television}} series Lost. It centers on Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who brutally attacks Michael Dawson (Harold Perrineau); the survivors <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> since Jin and his wife Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim) only speak Korean. Meanwhile, Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) proposes that the survivors move to the caves from the beach. The episode {{was the first to}} feature the backstory of Sun and Jin, and the former is shown in the episode's flashbacks. It was directed by Michael Zinberg and written by Javier Grillo-Marxuach.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen and we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to}} the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E

500|$|Scientists <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> {{the fungus}} mysteriously lives only in Texas and Japan, {{locations}} of {{approximately the same}} latitude, but separated by [...] Fred Jay Seaver commented [...] "this is only another illustration of the unusual and unpredictable distribution of many species of the fungi. It would be difficult indeed to account for it, and we merely accept the facts as they are." [...] In 2004, a research study compared the DNA sequences of both populations and used a combination of molecular phylogenetics and molecular clock calculations to estimate the extent of genetic divergence. It concluded that the two populations have been separated for at least nineteen million years, ruling {{out the possibility of}} human introduction of the species from one location to the other. Although there are no consistent differences in morphology between the two populations, there are several differences in their life histories. The preferred host of Texan populations is typically roots and stumps of Ulmus crassifolia, while the Japanese populations tend to grow on the fallen trunks of Symplocos myrtacea and Quercus gilva. Texan species grow in areas subjected to periodic flooding, unlike their Japanese counterparts. Finally, only Japanese specimens can be grown in culture—the spores of Texan material have not been successfully germinated on artificial media.|$|E
500|$|On 15 March 1899 Bruce {{wrote to}} Sir Clements Markham at the RGS, {{offering}} {{himself for the}} scientific staff of the National Antarctic Expedition, then in its early planning stages. Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce heard nothing for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E
500|$|... "Fermín" [...] {{describes}} a mentally ill character in an institution. The song changes {{a line from}} the French folk song, [...] "Marlbrough s'en va-t-en guerre", from [...] "Mambrú se fue a la guerra, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Mambrú left for the war; I do not know when he will return") to [...] "Fermín se fue a la vida, no sé cuándo vendrá" [...] ("Fermín left for life; I do not know when he will return"). According to Spinetta, [...] "life for the insane is like war for the sane." [...] Reflecting on the track, Spinetta said: [...] "In front of my house lived an incredible character called Carlitos, a retarded boy, who is in part the personification of Fermín for me. With Carlitos we shared moments of joy when we were kids. Although he could not play ball with everyone, he felt accompanied in his tremendous problem when we were with him. It is also an apology, because I remember that his mother punished him a lot, even {{in front of the other}} boys. I do not know if the degree of illness of the song's Fermín is as actue as that of Carlitos, but serves to define the situation of the alienated as a propitious cell to receive the most aberrant injustices. [...] "Plegaria para un niño dormido" [...] urges not to wake a poor child up, letting him be happy in his dreams. The criticism of society's injustice is, in Spinetta's words, [...] "a complaint made with tenderness." [...] He called it [...] "the symbol of a Christian ideology: neighborliness, solidarity." [...] "A estos hombres tristes" [...] was inspired by the melancholy of Sundays in Argentina, with Spinetta saying: [...] "Sunday was always a sad day, I <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why.</b> At the same time it was happy because there was football, the family gathered, there was good food. The importance that was given to the weekend in our country in those years was tremendous. But the personal solitude at that time was very clear." [...] The album ends with [...] "Laura va", a baroque pop song which took Spinetta a year and a half to write; Spinetta described it as an attempt to emulate the Beatles' [...] "She's Leaving Home".|$|E

2500|$|Wolfgang {{left home}} {{permanently}} in 1781 (see below), {{and from this}} time until 1784, Leopold lived in Salzburg with just Nannerl (now in her early thirties) and their servants. Nannerl {{had a number of}} suitors, of whom the most important was Franz Armand d'Ippold, with whom she was evidently in love. In the end she did not marry him, and {{the reason for this is}} unknown. One possibility, frequently entertained by biographers, is that the marriage was blocked by Leopold, who liked having Nannerl at home as the lady of the house. However, Halliwell [...] observes that no written evidence on this point survives and insists that we simply <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> Nannerl married so late. Nannerl finally did marry in August 1784, at age 33. She moved to the home of her new husband, Johann Baptist Franz von Berchtold zu Sonnenburg, in the small rural town of St. Gilgen, roughly six hours journey east of Salzburg.|$|E

2500|$|In three {{comic strip}} stories written by Alan Moore in 1980 and 1981, the Time Lords, {{assisted}} by the Special Executive, fight a time war {{early in their}} history against the [...] "Order of the Black Sun", based some thirty thousand years in their future. The first strike of the war, from the Time Lords' point of view, is when a Black Sun agent travels back in time, and attacks the Time Lords {{just as they are}} about to turn the star Qqaba into a power source for their time experiments. This also causes the apparent demise of the stellar engineer Omega. The Time Lords <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> the Black Sun (whom they had never encountered before the attack) should have wanted to strike at them, and surmise that it was for something they had yet to do. Years later, at a diplomatic conference, a representative of the Order is murdered by the Sontarans, and the murder is blamed on the Time Lords. This provides the motivation for the war's beginnings, as from the Order's point of view, the Time Lords are the ones who strike first.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presence}} of Ecclesiastes in the Bible {{is something of}} a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon—a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people—are absent from it, which gives it tone that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. The problem to understand the book has been there from the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical Council of Jamnia in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced then was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion, but other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes. Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything {{in the rest of the}} book which would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion has been to treat the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are, for example in the Book of Job. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. [...] "In short, we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> or how this book found its way into such esteemed company," [...] summarizes Martin A.
