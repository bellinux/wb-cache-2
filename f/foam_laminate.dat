5000|$|Viscoelastic armor is able {{to achieve}} {{a higher level of}} shock/impact {{reducing}} benefits with more comfort and less bulk than traditional hard armor - <b>foam</b> <b>laminate</b> solutions. Hybrid armor is layered with hard shell outer materials. European standard EN-1621 is used to rate the effectiveness of armor. In this standard, a 5 kg flat impactor impacts the armor at a speed of 4.47 m/s (energy 5x4,47x4,47/2=50 J [...] "Joules"). 50 J of energy is roughly equivalent to dropping a 1Kg mass from a height of 5m (E=mGH). Sensors measure how much force is transmitted through the armor, its peak force in kilo-newtons (kN), and its period (how long it took the force to be transmitted). If the force transmitted through the armor is less than 35 kN then the armor (all armor except back) can attain an EN-1621-1 rating. Standard also includes other factors such as temperature stability and coverage area. The back protection standard is EN-1621-2. That standard rating is based on that energy being less than 18 kN (EN-1621-2 Level 1) or less than 9 kN (EN-1621-2 Level 2).|$|E

In conclusion, the project shows that open celled foams out of molybdenum are a potent substitute for conventional radiation sheet heat insulation.

40|$|Bicycle helmet is {{a useful}} {{personal}} device for protecting bicyclist's head and brain during accidents. Nowadays most bicycle helmets are made of polymer foams such as expended polyurethane and expended polystyrene. The current polymer foams used mostly have closed cells structure, resulting in poor ventilation. This can only be improved by adding the ventilation slots (vents), {{with the cost of}} the reduction in the impact protection. A research project concentrating on the impact strength, the effectiveness of the ventilation and the selection of alternative materials had been conducted for two years. This thesis summarizes the investigation results of the project. Polymer foam has been widely used in bicycle helmets as an efficient energy-absorption material. This study examines the energy-absorbing capacity and various failure modes of polymer <b>foam</b> <b>laminated</b> structure by a series of static and impact experiments using both MTS and Dynatup 8250. When a head is subjected to an impact, violent force and moment caused by sudden deceleration of the head are applied to the brain. Wearing a helmet substantially reduces the risk of head injury in a crash. Therefore, the highest head acceleration, the energy-absorbing capacity and the failure analysis of bicycle helmets under specially designed Impact Test Rig have been studied on various anvils. To improve the design of bicycle helmets, a mechanics model has been proposed which is capable of estimating the acceleration - time curve and predicting the energy absorbed by the bicycle helmet. The predictions have shown good agreement with the experimental measurements. Based on our experimental studies and modeling, some improvements in the alternative selection of materials has also been suggested. It has been found that the grid-domed textile composites possess outstanding impact energy-absorption capacity and good ventilation. This has raised a possibility of employing this new type of material as the cushioning layer (i. e. liner) in bicycle helmets of new generation...|$|R

Such foam cups not only provide {{a wide range of}} designs combined with different levels of softness and support,but also reduce production costs with minimum cutting and sewing of seams. In this study,two selected PU foam and fabric materials typically used for bra cup moulding were examined. Their respective performance behaviour in relation to different moulding temperatures and time changes were recorded and analyzed. The results reveal that cup heights are greatly affected by the use of <b>foam</b> and/or fabric-foam <b>laminated</b> materials. High moulding temperatures and/or prolonged dwell time could be required when deforming laminated materials and setting large cup sizes.

The thesis experimentally and analytically investigates {{the response of}} foam-only panels (ALPORAS) to indentation with various indenter sizes and shapes; and also studies the behaviour of sandwich panels to contact damage caused quasi-statically or by impact. Quasi&# 150;static uniaxial compression testing is {{used to determine the}} mechanical properties of the foams (ALPORAS and ALULIGHT). It is revealed that the plastic collapse strength (&# 963;* pl) obtained from the stress&# 150;strain curves is lower than the values predicted by the Gibson-Ashby theoretical model. This phenomenon is {{explained by the fact that}} the aluminium foams tested are imperfect, non-homogeneous and non-isotropic, and show a distinct cell elongation. Whereas, the Gibson-Ashby theoretical model was based on the finite element method applied to the response of a unit tetrakaidecahedral closed cell having flat faces. The experimental work shows that the deformation of the foam-only panels to indentation is caused by progressive crushing of the cell bands and by shearing and tearing of the cell walls. This thesis presents new analytical models for the response of the foam-only panels and estimates the applied deformation load in all types of indentation. By fitting the experimental load-displacement curves, the shear strength (&# 964;* pl) and the tear energy (&# 947;) are deduced. Compared to the literature, more consistent results are obtained for the shear strength (&# 964; * pl) and the tear energy (&# 947;) from all types of indentation. It is also suggested to determine (&# 964; * pl) and (&# 947;) through indentations with long punches (FEP and LCP), instead of hemi-spherical or cylindrical indenters, because indentation on enclosed areas shows some indenter size dependence. It is concluded that thinner panels are not suitable for the determination of the tear energy (&# 947;) since the densification of the foam is achieved before the tear resistance is fully engaged. Another objective of this thesis is to study the response of sandwich panels comprising a closed&# 150;cell aluminium <b>foam</b> core and <b>laminated</b> with carbon fibre skin to quasi-static and impact local damage. Special attention is paid to the residual (remnant) strength in bending of the already indented sandwich panels (quasi-statically or by impact) up to the failure point. The remnant strength in bending is determined by carrying out four point bending strength tests. The local damage is located on either the compressive or on the tensile side of the sandwich panels. Thus, the capacity of the panels to resist transverse loads after they have been locally damaged at contact is investigated. The contact damage on the sandwich panels is experimentally simulated using spherical indenters. The quasi-static indentation is carried out at a low constant velocity (0. 5 mm/min) &# 150; the induced contact damage is found to be independent on the sample thickness but dependent on the indenter diameter. On the contrary, the impact test indicates velocity-dependence of the failure mode of the sandwich panel (i. e. skin breakage or punch through) which is found from the load-displacement curves. The results reveal that there is a correlation between the area of the contact damage and the remnant strength, and that the use of metal foam cores leads to high contact damage resilience of composite structures...|$|R

Before the size effect is addressed for a sandwich structure, it must be understood for its components-the/Dam core and the laminate skins. In the current practice, the size effects are automatically attributed 10 the randomness of material strength. as described by the Weibull theory. The purpose of this paper is to show that in both the <b>foam</b> and the <b>laminate</b> there are deterministic size effects, which are generally more pronounced. They are caused by stress redistribution and energy release due to the growth of large fractures or large cracking zones prior to attaining the maximum load.

40|$|Lightweight, high strength, high {{stiffness}} fiber reinforced polymer {{composite materials}} are leading contenders {{to improve the}} efficiency and sustainability of many forms of transport. They offer immense scope for incorporating multifunctionality due to their hierarchical internal architecture. One limiting factor in their wider exploitation is relatively poor performance under impact loading, a crucial aspect of any safety critical design, leading to {{a significant reduction in}} strength, stiffness and stability. This results in conservative design and higher mass structures. Self-healing has the potential to mitigate damage resulting from impact, thereby improving design allowables or offering other benefits such as reduced maintenance and inspection schedules. The work presented in this paper shows that either compartmentalised hollow-fiber or continuous vascular network self-healing approaches can be used for the repair of advanced composite structures. In the nearer term, the specific placement of self-healing plies or individual fibers to match a critical damage threat has been shown to repair internal matrix cracking and delaminations throughout the thickness of a laminate when assessed in both a flexural and compressive loading state. In the longer term, integration of a pervasive, circulatory vascular network within the foam core of a composite sandwich structure has also been shown to offer a marked benefit. The network has negligible influence on structural performance whilst being able to provide reattachment of the <b>foam</b> core and <b>laminate</b> skin after impact damage. In the case studied, a sizeable recovery in flexural and compression after impact strength, and restoration of primary failure mode was observed. Such systems offer significant potential for restoring structural integrity to a composite component during service and prolonging residual life after a damage event.
