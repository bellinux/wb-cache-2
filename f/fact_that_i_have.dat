500|$|In July 2005, Jeff Gannon {{began writing}} editorials for the paper. His pieces {{included}} criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis, {{who had helped}} uncover Gannon's pornographic ads. Editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's history of anti-gay reporting as well as Gannon's refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, “My personal life is a private matter, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> become a public person.” Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial and claimed the [...] "steady stream of feedback/vitriol" [...] had declined [...] "a little" [...] with each new Gannon article.|$|E
500|$|After the war, {{many former}} Nazis fled to South America, {{especially}} to Argentina, {{where they were}} welcomed by Juan Perón's regime. In the 1950s, former Dachau inmate Lothar Hermann discovered that Buenos Aires resident Ricardo Klement was in fact Adolf Eichmann, who had in 1948 obtained false identification and a landing permit for Argentina through an organization directed by Bishop Alois Hudal, an Austrian cleric with Nazi sympathies then residing in Italy. Eichmann was captured in Buenos Aires on 11 May 1960 by Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency. At his trial in Jerusalem in 1961, he was found guilty {{and sentenced to death}} by hanging. Eichmann was quoted as having stated, [...] "I will jump into my grave laughing, because the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the death of five million Jews [...] on my conscience gives me extraordinary satisfaction." [...] Franz Stangl, the commandant of Treblinka, also escaped to South America with the assistance of Hudal's network. He was deported to Germany in 1967 and was {{sentenced to life in prison}} in 1970. He died in 1971.|$|E
500|$|The National Black Police Association {{opposed the}} boycott of Time-Warner and {{the attacks on}} [...] "Cop Killer," [...] {{identifying}} police brutality {{as the cause of}} much anti-police sentiment, and proposed the creation of independent civilian review boards [...] "to scrutinize the actions of our law enforcement officers" [...] as a way of ending the provocations that caused artists such as Body Count [...] "to respond to actions of police brutality and abuse through their music. [...] Many individuals of the law enforcement profession do not want anyone to scrutinize their actions, but want to scrutinize the actions of others." [...] Critics argued that the song could cause crime and violence. Others defended the album {{on the basis of the}} group's right to freedom of speech, and cited the fact that Ice-T had portrayed a police officer in the film New Jack City. Ice-T is quoted as saying that [...] "I didn't need people to come in and really back me on the First Amendment. I needed people to come in and say 'Ice-T has grounds to make this record.' I have the right to make it because the cops are killing my people. So fuck the First Amendment, let's deal with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> the right to make it." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mary Sloane {{was very}} much pleased at Hugh's visit. She had always resented the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never had a [...] "beau," [...] seeming to think it {{reflected}} some slight or disparagement upon me. She did all she could to encourage him.|$|R
2500|$|He also {{released}} a statement in which he explained his actions and rationalized them as serving the cause of anti-abortion and anti-gay activism. In his statement, he claimed that he had [...] "deprived the government of its goal of sentencing me to death," [...] and that [...] "the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> entered {{an agreement with the}} government is purely a tactical choice on my part and in no way legitimates the moral authority of the government to judge this matter or impute my guilt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2005, Gannon {{began writing}} for the DC-area gay {{publication}} Washington Blade. His articles included criticism of gay blogger John Aravosis, who had accused him of having pornographic ads. Blade editor Chris Crain attracted his own criticism from many in the gay community for this decision, due to Gannon's criticism of the gay rights movement {{as well as his}} refusal to disclose his sexual orientation. He has said, [...] "My personal life is a private matter, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> become a public person." [...] Crain defended his decision in a September 2005 editorial, writing that the [...] "steady stream of feedback/vitriol" [...] had declined [...] "a little" [...] with each new Gannon article. Crain resigned as editor in 2006, retaining ownership in the paper's parent company. The new editorial team fired Gannon {{as a result of what}} editor Kevin Naff called Gannon's [...] "huge credibility problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{put myself}} in the (Those who fear {{expansion}} of Government control) group, and do not hide the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a clear bias on Anthropogenic global warming (AGW). [...] My bias is based on fear of Government expansion and the observation of AGW data presentation fraud – not based on financial or any other personal benefit. [...] I merely {{have found that the}} closer you look at the data and alarmists’ [...] presentations, the more fraud you find and the less you think there is an AGW problem... For decades, as a professional experimental test engineer, I have analyzed experimental data and watched others massage and present data. [...] I became a cynic; My conclusion – “if someone is aggressively selling a technical product whose merits are dependent on complex experimental data, he is likely lying”. [...] That is true whether the product is an airplane or a Carbon Credit.|$|E
60|$|Lady Desborough {{had sent}} her {{carriage}} to meet me, and I began to realize the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> all at once become a young woman.|$|R
60|$|I {{could then}} make confession, and surely the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> paid where clearly {{there was no}} longer any need to pay must earn me {{forgiveness}} and afford proof of the sincerity of my passion.|$|R
6000|$|... "For one thing," [...] John replied, [...] "I <b>have</b> {{come because}} <b>I</b> don't {{want to appear}} prejudiced, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> never spent a month in London, or even a week, seemed a little narrow-minded." ...|$|R
2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the other day I knew the reaction there was going to be. But I think if they put themselves in the same predicament, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been at Liverpool for 12 years and that I would like to test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anscombe also {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. When a set of facts xyz stands in this relation to a fact A, they are a subset out of a range some subset among which holds if A holds. Thus if A is the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> paid for something, the brute facts might be that I have handed him a cheque for a sum which he has named as the price for the goods, saying that this is the payment, or that I gave him some cash {{at the time that he}} gave me the goods. There tends, according to Anscombe, to be an institutional context which gives its point to the description 'A', but of which 'A' is not itself a description: that I have given someone a shilling is not a description of the institution of money or of the currency of the country. According to her, no brute facts xyz can generally be said to entail the fact A relative to which they are 'brute' except with the proviso [...] "under normal circumstances", for [...] "one cannot mention all the things that were not the case, which would have made a difference if they had been." [...] A set facts xyz... may be brute relative to a fact A which itself is one of a set of facts ABC... which is brute relative to some further fact W. Thus brute facts are not a distinct class of facts, to be distinguished from another class, 'institutional facts': the essential concept to grasp here is that of a set of facts being 'brute relative to' some fact. The term 'brute facts' had a major role to play in John Searle's philosophy of speech acts and institutional reality.|$|E

60|$|The third {{letter was}} a long one, and very hurriedly written, so much so in <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> all <b>I</b> could do to {{decipher}} its contents. I moved over to the skylight, and was soon deeply absorbed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I suppose, sir," [...] Mrs. Wingfield said coldly, [...] "that {{there was}} no {{necessity}} for me to acquaint Mr. Jackson formally with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> purchased through my agent the woman he sold to separate her from her husband." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was chiefly {{mindful of}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my brother's life to save," [...] said the girl, very coldly, her eye resting upon her betrothed in a glance of so much {{contempt}} that it forced him into an abashed silence.|$|R
60|$|I have {{to thank}} Monsieur Philippe de St. Gre for a great deal. And I take this {{opportunity}} to set down the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> rarely met a more remarkable man.|$|E
6000|$|... "D'ye know, Jack, I {{have been}} in {{possession}} of my fortune, as you call it, so short a time that I cannot realise the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> it.-- Hollo! Mak, what's wrong with you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I have a watchman—old Tony Wells, who is {{as honest}} {{as they make}} ’em. But, Dave, I don’t want you to mention the {{diamonds}} to anybody. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> this order is being kept a secret,” went on Mr. Wadsworth, anxiously.|$|E
60|$|When we set {{out again}} all of us from the Avenger were side by side, and, {{although}} it may seem childish to say so, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> friends at either hand gave me renewed strength of body {{as well as of}} mind.|$|R
60|$|Paul {{pressed my}} arm in token {{that he wanted}} to say something; but I clapped my hand over his mouth. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> made a most grievous mistake was {{beginning}} to find lodgment in my dull brain, and a nervous fear was creeping over me.|$|R
5000|$|... "If {{there is}} anyone {{that should be}} a Republican or an ultra conservative, it's me, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> not only conquered the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> only a tenth grade education, but based on the friendships <b>that</b> <b>I</b> made, and the betting on people, like Mr. J.

60|$|From the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{quoted a}} part of the inaugural address, it must not be {{inferred}} that I repudiate any other part, the whole of which I reaffirm, except so far as what I now say of the mails may be regarded as a modification.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have not. Mine {{own sister}} {{would not have}} been more {{respected}} than hath Ozema been respected by me, as is shown by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> hastened to place her in the care of my dear aunt, and in the company of Doña Mercedes." ...|$|E
60|$|Ignoring the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{had all the}} luck, I was {{inclined}} to be self-satisfied when I thought of Sam. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> pitted my wits against his, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> won.

5000|$|... “Just {{the very}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to be so}} {{cautious}} and clandestine about it speaks volumes to the worry about the state… you still cannot show any dissidence. Certainly much has changed, certainly you can talk much more openly in private. But don’t you dare oppose the regime in public!” ...|$|R
60|$|The 'Volksstem' noticed as a {{significant}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> recently become a subscriber to the State Library, and had selected Mill's essay 'On Liberty.' It apparently desired to gravely deprecate prisoners having access to such inflammatory literature. The idea will, perhaps, amuse those who have read the work in question.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{were not}} content, madam," [...] he said, [...] "I should deserve {{to lose my}} place.

6000|$|... "It {{appears to}} me, Mr. Wadham," [...] he said quietly, [...] "that your visit is, in a sense, an admonitory one.

60|$|Once {{this matter}} had been settled Hiram seemed to {{consider}} himself {{the leader of}} our party, regardless of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been chosen captain of the company, and straightway began to lay plans, thus showing, to my mind at least, that he had decided, even before awakening me, on some such scheme.|$|R
