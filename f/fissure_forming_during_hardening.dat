This fact of the ocean-islands being so generally volcanic is also interesting in relation {{to the nature of the}} mountain-chains on our continents, which are comparatively seldom volcanic; and yet we are led to suppose that where our continents now stand an ocean once extended.

40|$|Aerial IR {{surveys were}} carried out in September 2010 over {{geothermal}} areas at Usu, Noboribetsu and Hokkaido-Komagatake volcanoes, Japan. The heat discharge rate from steaming grounds that <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> the 2000 eruption of Usu volcano {{is estimated to be}} 5. 6 MW, which is half the rate measured in September 2006. Integration of the heat discharge rate from April 2000 to September 2010 yields an accumulated discharge of approximately 2. 4 × 1016 J. This amount of heat corresponds to several percent of the total intruded magma heat estimated from analyses of ground deformation associated with the 2000 eruption. Areas of steaming ground associated with the 2000 eruption showed rapid growth compared with those of the 1977 eruption but discharged less heat. We suspect that differences in the hydrological environments of the two eruptions, led to contrasting patterns of propagation of the hydrothermal systems around the intruded magmas. 　　The heat discharge rate from the summit areas of Usu volcano, Showa-shinzan and Noboribetsu volcano in 2010 are estimated to be 40, 6. 2 and 22 MW, respectively, similar to the rates measured in September 2006. 　　No high-temperature grounds were detected at the vents and <b>fissure</b> <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> the 1942 eruption of Hokkaido-Komagatake volcano.

40|$|Abstract: The heat {{treatment}} of {{high speed steel}} tools consists of austenitizing, quenching and tempering. The size of austenite grains <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> the <b>hardening</b> treatment {{is an important factor}} in the final microstructure of the steel, and it also affects properties such as wear resistance and toughness. This paper presents the austenite grain size, matrix composition and hardness of commercial AISI M 2, AISI T 15, VWM 3 C and Sinter 23 high speed steels that were austenitized and quenched from five distinct temperatures. This study shows that increase in quenching temperature results in grain growth of steels such as AISI M 2 and VWM 3 C, obtained by the conventional method (cast to ingot and worked). The P/M Sinter 23 high speed steel showed a slight grain growth (about 10 %). This effect was not observed in AISI T 15 obtained by the powder metallurgy process...|$|R
40|$|Radiocarbon (14 C) can be {{successfully}} applied to organic {{materials such as}} wood, charcoal, paper, parchment, bones etc. Mortar is a difficult material for 14 C dating because of potential contamination with dead carbon from unreacted limestone left during preparation of quick lime and mortar. Attempts for radiocarbon dating of mortar have been performed {{since the early days}} of the method development without significant success. The accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) measurement technique has recently enabled development of various sample preparation techniques taking into account various phases of mortar. The Aqueduct in Skopje (FYR Macedonia) is one of the landmarks of Skopje, a monumental building more than 380 m long. It was a part of a water-supply system with a total length of about 10 km. The age of the Aqueduct is not known –several hypotheses place it to periods between 6 th and 16 th century. Six mortar samples from different positions of the eastern façade were collected in July 2017. In order to prevent the dead carbon contamination during 14 C analyses of carbonates in mortars, only the carbonate fraction associated with the carbonation of slaked lime, i. e., calcite that is <b>formed</b> only <b>during</b> mortar <b>hardening</b> had to be extracted. First, the mortar samples were broken by alternately changing temperatures from - 198 °C to 80 °C. Three strategies for separation of slaked lime were used: 1) mechanical separation of calcite inclusions <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> mortar <b>hardening</b> (not possible for all mortar samples), 2) selection on the basis of particle size and suspension in water induced by ultrasonic shock, and 3) collection of at least two fractions of CO 2 produced by reaction of calcite with acid. The results of the analyses will be presented and possibility of using the method for future mortar dating will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Molar-tooth {{structures}} are intricately crumpled, microsparry calcite <b>fissure</b> fills that <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> the Precambrian. Strontium isotope stratigraphy constrains the last occurrence of volumetrically significant molar-tooth structure (MT) in the geological record to ∼ 750 Ma. Although {{the disappearance of}} MT is commonly ascribed {{to the influence of}} metazoans on sediment cohesion, this now seems less plausible because there is no evidence for significant sediment disruption by metazoans before ∼ 550 Ma. It is proposed here that the most likely alternative explanation for MT disappearance is a change in ocean chemistry. A decrease in CaCO 3 saturation and/or an increase in the concentration of precipitation inhibitors in mid-Neoproterozoic seawater may have contributed to MT disappearance, and might also help to explain the approximately contemporaneous decline in stromatolite diversity...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – Important {{vertebrate}} faunas {{occur in}} fissure deposits of Late Triassic–Jurassic age in SW Britain. Although the faunas are well described, their age and palaeoenvironment remain poorly understood. One such fissure system was documented in detail during quarrying operations at Tytherington and has yielded in situ palynomorphs that add much information concerning its age and palaeoenvironment. Significantly, the Tytherington fauna {{is of the}} sauropsid type that has generally been dated as Norian or pre-Penarth Group transgression and was also regarded as representing a distinct upland fauna. The palynomorphs, which include a significant marine component, demonstrate that the Tytherington Triassic fissures are infilled with Late Triassic (Rhaetian) sediments that match specific levels in the Westbury Formation. In addition, many of the Tytherington solutional <b>fissures</b> probably <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> the Rhaetian and are consistent with a fluctuating saline to freshwater environment. There is no prima facie evidence of solutional formation and infilling of the reptile-bearing deposits before the Rhaetian trangression. The fissure reptile fauna, which includes the early dinosaur Thecodontosaurus, inhabited a small fire-swept limestone island in the Rhaetian sea. The features of the herpetofauna are entirely consistent with this island model which has Quaternary analogues...|$|R

In this study, we compared the morphometry and compound eye characteristics of three species of the genus Siagona: S. jenissoni, S. dejeani and S. europaea. These carabids have a stenotopic lifestyle in Mediterranean clayey soils, inhabiting the ground <b>fissure</b> system <b>formed</b> <b>during</b> the dry season. All species have a Mediterranean distribution and are nocturnal olfactory hunters, and are strict ant predators. For morphometric measurements, we considered body length (mm), wing length (mm), antenna length (mm), head width (mm), trochanter length (mm), number of ommatidia, eye surface area (mm 2), ommatidia density (number of ommatidia/mm 2 of eye surface area), head height (mm), thorax height (mm) and abdomen height (mm). The data revealed intersexual and interspecific differences. The three species differ in relative length of the antennae, density and number of ommatidia and relative trochanter length. Significant differences occurred in wing sizes, which are well developed in S. europaea, the only species capable of flight. When eye size is compared with other ground beetles of various lifestyles, Siagona shows pronounced “microphthalmy” an adaptation to subterranean life in clayey crevices of tropical and subtropical climates with a marked dry season...|$|R

40|$|For the {{disposal}} of high level radioactive waste, cementitious barriers are considered worldwide and for various purposes. The Belgian supercontainer concept, for example, considers the use of cylindrical concrete containers: the radwaste is emplaced inside a hardened self-compacting concrete buffer, and for closure of the supercontainer the remaining gap is filled by casting a selfcompacting mortar. As a consequence, this cementitious layer is exposed to the radioactive waste and gamma radiation <b>during</b> <b>hardening.</b> In this research study, small self-compacting mortar samples are irradiated by gamma rays <b>during</b> <b>hardening,</b> and exposed to different doses (Gy) and different dose rates (Gy/h) at different hardening times at first exposure to investigate the cement-waste interactions that might occur <b>during</b> <b>hardening</b> of the cementitious barrier. The effect on the strength and the microstructure is investigated, by means of compressive strength tests, scanning electron microscopy, and nitrogen adsorption tests. It {{was found that the}} observed strength loss due to gamma irradiation increases with an increasing total received dose. Furthermore, the age at which irradiation starts, plays a role in the effect of the gamma irradiation. A link between the strength of the mortar samples and its porosity is found by means of the nitrogen adsorption tests. A higher received dose increases the porosity which leads to a decrease in compressive strength. BET-analysis shows that the specific surface of the pores also increase due to gamma irradiation. Finally, SEM-analysis revealed that gamma irradiation <b>during</b> <b>hardening</b> of cementitious samples affects the microstructure...|$|R

40|$|The {{start of}} the {{chemical}} reaction between cement and water is the moment that concrete starts to develop its properties. More precisely, it is the paste that starts to generate a loadbearing microstructure that exhibits {{a certain number of}} mechanical properties. One of the properties generated <b>during</b> <b>hardening</b> is the so-called hardening shrinkage. Quite often, this property is measured from hardening concrete by linear measurements and related to the paste deformation by using mathematical models. The opposite way, by measuring the paste deformation and relate it to the deformation of concrete is another possibility that can be applied. In the paper, a new apparatus called “mini-TSTM” (Thermal Stress Testing Machine) for measuring the hardening shrinkage of paste will be presented and discussed [1]. The device has been developed to measure the hardening deformations directly from the paste. It provides more insight in the contracting forces that act on the paste located in between the aggregates. The mini-TSTM is scaled down from the “full-scale” TSTM machine which is commonly used for measuring the thermal stresses of hardening concrete elements. With the mini-TSTM, the contraction forces can be measured (load controlled) as well as the deformations (deformation controlled) which are mobilized by a paste <b>during</b> <b>hardening.</b> The mini-TSTM is a tool that fits into the moisture controlled specimen chamber of the ESEM /Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope/ with enables the opportunity to sample the paste deformations <b>during</b> <b>hardening</b> as wel...|$|R
