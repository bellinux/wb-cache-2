25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy when he was out. But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E

In 1996, the group won seven VMAs total for the [...] "1979" [...] and [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] videos, including the top award, Video of the Year, for [...] "Tonight, Tonight". The video was also nominated for a Grammy at the 1997 ceremony.

500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{was more}} critical, {{referring}} {{to it as}} [...] "forced, off pitch, and strenuously unfunny". She was also critical of Michael's interaction with the youth group, writing that it [...] "didn't add any development to his character or to the show's broader arcs; <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> weird, and not that humorous." [...] Despite this, she praised the cold opening, featuring Pam lecturing the office on proper hygiene. HitFix reviewer Alan Sepinwall called the episode [...] "spectacularly unfunny" [...] and criticized the writers for using Michael's loneliness as a joke instead of taking it seriously like {{they had in the}} fourth season episode [...] "Money". Despite this, he complimented Lieberstein's performance as Toby while he was questioning God.|$|E

The 45-minute film audible visions of (sic)nesses features Slipknot during and in-between gigs on the All Hope Is Gone World Tour. Shawn Crahan stated that, [...] "Going in and filming this, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like {{there was no way}} it could fail. It {{was going to be in}} the top five best shows of our careers, and that's basically what it was: we got off the stage and all nine of us [...] felt the same thing, we knew that we destroyed 80,000 people. Watching it back just brings tears to my eyes".|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Matt Mitovich from TV Guide {{wrote that}} [...] "Larry King" [...] was [...] "pretty blah. Something about <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> drab and lifeless, {{as if the}} writers and cast were in a mad dash to break for Christmas." [...] The A.V. Clubs Scott Tobias {{believed}} that the episode was not up to [...] "30 Rocks high standards" [...] and commented that a [...] "big problem" [...] was Jack and Elisa's storyline. [...] "The concept of rich, superficial, commitment-phobic workaholic Jack falling for his exact opposite isn't a bad one, but Hayek's run has been {{more or less a}} wash." [...] Tobias further added that Alec Baldwin and Salma Hayek [...] "are an odd couple" [...] citing {{that they do not have}} much chemistry together.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics are}} more demanding. M. Keith Booker writes: For their part, the Coens deny any {{intention}} of presenting an allegorical message. They chose the detectives' names deliberately, but [...] "we just {{wanted them to be}} representative of the Axis world powers at the time. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> kind of amusing. It's a tease. All that stuff with Charlie– [...] the [...] "Heil Hitler!" [...] business– [...] sure, it's all there, but it's kind of a tease." [...] In 2001, Joel responded to a question about critics who provide extended comprehensive analysis: [...] "That's how they've been trained to watch movies. In Barton Fink, we may have encouraged it– [...] like teasing animals at the zoo. The movie is intentionally ambiguous in ways they may not be used to seeing".|$|E
5000|$|Pitchfork was critical, writing, [...] "Beyond the melodies that dont {{stick in}} my head and the beats that dont make me want to dance, the only real problem with Souljacker ... is that <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like an underachievement." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{music video}} {{received}} heavy airplay on MTV and won several awards. Corgan remarked that [...] "I don't think we've ever had people react ...<b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to touch a}} nerve." [...] It won six awards at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1996: Video of the Year, Breakthrough Video, Best Direction in a Video (Directors: Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris), Best Special Effects in a Video (Special Effects: Chris Staves), Best Art Direction in a Video (Art Director: K. K. Barrett and Wayne White) and Best Cinematography in a Video (Director of Photography: Declan Quinn). [...] "Tonight, Tonight" [...] was nominated for Best Editing in a Video (Editor: Eric Zumbrunnen) and Viewer's Choice, and was also nominated for Best Music Video, Short Form at the 39th Annual Grammy Awards. It is still {{considered one of the}} greatest music videos of all time, ranking number 40 on Stylus Magazines list of the top 100 music videos of all time.|$|E
500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|John Nigro of The Pitt News {{considered}} [...] "Petarded" [...] one {{of volume}} 3's best episodes along with [...] "Breaking Out Is Hard to Do" [...] and [...] "Perfect Castaway". The Sydney Morning Herald critic Marc McEvoy commented [...] "Petarded" [...] to be [...] "a real thigh-slapper." [...] Kim Voynar of TV Squad gave the episode a mixed review, saying [...] " [...] <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to wrap up}} a little too quickly for me, like {{they ran out of}} time and were like, 'Oops, let's wrap this up now'. Other than that quibble, though, it was a fairly funny episode." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number five on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "one of the best episodes ever" [...] for fans of offensive humor. He also noted that the episode did not [...] "go down all that well at the time with censors and charity groups." ...|$|E

"I can't put {{my finger}} on it [...] - [...] <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> to strike a chord with {{a hell of a lot}} of people, whether it's letting out that pent-up {{aggression}} they feel for their jobs through the week or what, but they just let go when they come hear us."

5000|$|In 1974, {{after he}} had {{recorded}} eight albums, Morrison told Ritchie Yorke when he {{asked him what he}} considered his finest single track and the one that he enjoyed the most that it was: [...] "Definitely 'Madame George', definitely.

500|$|Connor Trinneer (who played Commander Trip Tucker), {{felt that}} the finale {{should have had a}} memorable {{farewell}} that he described as a [...] "M*A*S*H moment", but that the producers did not want to focus on such an element. Anthony Montgomery (who played Ensign Travis Mayweather) was similarly displeased with the finale and said [...] "I feel there could have been a more effective way to wrap things up for our show as well as the franchise as a whole. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to take a little bit away from what the Enterprise cast and crew worked so diligently to achieve over the past four years." [...] While Frakes enjoyed working with Sirtis again, he said that [...] "the reality is {{it was a bit of}} a stretch to have us shut down [...] show," [...] and that in hindsight it was a disservice to them. The early criticism forced the show's producers to hold a conference and address the issue. Braga admitted there was cast unrest, but defended the episode as a way to close not just Enterprise but Star Trek as a whole.|$|E
500|$|Gary Anderson's missed kick {{has been}} singled out as the main {{contributing}} factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able {{to capitalize on the}} late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss {{as one of the most}} devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to Chad Hartman, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, [...] " [...] will always be known as the guy who was a part of screwing up the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." [...] ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including two further NFC Championship losses in 2000 and 2009. Cunningham concurred by claiming, [...] "With that kick, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like the whole franchise went wide left." ...|$|E
500|$|The band took a {{break from}} {{performing}} live between the NetAid charity concert in October 1999 and 2001. They returned to {{the stage for a}} further charity gig on 28 April, in support of Unison's campaign for a living wage at the Manchester Evening News Arena. Matthews said prior to the performance that [...] "It's a cause I think's really important and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to be the right time for us to come back – it's a long, long time since we played live. It should be really great. We're really looking forward to what they (the new songs) are going to sound like live. It'll be good {{to get back on the}} old live circuit again." [...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid. [...] was all over the shop stylistically, I think it's a bit more focused. And I think it's a bit more impassioned".|$|E
500|$|The {{radio tower}} scene {{initially}} called for Electro {{to climb to}} {{the very top of}} the structure, a concept the crew found [...] "clunky" [...] throughout the storyboarding and directing process. Victor Cook, a producer and developer for The Spectacular Spider-Man, observed [...] "He's gonna climb the whole tower? <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> kind of weird." [...] Before release, the scene was altered to have Electro gradually propel himself up the tower with several electrical blasts.|$|R
50|$|There’s no way {{to contact}} people {{directly}} in Lifestage, since Sayman explains “my friends and I have a bajillion messaging apps we already use and love, so what’s {{the point of having}} another messaging app? <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> annoying to me.” Instead, each users gets a “Reach Me” line of text that appears beneath their name, which could be used to show off their Snapchat or Instagram handle, or another piece of contact info.|$|R
5000|$|Icelandic singer Björk {{initially}} {{chose not}} to release her album Vulnicura on Spotify, saying: [...] "This streaming thing just does not feel right. I don’t know why, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> insane. ... To work on something {{for two or three}} years and then <b>just,</b> 'Oh, here <b>it</b> is for free.'

500|$|The Beatles reconvened at EMI Studios on 21 October {{to conduct}} three {{additional}} takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangements, {{with the second}} take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon's acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped [...] "Norwegian Wood", {{it was far from}} the album version. Harrison's sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called [...] "Norwegian Wood", and the group changed the key from D major, to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be [...] "quite spontaneous from what I remember", adding, [...] "We miked it up and put it on and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to hit the spot".|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> like it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E
500|$|On September 10, Eleanor Roosevelt, {{the late}} president's widow and the gubernatorial candidate's mother, arrived in California {{for a quick}} {{campaign}} swing to support her son and Douglas before she {{had to return to}} New York as a delegate to the United Nations. Douglas hoped that the former first lady's visit would mark {{a turning point in the}} campaign. At a Democratic rally featuring Mrs. Roosevelt the next day in Long Beach, Nixon workers first handed out a flyer headed [...] "Douglas–Marcantonio Voting Record", printed with dark ink on pink paper. The legal-size flyer compared the voting records of Douglas and Marcantonio, principally in the area of national security, and concluded that they were indistinguishable. In contrast, the flyer said, Nixon had voted entirely in opposition to the [...] "Douglas–Marcantonio Axis". It implied that sending Douglas to the Senate would be no different from electing Marcantonio, and asked if that was what Californians wanted. The paper soon became known as the [...] "Pink Sheet". Chotiner later stated that the color choice was made at the print shop when campaign officials approved the final copy, and [...] "for some reason or other <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> to appeal to us for the moment". An initial print run of 50,000 was soon followed by a reprint of 500,000, distributed principally in heavily populated Southern California.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} at Architekt Music Studios in Butler, New Jersey.

5|$|<b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> like a feel-good record {{but when}} you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did because I was so in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|R

2500|$|The final track, [...] "Journeyman", is Iron Maiden's {{first and}} only fully {{acoustic}} song. According to Dickinson on the Death on the Road live album, it is about [...] "the whole process of writing and being a musician," [...] although Mick Wall describes it as [...] "a wistful tale of carpe diem." [...] The song was originally recorded with electric instruments, however, as Dickinson states, [...] "after all the battering that we've given the listener over the last hour of music <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> right to play out with something totally unexpected and left field." [...] The original version appears on the No More Lies EP.|$|E
2500|$|The {{play was}} {{eventually}} adapted {{for a film}} released in February 1990, with screenplay and direction by Stoppard. [...] The motion picture is Stoppard's only film directing credit: [...] "t began to become clear {{that it might be}} a good idea if I did it myself—at least the director wouldn't have to keep wondering what the author meant. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> that I'd be the only person who could treat the play with the necessary disrespect." [...] The cast included Gary Oldman as Rosencrantz, Tim Roth as Guildenstern, Richard Dreyfuss as the Player, Joanna Roth as Ophelia, Ian Richardson as Polonius, Joanna Miles as Gertrude, Donald Sumpter as Claudius, and Iain Glen as Hamlet.|$|E
