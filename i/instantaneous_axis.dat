A numerical orientation workspace evaluation method is proposed based on an equi‐volumetric partition in its parametric space and the volume‐element associated integral factor.

Specifically, we do not assume knowledge of the time evolution of the <b>instantaneous</b> orbital <b>axis</b> and the co-precessing waveforms before analyzing the data in our method. We test and measure the accuracy of our method using the numerical relativity simulation data of precessing binary black holes taken from the SXS Catalog.
