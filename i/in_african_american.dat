40|$|The risk of {{hypertension}} and related target organ damage {{is much greater}} <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> than <b>in</b> Caucasians. The risk of hypertensive end-stage renal disease is approximately five-fold higher <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Many {{studies have shown that}} low birth weight is strongly associated with increased risk {{of hypertension}}, stroke, and myocardial infarction. However, until recently the relationship between birth weight and hypertension-related diseases was not clearly established <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Moreover, it was also unclear if low birth weight in humans heightened the risk for end-stage renal disease. This is a critical gap in the literature, since low birth weight occurs at twice the rate <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> as among Caucasians. We identified a significant relationship between end-stage renal disease and low birth weight <b>in</b> both <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Caucasians. Given the higher rates of low birth weight <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> differences <b>in</b> fetal development may, therefore, contribute to the racial disparity in end-stage renal disease.

40|$|Hypertensive nephrosclerosis <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> versus Caucasians. BackgroundExtensive global {{glomerulosclerosis}} (GS) {{has been}} reported <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> with hypertension and renal insufficiency, far exceeding that in Caucasians. To assess and compare severity and phenotype of injury <b>in</b> biopsied <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Caucasians who morphologically had hypertensive nephrosclerosis, we performed a retrospective biopsy study. MethodsAll renal biopsies with a histological diagnosis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis from the last 11 years were identified from our clinical files. Lesions of global and segmental sclerosis, interstitial fibrosis and vascular sclerosis were semiquantitatively analyzed as percent involved, or on a 0 to 3 scale, respectively. The phenotypes of global glomerulosclerosis also were categorized as either the solidified (that is, the entire tuft is solidified) or the obsolescent type (that is, Bowman's space is occupied by collagenous material and the tuft is retracted). ResultsSixty-two patients (19 <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> 43 Caucasians) {{were included in the}} study. At biopsy, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> were younger than Caucasians with higher serum creatinine, but no difference in proteinuria or mean arterial pressure (MAP). <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had a marked increase in the solidified form of GS (25 ± 6 <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> vs. 8 ± 2 % in Caucasians, P < 0. 01). This extensive solidification of glomeruli was associated with segmental sclerosis <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> (38 ± 10 %), contrasting low prevalence of solidified GS in Caucasians with segmental sclerosis (10 ± 3 %, P < 0. 05) and <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> without segmental sclerosis (10 ± 4 %, P < 0. 05). <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> with segmental sclerosis were younger and clinically expressed a more severe renal disease than Caucasians with this lesion. Interstitial fibrosis was greater <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> than <b>in</b> Caucasians (54 ± 6 vs. 33 ± 3 %, P < 0. 01) and correlated with proteinuria and serum creatinine levels, especially <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> and also with GS. Vascular sclerosis was worse <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> than <b>in</b> Caucasians (0. 96 ± 0. 04 vs. 0. 77 ± 0. 08 score, P < 0. 05) and did not correlate with GS. By modeling, neither MAP nor age was useful in predicting any morphological lesions and proteinuria accounted only minimally for the variability of GS. ConclusionsBlood pressure levels and proteinuria did not account for morphological lesions, suggesting other factors (such as genetic factors, microvascular disease) may play a role. The phenotype of GS differs <b>in</b> biopsied <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> versus Caucasians with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, with a marked increase in the solidified form of GS <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> The association of extensive solidified GS with segmental sclerosis lesions <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> but not <b>in</b> Caucasians, suggests different mechanisms may contribute to the development and progression of sclerosis in these two patient groups...|$|R

5|$|The blues is a {{genre of}} African American folk {{music that is}} the basis for much of modern American popular music. Blues can be seen as part of a {{continuum}} of musical styles like country, jazz, ragtime, and gospel; though each genre evolved into distinct forms, their origins were often indistinct. Early forms of the blues evolved in and around the Mississippi Delta in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The earliest blues music was primarily call and response vocal music, without harmony or accompaniment and without any formal musical structure. Slaves and their descendants created the blues by adapting the field shouts and hollers, turning them into passionate solo songs. When mixed with the Christian spiritual songs of African American churches and revival meetings, blues became the basis of gospel music. Modern gospel began <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> churches in the 1920s, in the form of worshipers proclaiming their faith in an improvised, often musical manner (testifying). Composers like Thomas A. Dorsey composed gospel works that used elements of blues and jazz in traditional hymns and spiritual songs.|$|E

In order to investigate the genetic architecture of T 2 D <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> the MEta-analysis of type 2 DIabetes <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> (MEDIA) Consortium examined 17 GWAS on T 2 D comprising 8, 284 cases and 15, 543 controls <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> stage 1 analysis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) association analysis was conducted in each study under the additive model after adjustment for age, sex, study site, and principal components. Meta-analysis of approximately 2. 6 million genotyped and imputed SNPs in all studies was conducted using an inverse variance-weighted fixed effect model. Replications were performed to follow up 21 loci in up to 6, 061 cases and 5, 483 controls <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> and 8, 130 cases and 38, 987 controls of European ancestry. We identified three known loci (TCF 7 L 2, HMGA 2 and KCNQ 1) and two novel loci (HLA-B and INS-IGF 2) at genome-wide significance (4. 15 × 10 − 94 <P< 5 × 10 − 8, odds ratio (OR)  =  1. 09 to 1. 36). Fine-mapping revealed that 88 of 158 previously identified T 2 D or glucose homeostasis loci demonstrated nominal to highly significant association (2. 2 × 10 − 23 < locus-wide P< 0. 05). These novel and previously identified loci yielded a sibling relative risk of 1. 19, explaining 17. 5 % of the phenotypic variance of T 2 D on the liability scale <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> Overall, this study identified two novel susceptibility loci for T 2 D <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> A substantial number of previously reported loci are transferable to <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> after accounting for linkage disequilibrium, enabling fine mapping of causal variants in trans-ethnic meta-analysis studies...|$|R

Studies were performed on a diet containing 200 mmol of sodium and 100 mmol of potassium per day. In a separate study of 28 subjects, 10 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and 18 Caucasians, the contribution of the renin-angiotensin system was assessed by measuring renal hemodynamic responses to angiotension II (Ang II) and captopril. ResultsAlthough glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was similar, renal plasma flow (RPF) was significantly less <b>in</b> age-matched <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> (568 ± 18) than Caucasians (620 ± 13 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P = 0. 0063). After captopril, <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had a sevenfold greater vasodilator response and a rise in RPF (35. 3 ± 4. 9 vs. 4. 9 ± 12. 4 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Caucasians, respectively, P < 0. 028). Ang II administration caused a significantly smaller vasoconstrictor response <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> (Ang II-induced fall in RPF, - 97 ± 18 vs. - 150 ± 9 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, P = 0. 05), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition enhanced the response to Ang II <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> significantly. ConclusionsA reduction in RPF, blunting of the renal vascular response to Ang II, and an accentuated renal vasodilator response to captopril, which in turn corrects the blunting of responsiveness to Ang II, all suggest activation of the renin system <b>in</b> apparently healthy <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> As PRA was identical <b>in</b> Caucasians and <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> the findings suggest that it is the intrarenal-renin system that is activated <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> This difference <b>in</b> normal control mechanisms could predispose to nephropathy...|$|R

5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>American</b> styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines.

OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that low serum potassium contributes to the excess risk of diabetes <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans.</b> DESIGN: We analyzed data collected from 1987 to 1996 from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study. At baseline, we identified 2716 <b>African</b> <b>American</b> and 9493 white participants without diabetes. We used multivariate Cox models to estimate the relative hazards (RHs) of incident diabetes related to baseline serum potassium during 9 y of follow-up. RESULTS: Mean serum potassium concentrations were lower <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> than <b>in</b> whites at baseline (4. 2 compared with 4. 5 mEq/L; P < 0. 01), and <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had a greater incidence of diabetes than did whites (26 compared with 13 cases/ 1000 person-years). The adjusted RHs (95 % CI) of incident diabetes for those with serum potassium concentrations of < 4. 0, 4. 0 - 4. 4, and 4. 5 - 4. 9 mEq/L, compared with those with serum potassium concentrations of 5. 0 - 5. 5 mEq/L (referent), were 2. 28 (1. 21, 4. 28), 1. 97 (1. 06, 3. 65), and 1. 85 (0. 99, 3. 47) for <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and 1. 53 (1. 14, 2. 05), 1. 49 (1. 19, 1. 87), and 1. 27 (1. 02, 1. 58) for whites, respectively. Racial differences in serum potassium appeared to explain 18 % of the excess risk of diabetes <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans,</b> which is comparable with the percentage of risk explained by racial differences in body mass index (22 %).

Important baseline differences were higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> compared to Hispanics and Caucasians (107 ± 19, 102 ± 15, and 99 ± 13 mmHg, P< 0. 05), and higher serum creatinine (1. 66 ± 1. 3, 1. 25 ± 1. 0, and 1. 31 ± 1. 0 mg/dl, P< 0. 025). <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> had lower hematocrit compared to Hispanics and Caucasians (29 ± 5, and 31 ± 6, and 32 ± 7 %, P< 0. 05), and lower annual household income (30. 8 ± 14. 9, 33. 1 ± 15. 9, and 42. 2 ± 29. 3 in $ 1000; P< 0. 05). Lower prevalence of WHO class IV was seen in Caucasians (30 %) compared to Hispanics (57 %, P= 0. 03) and <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> (51 %, P= 0. 09). Development of doubling creatinine or end-stage renal disease was higher <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Hispanics than in Caucasians (31, 18, and 10 %; P< 0. 05), as was the development of renal events or death (34, 20, and 10 %; P< 0. 025). Our results suggest that both biological factors indicating an aggressive disease and low household income are common <b>in</b> <b>African</b> <b>Americans</b> and Hispanics with lupus nephritis, and outcomes in these groups are worse than in Caucasians...|$|R
