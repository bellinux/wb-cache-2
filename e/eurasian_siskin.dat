40|$|A die-off of {{passerine}} birds, mostly <b>Eurasian</b> <b>siskins</b> (Carduelis spinus), {{occurred in}} multiple areas of Switzerland between February and March 2010. Several {{of the dead}} birds were submitted for full necropsy. Bacteriological examination was carried out on multiple tissues of each bird. At gross examination, common findings were light-tan nodules, 1 to 4 mm in diameter, scattered through the esophagus/crop. Histologically, a necroulcerative transmural esophagitis/ingluvitis was observed. Bacterial cultures yielded Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. At the same time, 2 pet clinics reported an unusual increase of domestic cats presented with fever, anorexia, occasionally dolent abdomen, and history of presumed consumption of passerine birds. Analysis of rectal swabs revealed the presence of S. Typhimurium in all tested cats. PFGE (pulsed field electrophoresis) analysis was performed to characterize and compare the bacterial isolates, and it revealed an indistinguishable pattern between all the avian and all but 1 of the feline isolates. Cloacal swabs collected from clinically healthy migrating <b>Eurasian</b> <b>siskins</b> (during autumn 2010) did not yield S. Typhimurium. The histological and bacteriological findings were consistent with a systemic infection caused by S. Typhimurium. Isolation of the same serovar from the dead birds and ill cats, along with the overlapping results of the PFGE analysis for all the animal species, confirmed a spillover from birds to cats through predation. The sudden increase {{of the number of}} siskins over the Swiss territory and their persistency during the whole winter of 2009 - 2010 is considered the most likely predisposing factor for the onset of the epidemic...|$|R
40|$|Malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) {{include some}} of the world's most {{widespread}} and virulent pathogens. Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms these parasites use to invade and exploit hosts other than mice and primates is, however, extremely limited. It is therefore imperative to characterize transcriptome-wide gene expression from non-model malaria parasites and how this varies across host individuals. Here, we used high-throughput Illumina RNA-sequencing on blood from wild-caught <b>Eurasian</b> <b>siskins</b> experimentally infected with a clonal strain of the avian malaria parasite Plasmodium ashfordi (lineage GRW 2). By using a multi-step approach to filter out host transcripts, we successfully assembled the blood-stage transcriptome of P. ashfordi. A total of 11 954 expressed transcripts were identified, and 7 860 were annotated with protein information. We quantified gene expression levels of all parasite transcripts across three hosts during two infection stages – peak and decreasing parasitemia. Interestingly, parasites from the same host displayed remarkably similar expression profiles during different infection stages, but showed large differences across hosts, indicating that P. ashfordi may adjust its gene expression to specific host individuals. We further show {{that the majority of}} transcripts are most similar to the human parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and a large number of red blood cell invasion genes were discovered, suggesting evolutionary conserved invasion strategies between mammalian and avian Plasmodium. The transcriptome of P. ashfordi and its host-specific gene expression advances our understanding of Plasmodium plasticity and is a valuable resource as it allows for further studies analysing gene evolution and comparisons of parasite gene expression...|$|R
40|$|Birds use {{change in}} daylength {{during the year}} to time events during their annual cycles. Individual <b>Eurasian</b> <b>siskins</b> Carduelis spinus can breed and winter in widely {{separated}} areas in different years. Birds at different latitudes will experience different changes in photoperiod. So how does latitude affect photoperiodic control? Our aim {{in this study was}} to find whether siskins caught from the wild in Britain and exposed to different photoperiodic regimes, typical of widely separated latitudes, would differ in the subsequent timing and duration of their moults and associated processes. Siskins were caught in late February and early March, and initially kept outside on natural photoperiods. From the spring equinox (21 March), they were divided into three groups kept under photoperiodic regimes that simulated latitudes 40 º, 55 º and 70 º N respectively. All three groups showed highly significant subsequent changes in body mass, fat scores and cloacal protuberance size. Moult of the primary feathers started during June – August (mean 9 July), and lasted 61 - 99 days (mean 75 days). Birds that started to moult late in the season had shorter moult durations. All individuals showed lower mass and fat levels during moult than before or after moult. Crucially, {{there were no significant differences}} in the timing of these events between the three photoperiodic groups. Apparently these birds did not use prevailing absolute photoperiod or the prevailing rate of change in photoperiod to time moult-related seasonal events, but used instead some other feature of the annual photoperiod cycle or some form of interval timer linked to photoperiod...|$|R

40|$|Animals {{have to eat}} {{a certain}} amount of food every day to survive. Since trophic {{resources}} are usually found in exposed locations, animals are in risk of predation while feeding, and face the well known trade-off between predation and starvation risks. Animals may reduce predation risk by scanning for predators. However, an increase in vigilance entails an increase in exposure time to predators. Therefore, animals may increase food intake to reduce foraging bouts at the cost of vigilance or may do the opposite. Animals may also reduce predation risk without increasing vigilance by joining groups. However, when food items are concentrated in some defendable patches, individuals will fight to access them, leading to interference competition. Birds have developed different vigilance and foraging strategies to cope with all these trade-offs. These strategies can be adapted to the environmental conditions and type of predators, and will highly differ according to the genetic, phenotypic and ecological characters of the individuals. In this thesis I investigated how wintering <b>Eurasian</b> <b>siskins</b> (Carduelis spinus) adjusted their vigilance and foraging behaviour to predation risk and competition, and how this adjustment varied according to conspicuousness, residence status and personality of focal birds. I also studied how resident and transient siskins regulated their body mass to predation risk. In order to determine the differential effects of predation risk and competition on the behaviour of siskins, I designed an experiment with three feeders differing in predation risk and interference competition. I captured the siskins every week and marked them with aluminium rings (at first capture) and colour rings (if residents). From each bird, I measured body mass, wing length and plumage coloration cues. I filmed the siskins foraging at feeders from a hide. Then I analyzed the video recordings and selected a sample of birds at each feeder to study the effect of environmental factors, and selected pairs of birds belonging to different cohorts of sex, residence and personality to compare their vigilance and foraging behaviour. I also compared body mass of a large sample of residents and transients in two periods with and without avian predators. I found that siskins adjusted their vigilance behaviour specifically to the environmental conditions. Vigilance to predators, achieved by reducing inter-scan durations, was less costly in terms of food intake rate than vigilance to flockmates, achieved by increasing scan durations. Siskin males were more brightly coloured and detectable than females, and showed a vigilance system more oriented to predator detection, supporting (together with the correlation between coloration and vigilance in males) the view of a predation cost to conspicuousness. Resident and transient siskins showed a different vigilance and foraging strategy. Residents were more confident in vigilance to reduce predation risk while transients preferred to reduce foraging bout lengths. Transient siskins were in higher predation risk because of their vigilance and foraging behaviour, and this was related both to their unfamiliarity with the area and their subordination to residents. Proactive male siskins showed a vigilance system that improved their ability to detect predators as compared with reactive males, supporting the view of a behavioural compensation for their personality trait (and not the existence of behavioural carryovers). Resident siskin males adjusted their body mass to the presence of predators at the foraging area, something that transients could not do because of their site unfamiliarity. In general, dominant individuals (whether males, residents or proactive birds) showed a foraging behaviour that prioritized the reduction in predation risk and not the increase in food intake rate, as compared to subordinates. Dominance alone cannot account for our results, although it probably had some effect in all the comparisons. En aquesta tesi vaig estudiar el comportament de vigilància i d'alimentació de lluers hivernants a tres menjadores que diferien en risc de depredació i competència. Vaig determinar com els ocells ajustaven la vigilància a aquestes variables, i vaig comparar el comportament dels ocells pertanyents a diferents classes de sexe, estatus de residència i personalitat, per veure si adoptaven diferents estratègies. Els lluers van ajustar de manera diferent el seu comportament al risc de depredació i la competència. La vigilància dirigida als depredadors, assolida tot reduint la durada dels intervals entre vigilàncies, va resultar ser menys costosa en termes d'ingesta d'aliment que la vigilància a companys d'estol, assolida mitjançant l'increment de la durada de les vigilàncies. Els mascles de lluer van ser més brillants i fàcils de detectar que les femelles, i van mostrar un comportament més orientat a la detecció de depredadors, cosa que dóna suport (junt amb la correlació entre coloració i vigilància en mascles) a l'existència d'un cost de depredació associat a la conspicuïtat del plomatge. Els lluers residents van adoptar un sistema de vigilància que els exposava a menor risc de depredació que els transeünts. A més, a diferència d'aquests, van confiar sobretot en la vigilància a l'hora de reduir el risc de depredació. Aquestes diferències estarien relacionades tant amb el grau de coneixement de la zona com amb la dominància. Els mascles proactius van mostrar un sistema de vigilància que millorava la seva capacitat per detectar aviat els depredadors en comparació amb els mascles reactius, cosa que dóna suport a la idea d'una compensació comportamental del tret de personalitat. Els mascles residents van ajustar la seva massa corporal a la presència d'un depredador aeri a la zona, cosa que no van fer els transeünts segurament pel seu desconeixement del risc de depredació. En general, els individus dominants (mascles, residents o individus proactius) van mostrar un comportament d'alimentació que prioritzava la reducció del risc de depredació i no l'increment en la ingesta d'aliment. La dominància per sí sola no pot explicar els resultats de les comparacions, malgrat que pot tenir un cert efecte en totes elles...|$|R
