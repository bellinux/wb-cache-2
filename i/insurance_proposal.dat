40|$|ABSTRACT: According to Progressive reformers, {{private health}} {{insurance}} had failed to protect sick workers {{and needed to be}} replaced by compulsory government insurance. Their opponents claimed that sick pay benefits induced an absenteeism moral hazard that presaged disaster if states adopted Progressive <b>insurance</b> <b>proposals.</b> Progressives denied the existence of such a moral hazard. This essay uses worker and sickness fund surveys to test the veracity of these competing claims. It finds evidence of a sick pay moral hazard that was counterbalanced by medical control over absence duration. Overall, private sickness insurance funds capably provided income protection for covered workers...|$|R

50|$|As {{a result}} of such absurd results, and the {{potential}} for more, statutory reform introduced certain curtailments regarding remedies for breach of warranties. Section 63 of the Insurance Act (the governing legislation at the time) was amended in 1969. The effect of the amendment was that the insurer was not permitted to set aside a contract on the grounds of breach of an affirmative warranty unless the insurer could prove that the correctness of the statement (or representation or warranty) was material to the assessment of the risk at the time the policy was issued or renewed. The purpose of the amendment was to protect the insured against repudiations by insurers based on inconsequential inaccuracies or trivial misstatements in <b>insurance</b> <b>proposal</b> forms, even if they were warranted to be true.|$|E

40|$|A {{major theme}} in the {{literature}} on bank regulation is that greater reliance on market forces can help alleviate the moral hazard problem inherent in government sponsored deposit <b>insurance.</b> <b>Proposals</b> include minimum requirements on (1) uninsured subordinated debt financing (either fixed-term or with option-type features), and (2) private co-insurance on deposits. Such policies amount to delegating the responsibility for bank regulation to various private-sector claimholders. Our results show that, in general, such delegation (even if the claims include option-type features) is at best ineffective in lowering bank risk, at least within the present framework of deposit-taking institutions. We also show, however, that there are alternative mechanisms that will minimize regulatory costs, alleviate the moral hazard problem, and achieve first-best. But, the regulator (deposit insurer) must {{be an integral part of}} any solution; thus, such solutions are not attributable to market discipline. ...|$|R

Many {{features of the}} workers' compensation program parallel features of proposed mandated employer-paid health insurance plans.

In addition, higher insurance costs are found to have a negative but statistically insignificant effect on employment. The implied elasticity of labor demand from our results is about -. 50. ...|$|R

FORMULATION OF THE GAME The purpose of this paper, whose mathematical level is elementary, is to demonstrate how game theory can help the insurers to formulate and solve some of their underwriting problems. The framework adopted here is life insurance acceptance, but the concepts developed could be apphed to any other branch. The {{decision problem}} of acceptance or rejection of life <b>insurance</b> <b>proposals</b> can be formulated as a two-person on cooperative game the following way: player 1, P, is the insurer, while player 2, P 2, is the set of all the potential pohcy-hotders. The game is played many times, m fact each time a member of P. - fills m a proposal. suppose that tlfis person is either perfectly healthy (and should be accepted) or affected by a disease which should be detected and cause rejection. We shall assume for the moment hat the players possess only two strategies each. acceptance and rejection for P, health or disease for P 2. To be more realistic we should introduce a third pure strategy for P : acceptance of the proposer with a surcharge. To keep the analysis as simple as possible we shall delay the introduction of surcharges until sectmn 4. Consequently we can define a 2 x 2 payoff matrix for the insurer. • P 2 healthy ill. P proposer proposer acceptance A C rejection B D It iS evident that the worst outcome for the insurer is to accept a bad risk. Interpreting the payoffs as utilities for P 1, C should be the lowest figure. Clearly D> B: it is better for the insurer to reject a bad risk than a good risk. Also A must be greater than B.

It would be interesting to see an analysis of the controls in place to mitigate Multi-Media Liability (outlined in Table 1) such as review by a qualified attorney. Especially in light of the different nature of risks such as international cyber torts [38]. Future work could use an inductive approach to capture controls not included in our analysis.

30|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explore how well the current cyber {{insurance}} assessment process aligns with established network security best practice, as provided by the International Organization for Standardization and the International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 27002 and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls Version 6.0. Our approach investigates <b>insurance</b> <b>proposal</b> forms, a self-assessed questionnaire that applicants are expected to complete as an initial part of the cyber insurance application process. The key value of the results of our study is that they allow us to highlight neglected aspects of the assessment process. This can inform policy-makers by providing empirical evidence as to the success of cyber insurance in promoting established risk management standards. Further, it can help cyber insurers refine the assessment process grounded in security best practice.|$|E
30|$|A {{policy to}} address these issues and {{supplement}} UI for likely permanent job losers is wage-loss insurance (also called wage insurance) which (at least temporarily) subsidizes worker earnings upon reemployment when the wage they receive on their new job is less than that of their old job. Economists have noted several advantages to wage-loss insurance, such as the ability to better target benefits to those workers who face the most severe consequences of job loss (Kletzer and Litan [2001]; Kling [2006]). Although behavioral economics does not change that logic, it does identify additional advantages to wage-loss insurance. By manipulating the realized value of wages (especially if the wage-loss insurance payments show up directly in one’s regular paycheck) and making job offers more attractive, it averts to some degree the impacts of biased wage expectations and mitigates the effects of loss aversion. In the longer run, it may smooth the painful but sometimes necessary process of psychological adjustment to lower-wage employment. Consideration of wage-loss <b>insurance</b> <b>proposals</b> should weigh these behavioral advantages, and any demonstration projects or evaluations of wage-loss insurance, such as that currently being conducted as part of the U.S. Trade Adjustment Assistance program, should take care to test for the possible importance of these behavioral dimensions.|$|R
