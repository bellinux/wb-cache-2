5|$|After {{the death}} of Tiberius’ son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD, he became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD Tiberius removed himself from Rome and left {{administration}} largely in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> unscrupulous Praetorian prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro.|$|E
5|$|About {{ten minutes}} after the surrender, Pritchard heard rapid gunfire to the north. He left Davis and the {{captured}} men in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> 21-year-old adjutant. Once he had approached the gunfire, {{he realized it was}} the 4th Michigan and the 1st Wisconsin shooting at each other with Spencer repeating carbines, neither realizing who they were shooting at. Pritchard immediately ordered his men to stop and shouted to the 1st Wisconsin to identify the parties. In the five-minute skirmish, the 1st Wisconsin Cavalry had suffered eight men wounded, while the 4th Michigan Cavalry had lost two men killed and one wounded.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 640s, the Irish monk Fursey, having {{spent a year}} as a hermit, left East Anglia for Gaul. His monastery at Cnobheresburg (identified by some with Burgh Castle) was left in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> half-brother, Foillan. In 651, shortly after his departure, the heathen threat he had {{foreseen}} became a reality, when Foillan and his community were driven out by Penda's forces and Anna, who encountered Penda at Cnobheresburg, was exiled.|$|E
5|$|In 1513 James IV {{launched}} {{an invasion of}} England, attempting {{to take advantage of}} the absence of the English King Henry VIII. His forces met with disaster at Flodden Field; the King, many senior noblemen, and hundreds of soldiers were killed. As his son and successor, James V, was an infant, the government was again taken over by regents. James V led another disastrous war with the English in 1542, and his death in the same year left the Crown in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> six-day-old daughter, Mary I. Once again, a regency was established.|$|E
5|$|Jackson gave a 90-minute {{interview}} to Oprah Winfrey on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking {{of his childhood}} abuse at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought {{the bones of the}} Elephant Man, slept in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, and stated {{for the first time that}} he had vitiligo. Dangerous re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.|$|E

5|$|R v Hopley (more {{commonly}} known as the Eastbourne manslaughter) was an 1860 legal case in Eastbourne, England, concerning the death of 15-year-old Reginald Cancellor (some sources give his name as Chancellor and his age as 13 or 14) at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teacher, Thomas Hopley. Hopley used corporal punishment with the stated intention of overcoming what he perceived as stubbornness on Cancellor's part, but instead beat the boy to death.|$|E
5|$|The Survey Corps, {{losing all}} will {{to follow the}} current government, stage a {{successful}} rebellion to overthrow the monarchy, culminating {{with the death of}} Rod by the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own daughter, who becomes the new queen. It is then revealed that the Reiss Family was responsible for the creation of the walls 100 years ago using the Coordinate, which was stolen by Eren's father Grisha, who then transferred it to Eren's body by turning him into a Titan before allowing his son to devour him.|$|E
5|$|The {{first draft}} {{and part of}} the editing process was {{completed}} before Fleming's death and the manuscript had passed through the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> copy editor, William Plomer, but it was not as polished as other Bond stories. Much of the detail contained in the previous novels was missing, as this was often added by Fleming in the second draft. Publishers Jonathan Cape passed the manuscript to Kingsley Amis for his thoughts and advice on the story, although his suggestions were not subsequently used.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{interpretation}} of the authorship comes from the Septuagint superscription, ὲν χειρὶ ἀγγήλου αὐτοῦ, which {{can be read as}} either [...] "by the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> messenger" [...] or as [...] "by the <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> angel". The [...] "angel" [...] reading found an echo among the ancient Church Fathers and ecclesiastical writers, and even gave rise to the [...] "strangest fancies", especially among the disciples of Origen of Alexandria.|$|R

5|$|After David II's death, Robert II, {{the first}} of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was {{followed}} in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the regnal name Robert III. During Robert III's reign (1390–1406), actual power rested largely in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany. After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future James I, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son Murdoch.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{was born}} in a house called Southbourne, in the Edgbaston {{district}} of Birmingham, England, as the only son of the second marriage of Joseph Chamberlain, who later became Mayor of Birmingham, and who also served as a Cabinet minister. Joseph Chamberlain had fathered two children by his first marriage, Beatrice and Austen. Joseph's first wife, Harriet, died giving birth to Austen; Neville's mother, the former Florence Kenrick, also died in childbirth in 1875, when Neville was six years old. Florence Chamberlain left three daughters in addition to Neville and her stepchildren. Joseph Chamberlain, {{in the midst of a}} highly successful parliamentary career, was often away, leaving the household in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sister. Young Neville was sent away to school at age eight.|$|E
5|$|Dumouriez {{tried to}} put the {{frontier}} fortresses in the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> adherents but failed. Miaczinski botched the attempted seizure of Lille and was later executed. Dumouriez believed that he could control the regular infantry and cavalry regiments. On the other hand, the volunteers and the artillery remained devoted to the National Convention. In one incident, Dumouriez was fired on and nearly arrested by Louis-Nicolas Davout's volunteer battalion. He then made the mistake of being seen with an Austrian escort and the gunners took the lead in refusing to obey him. Seeing that his plot had fallen apart, Dumouriez defected to the Austrians on 5 April 1793. He was accompanied by the Duke of Chartres, Valence, several more generals and some cavalry. No longer bound by the previous agreement, Coburg prepared to invade France.|$|E

5|$|Edwin's {{expansion}} to {{the west}} may have begun early in his reign. There is firm evidence of a war waged in the early 620s between Edwin and Fiachnae mac Báetáin of the Dál nAraidi, king of the Ulaid in Ireland. A lost poem {{is known to have}} existed recounting Fiachnae's campaigns against the Saxons, and the Irish annals report the siege, or the storming, of Bamburgh in Bernicia in 623–624. This should presumably be placed in the context of Edwin's designs on the Isle of Man, a target of Ulaid ambitions. Fiachnae's death in 626, at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> namesake, Fiachnae mac Demmáin of the Dál Fiatach, and the second Fiachnae's death a year later in battle against the Dál Riata probably eased the way for Edwin's conquests in the Irish sea province.|$|E
5|$|In October, {{he helped}} Malaysia to beat India {{to defend the}} {{gold medal at the}} 2010 Commonwealth Games mixed team event, then he {{successfully}} defended his gold medal once again in the singles event a few days later. The following month he won a silver medal at the Asian Games. Despite beating reigning World Champion Chen Jin in the semi-final, Lee once again tasted defeat at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> great rival, Lin Dan, in the final. At season's end, he won his second consecutive Hong Kong Open title, and third consecutive Super Series Master Finals title, where the tournament was held in January 2011.|$|E
5|$|Philip the Arab {{was one of}} the few 3rd-century Roman {{emperors}} {{sympathetic to}} Christians, although his relationship with Christianity is obscure and controversial. Philip was born in Auranitis, an Arab district east of the Sea of Galilee. The urban and Hellenized centers of the region were Christianized in the early years of the 3rd century via major Christian centers at Bosra and Edessa; there is little evidence of Christian presence in the small villages of the region in this period, such as Philip's birthplace at Philippopolis. Philip served as praetorian prefect, commander of the Praetorian Guard, from 242; he was made emperor in 244. In 249, after a brief civil war, he was killed at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> successor, Decius.|$|E

5|$|Sasuke is the remarkable, sole {{survivor}} of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha. At age seven, he survived the massacre of his entire clan at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life only because he deemed Sasuke unworthy to kill. When first assigned to Team 7, Sasuke is antisocial, superior and unwilling to cooperate with his team members, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, but he eventually concedes that they are useful. Sasuke awakens his Sharingan, the inherited ability of the Uchiha clan to see through illusions (genjutsu), which allows him to see and learn imperceptible movements at a super-human rate. As time passes, Sasuke seeks out very strong opponents in order to convince himself that he is growing physically.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Plovdiv did {{not seem}} to have had a {{profound}} effect on Ivan's career, and he remained a royal favourite. In 1328, Ivan was tasked by Tsar Michael Shishman with the defence of the Great Palace of Constantinople, the residence of emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. Andronikos II, facing imminent defeat at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> grandson and co-emperor Andronikos III in a protracted civil war, was distrustful of his own guard, and had requested the assistance of Michael Shishman. The Bulgarian emperor sent Ivan the Russian along with 3,000 horsemen to Constantinople in aid. In the words of Byzantine historian Nikephoros Gregoras, the actual intentions of Michael Shishman were to use Ivan and his men as a Trojan Horse. In a suitable moment, the Bulgarian guard would arrest the emperor and take hold of the palace before allowing Michael Shishman with a large army and Tatar mercenaries into Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and {{there is reason to}} believe that dates in this source are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death may be related to his defeat suffered at the <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E
