Loomis had advanced to the railroad in front of the ridge where he skirmished with Walker's division. Buschbeck, followed by Matthies and then Raum were sent up the west slope of Tunnel Hill between Loomis and Corse. Cleburne's salient began to feel the pressure and it came close to breaking. Hardee fed in reinforcements from Stevenson's division, and Cleburne ordered a general counterattack. Charging down the hill at 4 p.m., the Confederates routed Sherman's men, who were too tired and low on ammunition to resist, and captured numerous Federal prisoners.|$|E

2500|$|However, Chinese laborers did {{far more}} than mix the {{volatile}} ingredients of nitroglycerin for the Central Pacific. Their hard work was also crucial {{in the construction of}} 15 tunnels along the railroad's line through the Sierra Nevada mountains. [...] These tunnels were about 32 feet (10 m) high [...] and 16 feet (5 m) wide. When tunnels with vertical shafts were dug to increase construction speed, and tunneling began {{in the middle of the}} tunnel, at first hand-powered derricks were used to help remove loose rocks up the vertical shafts. These derricks were later replaced with steam hoists as work progressed. By using vertical shafts, four faces of the tunnel could be worked at the same time, two in the middle and one at each end. The average daily progress in some tunnels was only 0.85 feet (26cm) a day per face, which was very slow, or 1.18 feet (36cm) daily according to historian George Kraus. J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that [...] "The Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tunnel</b> No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen and a [...] "boss/translator". A single foreman (often Irish) with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 men worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom, removing blasted material. When a gang was small or the men were needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going." [...] The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers. Once out of the Sierras, construction was much easier and faster. Horace Hamilton Minkler, track foreman for the Central Pacific, laid the last rail and tie before the Last Spike was driven.|$|E

50|$|One has to {{wade through}} the cave wherein water height varies from 4 feet to 5 feet to have {{a glimpse of the}} deity's image formed on the {{laterite}} wall at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel</b> which is architectural wonder. Bats can be seen hanging {{on the roof of the}} cave and flying throughout the tunnel. It is a wonder that no one has been harmed by the bats till date. People utter the words govinda-govinda and narasimha hari-hari with devotion as mantras. The end of the cave temple is the sanctum sanctorum which houses two deities - Lord Narasimha and a Shiva Linga which the demon Jharasura (Jalasura) had worshipped. Around eight people can stand and watch this spectacular sight as there is very little space in there. Others need to wait in the water for their turn. Since the water flows continuously and people walk in it, the water does not remain crystal clear. People carry kids into the temple on their shoulder.The water has sulphur in it and is said to have healing properties for people having skin problems.This temple is especially visited by many child seeking couples. As this is one of its kind temple, the overall experience can be thrilling & adventurous.|$|E

The Central Pacific Railroad (CPRR) is the former name of the railroad network built between California and Utah that formed part of the [...] "First Transcontinental Railroad" [...] in North America. About 12,000 such emigrant workers were employed as laborers by the Central Pacific Railroad representing 90 percent of the entire work force. J. O.

These mobile network devices form a dynamic topology i. e., mobile nodes move freely and quickly, {{in and out}} from network. These is no central control for co-coordinating these network device i. e. decentralized network. These devices control each other directly i. e, peer-to-peer connection. The dynamic nature of MANET makes it vulnerable to variety of security threats like wormhole attack, eavesdropping etc. The performance and reliability of the network is affected by making alteration in routing protocols by the attacker. Wormhole attack {{is a type of}} tunneling attack where an attacker at one <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunnel</b> attracts data packets from one hop neighbors and transmits these data packets to another attacker of the tunnel which delivers these data packets to destination node.
