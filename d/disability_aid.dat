The aim of this survey was to analyse and compare the income and expenditure patterns of households containing a disabled adult with other households. To provide a comparative measure of the extra costs of disability to complement the subjective measures used in the OPCS Survey of Disabled Adults in Private Households (SN: 2577, GN: 33214). Main Topics : Disability; income; expenditure; benefit receipt; employment; costs of disability; standard of living; <b>disability</b> <b>aids.</b> Disabled adult respondents to the continuous Family Expenditure Survey (FES) between July 1986 and June 1987 were given an additional interview after participation in the FES. Detailed information on their disability was collected, to analyse in conjunction with information on income and expenditure from the main FES.

40|$|Prioritering av vård väcker starka känslor bland många människor. Prioritering likställs ofta med nedskärningar av offentlig service. Ändå är prioritering det mest naturliga man kan tänka sig inom ett hälso- och sjukvårdsystem som finansieras kollektivt genom skatter. När prioritering sker öppet blir frågan dock känslig i ett skattefinansierat sjukvårdsystem eftersom solidariteten mellan medborgare med olika medicinska behov sätts på prov. En sjukvård organiserad efter den generella principen rymmer inslag av omfördelning, mellan frisk och sjuk, mellan lite och mycket sjuk, mellan rik och fattig och ofta mellan ung och gammal. När sjukvårdens möjligheter expanderar utan att samhällets ekonomi riktigt hänger med i svängarna kommer ett sådant system lätt i obalans. Frågan blir då hur mycket solidariteten tål – denna problematik möter våra politiker. Hur mycket omfördelning går egentligen att visa upp för medborgarna. I rapporten undersöks tre fall med anknytning till prioritering. De är hämtade ur vardagen inom svensk hälso- och sjukvård under senare år och illustrerar en problematik som {{kommer att}} bli mer och mer påtaglig. Rapporten pekar på både möjligheter och problem. I rapporten redovisas resultaten från delstudie 2 i projektet ”Svåra beslut vid prioriteringar i hälso- och sjukvård – kan ’rättvisa processer’ stärka legitimiteten?” Projektet har erhållit finansiering genom Det nationella forskningsprogrammet om sjukvårdens förändringar, Tema 2 : Prioriteringar i praktiken (bakom forskningsprogrammet står Landstingsförbundet och ett antal landsting och regioner). Författaren riktar ett tack till finansiärerna samt till alla personer inom tre icke namngivna landsting (eller motsvarande) som frikostigt delat med sig av erfarenheter, kunskap och åsikter. In {{the health care}} sector, {{priority}} setting often {{takes the form of}} rationing (i. e. waiting lists) or even the exclusion of treatment for which there are inadequate funds.   This  situation  is  notoriously  difficult  for  decision-makers  to  handle, whether they are clinicians or elected politicians. In this study we have used a well-known ethical framework for "fair" priority setting (accountability for reasonableness) to analyse three cases drawn from the regional  health  care  service  in Sweden.   The  aim  was  to investigate  to what extent "procedural justice" can be applied to "real-life" cases of priority setting and rationing. The cases used in the study are cosmetic surgery, the allocation of <b>disability</b> <b>aids</b> and infertility treatment (IVF). In addition, the local politicians responsible for health care in three local authorities were asked to express their views on issues such as legitimacy and fairness in relation to priority setting. It is important to take into consideration that priority setting in the public health care system consists of at least four different processes, i. e. those that can be regarded as internal (within the health care delivery system itself and between the delivery system and political decision-makers)   and those that are external (between the delivery system and patients and between the public provider of health care and the general public). The intention was not to grade the three cases with regard to the "fairness" of the  priority-setting  process.   Nevertheless,  it  can  be  noted  that  in  case  A (cosmetic surgery) very little focus was given to the element of "publicity" i. e. information  to  or  dialogue  with  patients  and  the  general  public  about  the priority-setting process. In case B (new policy for <b>disability</b> <b>aids)</b> we noted that the internal legitimacy was far better, although the medical staff responsible for prescribing <b>disability</b> <b>aids</b> found it difficult to develop their own procedures for priority setting. The final case C, (infertility treatment) represents the traditional way to handle the gap between demand and supply in the public sector. In the local authority studied, the political level of decision-makers  had delegated all the  priority-setting  decisions  to  the  clinical  level,  but  instead  of  adopting  a "muddling  through  strategy",  the  clinicians  in  charge  had  spent  time  on developing procedures for disseminating information to patients (publicity) and for ensuring fairness (equal rights). The interviews indicate that Swedish local politicians responsible for health care have a relatively good understanding of  the problems related to limited resource and the need for priority  setting.   They are trying  to find new solutions,  and above all to develop a better dialogue with the general public. Most politicians appreciate  the  importance  of  "internal  legitimacy"  i. e.   the  interrelationship between the different decision-making levels within the local authority, and the need for a clear-cut message to patients and the public. On the other hand, the politicians are not in agreement about how the responsibility for communicating the information about priority-setting should be divided between the clinicians and themselves...|$|R

40|$|With this chapter, {{the authors}} have tried first of all to give {{visibility}} to recent models and principles that are most frequently mentioned in the literature about the difficulties faced by people with disabilities {{in their daily lives}} and, specifically, in their careers. The life design approach can easily help unifying the two worlds of disability and career counseling, which have ignored each other and proceeded along parallel trajectories for too long. Not only will research on inclusion of people with disabilities and on career counseling benefit from this “contamination”, but more importantly, so too will all of those people who experience difficulties and barriers in designing their future. The most important merit universally recognized in previously reported models and studies on disabilities is having placed in the foreground the possibilities and the future of people with disabilities, together with the components of health and strengths. Consequently, the importance of life, education, and work context has been emphasized (Soresi, 2007). A significant change in the assessment modalities and, subsequently, in the intervention planning is required next (Soresi et al., 2013). Although some processes seem to unify diverse situations of impairment or disability, it is worth remembering that even for people showing the same type of injury or <b>disability,</b> <b>aids</b> and supports are markedly heterogeneous and should be found within the same range of assistances that the life design approach may offer to everyone. In doing so, special attention should be devoted to the analysis of positive constructs such as hope, adaptability, and preparedness, equally predictive of the quality of life experience of people with or without a disability (Buchanan & Lopez, 2013; Rand & Shea, 2013). Although research is still needed, these findings are promising both for the way diverse individuals with disabilities may think their future and for the benefits deriving from approaching life design counselors...|$|R

Construction is traditionally reliant on labour and is a transient process. The reliance on a poorly educated transient labour force makes the industry particularly susceptible to the dynamics, spread and impact of HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB. The susceptibility is exacerbated by the socio-economic conditions most workers are exposed to. The combating of HIV/AIDS, STDs and TB requires a multistakeholder approach encapsulating interventong other: clients; communities; contractors; government; industry associations; media; tertiary institutions, and unions.
