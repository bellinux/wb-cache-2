25|$|On the balcony, Belle assures the Beast he'll live {{but they}} both know she is {{helpless}} to save him. She begs him not to leave her because she has found home in his company ("End Duet"), but despite this, he dies; Belle sobs on his body and says she loves him just before the last rose petal falls. A transformation takes place ("Transformation") and the Beast is alive and human once more. Though Belle doesn't recognize {{him for the first}} time, she looks <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> sees the Beast within and they kiss. The two of them sing of how their lives have changed because of love and they dance once more as the company, now changed back to their human form, gathers in the ballroom ("Beauty and the Beast (Reprise)").|$|E
25|$|During {{dinner with}} Anderson, Belle Gunness {{raised the issue}} of her mortgage. Anderson agreed that he would pay this off if they decided to wed. Late that night, while {{sleeping}} in the guest room, Anderson awoke startled to see Belle standing over him, peering <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> holding a candle in her hand. He later stated that the expression on her face was so sinister and murderous, that he let out a loud yell and she immediately ran from the room without uttering a single word. Left feeling terrified and uncomfortable, Anderson believed that Gunness intended to murder him. He quickly jumped out of bed and threw on his clothes. He fled the house without saying goodbye. As he ran away, he kept looking over his shoulder the entire time, fearing Gunness would come chasing after him. When he finally made it to La Porte, he got on the first train headed to Missouri. He never returned for his belongings, nor did he ever speak to Gunness again.|$|E
500|$|Thor {{is again}} the main {{character}} in the poem Hymiskviða, where, after the gods have been hunting and have eaten their prey, they have an urge to drink. They [...] "sh the twigs" [...] and interpret what they say. The gods decide that they would find suitable cauldrons at Ægir's home. Thor arrives at Ægir's home and finds him to be cheerful, looks <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> tells him that he must prepare feasts for the gods. Annoyed, Ægir tells Thor that the gods must first bring to him a suitable cauldron to brew ale in. The gods search but find no such cauldron anywhere. However, Týr tells Thor {{that he may have}} a solution; east of Élivágar lives Hymir, and he owns such a deep kettle.|$|E

2500|$|McCain {{has been}} one of the {{foremost}} Senate critics of Russian President Vladimir Putin: [...] "I looked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> saw three letters: a K, a G and a B", referring to Putin's membership in the KGB during the Soviet era. He has said that Putin is [...] "going to cause a lot of difficulties" [...] and that he is [...] "trying to reassert the Russian empire." [...] In January 2007, McCain said that he thought Putin was using Russia's energy sources as a political weapon.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997 {{he tried}} to help the Second Division {{football}} club Exeter City win a crucial end of season game by placing [...] "energy-infused" [...] crystals behind the goals at Exeter's ground (Exeter lost the game 5–1); he was appointed co-chairman of the club in 2002. The club was relegated to the Football Conference in May 2003, where it remained for five years. He has since severed formal ties with the club. He had also been involved with Reading F.C. and claimed in 2002 that he had helped them to avoid relegation by getting the club's supporters to look <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> say [...] "win, Reading, win". Reading manager Alan Pardew however dismissed Geller's role in the club's survival - which was achieved thanks to a draw in the crucial match rather than a Reading victory - stating [...] "as {{soon as we get}} a bit of joy, thanks to all the hard work and efforts of my staff and players, he suddenly comes out of the blue and tries to claim the limelight." ...|$|E
60|$|Comprehension came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{the natural}} man in him peeped through the polish.|$|E

60|$|Mr Dedalus screwed <b>his</b> glass <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> stared hard at {{both his}} sons. Stephen mumbled his bread without {{answering}} his father's gaze.|$|R
60|$|Young Leavenworth whisked <b>his</b> glass <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> Mr. Seguin {{put down}} his roll to behold the phenomenon. Poor Debby! her first step had been a wrong one.|$|R
60|$|A look of fear came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> he sank {{his face}} into his hands.|$|E
60|$|Tears {{had come}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> Gyp watched them, moved, troubled, but still deeply mistrusting.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{her face}} had once more the {{beautiful}} ingenuousness of a child.|$|E
60|$|Douglas {{returned}} his greeting cordially. His vis-a-vis drew the menu towards him and studied it with interest. Setting it down he screwed a single eyeglass <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> beamed over at Douglas.|$|R
5000|$|One {{example in}} a story from Georgia, {{describes}} two brothers trapped in the cave of [...] "One-eye". They take the wooden spit from One-eye’s fire, heat it up, stab it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> escape.|$|R
50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Eric Welch and premiered in June 2015. The video opens with a profile close-up of Farr as the camera goes <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> shows Farr inside a glass box as it fills with water.|$|R
60|$|Harry's countenance fell; {{tears came}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> he gazed on Lady Vandeleur with a tender reproach.|$|E
60|$|He {{looks at}} the trooper until tears come <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> then he {{looks at the}} sleet and snow again.|$|E
60|$|A little mocking gleam crept <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> I {{instantly}} {{realized that}} he was looking upon me as a rather impertinent child.|$|E
6000|$|... "The errant damosel," [...] said Buckingham, {{looking at}} Charles {{with as much}} {{intelligence}} as etiquette permitted him to throw <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> then turning it towards Alice, as she still held by Julian's arm, [...] "is resolved not to mistake her road a second time. She has chosen a sufficient guide." ...|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> bloodshot <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> cast a swift {{glance at}} the decanter.|$|R
60|$|He {{got up on}} {{his knees}} and faced her. She looked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> steadily, <b>and</b> her large mouth trembled with a smile.|$|R
60|$|For a brief instant Dan Baxter's {{face was}} a study. Then a crafty look came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> he drew himself up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{that the}} heavier mallet?" [...] she asked, and stood before him looking <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> {{weighing}} a mallet in either hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{dropped her}} arms; her face twitched. She looked {{straight}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> seemed incapable of pronouncing a word. He frowned at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a sad disadvantage, madam," [...] says Fizgig, gravely; [...] "and I {{recommend}} you and Brough here, {{who are coming}} out in the great world, to have some lessons; or at least get up a couple of dozen phrases, and introduce them into your conversation here and there. I suppose, sir, you speak it commonly at the office, Mr. What you call it?" [...] And Mr. Fizgig put <b>his</b> glass <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> looked at me.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Audley {{still looked}} rather too bewildered {{to be really}} the man the empire wants; none of the company could say {{anything}} except the man of wood--Colonel Pound--who seemed galvanised into an unnatural life. He rose rigidly from his chair, leaving all the rest sitting, screwed <b>his</b> eyeglass <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> <b>and</b> spoke in a raucous undertone {{as if he had}} half-forgotten how to speak. [...] "Do you mean," [...] he said, [...] "that somebody has stolen our silver fish service?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know whether}} I don't like you better so," [...] exclaimed she, looking <b>into</b> <b>his</b> clear <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> fine open face, full of resolution, not of shame.|$|R
60|$|Surprise flashed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{was gone}} {{as quickly as}} it had come. His thin lips parted in a smile, whose meaning was inscrutable.|$|E
60|$|She laughed softly. She {{was looking}} full <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>and</b> yet {{he could not}} tell whether she was angry with him or only amused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Write yourself, Georgy, I can't write," [...] says Harry, digging {{his fists}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> {{smearing}} {{over the whole}} composition, bad spelling and all, with his elbows.|$|E
60|$|On {{the next}} morning the last of the Folwells made <b>his</b> sortie <b>into</b> the city that {{sheltered}} the last Harkness. The Colt was thrust beneath his coat and secured by a narrow leather belt; the hunting-knife hung between his shoulder-blades, with the haft an inch below his coat collar. He knew this much--that Cal Harkness drove an express wagon somewhere in that town, and that he, Sam Folwell, had come to kill him. And as he stepped upon the sidewalk the red came <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> the feud-hate <b>into</b> <b>his</b> heart.|$|R
60|$|The fourth at {{the table}} was Ned Carrington, who had been first {{secretary}} at an Embassy, and he had many stories to tell of ambassadors who spoke commercial American and asked royalties after their wives. Some one had said about {{him that he was}} the only edition of the Almanach de Gotha that included the United States. He somewhat resembled a golden seal emerging from a cold bath, {{and from time to time}} screwed an eyeglass <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> <b>and</b> made a careful survey of Mrs. Grenfell's guests.|$|R
60|$|The consternation {{of the boy}} was so evident and so {{far beyond}} Mr. Hamlin's {{expectation}} that he instantly halted him, gazed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> shifting <b>eyes,</b> <b>and</b> gave a long whistle.|$|R
