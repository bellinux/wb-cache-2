Central midfielder Poyet was {{also included in}} the starting line-up to join captain Dennis Wise, after returning from a damaged cruciate ligament.

5|$|He was {{in great}} {{form for the}} Belgian spring classics, but a fall and {{material}} malfunction kept him from playing {{a part in the}} final of both the E3 Harelbeke and Gent–Wevelgem.

5|$|Prior to the match, Queen's Park and Blackburn Rovers had met {{on three}} occasions; {{each time the}} game ended in a draw.

They had been awarded the Scottish Cup {{earlier in the season}} after Vale of Leven declined to participate in the <b>final</b> <b>due</b> to illnesses suffered by a number of their players.|$|E

5|$|After {{five seasons}} with Lazio, Nedvěd was speculatively linked to several clubs (including Manchester United and Chelsea) {{before moving to}} Juventus in July 2001 for 75billionlire (€38.7million by fixed {{exchange}} rate). At Juventus, he replaced Zinedine Zidane, who had transferred to Real Madrid that summer. Nedvěd was a regular on Juventus' 2001–02 and 2002–03 Scudetto-winning teams. Although he was {{a substantial part of}} the club's championship season in 2003, he was also the subject of controversy. Nedvěd quit the Italian Footballers' Association in protest of the union's limit on non-European Union (EU) players; his native Czech Republic did not become an EU member until 2004. Although he was instrumental in leading Juventus to the 2003 UEFA Champions League final against Milan, he had to sit out the <b>final</b> <b>due</b> to an accumulation of yellow cards after his semi-final booking for a foul on Real Madrid midfielder Steve McManaman.|$|E

Hasselbaink was a doubt for the <b>final</b> <b>due</b> to a hamstring injury, and was substituted on 68 minutes at the Millennium Stadium as Chelsea lost 2–0 to rivals Arsenal.

5|$|Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matić was {{suspended}} for the <b>final,</b> <b>due</b> to a two-match ban he received for pushing over Burnley's Ashley Barnes in a league match on 21 February 2015. Another central midfielder for the club, John Obi Mikel, missed the match through a knee injury. Due to Matić's absence, Kurt Zouma – usually a central defender – moved into defensive midfield, with Gary Cahill introduced into Zouma's previous position. Chelsea made four other changes from their draw with Burnley: Petr Čech started in goal in place of Thibaut Courtois, César Azpilicueta at left-back instead of Filipe Luís, and Ramires and Willian came into the midfield {{at the expense of}} Juan Cuadrado and Oscar. Chelsea set up with a three-man attack, with Eden Hazard and Willian wide of Diego Costa.|$|E

He spent one season at the Stadium of Light before returning to Stoke in 2008. He became a vital member of Tony Pulis' squad as Stoke established themselves in the Premier League. He scored the winning goal in the FA Cup quarter-final against West Ham United but missed out on both the semi-final and the <b>final</b> <b>due</b> to a knee injury.
