40|$|Abstract—Fuel {{cells have}} the {{potential}} to solve several major challenges in the global energy economy: dependence on petroleum imports, degradation of air quality, and greenhouse gas emissions. Using catalyst-based <b>reformer</b> technology, <b>hydrogen</b> for fuel cells can be derived from infrastructure fuels such as gasoline, diesel, and natural gas. Platinum is one catalyst that is known to be very effective in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reformers.</b> Reformer size can be reduced when there is more efficient catalyst loading onto the substrate. In this experimental work, platinum was loaded onto-alumina coated substrates by plasma-polymerization followed by heat treatment. Vapor from a platinum-containing organic precursor was converted to plasma and deposited onto the substrate. The plasma-polymerized film was then calcined to drive off organic material, leaving behind a catalyst-loaded substrate. The plasma-polymerized organic film and the final heat-treated catalyst-loaded substrate surface were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and impedance spectroscopy. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to detect the presence of the catalyst on the substrate.

40|$|The {{deposition}} of carbon from carbonaceous gaseous environments is prevalent in many chemical and petrochemical processes such as, hydrogen-, ammonia-, and methanol-reforming systems, syngas production systems, and iron-ore reduction plants. One {{of the major}} consequences of carbon deposition is the degradation of structural materials by a phenomenon known as ''metal dusting''. There are two major issues of importance in metal dusting. First is formation of coke and subsequent {{deposition of}} coke on metallic structural components. Second is the initiation and subsequent propagation of metal dusting degradation of the structural alloy. In the past, we reported on the mechanism for metal dusting of Fe- and Ni-base alloys. In this report, we present metal dusting data on both Fe- and Ni-base alloys after exposure in high and atmospheric pressure environments that simulate the gas chemistry in operating <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reformers.</b> We have also measured the progression of pits by measuring the depth {{as a function of}} exposure time for a variety of Fe- and Ni-base structural alloys. We have clearly established the role of transport of iron in forming a non-protective spinel phase in the initiation process and presence of carbon transfer channels in the oxide scale for the continued propagation of pits, by nano-beam X-ray analysis using the advance photon source (APS), Raman scattering, and SEM/EDX analysis. In this report, we have developed correlations between weight loss and pit progression rates and evaluated the effects of carbon activity, system pressure, and alloy chemistry, on weight loss and pit propagation. To develop pit propagation data for the alloys without incurring substantial time for the initiation of pits, especially for the Ni-base alloys that exhibit incubation times of thousands of hours, a pre-pitting method has been developed. The pre-pitted alloys exhibited pit propagation rates similar to those of materials tested without pre-pitting. We have also developed a substantial body of metal-dusting data on the performance of Fe- and Ni-base weldments. During the course of this project, we have developed new Ni-base and Cu-base alloys and tested them in simulated metal dusting environments at 1 atm and at high pressures. Results clearly showed superior performance of both classes of alloys in resisting metal dusting. We also developed an approach to mitigate metal dusting by performing an intermediate oxidation step for extending the life of alloys in which metal dusting has initiated and pits are in progression.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the utilization of}} a PEM fuel cell as a main power source in a distributed generation system, particularly for future electric vehicle applications. One of the main weak points of the fuel cell is its time constants dominated by temperature and fuel delivery system (pumps, valves, and in some cases, a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reformer).</b> As a result, fast load demand will cause a high voltage drop in a short time, recognized as a fuel starvation phenomenon. Therefore, to employ a PEM fuel cell in dynamic applications, the electrical system must have at least an auxiliary power source to improve system performance when electrical loads at a dc bus demand high energy in a short time. The possibilities to use a supercapacitor or battery bank as an auxiliary source with a fuel cell main source is presented in detail. The very fast power response and high specific power of a supercapacitor or high specific energy of battery can complement the slower power output of the main source to produce the compatibility and performance characteristics needed in a load. The studies of two hybrid power systems for vehicle applications: a fuel cell/battery and a fuel cell/ supercapacitor hybrid power sources are explained. Experimental results in laboratory authenticate that energy storage devices can assist the fuel cell to meet the vehicle power demand and help achieve a better performance...|$|E

40|$|Partial {{oxidation}} (POX), catalytic {{steam reforming}} (CSR) and autothermal reforming (ATR) {{are some of}} the main processes widely used to produce <b>hydrogen.</b> Autothermal <b>Reformer</b> also defines as a steam reforming reaction and a partial oxidation reaction that take place over microscopic distances at the same catalytic site thus avoiding complex heat exchanging. The steam reforming reaction absorbs part of the heat generated by the partial oxidation process reaction, limiting the maximum temperature in the reactor. For a catalytically ignited autothermal reformer system, catalysts need to be preheated to its light- off or catalytic ignition temperature before the reactions can be self-sustained. The objective of this research is to come out with the practical method for starting-up an autothermal reformer system in the shortest possible preheating time. A catalytic burner has been proposed to supply the required energy for pre- heating the autothermal reactor. This proposed catalytic burner will use available hydrogen and natural gas as fuel and platinum on the honeycomb monolith surface as catalyst. Platinum-type catalyst can readily reacts hydrogen with air under room temperature to produce heats that aid the catalyst to reach light off temperature. The energy from catalytic combustion will be used to preheat the autothermal reformer. Ceramic honeycomb monolith with platinum based washcoat will be used a burner system. The results will then be further verified using CFD-ACE code and as well as compared with that of conventional preheating methods such as electrical coil...|$|R

The pure hydrogen production rate at steady state conditions was modeled by means of a static model based on the Sieverts' law. Finally, a dynamic model was developed under ideal gas law assumptions to simulate the dynamics of pure hydrogen production rate {{in the case of the}} fuel flow rate or the operating pressure set point adjustment (transient state) at isothermal conditions. The simulation of fuel flow rate change dynamics was more essential compared to the pressure change one, as the system responded much faster to such an adjustment.

40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{and cost of}} changing from a fossil-fuel-based society to a hydrogen-based society {{are considered to be}} extensive obstacles to the introduction of fuel cell vehicles (FCVs). The absence of existing profitable refueling stations {{has been shown to be}} one of the major barriers. This paper investigates methods for calculating an optimal transition from a gasoline refueling station to future methane and hydrogen combined use with an on site small-scale reformer for methane. In particular, we look into the problem of matching the hydrogen capacity of a single refueling station to an increasing demand. Based on an assumed future development scenario, optimal investment strategies are calculated. First, a constant utilization of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reformer</b> is assumed in order to find the minimum hydrogen production cost. Second, when considerations such as periodic maintenance are taken into account, optimal control is used to concurrently find both a short term equipment variable utilization for one week and a long term strategy. The result is a minimum hydrogen production cost of $ 4 - 6 /kg, depending on the number of reinvestments during a 20 year period. The solution is shown to yield minimum hydrogen production cost for the individual refueling station, but the solution is sensitive to variations in the scenario parameters.

In {{the manufacturing process}} of pipe bends {{it is difficult to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius of the pipe bend and thinning on the outer radius of the pipe bend. The cross section of the bend also becomes non circular due to bending process; this tends to cause ovality in pipe bends. The acceptability of pipe bends is based on the induced level of shape imperfections considered. Ovality is the shape imperfection considered for the analysis which varies from 0 to 8 %. This study is an attempt to analyze the ovality effect of inlet pigtail bend, INCOLOY 800 ASTM B 407 material which is used in <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reformer</b> application. The finite element method is used to model and analyze a stand-alone, long-radius pipe bend with 42. 2 mm nominal diameter and a 250 mm bend radius with specified length. A parametric study was performed in which the bend factor is taken as 1. 90 to 2. 07. Internal pressure is incremented for each model, until it reaches 27 x 108 N/mm 2. During this process, the bend undergoes plastic instability due to pressure and thermal effect.

40|$|The modern {{refinery}} {{and steel}} industries {{are facing a}} tremendous challenge with the rapid increase {{of the cost of}} energy due to high demand for production. To be competitive in the period of globalization, it is necessary to upgrade the design of equipment and optimize the operational parameters. Because of the complicated process in the production line of industries, it is impossible to optimize based on direct measurement or observation. Therefore, a compelling, non-intrusive, virtual modeling technique involving Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Virtual Reality (VR) Visualization has been applied to provide cost-effective solutions. Firstly, CFD and VR Visualization have been employed to develop a model for steady, multiphase and non-premixed combustion phenomenon in several refining and steel making processes in this course of this study. By utilizing the multiphase and non-premixed combustion model, the CFD simulation and VR Visualization of a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>reformer</b> furnace provides insight into the optimization of the system design. Secondly, a study of a Venturi scrubber including a steady multiphase model also has been studied by using CFD simulation and VR Visualization.

The parametric studies present the reason of the wear problem and optimized design thus improving the efficiency of the Venturi scrubber. Thirdly, CFD application about correction of reversed orifice plate measuring instrument was also involved in the course of work.

40|$|Pre-combustion capture is an {{important}} CCS technology. Pre-combustion capture of CO 2 incurs less of an energy penalty than current post combustion technologies. For this type of reforming to be competitive for power generation, excellent operability and robustness is required. Important for this is {{a thorough understanding of}} the system dynamics and a robust control structure design. Therefore the dynamic modelling and control design of two pre-combustion power cycles, i. e., a <b>hydrogen</b> membrane <b>reformer</b> (HMR) based power cycle and an autothermal reforming (ATR) based power cycle, are studied. The first contribution of this thesis is to develop new mathematical models of the two novel pre-combustion power cycles based on first principles. The precombustion gas power cycle plants consist of reformers and separation units, compressors, gas and steam turbines and a heat recovery system. Analysis of dynamic models at an early stage of design can give valuable information to control structure design as well as to further process design. Dynamic behaviours of the critical reactors as well as the whole plants are investigated based on these models. The simulations are focused on how different process inputs affect the important variables in the system, e. g., SOT, S/C ratio, TIT, GT power, ST power. The simulations show that both the steady state and dynamic behaviour of the plant depend strongly on the flow rates of feed streams. Due to the complexity of the system and the nonlinearities of the dynamic responses, a systematic approach to control structure design is advocated. The second contribution is to design the control structures of the two power cycles by a systematic approach. To determine the control structure, an economic objective is chosen, the degrees of freedoms and constraints are found, and the possible disturbances are assumed. The controlled variables are selected by using self-optimizing control. The results show that the control structure depends on the CO 2 price. Finally, the control structures with well-tuned PI controllers and feedforward controllers are simulated and evaluated. The results show that he designed control structure can result in a stable system and that PI controllers can make the controlled variables converge to desired values. However, some constraints may be violated during the transient period. The third contribution is to implement MPC controllers with state estimation for the HMR power cycle. The dynamic simulation reveals that constraint violations may be encountered during operation of the HMR power cycle. Therefore, an MPC controller may be used to handle the constraints systematically. Some selected control loops in the control structure of HMR power cycle is replaced with MPC controllers, and the dynamic simulation results are shown. The results show that because of the nonlinearities, the MPC controllers give a better dynamic behaviour than PI with feedforward controllers for given disturbances. PI with feedforward controllers are easy to implement and do not require much information about the system. However, they may give larger overshoot or constraint violation. MPC controllers can overcome these drawbacks and provide a smoother dynamic performance. Hence, for the HMR power cycle studied here, MPC controllers are recommended above PI controllers. Finally, the last contribution is the study on benchmarking the two power cycles. The dynamic responses and control structures are compared. The dynamic responses of the two systems have lots in common. The main differences are due to different syngas generators, different operating conditions, and process structure. The designed control structures for both systems give rapid response to load changes and exhibit good load-following capabilities. However, the control structure of the ATR power cycle has a lower complexity as compared to the HMR power cycle. PhD i teknisk kybernetikkPhD in Engineering Cybernetic...|$|R
40|$|The {{project was}} started in April 2005 with the {{objective}} to meet the DOE target of delivered hydrogen of <$ 1. 50 /gge, which was later revised by DOE to $ 2 -$ 3 /gge range for hydrogen to be competitive with gasoline as a fuel for vehicles. For small, on-site hydrogen plants being evaluated at the time for refueling stations (the 'forecourt'), {{it was determined that}} capital cost is the main contributor to the high cost of delivered hydrogen. The concept of this project was to reduce the cost by combining unit operations for the entire generation, purification, and compression system (refer to Figure 1). To accomplish this, the Fluid Bed Membrane Reactor (FBMR) developed by MRT was used. The FBMR has hydrogen selective, palladium-alloy membrane modules immersed in the reformer vessel, thereby directly producing high purity hydrogen in a single step. The continuous removal of pure <b>hydrogen</b> from the <b>reformer</b> pushes the equilibrium 'forward', thereby maximizing the productivity with an associated reduction in the cost of product hydrogen. Additional gains were envisaged by the integration of the novel Metal Hydride Hydrogen Compressor (MHC) developed by Ergenics, which compresses hydrogen from 0. 5 bar (7 psia) to 350 bar (5, 076 psia) or higher in a single unit using thermal energy. Excess energy from the reformer provides up to 25 % of the power used for driving the hydride compressor so that system integration improved efficiency. Hydrogen from the membrane reformer is of very high, fuel cell vehicle (FCV) quality (purity over 99. 99 %), eliminating the need for a separate purification step. The hydride compressor maintains hydrogen purity because it does not have dynamic seals or lubricating oil. The project team set out to integrate the membrane reformer developed by MRT and the hydride compression system developed by Ergenics in a single package. This was expected to result in lower cost and higher efficiency compared to conventional hydrogen production technologies. The overall objective was to develop an integrated system to directly produce high pressure, high-purity hydrogen from a single unit, which can meet the DOE cost H 2 cost target of $ 2 - $ 3 /gge when mass produced. The project was divided into two phases with the following tasks and corresponding milestones, targets and decision points.

40|$|The {{refineries}} {{need for}} hydrogen in hydrotreatment is increasing due to stricter environmental legislation {{and changes in}} product demand. At {{the same time the}} production of <b>hydrogen</b> in the <b>reformers</b> within the refineries is sinking. This has led to an increased attention on hydrogen management within refineries. Mongstad refinery is also experiencing this, and has estimated an increased need for hydrogen some time in the period 2011 to 2016. Mongstad refinery will start operating the natural gas based combined heat and power plant, Energiverk Mongstad, in 2010. Within 2014, full scale CO 2 capture will be in place. The refinery has indicated plans for yet another combined heat and power plant. This leads to a possibility of synergy effects by integration between the refinery, Energiverk Mongstad and the new plant. The thesis studies three options to provide the refinery with hydrogen and gaining synergy effects by integrating the hydrogen production with a new combined heat and power plant. The first option is to recycle the fuel gas stream in the refinery. The total potential for recycling hydrogen from this stream is 2. 4 ton/h of hydrogen. The fuel gas will be utilized in Energiverk Mongstad, and the hydrogen in the stream will be recovered by use of membrane process. The increased need for hydrogen is however estimated to be 4 ton/h and the recycling from the fuel gas stream is seen as a supplementary solution. The two latter options are two different configurations of the new combined heat and power plants for heat, power and hydrogen production in addition to CO 2 capture. The first alternative is a pre combustion CO 2 capture solution where the natural gas is reformed by auto thermal reforming into a synthesis gas. The CO 2 is removed prior to combustion. The plant has an export of 4 ton/h hydrogen before the rest of the synthesis gas is utilized for power production. The second alternative is based on conventional technology where the natural gas is combusted directly and the CO 2 is removed post combustion. This case is included with an external hydrogen production unit. Both cases are projected to deliver 120 MW low pressure steam for CO 2 capture in Energiverk Mongstad The two combined heat and power plants are modelled and simulated in HYSYS. The simulation shows that the post combustion case has an efficiency of 59 % and the pre combustion case has an efficiency of 56 %. This is due to higher electricity production in the post case. The efficiency for both cases will increase when the hydrogen or steam production increase. The two combined heat and power plants are compared economically by the net present value method. With today s prices of natural gas and electricity, none of the alternatives are profitable. With rice in electricity prices and a decline of natural gas prices they will both become economically viable although the post combustion case reaches break-even before the pre combustion case. </p...|$|R
