A park ranger also reportedly heard Capone twanging his banjo in the shower. Ranger Lori Brosnan has said that many visitors have reported feeling a cold chill when walking through the shower room, and one visitor reported feeling fingers {{on the back of his}} neck, but turned around and nobody was there. Brosnan herself has reported unexplained sounds such as cell doors moving in the night when the vices were locked tight and only she had the keys. Other rangers have also reported doors opening on their own accord, whispering sounds in cells, and the sounds of a harmonica. Ghostly voices from the hospital wards have also been reported. George [...] "Machine Gun" [...] Kelly has reportedly been sighted in the prison's church and Alvin [...] "Creepy" [...] Karpis is said to haunt the prison bakery and kitchen. One visitor and his wife have claimed to have heard canaries singing in what was the cell of Robert Stroud, the [...] "Birdman of Alcatraz", and to have seen him on the bed reading a book, yet Stroud was never permitted to keep birds in his cell as he'd done at former prisons.|$|E

At sight of his master's sudden departure, the varlet Watkin set off after him, with the pack-mule beside him, so that the four clattered away down the road together, until they swept round a curve and their babble was but a drone in the distance.

60|$|Autumn {{had melted}} into Indian summer, {{but it was}} still hot. With the {{perspiration}} dripping from me one afternoon, I whirled and drove the keen axe into a silver birch's side, seldom turning my eyes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> of white chips, because looking up between the slender stems one could see the black smoke of a thrasher streaking the prairie. The crops of the man who employed it had escaped damage, and as those of many had been spoiled by frost I knew he would reap a handsome profit on every bushel. I did not grudge it him, but the contrast with our failure troubled me. My throat was parched and dried up, for we had finished all the water they brought us in by train, and no man could drink of the shrunken creek, which was alkaline. It flowed down from one of those curious lakes to be found on the Western prairie, where clouds of biting dust which smarts one's eyes and nostrils intolerably rise up like smoke from the white crust about the margin of the waters, whose color is a vivid greenish blue.|$|E

60|$|William of Montaubon, the cunning squire, {{had made}} his way across {{to the spot where}} the steeds were tethered, and had mounted his own great roussin. At first it was thought {{that he was about to}} ride from the field, but the howl of execration from the Breton peasants changed {{suddenly}} to a yell of applause and delight as he turned the beast's head for the English circle and thrust his long prick spurs into its side. Those who faced him saw this sudden and unexpected appearance. Time was when both horse and rider must have winced away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> of their blows. But now they were in no state to meet such a rush. They could scarce raise their arms. Their blows were too feeble to hurt this mighty creature. In a moment it had plunged through the ranks, and seven of them were on the grass. It turned and rushed through them again, leaving five others helpless beneath its hoofs. No need to do more! Already Beaumanoir and his companions were inside the circle, the prostrate men were helpless, and Josselin had won.|$|E

I have been to see a deserted quinta (country-house), where {{there is a great deal}} of curious old sculpture, in relief, upon the masonry; many of the figures, which are nearly as large as life, representing soldiers clad and armed much as I should suppose those of Cortez were. There are no buildings about the Town, of the smallest pretensions to beauty or charm of any kind.

I am more comfortable and contented than I expected to be, so far from home and from everybody I am closely connected with: but, of course, it is at best a tolerable exile.|$|E
60|$|Mannhardt reasons in {{much the}} same way about the Golden Fleece. This is a peculiarly Greek feature, {{interwoven}} with the world-wide Marchen of the Lad, the Giant's helpful daughter, her aid in accomplishing feats otherwise impossible, and the pursuit of the pair by the father. I have studied the story--as it occurs in Samoa, among Red Indian tribes, and elsewhere--in 'A Far-travelled Tale.' {61b} In our late Greek versions the Quest of the Fleece of Gold occurs, but in no other variants known to me. There is a lamb (a boy changed into a lamb) in Romaic. His fleece is of no interest to anybody. Out of his body grows a tree with a golden apple. Sun-yarns occur in popular songs. Mannhardt (pp. 282, 283) abounds in solar explanations of the Fleece of Gold, hanging on the oak- tree in the dark AEaean forest. Idyia, wife of the Colchian king, 'is clearly the Dawn.' Aia is the isle of the Sun. Helle=Surya, a Sanskrit Sun-goddess; the golden ram off whose back she falls, while her brother keeps his seat, is the Sun. Her brother, Phrixus, may be the Daylight. The oak-tree in Colchis is the Sun-tree of the Lettish songs. Perseus is a hero of Light, born in the Dark Tower (Night) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> of gold (Sun-rays).|$|E

60|$|Romola did {{not mean}} to go to bed that night. When she had {{fastened}} the door she took her taper to the carved and painted chest which contained her wedding-clothes. The white silk and gold lay there, the long white veil and the circlet of pearls. A great sob rose as she looked at them: they seemed the shroud of her dead happiness. In a tiny gold loop of the circlet a sugar-plum had lodged--a pink hailstone <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower</b> of sweets: Tito had detected it first, and had said that it should always remain there. At certain moments--and this was one of them--Romola was carried, by a sudden wave of memory, back again into the time of perfect trust, and felt again the presence of the husband whose love made the world as fresh and wonderful to her as to a little child that sits in stillness among the sunny flowers: heard the gentle tones and saw the soft eyes without any lie in them, and breathed again that large freedom of the soul which comes from the faith that the being who is nearest to us is greater than ourselves. And in those brief moments the tears always rose: the woman's lovingness felt something akin to what the bereaved mother feels when the tiny fingers seem to lie warm on her bosom, and yet are marble to her lips as she bends over the silent bed.|$|E

40|$|The Pierre Auger Observatory Fluorescence Detector (FD) {{performs}} a calorimetric {{measurement of the}} primary energy of cosmic ray <b>showers.</b> <b>The</b> level of accuracy of this technique {{is determined by the}} uncertainty in several parameters, among them <b>the</b> fraction of <b>shower</b> light (both from fluorescence and Cherenkov light) that reaches the detector after being multiply scattered (MS) in the atmosphere. This component depends on atmospheric conditions, namely on Rayleigh and Mie scattering processes. Using laser events it is possible to study these processes and deconvolute them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>shower's</b> electromagnetic lateral distribution. We propose a new method to measure the Rayleigh and Mie MS components seen in laser events, and correlate them with atmospheric conditions. In order to study in detail the effect of such conditions in the scattering of photons, a Geant 4 dedicated laser simulation was developed. % In this framework photons are individually followed through the atmosphere allowing for any number of scatterings, from both processes This combination of a MS dedicated data analysis with a realistic laser simulation enables to explore MS characteristics, in particular the evolution with time, altitude and distance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> FD...|$|R
