2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way.

2500|$|In February 1914, the Tribals, whose {{range was}} too short for {{effective}} open sea operations, were sent to Dover, forming the 6th Destroyer Flotilla. On {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, the 6th Flotilla formed the basis of the Dover Patrol, with which the Tribal class, including Afridi, served {{for the duration of the}} war. Early in the war, the main means of detecting submerged submarines was the indicator net, in which a submarine would <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> net, with movement of an attached buoy indicating the location of the submarine. On 20 February 1915, the destroyer [...] spotted a disturbance in indicator nets in the Dover Straits, and signalled to Afridi to deploy her explosive anti-submarine sweep, but no submarine was found. On 6 April 1915, the drifter Hyacinth spotted a periscope of the German submarine [...] and called up Afridi, which was nearby. While the submarine carried away a section of the netting, the indicator buoys did not deploy, so U-33 was able to escape unscathed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{security}} forces were {{deployed in the}} area at the time, but did not intervene to end the fighting. Shortly after the shooting began, Stormont MP Paddy Kennedy went with Short Strand residents to the local RUC base and demanded protection for their homes. Across the River Lagan, in the Markets area, other IRA members assembled and prepared to reinforce the Short Strand should it be invaded. British soldiers eventually arrived in armoured vehicles and cordoned off the roads around the Short Strand, which denied the IRA [...] "any hope of reinforcement". At the time, the British Army said that its soldiers fired no shots because [...] "owing to the confused situation, {{it was impossible to}} identify targets". British Army Colonel Mike Dewar later said: [...] "The whole incident had taken its course because the Army was so chronically overstretched that night in Belfast. The one spare platoon in the whole of west Belfast was not able to get through rioting Protestants to the Short Strand". Journalist Tony Geraghty wrote that sometimes [...] "The gunfire eased long enough to allow an occasional British Army personnel carrier (a 'Pig') to whine past, illuminated by the flames in a token gesture of law-and-order". Another journalist who witnessed the battle, Peter Taylor, later said:The shooting intensified but the soldiers still declined to intervene and separate the two sides – either because they felt they were not numerically strong enough or because they did not wish to <b>get</b> <b>caught</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of a sectarian fight, in the darkness, with shots being fired by both sides.|$|E
