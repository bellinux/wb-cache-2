2500|$|Further {{controversy}} {{soon came}} to a head when, in late January 2003, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, Charles Lewis, published a leaked draft copy of an Administration proposal titled the Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003. The document was quickly dubbed [...] "PATRIOT II" [...] or [...] "Son of PATRIOT" [...] by the media and organisations such as the EFF. The draft, which was circulated to 10 divisions of the Department of Justice, proposed to make further modifications to extend the USA PATRIOT Act and would have made more changes to FISA, including extending the definition of a foreign power in relation to FISA and allowed the use of wiretaps 15 days after Congress authorized {{the use of military force}} (currently, the law allows this only after a declaration of war). Further, it would have allowed Federal agencies to acquire foreign government's spoken communications and would have expanded the use of pen registers under FISA to apply to U.S. citizens. It proposed that the FISA Court of Review be allowed to employ a lawyer with security clearance to defend the judgement of the FISC, and would have expanded the use of law enforcement <b>investigative</b> <b>tools</b> under FISA. Further gags were proposed in the draft and, had it been introduced into Congress, it would have prevented the disclosure of terrorism investigation detainee information, [...] "Worst Case Scenario" [...] information and information relating to Capitol buildings. The draft contained measures to further restrict what participants in Grand Jury terrorism hearings could disclose, while other proposed measures would have enhanced investigations into terrorism, including the establishment of a terrorism identification database. Changes were proposed to define terrorism as a crime and the legal framework with which to prosecute such crimes. Further modifications would have also changed immigration and border-security laws. Though the Department of Justice released a statement that it was only a draft, it caused an enormous amount of controversy, with many criticising it for impinging on privacy and civil liberties. In particular, Patrick Leahy complained that [...] "If there is going to be a sequel to the USA PATRIOT Act, the process of writing it should be open and accountable. It should not be shrouded in secrecy, steeped in unilateralism or tinged with partisanship. The early signals from the Administration about its intentions for this bill are ominous, and I hope Justice Department officials will change the way they are handling this." ...|$|E

40|$|It is {{presented}} here an <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> {{for use in}} research aimed at understanding the health concepts of biology teachers in basic education and/or higher education. Central element {{in the construction of}} the <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> is the understanding of the relevance of the socio-historical dimension in the genesis and in the transformation processes of knowledge, as indicated by the explanatory fleckian model of knowledge sociogenesis. Important contribution to the development of the questionnaire is offered by Barata (1985), which constructs a scheme that systematizes health concepts throughout human history. This tool was validated and then used to indicate the views of Parasitology and Microbiology university professors in a broader study, in which was investigated its academic genesis. The results of this first use in investigative processes of the questionnaire detected the presence of three distinct teachers’ profiles regarding the concepts of health: The undefined, those who reject the social causation and those who reject the simplistic conceptions of health, as hygienism and biologicism. Due to its quantitative character, the <b>investigative</b> <b>tool</b> is recommended for early stages of research, helping, for example, during the preliminary investigation, in the screening and selection of the sample for a more detailed research, of predominantly qualitative characte...|$|R

5000|$|Contemporary sociologists do not {{generally}} dispute that social phenomena {{take place within}} the natural universe and, as such, are subject to natural constraints, such as the laws of physics.
