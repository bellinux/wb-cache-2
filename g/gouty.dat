5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of <b>gouty</b> arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce this side effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. <b>Gouty</b> tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for basal cell carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{frequently}} {{occurs in}} combination with other medical problems. Metabolic syndrome, a combination of abdominal obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid levels, occurs in nearly 75% of cases. Other conditions commonly complicated by gout include lead poisoning, kidney failure, hemolytic anemia, psoriasis, solid organ transplants and myeloproliferative disorders such as polycythemia. A body mass index {{greater than or equal to}} 35 increases male risk of gout threefold. Chronic lead exposure and lead-contaminated alcohol are risk factors for gout due to the harmful effect of lead on kidney function. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is often associated with <b>gouty</b> arthritis.|$|E

2500|$|The crew exited {{through an}} escape hatch, {{surviving}} with minor injuries (<b>Goutier</b> {{a sprained ankle}} and Breathren a leg injury). They walked to Kentucky Route 20, about [...] away, for help. A passing motorist, who worked for Delta Air Lines, noted a person {{walking out of the}} woods and continued driving to the airport.

25|$|The pilot, Calvin <b>Goutier,</b> the co-pilot, Richard Breathren, and {{the flight}} {{engineer}} (no name or further information on record) were flying from Detroit, Michigan, carrying automotive parts for General Motors Corporation to the airport for a routine landing while en route to Atlanta, Georgia. In the crash the fuselage broke into two pieces and the wreckage was strewn along a 400-foot (122-m) path. The crash occurred about 5:26a.m.|$|R
5|$|<b>Gouty</b> {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth as to have brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
25|$|Piero the <b>Gouty</b> was {{the eldest}} son of Cosimo. Piero, as his sobriquet the <b>gouty</b> implies, {{suffered}} from gout and did not enjoy good health. Lorenzo the Magnificent was Piero's eldest son by his wife Lucrezia Tornabuoni. Piero's reign furthered the always fractious political divisions of Florence when he had called up huge debts owed to the Medici Bank. These debts were owed primarily by a Florentine nobleman, Luca Pitti. Lucca called for an armed insurrection against Piero, but a co-conspirator rebutted this. Duke Francesco Sforza of Milan died in 1466, and his son Galeazzo Maria Sforza became the new Milanese duke. With the death of Francesco Sforza, Florence lost a valuable ally among the other Italian states.|$|E
25|$|Use of {{ciclosporin}} in post renal transplantation {{is associated}} with hyperuricemia and, in some cases, gout. This {{is due to the}} decrease in glomerular filtration rate induced by ciclosporin leading to retention of uric acid. Use of azathioprine as an alternative has shown to reduce the incidence of <b>gouty</b> arthritis.|$|E
50|$|During 1983, Reininger left Tuxedomoon to {{concentrate}} on a new co-project with occasional band member Michael Belfer. Entitled Night Air, the album represented a more electronic approach than before, was produced by Gareth Jones and saw him continue his recording relationship with Crepuscule. Further solo works have included the EP Paris En Automne (recorded with Alain <b>Goutier),</b> the Live In Brussels album in 1986, Byzantium (recorded with Gilles Martin) and his last for the label Songs From The Rain Palace, released in 1990.|$|R

[...] 590 It was the first man's charter; why not mine? How forfeit? when, deposed in other hands? ...|$|R
40|$|The work by French author Benoite Groult (1920 -) is an {{expression}} of personal discontent. Biographer Fernando <b>Goutier</b> (1978, p. 98) points out that from 1968 to 1975 an increasingly acute awareness of the political and economic situation of Women compelled Groult to write Ainsi soit-elle (1975). Ainsi soit-elle is the point of departure for our study of feminist perspectives in Benoite Groult 2 ̆ 7 s writing. The purpose of this research project is to explore the possibilities, and the validity, of a feminist reading of a selection of essays and novels produced by Groult between 1975 and 1993. Included in this selection are: Ainsi soit-elle (1975), Les trois quarts du temps (1983), Les vaisseaux du cœur (1988), and 2 ̆ 2 Un mepris absolu 2 ̆ 2 - an introductory essay to Cette male assurance (1993). This thesis examines a number of feminin/feminist issues. We trace, for example, some important features of the Feminist Movement in France this century. We also explore {{the ways in which the}} Movement may have influenced our social structure our interpersonal relationships, and our literature. Subjectivity plays an important role in feminist discourse. Subjectivity is welcomed as a means by which to assert the female voice which has been repeatedly ignored. For our study we have chosen to apply Reader Oriented Criticism - a collective title for a number of theories that acknowledge, and even celebrate, the subjective character of both the author (text) and the reader...|$|R
25|$|For instance, needle {{aspiration}} {{of fluid}} from a <b>gouty</b> joint will reveal negatively birefringent monosodium urate crystals. Calcium pyrophosphate crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence. Urate crystals appear yellow, and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel {{to that of}} a red compensator filter, or a crystal of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison.|$|E
25|$|Regular {{consumption}} of alcohol is {{associated with an increased}} risk of <b>gouty</b> arthritis and a decreased risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Two recent studies report that the more alcohol consumed, the lower the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Among those who drank regularly, the one-quarter who drank the most were up to 50% less likely to develop the disease compared to the half who drank the least.|$|E
25|$|LNS is {{characterized}} by three major hallmarks: neurologic dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances including self-mutilation, and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia). Damage to the basal ganglia causes sufferers to adopt a characteristic fencing stance {{due to the nature}} of the lesion. Some may also be afflicted with macrocytic anemia. Virtually all patients are male; males suffer delayed growth and puberty, and most develop shrunken testicles or testicular atrophy. Female carriers are at an increased risk for <b>gouty</b> arthritis but are usually otherwise unaffected.|$|E
25|$|In {{her first}} {{start as a}} four-year-old in spring 1802 at Newmarket, Eleanor {{finished}} last {{in a field of}} four horses to Lord Darlington's horse Muly-Moloch. At the First October meeting in Newmarket, Eleanor regained her three-year-old form and defeated the mare Penelope, winning 350 guineas. She also won the King's Plate from Sister to <b>Gouty</b> a few days later. At the Second October meeting at Newmarket, her last engagement of the season, Eleanor won £50 in a stakes race by beating the Prince of Wales' horse Shock.|$|E
25|$|It is {{essential}} that the overproduction of uric acid be controlled {{in order to reduce}} the risk of nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and <b>gouty</b> arthritis. The drug allopurinol is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. Allopurinol is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3–20mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric acid level down into the normal range (<3nbsp&mg/dL). Most affected individuals can be treated with allopurinol all through life.|$|E
500|$|For {{his next}} four stage productions, Richardson {{was at the}} Haymarket. Father Carving a Statue (1964) by Graham Greene was short-lived. He had a more {{reliable}} vehicle in Shaw's You Never Can Tell (1966) in which he played the philosopher-waiter William, {{and in the same}} year he had a great success as Sir Anthony Absolute in The Rivals. The critic David Benedictus wrote of Richardson's performance, [...] "...he is choleric and <b>gouty</b> certainly, the script demands that he shall be, but his most engaging quality, his love for his son in spite of himself, shines through every line." [...] In 1967 he again played Shylock; this was the last time he acted in a Shakespeare play on stage. His performance won critical praise, {{but the rest of the}} cast were less well received.|$|E
2500|$|Health {{professionals}} see orthomolecular medicine as encouraging {{individuals to}} dose themselves with {{large amounts of}} vitamins and other nutrients without conventional supervision, which they worry might be damaging to health. Potential risks of inappropriate vitamin and supplement regimes include {{an increased risk of}} coronary heart disease, hypertension, thrombophlebitis, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, neurological effects, liver toxicity, congenital abnormalities, spontaneous abortion, <b>gouty</b> arthritis, jaundice, kidney stones, and diarrhea. In their book Trick or Treatment?, Edzard Ernst and Simon Singh conclude that [...] "The concepts of orthomolecular medicine are not biologically plausible and not supported by the results of rigorous clinical trials. These problems are {{compounded by the fact that}} orthomolecular medicine can cause harm and is often very expensive." ...|$|E
