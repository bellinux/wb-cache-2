40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} a random height function with long-range constraints on a <b>discrete</b> <b>segment.</b> This model was suggested by Benjamini, Yadin and Yehudayoff and is a generalization of simple random walk. The random function is uniformly sampled from all graph homomorphisms from the graph P_{n,d} to the integers Z, where the graph P_{n,d} is the <b>discrete</b> <b>segment</b> { 0, 1, [...] ., n} with edges between vertices of different parity whose distance is at most 2 d+ 1. Such a graph homomorphism {{can be viewed as a}} height function whose values change by exactly one along edges of the graph P_{n,d}. We also {{consider a}} similarly defined model on the discrete torus. Benjamini, Yadin and Yehudayoff conjectured that this model undergoes a phase transition from a delocalized to a localized phase when d grows beyond a threshold c*log(n). We establish this conjecture with the precise threshold log_ 2 (n). Our results provide information on the typical range and variance of the height function for every given pair of n and d, including the critical case when d-log_ 2 (n) tends to a constant. In addition, we identify the local limit of the model, when d is constant and n tends to infinity, as an explicitly defined Markov chain. Comment: 49 pages, 14 figure...|$|E

For this reason, the sequence presented here encodes an aberrantly rearranged human T-cell gamma chain. There are several surprising differences between the deduced human and murine gamma-chain amino acid sequences. These include poor homology in the variable region, poor homology in a <b>discrete</b> <b>segment</b> of the constant region precisely bounded by the expected junctions of exon CII, and the presence in the human sequence of five potential sites for N-linked glycosylation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss from an {{arithmetic}} and combinatorial viewpoint a simple algorithmic method of generation of discrete segments in the three-dimensional space. We consider discrete segments that connect the origin to a given point (u 1, u 2, u 3) with coprime nonnegative integer coordinates. This generation method is based on generalized three-dimensional Euclid’s algorithms acting on the triple (u 1, u 2, u 3). We associate with the steps of the algorithm substitutions, that is, rules that replace letters by words, which allow us to generate the Freeman coding of a <b>discrete</b> <b>segment.</b> We introduce a dual viewpoint on these objects in order to measure the quality of approximation of these discrete segments with respect to the corresponding Euclidean segment. This viewpoint allows us to relate our discrete segments to finite patches that generate arithmetic discrete planes in a periodic way...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe cardiac {{conduction}} {{system is}} an anatomically <b>discrete</b> <b>segment</b> of specialized myocardium that initiates and propagates electrical impulses to coordinate myocardial contraction. To define the molecular {{composition of the}} mouse ventricular conduction system we used microdissection and transcriptional profiling by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE). Conduction-system-specific expression for Id 2, {{a member of the}} Id gene family of transcriptional repressors, was identified. Analyses of Id 2 -deficient mice demonstrated structural and functional conduction system abnormalities, including left bundle branch block. A 1. 2  kb fragment of the Id 2 promoter proved sufficient for cooperative regulation by Nkx 2 - 5 and Tbx 5 in vitro and for conduction-system-specific gene expression in vivo. Furthermore, compound haploinsufficiency of Tbx 5 and Nkx 2 - 5 or Tbx 5 and Id 2 prevented embryonic specification of the ventricular conduction system. We conclude that a molecular pathway including Tbx 5, Nkx 2 - 5, and Id 2 coordinates specification of ventricular myocytes into the ventricular conduction system lineage...|$|E

40|$|Silencing of {{chromosomal}} domains {{has been}} described in diverse systems such as position effect variegation in insects, silencing near yeast telomeres, and mammalian X chromosome inactivation. In mammals, silencing is associated with methylation at CpG dinucleotides, but {{little is known about}} how methylation patterns are established or altered during development. We previously described a strain-specific modifier locus, Ssm 1, that controls the methylation of a complex transgene. In this study we address the questions of the nature of Ssm 1 ’s targets and whether its effect extends into adjacent sequences. By examining the inheritance of methylation patterns in a series of mice harboring deletion derivatives of the original transgene, we have identified a <b>discrete</b> <b>segment,</b> derived from the gpt gene of Escherichia coli, that is a major determinant for Ssm 1 -mediated methylation.

The gene {{order of the}} catabolic operon of NAH 7 for salicylate oxidation was determined to be: promoter [...] nahG (the structural gene for salicylate hydroxylase) [...] nahH (catechol 2. 3 -dioxygenase) [...] nahI (hydroxymuconic semialdehyde dehydrogenase) [...] nahN (hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase) [...] nahL (2 -oxopent- 4 -enoate hydratase). This order is identical {{to that of the}} isofunctional genes of TOL plasmid pWW 0. The complete nucleotide sequence of nahH was determined and compared with that of xylE, the isofunctional gene of TOL plasmid pWW 0. There were 20 % and 16 % differences in their nucleotide and amino acid sequences, respectively. The homology between the NAH 7 and TOL pWW 0 plasmids ends upstream of the Shine-Dalgarno sequences of nahH and xylE, but the homology continues downstream of these genes.

40|$|Extracellular Yersinia {{adhering}} at {{the surface}} of a eukaryotic cell translocate effector Yops across the plasma membrane of the cell by a mechanism requiring YopD and YopB, the latter probably mediating pore formation. We studied the role of SycD, the intrabacterial chaperone of YopD. By producing GST-YopB hybrid proteins and SycD in Escherichia coli, we observed that SycD also binds specifically to YopB and that this binding reduces the toxicity of GST-YopB in E. coli. By analysis of a series of truncated GST-YopB proteins, we observed that SycD does not bind to a <b>discrete</b> <b>segment</b> of YopB. Using the same approach, we observed that YopD can also bind to YopB. Binding between YopB and YopD occurred even in the presence of SycD, and a complex composed of these three proteins could be immunoprecipitated from the cytoplasm of Yersinia. In a sycD mutant, the intracellular pool of YopB and YopD was greatly reduced unless the lcrV gene was also deleted. As LcrV is known to interact with YopB and YopD and to promote their secretion, we speculate that SycD prevents a premature association between YopB-YopD and LcrV...|$|E
