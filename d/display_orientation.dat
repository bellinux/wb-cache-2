5000|$|Following {{their initial}} finding, Hubel and Wiesel {{discovered}} {{the presence of}} a variety of visual processing cells, each with unique receptive field properties. At the lowest and simplest level of the hierarchy are the aforementioned centre-surround cells of the retinal ganglion and LGN. Next, within the visual cortex, are simple cells. [...] Simple cells exist within the primary visual cortex (Brodmann Area 17). These cells are found specifically in layer IV, at which most outgoing projections from the LGN terminate. [...] The receptive fields of simple cells are non-concentric and linear, in which excitatory and inhibitory regions exist adjacent to one another. Thus, a response is elicited by stationary linear stimuli. Furthermore, the regions exhibit mutual cancellation (antagonism) and produce stronger responses as the stimuli fill more space (spatial summation). A discerning feature of simple cells is that their responses <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> and positional selectivity. This means that a simple cell fires at an optimal orientation. Elicited responses get progressively weaker as a stimulus's orientation shifts sub-optimally and ceases to fire when at 90˚ from the optimal orientation. Positional selectivity simply refers to the cell's receptiveness to the position of the stimulus within part or all of the excitatory/inhibitory regions. Accordingly, simple cell receptive fields exist in a variety of different geometries and sizes for all possible orientation and positions in the visual field. It is presumed that multiple concentric LGN receptive fields converge in a line to develop a single simple receptive field.|$|E
30|$|<b>Display</b> <b>orientation</b> also impacts {{the stock}} per facing since more or fewer units of an item fit behind one facing {{depending}} on whether the item is positioned length- or crosswise. In Fig.  1, fewer units would fit behind one facing lengthwise and more units behind a facing with crosswise <b>display</b> <b>orientation.</b> The stock that can be placed behind one facing is determined by the depth of the shelf and the item dimensions. Since the space behind one facing is always filled completely after a replenishment (i.e., filled up until the shelf depth is fully occupied), the stock per facing is not itself a decision of the retailer, but is determined via shelf and item dimensions as well as the decision on the <b>display</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{application}} of our model to real and randomly generated data sets reveal several important insights. First, we {{show in a}} case study that a retailer can increase profits by around 29 % compared {{to the status quo}} if our model is applied in full. Simultaneously optimizing facings, display orientations and order frequencies is superior to the strictly shelf-space-based optimization of facings and <b>display</b> <b>orientation,</b> without optimizing order frequencies. This underlines the importance of an integrated perspective on shelf-space optimization and in-store replenishment processes. Second, our model can be efficiently solved by a MIP model. The results consistently are optimal and even generated within a minimum amount of time for large-scale instances. Third, if backroom space is available, retailers can make use of it by assigning more showroom space to highly profitable items and moving less profitable items to the backroom, from where they are replenished more frequently. In other words, the available backroom space gives more degrees of freedom to the retailer in terms of shelf-space optimization. Fourth, our model can be extended to account for assortment decisions, which is especially relevant for situations where the available shelf space is not sufficient to list all possible items of a category. Finally, the profit advantage a retailer has when taking an integrated approach to facing, <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> and order frequency optimization can amount up to around 22 % compared to a case where facings and <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> are optimized without considering the related costs for in-store replenishment. This is because significantly different solution structures result in terms of facings, <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> and order frequencies if replenishment processes are neglected.|$|E
3000|$|... (1) Shelf-space {{decision}} Shelf-space {{planning is}} a mid-term task and typically executed every six months, requiring a retailer to assign shelf space and shelf quantities to listed products under {{the constraints of}} limited shelf size (Hübner and Kuhn 2012; Hübner et al. 2013; Bianchi-Aguiar et al. 2016). The results of these decisions are visualized in a planogram which displays the number of facings, <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> and position on the shelf for every item (cf. Fig.  1). A facing is the first visible unit of an item {{in the front row}} of a shelf. Behind each facing, there is certain quantity of stock, i.e., additional units of the respective item. The number of facings and the stock per facing determine the total shelf quantity of an item. Furthermore, items can be displayed lengthwise or crosswise (cf. Drèze et al. 1994). Particularly when single units of an item are stored in cartons, the retailer must decide on the <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> of the respective carton. Figure  1, left, shows the difference between facings and shelf quantities. For example, item a gets 2 facings with a stock of 4 units each, resulting in a total quantity of 2 · 4 = 8 units. Item b gets 1 facing with a stock of 6 units and a total shelf quantity of 6. The right of Fig.  1 explains the difference between length- and crosswise <b>display</b> <b>orientation.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{potential}} perceptual ambiguity of a point-light walking figure, with upright <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> observers can readily recover the invariant structure from biological motion. However, {{regardless of the}} same low-level relations between moving dots within upright and inverted orientation, perception of a point-light walker is dramatically impeded with 180 º-display inversion. Spontaneous recognition was found to improve abruptly with changing <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> from inverted to upright (Pavlova, 1996, Perception 25, Suppl.). This evidence implies that the visual system implements additional processing constraints for the unambiguous interpretation of biological motion. We used a masking paradigm to study the processing constraints in biological motion perception. At each of randomly presented five orientations (0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °, and 180 °), viewers saw a sequence of 210 displays. Half of them comprised a canonical 11 pointlight walker, and half a partly distorted walker, in which rigid pair-wise connections between moving dots were perturbed. A 66 -dot “scrambled-walker” mask camouflaged both figures. Prior each experimental sequence, a sample of a canonical walker in respective orientation was demonstrated. Observers judged whether a canonical figure was present. A jackknife estimating of the ROC parameters indicated that detectability leveled off with changing orientation from upright to 135 °, and then slightly increased to display inversion. However, even with 135 ° and 180 ° it was above chance. For orientations 0 °, 45 ° and 90 °, perceptual learning to detect a canonical walker proceeded rather rapidly {{in the course of}} the experiment. Comparison with the data on spontaneous recognition of biological motion suggests that <b>display</b> <b>orientation</b> affects bottom-up processing of biological motion more strongly than top-down. We suppose that some processing constraints (such as axis-of-symmetry, dynamic constraints) in perception of biological motion be hierarchically nested. Dynamic constraints appear to be the most powerful: the highest detectability was found with upright orientation. While with changing orientation these constraints lose their strength, others processing constraints are getting more influential. For instance, the lower sensitivity for 135 ° as compared to 180 ° might be accounted for by the axis-of-symmetry constraint that is implemented by the visual system at 180 °. Likewise, due to the inefficiency of this constraint, biological motion pattern is perceived as more multistable with 90 °- 150 °, as compared to 180 ° <b>display</b> <b>orientation...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{colorful}} {{representation of}} orientation preference maps in {{primary visual cortex}} has become iconic. However, the standard representation is misleading because it uses a color mapping to indicate orientations based on the HSV (hue, saturation, value) color space, for which important perceptual features such as brightness, and not just hue, vary among orientations. This means that some orientations stand out more than others, conveying a distorted visual impression. This is particularly problematic for visualizing subtle biases caused by slight overrepresentation of some orientations due to, for example, stripe rearing. We show that <b>displaying</b> <b>orientation</b> maps with a color mapping based on a slightly {{modified version of the}} HCL (hue, chroma, lightness) color space, so that primarily only hue varies between orientations, leads to a more balanced visual impression. This makes it easier to perceive the true structure of this seminal example of functional brain architecture...|$|R
30|$|Shelf-space {{decisions}} impact customer demand. Item demand {{depends on}} the visible quantity on the shelf and the <b>display</b> <b>orientation.</b> The higher the visibility of an item, the higher its demand. The visibility of an item increases {{with the number of}} facings assigned to that item and its <b>display</b> <b>orientation,</b> i.e., the visible item width the customer sees. Empirical studies examine these so-called “space-elasticity effects”, (cf. e.g., Cox 1964; Frank and Massy 1970; Curhan 1972; Drèze et al. 1994; Desmet and Renaudin 1998). Chandon et al. (2009) show that the number of facings is the most important in-store factor affecting customer demand. Using a meta-analysis across empirical studies, Eisend (2014) quantified the average space-elasticity factor as 17 %, which implies a demand increase of 17 % each time the number of facings is doubled. The discussion of the demand effect on other items (referred to as “cross-space elasticity”) is ambiguous in the pertinent literature. For example, Zufryden (1986) and Kök et al. (2015) state that there is no empirical evidence that product-level demand can be modeled with cross-space elasticity. In addition, the measured effects of cross-space elasticity appear to have only a limited influence on sales (Eisend 2014; Hübner and Schaal 2016). We therefore comply with these results in the literature and disregard cross-space elasticity effects in the remainder of our paper.|$|E

Our model accounts for space-elastic demand, assumes limited showroom and backroom space, and differentiates between direct and indirect replenishment cost as well as showroom and backroom inventory holding cost.
