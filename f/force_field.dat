40|$|AbstractAccurate <b>force</b> <b>fields</b> are {{essential}} {{for the success of}} molecular dynamics simulations. In apparent contrast to the conformational preferences of most <b>force</b> <b>fields,</b> recent NMR experiments suggest that short polyalanine peptides in water populate the polyproline II structure almost exclusively. To investigate this apparent contradiction, with its ramifications for the assessment of molecular <b>force</b> <b>fields</b> and the structure of unfolded proteins, we performed extensive simulations of Ala 5 in water (∼ 5 μs total time), using twelve different <b>force</b> <b>fields</b> and three different peptide terminal groups. Using either empirical or density-functional-based Karplus relations for the J-couplings, we find that most current <b>force</b> <b>fields</b> do overpopulate the α-region, with quantitative results depending on the choice of Karplus relation and on the peptide termini. Even after reweighting to match experiment, we find that Ala 5 retains significant α- and β-populations. In fact, several <b>force</b> <b>fields</b> match the experimental data well before reweighting and have a significant helical population. We conclude that radical changes to the best current <b>force</b> <b>fields</b> are not necessary, based on the NMR data. Nevertheless, experiments on short peptides open the way toward the systematic improvement of current simulation models...|$|R

5|$|Devers was an {{articulate}} {{proponent of}} the Army's now-emerging tactical doctrine of combined arms: infantry-artillery-armor-close air support. He carried a translation of a German manual on {{the components of the}} panzer division. Devers was neither the first nor the only general to embrace combined arms as the doctrinal {{solution to the problem of}} how best to employ tanks, but he was well-placed to act upon it. At his direction an updated, comprehensive (460 pages) Armed <b>Force</b> <b>Field</b> Manual: Tactics and Technique FM 17–10 was written, published and distributed in March 1942. A German manual on tank platoon tactics, with a foreword by Heinz Guderian, was translated into English and issued as an Armored Force publication. March 1942 saw a reorganization of the armored divisions in the wake of the 1941 maneuvers. Devers added an artillery headquarters to the armored division, and reorganized the artillery component into three battalions, each of three batteries of six M7 Priest self-propelled guns. A division trains headquarters was added to coordinate logistical activities. In a first, at Devers' insistence, a flight of light aircraft to be used for artillery spotting and reconnaissance were included in the new Table of Organization and Equipment (TO) for each division. He was a strong and early supporter of the development of the DUKW, an amphibious truck. Vannevar Bush later recalled that in the early stages of its development, Devers was the only man in the Army who fully appreciated its possibilities. Its value would be demonstrated during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, as {{preparations}} {{were being}} made for Operation Iraqi Freedom, the 173d Airborne Brigade was assigned {{to be a part}} of an assault from the north of Iraq. The original plan was for the 173d to be attached to the 4th Infantry Division as a flexible force of airborne troops to complement the heavy weapons of the division's three brigades. Supported by the 1st Infantry Division and the 10th Special Forces Group, the 4th Infantry Division was to assemble in Turkey and use its heavy mechanized brigades to attack through Tikrit and eventually assist V Corps, which would attack from the south, in surrounding Baghdad. However, this plan fell through when the government of Turkey would not allow offensive operations to be conducted from its soil, and the entire 4th Infantry Division was left stuck on ships in the Mediterranean for the opening of the operation. This meant that the entire northern front of the war would be conducted by the 173d Airborne Brigade and Army special forces operating with aircraft from Europe as their only supply line. As the brigade had no heavy or mechanized forces and only a few Humvees and an artillery battery, heavier forces were attached to it in the form of two companies of M113 Armored Personnel Carriers, M1 Abrams tanks, and M2 Bradleys from a task force of 1st Battalion, 63d Armor, which was attached to the brigade. Task Force 1-63 consisted of HHC/1-63d Armor, C/1-63d Armor and B/2-2d Infantry. The force also received <b>force</b> <b>field</b> artillery headquarters from the 2d Battalion, 15th Field Artillery, which brought a Tactical Operations Center, a Q-36 counterfire radar and Combat Observation and Lasing Team (COLT)a pair of Dragoneye Unmanned Aerial Vehicles from the US Marine Corps, to be operated by the Brigades Ground Surveillance Systems (GSS) team.|$|E
