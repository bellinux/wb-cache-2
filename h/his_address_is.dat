2500|$|He {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy between 1853 and 1899; from 1894 [...] as [...] "James Brooks and Sons". <b>His</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> given in the Academy catalogues as 6 Bloomsbury Street between 1853 and 1862; 11, Serle Street, Lincoln's Inn, between 1871 and 1875, and 35 Wellington Street, Strand from 1876. He lived, however, {{for much of this}} time at The Grange in Stoke Newington [...] (now numbered 42, Clissold Crescent), a red-brick house built to his own design in 1862.|$|E
2500|$|After being {{educated in}} Bath, Trask {{attended}} the Bristol Medical School, {{and entered the}} Army Medical Department in 1887, after a short probationary period he was commissioned on 27 July 1887.

[...] After {{a couple of months}} back in England during 1895, he was seconded to the Egyptian Army on 23 August 1895. [...] During this posting, he died of cholera during the Dongola Expedition on 25 July 1896. He was Mentioned in Despatches by Sir Herbert Kitchener (later Earl Kitchener) in a despatch dated 30 September 1896.

6000|$|In {{response}} to an insistent demand from his fellow-citizens Mr. Watling, the Saturday evening before, had made a speech in the Auditorium, decked with bunting and filled with people. For once the Morning Era did not exaggerate when it declared that the ovation had lasted fully ten minutes. [...] "A remarkable proof" [...] it went on to say, [...] "of the esteem and confidence in which our fellow-citizen is held by {{those who know him}} best, his neighbours in the city where he has given so many instances of his public spirit, where he has achieved such distinction in the practice of the law. He holds the sound American conviction that the office should seek the man. <b>His</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> printed in another column, and we believe it will appeal to the intelligence and sober judgment of the state.

6000|$|... "Absurd, mother! You {{must not}} {{think that he is}} a navvy in fustian and corduroys. He seems a {{sensible}} man: <b>his</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> really remarkably good, considering what he is. As to his being savage, he is quite the reverse. His head is full of figures and machinery; and I am told that he does nothing at home but play the piano. He must bore Marian terribly. I do not want to go to his house particularly; but Marian and he are, of course, very sensitive to anything that can be construed as a slight; and I shall visit them once or twice to prevent them from thinking that I wish to snub Conolly. He will be glad enough to have me at his dinner-table. I am afraid I must hurry away now: I have an appointment at the club. Can I do anything for you in town?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{have had}} {{dealings}} {{with some very}} bad couriers; but I have also had dealings with one who might fairly be called perfection. He was a young Polander, named Joseph N. Verey. He spoke eight languages, {{and seemed to be}} equally at home in all of them; he was shrewd, prompt, posted, and punctual; he was fertile in resources, and singularly gifted in the matter of overcoming difficulties; he not only knew how to do everything in his line, but he knew the best ways and the quickest; he was handy with children and invalids; all his employer needed to do was to take life easy and leave everything to the courier. <b>His</b> <b>address</b> <b>is,</b> care of Messrs. Gay & Son, Strand, London; he was formerly a conductor of Gay's tourist parties. Excellent couriers are somewhat rare; if the reader is about to travel, he will find it to his advantage to make a note of this one.|$|E
6000|$|... "When you do go home, Gregory, you had best {{go first}} to your father's brother. <b>His</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> on a paper in the envelope. He was heir to a peerage, and has, perhaps, now come into it. I have no reasons for supposing that he sided with his father against yours. The {{brothers}} were not bad friends, although they saw little of each other; for your father, after he left Oxford, was {{for the most part}} away from England, until a year before his marriage; and at that time your uncle was in America, having gone out with two or three others on a hunting expedition among the Rocky Mountains. There is, therefore, no reason for supposing that he will receive you otherwise than kindly, when once he is sure that you are his nephew. He may, indeed, for aught I know, have made efforts to discover your father, after he returned from abroad." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{his sense}} and his goodness," [...] {{continued}} Elinor, [...] "no one can, I think, be in doubt, {{who has seen}} him often enough to engage him in unreserved conversation. The excellence of his understanding and his principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps him silent. You know enough of him {{to do justice to}} his solid worth. But of his minuter propensities, as you call them you have from peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He and I have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I have seen a great deal of him, have studied his sentiments and heard his opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I venture to pronounce that his mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books exceedingly great, his imagination lively, his observation just and correct, and his taste delicate and pure. His abilities in every respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his manners and person. At first sight, <b>his</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> certainly not striking; and his person can hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his eyes, which are uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his countenance, is perceived. At present, I know him so well, that I think him really handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Literary World' {{speaks of}} him, confidently, {{as a native}} of Presburg (misled, perhaps, by the account in 'The Home Journal') but I am pleased {{in being able to}} state positively, since I have it from his own lips, that he was born in Utica, in the State of New York, {{although}} both his parents, I believe, are of Presburg descent. The family is connected, in some way, with Maelzel, of Automaton-chess-player memory. In person, he is short and stout, with large, fat, blue eyes, sandy hair and whiskers, a wide but pleasing mouth, fine teeth, and I think a Roman nose. There is some defect in one of his feet. <b>His</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> frank, and his whole manner noticeable for bonhomie. Altogether, he looks, speaks, and acts as little like 'a misanthrope' as any man I ever saw. We were fellow-sojouners for a week about six years ago, at Earl's Hotel, in Providence, Rhode Island; and I presume that I conversed with him, at various times, for some three or four hours altogether. His principal topics were those of the day, and nothing that fell from him led me to suspect his scientific attainments. He left the hotel before me, intending to go to New York, and thence to Bremen; it was in the latter city that his great discovery was first made public; or, rather, it was there that he was first suspected of having made it. This is about all that I personally know of the now immortal Von Kempelen; but I have thought that even these few details would have interest for the public.|$|E
6000|$|The reigning Prince, Otto Johann Friedrich, a {{young man}} of {{imperfect}} education, questionable valour, and no scintilla of capacity, has fallen into entire public contempt. It was with difficulty that I obtained an interview, for he is frequently absent from a court where his presence is unheeded, and where his only rôle {{is to be a}} cloak for the amours of his wife. At last, however, on the third occasion when I visited the palace, I found this sovereign in the exercise of his inglorious function, with the wife on one hand and the lover on the other. He is not ill-looking; he has hair of a ruddy gold, which naturally curls, and his eyes are dark, a combination which I always regard as the mark of some congenital deficiency, physical or moral; his features are irregular but pleasing; the nose perhaps a little short, and the mouth a little womanish; <b>his</b> <b>address</b> <b>is</b> excellent, and he can express himself with point. But to pierce below these externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling quality, a deliquescence of the moral nature, a frivolity and inconsequence of purpose that mark the nearly perfect fruit of a decadent age. He has a worthless smattering of many subjects, but a grasp of none. [...] "I soon weary of a pursuit," [...] he said to me, laughing; it would almost appear as if he took a pride in his incapacity and lack of moral courage. The results of his dilettanteism are to be seen in every field; he is a bad fencer, a second-rate horseman, dancer, shot; he sings--I have heard him--and he sings like a child; he writes intolerable verses in more than doubtful French; he acts like the common amateur; and in short there is no end to the number of things that he does, and does badly. His one manly taste is for the chase. In sum, he is but a plexus of weaknesses; the singing chambermaid of the stage, tricked out in man's apparel, and mounted on a circus horse. I have seen this poor phantom of a prince riding out alone or with a few huntsmen, disregarded by all, and I have been even grieved for the bearer of so futile and melancholy an existence. The last Merovingians may have looked not otherwise.|$|E
