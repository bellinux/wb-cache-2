It is argued that this first, major export <b>of</b> British <b>capital</b> to South Africa after 1870, mostly for railway building (a) formed part of a wider shift in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> British <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> towards parts <b>of</b> the Empire other than India; (b) had important implications for the constitutional development of the Cape and its political relationship with Great Britain; (c) enabled those colonial interests exercising power in the political system to determine the use made of British investments in Cape government securities, against the wishes of other colonists; (d) conditioned the relationships between British and Afrikaner colonists in the Cape; and (e) implied a new dimension to the demand for wage labour there. These developments and their implications are studied here in their inter-relation. The conclusions of the study are finally related to recent writing about the way in which Imperial economic and political interests were promoted through the collaboration of white colonial settlers. </p...|$|R

40|$|At the {{operating}} {{stage of the}} investment cycle problems <b>of</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> efficiency do not rise. At the same time, {{the development of the}} concepts of corporate management provides the ability to apply them in the performance management by approach <b>of</b> companies-objects <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments.</b> During the research were used the methods: Statistical Simulation Methods, correlation-regression analysis, the system of lump-sum equations, direct functional relationships. The attempt to justify the management of efficiency system <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> from the position of the object <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> for the operational phase of the investment cycle was made. The technique of constructing a model of cause-and-effect relationship of efficiency system <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> was proposed, its strengths and weaknesses was identified. The system performance indicators can be significantly expanded and built in the context <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> investors (stakeholders) and time horizons (short-, medium-and long-term). The number <b>of</b> indicators <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> and exogenous factors, too, can be greatly expanded. So, the inverse relationship <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> and <b>of</b> the effects of the trade with indices of freedom of investment, of trade freedom and business freedom can not be described positively. This situation is caused by incorrect calculations of these indexes, or the excess of influence of mental factors compared with the economic laws for the process <b>of</b> investing <b>capital</b> in the trading business of Ukraine and entrepreneurship. The tendencies of stochastic dependence <b>of</b> the <b>investment</b> <b>capital</b> and <b>of</b> the obtained effects undoubtedly manifested in indicators of efficiency. There are some distortions in the understanding of the optimistic and pessimistic forecasts {{from the point of view}} of trends in the external environment and trading business in Ukraine. In particular, the pessimistic forecast <b>of</b> total <b>capital</b> return (0. 3 grn.) was better than the optimistic (0. 2 grn.), and the same with respect to the turnover on UAH 1 capital. This indicates a decrease <b>of</b> the total <b>capital</b> return <b>of</b> trading companies (more rapid growth <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> as compared to the effects obtained from them), with the progressive development of the external environment factors. The same is observed for the non-current assets returns, for fixed assets and current assets returns, and profitability <b>of</b> total <b>capital,</b> <b>of</b> non-current <b>capital,</b> <b>of</b> fixed assets, of current assets, and for the profit per one enterprise. Other trends of performance indicators consistent with the general trends in the development of Ukraine's economy. Thus, performance management <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> in the business at the operational stage of the investment cycle can be carried out by modeling the cause-effect relationships of the system performance indicators and system of exogenous factors, <b>of</b> indicators <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> and <b>of</b> the obtained effects. The model can be built on the system of lump-sum equations, which are calculated by the stochastic and functional links between the above indicators. The system performance indicators can be significantly expanded and built in the context <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> investors (stakeholders) and time horizons (short-, medium-and long-term). The number <b>of</b> indicators <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> and exogenous factors, too, can be greatly expanded. The system of equations can also include the functional relationship between the planned indicators. Performance management <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> in the business from the perspective of the object <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> allows to predict, to monitor, and to analyze of the performance indicators system (as opposed to one or more integrated indicators) over the full life cycle of the enterprise-object <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments.</b> To some extent, forward-looking indicators of efficiency can be manipulated by changing the parameters <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> <b>investments</b> (dependend management indicators). The disadvantages of the approach are: 1) the proposed method of construction of the model can be applied only in the context of stable development of the economy, else stochastic communication parameters may not be set, 2) technique requires a large sample of statistical information, 3) it is sometimes difficult to establish the factors that actually have impact on the performance, that is, made calculations may not lead to the identification of mathematical functions...|$|R
