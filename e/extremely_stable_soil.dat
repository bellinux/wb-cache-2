40|$|The {{components}} of a turfgrass ecosystem, including plants, an intervening layer of thatch and the underlying soil, influence the fate of topically applied urea fertilizer. The loss of urea N by ammonia volatilization may be governed by the rate of urea hydrolysis. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the extent of urease activity associated with turfgrass plant tissue, thatch, and the underlying soil. This information may help elucidate the mechanism of ammonia loss following urea application. Because a turfgrass stand frequently possesses an extensive thatch layer that may serve as the primary plant growth medium, additional objectives included: i) determining the effects of air drying and seasonal variation on the activity of urease in thatch; ii) determining the variability in thatch urease activity by analyzing multiple field samples; and iii) determining the variation of urease activity within a thatch profile. Turfgrass clippings, thatch, and underlying Flanagan silt loam soil (Aquic Argiudoll) samples were taken from a field-grown Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) turf in either September 1980 or March 1981. On a dry weight basis, urease activity was 18 to 30 times higher from turfgrass clippings and thatch than from soil. Air drying thatch increased urease activity by 20 % over moist samples while air drying soil samples had no apparent effect. Greenhouse incubation of winter-dormant thatch samples increased urease activity 40 %, presumably in response to the duration of increased temperature. Thatch urease activity varied between sampling sites but still remained extremely high compared to soil activity. Within each thatch sample (1 X 1 X 2 cm), urease activity was highest in the upper 1. 0 cm of the profile. It was concluded that thatch urease activity was variable in nature depending upon seasonal conditions which contrasts sharply with <b>extremely</b> <b>stable</b> <b>soil</b> urease activities. These findings suggest that, because of the high level of urease in thatch, ammonia volatilization will occur from most urea-treated turfgrass stands, regardless of the type of underlying soil unless the urea is thoroughly washed into the soil...|$|E
