Therefore, comparison of the concordance and discordance between romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> may elucidate potential treatments for addiction. This focused review uses the evidences from our recent studies to compare the neural alterations between romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction,</b> moreover we also compare the behavioral and neurochemical alterations between romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction.</b> From the behavioral comparisons we find {{that there are many}} similarities between the early stage of romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction,</b> and this stage romantic love is considered as a behavioral addiction, while significant differences exist between the later stage of romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction,</b> and this stage of romantic love eventually developed into a prosocial behavior. The neuroimaging comparisons suggest that romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> both display the functional enhancement in reward and emotion regulation network. Except the similar neural changes, romantic love display special function enhancement in social cognition network, while <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> display special dysfunction in cognitive control network. The neurochemical comparisons show that there are many similarities in the dopamine (DA) system, while significant differences in oxytocin (OT) system for romantic love and <b>drug</b> <b>addiction.</b> These indicate that the functional alterations in reward and emotion regulation network and the DA system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a behavioral addiction, and the functional alterations in social cognition network and the OT system may be the neurophysiological basis of romantic love as a prosocial behavior. It seems that the OT system is a critical factor for the development of addiction. So we then discuss strategies to treat <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> with OT, and suggest that future research should further investigate OT system interventions aiming to improve cognitive control and/or social cognition functions, in order to develop strategies designed to more effectively treat <b>drug</b> <b>addiction...</b>|$|R

Guidance and Counseling Department of School of Postgraduate Indonesia University of Education, Bandung. The empirical {{and theoretical}} background {{of this research}} shows that drug addiction is one of global threats faced by human being {{all over the world}} and is viewed as universal deviant behavior which is very pathologic since it is against self preservation and the norms of the entire social and cultural environment. A counselee who addicted to drugs often suffers a negative psychological impact, among others, include: negative internal and external thinking orientation, low self-control, depression, weak self-regulation and self-efficacy, low life expectation of wellness, and weak self-direction. The counselee suffering from <b>drugs</b> <b>addiction</b> cannot be ignored. There must be real efforts done integrally, systematically, structurally, and simultaneously by all sides with the inclusion of counselors so that, the counselee can be free from psychological impacts of <b>drugs</b> <b>addiction</b> and able to accomplish functions optimally. One of the efforts is Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling. The objective of this research is to test the effectiveness of Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling that aims to reduce the psychological impacts of the counselees caused by <b>drugs</b> <b>addiction,</b> which include: thinking orientation, low self-control, depression, weak self-regulation and self-efficacy, low life expectation of wellness, and weak self-direction. The research employed true experimental designs with pretest-posttest control group design. The sample of this research were counselees of <b>drugs</b> <b>addiction</b> at the Center of Social Healing Pamardi Putera (BPSPP) Lembang in the district of West Bandung. The sample consisted of 40 people of whom people as the acted experimental group and 20 people as control group. The result of this research shows that Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in reducing the psychological impacts of counselees suffering from <b>drugs</b> <b>addiction.</b> In the first place, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in altering negative internal and external mind orientation of the drug addicted counselee into positive thinking. Second, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in the improvement of self-control of the drug addicted counselee. Third, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in reducing depression of the drug addicted counselee. Fourth, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in the improvement of self-regulation of the drug addicted counselee. Fifth, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in the improvement of self-efficacy of the drug addicted counselee. Sixth, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in the improvement of hope for a better life (wellness) for the drug addicted counselee. Seventh, Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling is effective in the improvement of self-direction of the drug addicted counselee. This research recommends BPSPP, center of social rehabilitation, BNN, BNP, ABKIN, Guidance and Counseling Department, Counselors, and the next researchers to: (1) employ the manual of Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling as counseling guid for drugs addiction; (2) review Cognitive-Behavioral Counseling and carry out empirical tests which are extended to various paths, levels, settings, and populations of drug addicted counselee, and (3) to establish efforts directed to the system of: (a) accreditation and license of <b>drugs</b> <b>addiction</b> counselors; (b) trainings/seminars of guidance and counseling in various paths, levels, settings, and populations suffering from drugs addiction; and (c) in-service trainings...|$|E

Together with further social problems of the day, <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> and its impacts rank worldwide among the most burning issues, particularly {{in terms of their}} reflection in the media. Recently, the issue of drug legalisation has often been discussed widely in the media leaving the impact of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> on the families stricken with this problem out of consideration. At first, the <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> affects solely the addicted family member, but in the course of time, <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> is bound to become a burning issue for the whole family. It depends on each individual family member and their level of the development of protective mechanisms which directly correlate with their chance to master this stressor, the occurrence of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> within the family. The objective of my bachelor paper has been to evaluate the social impact of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> on other family members. In relationship with this objective a hypothesis has been formulated - The social impact of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> on a family the members of which are drug addicted is socially significant and traumatising for the other family members. A quantitative research has been carried out in family members, whose close relatives have been treated for <b>drug</b> <b>addiction.</b> The psychiatric clinic Červený Dvůr and its highly qualified and trained medical staff provided the necessary terms and conditions for this field research. Only 44 percent of the respondents were ready and willing to participate in the research, which shows that this topic still presents a highly sensitive issue, even a taboo, for families with a drug addicted member, as these families strive to protect their private sphere and do not tend to make their <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> family problem public. The questionnaire was focussed on the detection of the social impact related to <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> within the family. Thus, the responses presented a basis for determining the rate and significance of the social impact of <b>drug</b> <b>addiction</b> on the individual respondents. The results of the research section of this bachelor paper actually showed both the social significance of the drug issue and its high traumatic rate for stricken families. The objective of the presented bachelor paper has thus been fulfilled and the results have proved the correctness of the hypothesis...|$|R
