5|$|Frogs {{have served}} as {{experimental}} animals {{throughout the history of}} science. Eighteenth-century biologist Luigi Galvani discovered the link between electricity and the nervous system by studying frogs. In 1852, H. F. Stannius used a frog's heart in a procedure called a Stannius ligature to demonstrate the ventricle and atria beat independently of each other and at different rates. The African clawed frog or platanna (Xenopus laevis) was first widely used in laboratories in pregnancy tests {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. A sample of urine from a pregnant woman injected into a female frog induces it to lay eggs, a discovery made by English zoologist Lancelot Hogben. This is because a hormone, <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin,</b> is present in substantial quantities in the urine of women during pregnancy. In 1952, Robert Briggs and Thomas J. King cloned a frog by somatic cell nuclear transfer. This same technique was later used to create Dolly the sheep, and their experiment was the first time a successful nuclear transplantation had been accomplished in higher animals.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{success of}} ovarian {{follicle}} growth and ovulation is strictly {{related to the}} development of an adequate blood vessel network required to sustain the proliferative and endocrine functions of the follicular cells. Even if the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) drives angiogenesis before ovulation, the local role exerted by Progesterone (P 4) remains to be clarified, in particular when its concentration rapidly increases before ovulation. AIM: This in vivo study was designed to clarify the effect promoted by a P 4 receptor antagonist, RU 486, on VEGF expression and follicular angiogenesis before ovulation, in particular, during the transition from pre to periovulatory follicles induced by <b>human</b> <b>Chorionic</b> <b>Gonadotropins</b> (hCG) administration. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Preovulatory follicle growth and ovulation were pharmacologically induced in prepubertal gilts by combining equine <b>Chorionic</b> <b>Gonadotropins</b> (eCG) and hCG used in {{the presence or absence of}} RU 486. The effects on VEGF expression were analyzed using biochemical and immunohistochemical studies, either on granulosa or on theca layers of follicles isolated few hours before ovulation. This angiogenic factor was also correlated to follicular morphology and to blood vessels architecture. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: VEGF production, blood vessel network and follicle remodeling were impaired by RU 486 treatment, even if the cause-effect correlation remains to be clarified. The P 4 antagonist strongly down-regulated theca VEGF expression, thus, preventing most of the angiogenic follicle response induced by hCG. RU 486 -treated follicles displayed a reduced vascular area, a lower rate of endothelial cell proliferation and a reduced recruitment of perivascular mural cells. These data provide important insights on the biological role of RU 486 and, indirectly, on steroid hormones during periovulatory follicular phase. In addition, an in vivo model is proposed to evaluate how periovulatory follicular angiogenesis may affect the functionality of the corpus luteum (CL) and the success of pregnancy...|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{research}} into immunity that inhibits gamete outcome has focused on <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG). hCG is not necessary for fertilization, but is secreted by embryos shortly thereafter.

25|$|For {{women with}} germ-cell tumors, {{follow-up}} tests generally include alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and/or <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin.</b> For women with stromal cancers, tests for hormones like estrogen, testosterone, and inhibin are sometimes helpful.

40|$|By using radioimmunoassay, the {{interaction}} of sheep lutropin (luteinizing hormone, LH) beta-subunit with rat ovarian receptors was investigated. The binding of beta-subunit was specific, although of much lower order than that of lutropin. Sheep lutropin beta-subunit effectively inhibited the binding of <b>human</b> choriogonadotropin (<b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin,</b> gCG) to the ovary, showing that both occupy the same sites. The binding of sheep lutropin beta-subunit to ovary was not followed by any detectable increase in cyclic AMP. The ovarian response to lutropin in terms of cyclic AMP production was inhibited {{in the presence of}} free beta-subunit. The alpha-subunit of lutropin, when used at concentrations where contamination with whole lutropin was negligible, enhanced the degree of binding of beta-subunit; this did not lead to increased cyclic AMP in the tissue. Surprisingly, the binding of beta-subunit in vitro was drastically decreased by the prior removal of all endogenous rat lutropin bound to receptors.

40|$|Mitogen-activated {{protein kinase}} 3 / 1 (Mapk 3 / 1) pathway is {{critical}} for LH signal transduction during ovulation. However, the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that Mapk pathway regulates ovulation through transcriptional regulation of ovulatory genes. To test this hypothesis we used immature mice superovulated with equine and <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> (eCG and hCG) and PD 0325901, to inhibit hCG-induced Mapk 3 / 1 activity. Mice received either the inhibitor PD 0325901 (25 μg/g, i. p.) or vehicle at 2 h before hCG stimulation. Administration of the inhibitor abolished Mapk 3 / 1 phosphorylation in granulosa cells. While vehicle-treated mice ovulated normally, there were no ovulations in inhibitor-treated mice. First, we analyzed gene expression in granulosa cells at 0 h, 1 h and 4 h post-hCG. There was expected hCG-driven increase in mRNA abundance of many ovulation-related genes including Ptgs 2 in vehicle-treated granulosa cells, but not (P< 0. 05) in inhibitor-treated group. There was also reduced mRNA and protein abundance of the transcription factor, early growth response 1 (Egr 1) in inhibitor-treated granulosa cells. We then used GRMO 2 cell-line to test if Egr 1 is recruited to promoter of Ptgs 2 followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with either Egr 1 or control antibody. Enrichment of the promoter regions in immunoprecipitants of Egr 1 antibody indicated that Egr 1 binds to the Ptgs 2 promoter. We then knocked down Egr 1 expression in mouse primary granulosa cells using siRNA technology. Treatment with Egr 1 -siRNA inhibited Egr 1 transcript accumulation, which was associated with reduced expression of Ptgs 2 when compared to control-siRNA treated granulosa cells. These data demonstrate that transient inhibition of LH-stimulated MAPK 3 / 1 activity abrogates ovulation in mice. We conclude that Mapk 3 / 1 regulates ovulation, at least in part, through Egr 1 and its target gene, Ptgs 2 in granulosa cells of ovulating follicles in mice...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear {{progesterone}} receptor (Pgr) {{is one of}} {{the major}} mediators for progestin signaling during oocyte ovulation in vertebrates. However, any roles Pgr may play in oocyte growth, and especially in the final oocyte maturation, are controversial. Due to the small size of the oocytes and difficulty in separation of encircled follicular cells from oocytes, little information is available on the location and changes of Pgr in vertebrates. We study the roles of the Pgr in the ovaries of zebrafish, which release eggs daily, by localizing and comparing the changes of Pgr in the oocytes and enclosed follicular layers at all developmental stages and from different times of the day or after treatment with various hormones. The pgr transcript and Pgr protein were expressed in oocytes and follicular cells of early developmental stages (stage I and II). In contrast, Pgr was expressed abundantly in the follicular cells surrounding late developmental stage oocytes (stage IV) but completely absent from stage IV oocytes. Furthermore, the most significant daily changes of pgr transcript were observed in the stage IV follicular cells with the highest level observed at 6 am prior to ovulation and the lowest level at 9 pm. The levels of pgr transcript were upregulated by 17 alpha, 20 beta-dihydroxy- 4 -pregnen- 3 -one (DHP) in both stages of I-II and IV oocytes. Intriguingly, estrogen (E 2) and <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropins</b> (hCG) significantly suppressed pgr expression in stage I-II oocytes, while enhancing pgr expression in stage IV oocytes. Presence of Pgr in both oocytes and follicular cells of early stages (stages I-II) suggest roles of Pgr in oocyte growth. Abundant expression and dramatic changes of Pgr in the follicular cells of late stage (stage IV) indicate roles of Pgr during oocyte ovulation. Absence and lack of changes of Pgr in the stage IV ooctyes do not support the role of Pgr in final oocyte maturation.   M. S...|$|R

25|$|Risk {{factors for}} ectopic {{pregnancy}} include: pelvic inflammatory disease, often due to Chlamydia infection, tobacco smoking, prior tubal surgery, {{a history of}} infertility, {{and the use of}} assisted reproductive technology. Those who have previously had an ectopic pregnancy are at much higher risk of having another one. Most ectopic pregnancies (90%) occur in the Fallopian tube which are known as tubal pregnancies. Implantation can also occur on the cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen. Detection of ectopic pregnancy is typically by blood tests for <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) and ultrasound. This may require testing on more than one occasion. Ultrasound works best when performed from within the vagina. Other causes of similar symptoms include: miscarriage, ovarian torsion, and acute appendicitis.|$|E
25|$|When the undescended testis {{is in the}} {{inguinal}} canal, hormonal {{therapy is}} sometimes attempted and very occasionally successful. The most commonly used hormone therapy is <b>human</b> <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (HCG). A series of hCG injections (10 injections over 5 weeks is common) is given {{and the status of}} the testis/testes is reassessed at the end. Although many trials have been published, the reported success rates range widely, from roughly 5 to 50%, probably reflecting the varying criteria for distinguishing retractile testes from low inguinal testes. Hormone treatment does have the occasional incidental benefits of allowing confirmation of Leydig cell responsiveness (proven by a rise of the testosterone {{by the end of the}} injections) or inducing additional growth of a small penis (via the testosterone rise). Some surgeons have reported facilitation of surgery, perhaps by enhancing the size, vascularity, or healing of the tissue. A newer hormonal intervention used in Europe is the use of GnRH analogs such as nafarelin or buserelin; the success rates and putative mechanism of action are similar to hCG, but some surgeons have combined the two treatments and reported higher descent rates. Limited evidence suggests that germ cell count is slightly better after hormone treatment; whether this translates into better sperm counts and fertility rates at maturity has not been established. The cost of either type of hormone treatment is less than that of surgery and the chance of complications at appropriate doses is minimal. Nevertheless, despite the potential advantages of a trial of hormonal therapy, many surgeons do not consider the success rates high enough to be worth the trouble since the surgery itself is usually simple and uncomplicated.|$|E

Absorption and fluorescence spectra of the isolated subunits have also been measured. From the spectra the extinction coefficient, fluorescence quantum yield and anisotropy have been calculated. Global analysis is used to characterize the bands in the spectra. The adsorption, CD, LD and fluorescence xcitation spectra ll contain a band around 300 nm {{that appears to be}} a sensitive indicator for the intactness of the protein. Evidence is provided for the involvement of tyrosinate in the fluorescence, and for a close contact between the tryptophan (in the fl subunit) with at least one tyrosine of the a subunit. The overall secondary structure of recFSH has been determined from its far-UV CD and its IR absorption spectrum. The secondary structure of recFSH is estimated to contain 15 - 25 % a-helix, 15 - 25 % fl-turn and 30 - 40 % fl-sheet. The fl-sheet in recFSH is almost exclusively antiparallel.

40|$|Stanniocalcin (STC) is a {{recently}} discovered mammalian hormone that is widely distributed in many tissues. In rodents the STC gene is most highly expressed in ovary, specifically in androgen-producing thecal and interstitial cells. In addition, ovarian levels of expression rise 15 -fold over pregnancy. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop a primary culture system for ovarian thecal-interstitial cells (TICs) to identify factors governing STC production and release. We used highly purified primary cultures of rat and bovine TICs, the purity of which was routinely assessed with antigenic and enzymatic markers. The functionality of cells was assured by their responsiveness to LH in the form of progesterone release. We found that forskolin significantly increased STC gene expression and secretion by both rat and bovine TICs, an effect that was only replicated by <b>human</b> (h) <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (CG). Coincubation of TICs with hCG and phosphodiesterase inhibitors further increased STC secretion, whereas coincubation of TICs with hCG and protein kinase A inhibitors attenuated hCG-stimulated release.

40|$|Implantation {{requires}} {{communication between}} a receptive endometrium {{and a healthy}} blastocyst. This maternal-embryonic crosstalk involves local mediators within the uterine microenvironment. We demonstrate that a secreted protein, prokineticin 1 (PROK 1), is expressed in the receptive endometrium and during early pregnancy. PROK 1 induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in endometrial epithelial cells and first trimester decidua via a Gq-Ca 2 +-cSrc-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated pathway. We show that <b>human</b> embryonic <b>chorionic</b> <b>gonadotropin</b> (hCG) induces sequential mRNA expression of PROK 1 and LIF in an in vivo baboon model, in human endometrial epithelial cells, and in first-trimester decidua.

Dual immunohistochemical analysis colocalized expression of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor, PROK 1, PROKR 1, and LIF to the glandular epithelial cells of the first trimester decidual tissue. PROK 1 enhances adhesion of trophoblast cells to fibronectin and laminin matrices, which are mediated predominantly via LIF induction.
