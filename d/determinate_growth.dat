40|$|SummaryPlant shoots display {{indeterminate}} growth, {{while their}} evolutionary decedents, the leaves, are <b>determinate.</b> <b>Determinate</b> leaf <b>growth</b> is conditioned by the CIN-TCP transcription factors, which promote leaf maturation and are negatively regulated by miR 319 in leaf primordia. Here {{we show that}} CIN-TCPs reduce leaf sensitivity to cytokinin (CK), a phytohormone implicated in inhibition of differentiation in the shoot. We identify the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM) as a genetic mediator of CIN-TCP activities and CK responses. An interactome screen further revealed that SWI/SNF complex components including BRM preferentially interacted with basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors and the bHLH-related CIN-TCPs. Indeed, TCP 4 and BRM interacted in planta. Both TCP 4 and BRM bound the promoter of an inhibitor of CK responses, ARR 16, and induced its expression. Reconstituting ARR 16 levels in leaves with reduced CIN-TCP activity restored normal growth. Thus, CIN-TCP and BRM together promote <b>determinate</b> leaf <b>growth</b> by stage-specific modification of CK responses...|$|R

Life history studies would benefit from a better understanding of strategies and mechanisms of growth, but still no comparative research on individual growth strategies has been conducted. Growth patterns and methods have been shaped by evolution and a great variety of them are observed. Two distinct patterns - <b>determinate</b> and indeterminate <b>growth</b> - are of a special interest for these studies since they present qualitatively different outcomes of evolution. We attempt to draw together studies covering growth in plant and animal species across a wide range of phyla focusing primarily on the noted qualitative features.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to study the pattern, rate and duration of seed dry weight (SDW) and oil accumulation in two improved noug varieties during 1995 and 1996. Seeds from uniformly flowered heads were harvested manually seven days after anthesis initiation (DAAI) and continued for 60 days with four days interval.

The study shows that the extended reproductive period in noug could be well shortened by selecting plants with <b>determinate</b> or semi-determinate <b>growth</b> habit without affecting seed and oil yield.

The primary conductive clusters are formed as a result of differentiation between meristematic cells of apices. Populations of cultivated common buckwheat are polymorphic by anatomic structure of fibro-vascular system of stalk. This polymorphism caused by the presence or lack of meristematic activity of cambium of 1 st- 4 th internodes.

50|$|This {{growth rate}} is much {{slower than the}} rate seen in large pterodactyloid pterosaurs, such as Pteranodon, which {{attained}} near-adult size within {{the first year of}} life.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{evolutionary}} transitions of the mammaliaform lineage was the origin of a typically mammalian pattern of growth. This is characterized by rapid juvenile growth followed by abrupt cessation of growth at adult size and may be linked with other important mammaliaform apomorphies of dental replacement and morphology. Investigation of growth patterns in the tritylodontid cynodont Oligokyphus and the basal mammaliaform Morganucodon provides insight into this crucial transition. We collected mandibular depth measurements from large samples of Morganucodon and Oligokyphus and constructed distributions of mandibular depth versus frequency for each species. These were compared with distributions from species from three different growth classes of extant amniote: testudines + crocodilians, mammals + birds, and lepidosaurs. Discriminant function {{analysis was used to}} differentiate between known growth classes by using different combinations of three measures of mandibular depth distribution shape (skew, kurtosis, and coefficient of variation) as proxies for different juvenile and adult growth patterns. Classification of the fossil species showed that Morganucodon closely resembled extant placental mammals in having rapid juvenile growth followed by truncated, <b>determinate</b> adult <b>growth.</b> Oligokyphus showed intermediate growth patterns, with more extended adult growth patterns than Morganucodon and slightly slower juvenile growth. This suggests a gradual evolution of mammalian growth patterns across the cynodont to mammaliaform transition, possibly with the origin of rapid juvenile growth preceding that of truncated, <b>determinate</b> adult <b>growth.</b> In turn, acquisition of both these aspects of mammalian growth was likely necessary for the evolution of diphyodont tooth replacement in the mammaliaform lineage.
