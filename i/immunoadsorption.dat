50|$|Artificial cell hemoperfusion {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a less costly and more efficient detoxifying option than hemodialysis, in which blood filtering takes place only through size separation by a physical membrane. In hemoperfusion, thousands of adsorbent artificial cells are retained inside a small container {{through the use of}} two screens on either end through which patient blood perfuses. As the blood circulates, toxins or drugs diffuse into the cells and are retained by the absorbing material. The membranes of artificial cells are much thinner those used in dialysis and their small size means that they have a high membrane surface area. This means that a portion of cell can have a theoretical mass transfer that is a hundredfold higher than that of a whole artificial kidney machine. The device has been established as a routine clinical method for patients treated for accidental or suicidal poisoning but has also been introduced as therapy in liver failure and kidney failure by carrying out part of the function of these organs.Artificial cell hemoperfusion has also been proposed for use in <b>immunoadsorption</b> through which antibodies can be removed from the body by attaching an immunoadsorbing material such as albumin {{on the surface of the}} artificial cells. This principle has been used to remove blood group antibodies from plasma for bone marrow transplantation and for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia through monoclonal antibodies to remove low-density lipoproteins. Hemoperfusion is especially useful in countries with a weak hemodialysis manufacturing industry as the devices tend to be cheaper there and used in kidney failure patients.|$|E

During his medical studies {{he was promoted}} as a scholar of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung. For several years {{he used to work}} as the speaker for this organization in Munich. After his medical degree in 1993 he worked as a physician in a traineeship of the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery/Klinikum Großhadern in the team of Bruno Reichart. Brenner withdrew 1996 and 1997 among the last twenty applicants for a cosmonaut trainee program in Star City (Zvyozdny gorodok) in Russia in a national (15.000 applicants) and international (150.000 applicants) final selection. Today {{he is a member of}} the Verein zur Förderung der Raumfahrt. From 1995 to 97 he worked as a scientific assistant at the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery hospital and polyclinic, Klinikum Großhadern of the LMU Munich and became admitted to leader for clinical, pharmacological studies. Brenner was promoted to doctor of medicine at the Physiological Institute of the LMU Munich with magna cum laude 1995. His dissertation covered the effect of different peptides on the sympathetic nervous system of Brown-Norway rats before and after inhibition of converting enzyme. This work was essential for the development of the medicine Ramipril. In 1997 he obtained a scholarship of the Bavarian Research Foundation (Bayerische Forschungsstiftung) for a project dealing with the development of gene technological and mechanical proceedings to realize xenogeneic transplantation of pig organs at the Institute for Surgery Research of the LMU. In the framework of this project among others he performed various xenoperfusion and transplantation test series of landrace- and transgenic pig hearts. In 1999 Brenner moved within the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery of the LMU in the team of Bruno Reichart into the Augustinum. In 2003 he concluded the specialist training for cardiac surgery. He continued to work at the xenotransplantation follow-up project dealing with the production of multi-transgenic pigs and the development of iimmunomodulatoryl strategies for the clinical xenotransplantation. In the same year he moved as a surgeon to the Klinikum Großhadern of the LMU at the same Dept. of Cardiac Surgery. In 2004 he finished his habilitation with a work on the influence of <b>immunoadsorption</b> on xenogenic immunosuppression mechanisms in a perfusion model and in xenotranplantation of landrace an hDAF transgenic pig hearts in primates, recorded in a work encompassing 1450 pages. In 2004 he reached “venia legendi”, was named “Privatdozent” and functional attending chief resident and in 2006 attending deputy at the Dept. of Cardiac Surgery and member of the Munich Lung Transplantation Group (ex- und implantation). In 2011 Brenner was named associate professor at the LMU and was promoted to the degree of an academic director in 2012.|$|E
5000|$|Since 1993 Brenner {{deals with}} topics of {{thoracic}} organ transplantation, since 2004 as a transplant surgeon {{of heart and}} lung transplantation, since 2006 {{as a member of}} the Munich Lung Transplant Group and already since 2000 as an explant surgeon of the German Organ Transplantation Foundation (Deutsche Stiftung Organtransplantation (DSO)). Yet 1993 he acted as a junior operator of the former Baxter Novacor Company for the wearable artificial heart system Novacor and researched at last as a proctor of JarvikHeart in cooperation with Robert Jarvik developing a new miniaturized “valve axial pump”. Supported by the Bavarian Research Foundation (Bayerische Forschungsstiftung, grant 219/96) together with his research team as a consultant of cardiac surgery he investigated the xenogeneic transplantation of multi-transgenic pig hearts as a possible future organ replacement therapy in man since 1997. Since 2004 he worked within the scope of a Transregio Research Group FOR 535 of the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)) and since 2012 as a principal investigator (PI) for the sector of xenogeneic heart transplantation of the Transregio Research Collaborative Research Centre 127 (Transregio-Sonderforschungbereich SFB 127) with the speaker Bruno Reichart in the Walter-Brendel-Center of experimental medicine (WBex). Cardiac xenotransplantation (from pig to man), which was studied by Brenner and Reichart since 1997, has reached a preclinical status despite of a higher immunological complexity than allotransplantation due to preexisting and new-built antibodies against whole organs. Using a patented combination (EP 1181034 B1, EP 1980263A1, US 8,435,520 B2) consisting of transgenic organs/cells and <b>immunoadsorption</b> (elimination of antibodies from the recipient) and a special combination of immunosuppressive drugs hyperacute and delayed xenograft rejection should be prevented and long-term survival of a xenograft should be enabled and realized. In times of massively increasing shortage of donor organs and yet major problems with artificial hearts (cable connections, batteries, strokes and infections) this makes xenotransplantation highly interesting in the area of organ/cell transplantation. By using an almost unlimited source of porcine organs (heart, kidney, lung, cornea, (liver rather improbably) and cells (pig islet cells) against diabetes, nigrostriatal brain cells against Morbus Parkinson, stem cells, bone/-marrow, skin etc.) not only in Europe, but also worldwide many people could be helped with animal cells or with the replacement of a whole organ. In view of 45 original papers, over 110 national and international oral presentations, two highly prized international research awards and as an advising tutor of 20 postdocs and postgraduates (for example [...] ) Brenner did pioneer work and substantially contributed to the scientific progress of the LMU, especially due to his know-how in the area of xenotransplantation and mechanical circulatory support systems. Brenner can be classified as an international expert for mechanical and “biological” heart replacement, wherefore he also owns patents (for example [...] ). In his teaching activity since 2004 Brenner was involved in the introduction of the practical MECUM student educational program of the LMU oriented to the Harvard-University concept. Since 2007 he was the responsible organizing associate lecturer for the compartment of cardiac surgery of the LMU and since 2011 deputy speaker of the cardiovascular educational block of the new medical student education system Modul 23 of the LMU. As the leader of the cardiac surgical advanced training program he organized about 400 specialist and scientific qualification performances mostly as from the Bayerische Landesärztekammer certificated Monday education for consultant training and professional development since 2003. [...] Novel research focuses and interests of Brenner are miniaturized artificial hearts in heart valves (in cooperation with Robert Jarvik), inhibition of aging enzymes, cryonic, energy and environment technology (e.g. e-mobility), essential oils as well as ebola.|$|E

Miniature membrane plasma separators coupled with a Protein A (PA) -Sepharose immunoadsorbent column were used to perform upon conscious rabbits 5 IgG <b>immunoadsorption</b> treatments over 6 days. Quantitation of anti-myelin IgG and IgM by ELISA revealed that 55 - 65 % of plasma IgG was removed per treatment.

40|$|Background. <b>Immunoadsorption</b> is {{increasingly}} {{used to treat}} antibody-mediated autoimmune diseases. To prevent microbial growth during storage, reusable protein A–Sepharose gel columns are primed with ethyl mercury thiosalicylate (thiomersal, 0. 1 % solu-tion) and rinsed with phosphate buffer before use. In this study, we tested the hypothesis of systemic mercury exposure in protein A <b>immunoadsorption.</b> Methods. Whole blood mercury levels were measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy before and after protein A <b>immunoadsorption</b> (11 patients, 26 treat-ments), anti-IgG <b>immunoadsorption</b> (eight patients, 13 treatments) and LDL apheresis (DALI and Thera-sorb systems; nine patients, 14 treatments). Results. Patients treated with protein A immunoad-sorption had significantly elevated baseline mercury levels compared with the other groups, which were not different from healthy controls. Following protein A <b>immunoadsorption,</b> mercury levels increased from 5. 9 ± 1. 4 mg/l (mean±SEM, normal, < 5 mg/l) to 32. 3 ± 5. 7 mg/l, P< 0. 001). In one intensively treated patient, acute neurological toxicity developed at a mercury level of 107 mg/l.

No mercury release to patients occurred in anti-IgG <b>immunoadsorption</b> or LDL apheresis treatments. Conclusion. This preliminary report suggests that protein A <b>immunoadsorption</b> columns primed with thiomersal during storage may cause a sustained increase of systemic mercury concentrations, which exceed current safety recommendations in a propor-tion of patients.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESIn a substudy to a {{recently}} reported investigation that demonstrated {{the benefit of}} immunoglobulin adsorption (<b>immunoadsorption)</b> for patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC), we tested whether this benefit {{is associated with a}} reduction of oxidative stress. BACKGROUNDThe progression of cardiomyopathy is believed {{to be related to the}} increase of oxidative stress. Therefore, reduction of oxidative stress could be one of the effects of <b>immunoadsorption</b> for improvement of cardiac performance and clinical status. METHODSPlasma markers for oxidative stress—thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), lipid peroxides (LPO), anti-oxidized low-density lipoprotein-autoantibodies (anti-oxLDL-AB), thiol groups and vitamin E—were compared in 31 patients, of whom 16 underwent <b>immunoadsorption</b> and 15 received conventional treatment (controls). All patients received a daily supplement of vitamins, minerals and trace elements. RESULTSAfter one year, TBARS (p = 0. 026), LPO (p = 0. 026) and anti-oxLDL-AB (p = 0. 044) were decreased in the <b>immunoadsorption</b> group but not in the controls. Thiols were unchanged in the <b>immunoadsorption</b> group but were decreased in the controls (p = 0. 001). Vitamin E accumulated in both groups (immunoadsorption: p = 0. 001; controls: p = 0. 031) with a trend for stronger accumulation after <b>immunoadsorption</b> (p = 0. 09). Prior to the study, the anti-oxLDL-AB to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p = 0. 05) were inversely correlated. After one year, correlations with borderline significance were calculated for TBARS to New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0. 081) and inversely for LPO to LVEF (p = 0. 083).

40|$|Introduction: Acute {{vascular}} rejection {{is one of}} {{the major}} challenges in human allogenic organ transplantation. The aim of the treatment is the elimination of circulating de novo donor specific antibodies (DSA). The extracorporeal elimination of DSA with <b>immunoadsorption</b> is a specific and efficient treatment option. We report about our results with <b>immunoadsorption</b> for patients with acute vascular rejection after renal transplantation. Material and Methods: We retrospectively analysed the results of <b>immunoadsorption</b> in our transplantation centre. 365 renal transplantation were performed in Rostock centre between 2002 and 2009. In all cases of acute vascular rejection (n= 16), patients were treated with <b>immunoadsorption.</b> Extracorporeal elimination of antibodies was carried out with Ig TheraSorb® columns (Miltenyi, Germany). Results: Overall 89 sessions of <b>immunoadsorption</b> were performed in the 16 patients. The individual number of sessions ranged from 2 to 9 per patient (mean 5. 6). 12 / 16 patients showed improved graft function with a decrease of serum creatinine > 50 % (responders). The remaining 4 patients had only a marginal improvement of graft function (non-responders). The graft survival rate was significantly better in the responder group compared to non-responders. All grafts of the responder group except one show stable function (maximum follow up 60 months). There were no relevant side effects of the treatment.

40|$|Plasma {{exchange}} (PE) and ex vivo <b>immunoadsorption</b> (IA) may {{be applicable}} to the removal of anti-insulin antibodies (AI-Ab) from diabetic patients.

The effects of both PE and IA on AI-Ab synthesis were studied in a rabbit model. Rabbits were immunized with insulin and the resulting AI-Abs removed by both plasma exchange and specific <b>immunoadsorption.</b> Following AI-Ab removal by PE no increase in AI-Ab synthesis or antibody overshoot occurred. However a large increase in AI-Ab synthesis and overshoot occurred following specific AI-Ab removal by <b>immunoadsorption.</b> Despite similar reductions in AI-Ab levels by PE and IA, no increase in antibody synthesis occurred due solely to antibody removal.

40|$|ABO-incompatible kidney {{transplantation}} using <b>immunoadsorption</b> {{to remove}} anti-A/B antibodies {{has become a}} successful clinical practice. Since the data on the specificity of the ABO columns are controversial, the present study assessed the efficiency and specificity of the ABO <b>immunoadsorption,</b> the effect on total immunoglobulins and antibodies previously induced by vaccination. Anti-A/B antibodies were measured by agglutination and ABO flow cytometry, total IgG/IgM, carbohydrate- and protein-specific antibodies by nephelometry and ELISA. The first <b>immunoadsorption</b> not only efficiently reduced donor-specific anti-A/B IgM (81 %) and IgG (56 %) but also reduced compatible anti-A/B IgM (59 %) and IgG (34 %). The measurements of antidonor A/B antibodies by direct agglutination (IgM) or flow cytometry better represented the effective antibody levels than the indirect agglutination test (IgG). The median reduction of total IgM and total IgG levels after a single <b>immunoadsorption</b> was 34 % and 18 %, respectively. Antibodies against pneumococcus and haemophilus polysaccharide antigens were significantly reduced, whereas antitetanus and antidiphtheria protein antibodies were not affected. Intravenous immunoglobulin administration restored the protective anticarbohydrate antibody levels. In summary, <b>immunoadsorption</b> efficiently removed antidonor A/B antibodies, but was not specific for A/B antigens.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{patients}} with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and severe congestive heart failure, <b>immunoadsorption</b> (IA) and subsequent IgG substitution {{leads to an}} acute and prolonged hemodynamic improvement. Goal {{of this study was}} to investigate the long-term effect of <b>immunoadsorption</b> on morbidity and quality of life. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis 34 patients were included - 17 patients who have received <b>immunoadsorption</b> therapy and 17 control patients who did not. Inclusion criteria were DCM, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 35 % and NYHA classes II-III. The average time after <b>immunoadsorption</b> was 3. 0 years. Both groups did not differ concerning sex, age, duration of disease, medication and NYHA class. All patients filled in a questionnaire, which was the main instrument of this study. The questionnaire consisted of questions concerning duration of disease, number of hospitalization days due to heart failure, medication, date of IA therapy and quality of life. The data of echocardiography and current medication was obtained from the medical records of these patients. RESULTS: In patients who have received <b>immunoadsorption</b> (IA) the days of hospitalisation for congestive heart failure per year could be significantly reduced in contrast to the control patients (17. 2 days prior to IA, 4. 3 days after IA). Even if the procedural days for <b>immunoadsorption</b> were included (on average 14. 5 days) there was still a significant reduction of hospitalisation if IA therapy was longer than 2. 5 years ago. Furthermore IA induced an acute increase in EF (19. 8 to 25. 7 %, p< 0. 01 vs. baseline). The questionnaire investigating quality of life at one time point did not reveal a significant difference between both groups.

40|$|Abstract: Several autoantibodies {{directed}} against cardiac cellular proteins including G-protein-linked receptors, contractile proteins and mitochondrial proteins, {{have been identified}} in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Among these autoantibodies, anti-� 1 -adrenoreceptor (AR) antibodies have long been discussed in terms of their pathogenetic role in DCM. Anti-� 1 -AR antibody-positive patients with DCM showed significant deterioration of NYHA functional class as well as reduced cardiac function compared to those in autoantibody-negative patients. Various studies with a limited number of patients indicate that the use of <b>immunoadsorption</b> to eliminate immunoglobulin G (IgG) significantly improves cardiac performance and clinical status in heart failure patients. Since removal of autoantibodies of the IgG 3 subclass induces hemodynamic improvement and an increase in the left ventricular ejection fraction, antibodies belonging to IgG 3 such as anti-� 1 -AR antibodies might {{play an important role in}} reducing cardiac function in patients with DCM. According to a recent report, however, the effect of hemodynamic improvement by <b>immunoadsorption</b> threapy was similar among patients who were positive and negative for anti-� 1 -AR antibodies, indicating that the beneficial effects of <b>immunoadsorption</b> might be not directly associated with the selective elimination of the � 1 -AR autoantibodies. <b>Immunoadsorption</b> therapy is a new therapeutic option for patients with DCM and heart failure, but further investigations are required to elucidate the specific antigens of cardiac autoantibodies responsible for the hemodynamic effects.

40|$|Background and Design: Plasmapheresis or <b>immunoadsorption</b> {{which is}} a more {{advanced}} method are among the treatment options that induce a rapid remission in severe and resistant pemphigus. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of plasmapheresis or <b>immunoadsorption</b> therapies via the clinical experience gained from our patients with pemphigus vulgaris and paraneoplastic pemphigus. Materials and Methods: Among patients who were diagnosed with pemphigus according to the histopathology and/or immunofluorescence methods and followed-up at our bullous diseases outpatient clinic between the years 1987 and 2013, 7 patients (5 PV, 2 PNP), who were treated with plasmapheresis or <b>immunoadsorption,</b> were retrospectively analyzed. Among these patients, 3 were treated with classical plasmapheresis, whereas 2 with double-filtration plasmapheresis, 1 with <b>immunoadsorption,</b> and 1 initially with classical plasmapheresis followed by <b>immunoadsorption</b> due to impairment of the hemodynamic parameters. The clinical findings, antibody titers, and immunological responses before and after the therapy, the therapy dosages and adverse effects were evaluated according to the data gained from the patient files. Results: In 4 patients (1., 3., 4. and 5. patients) with pemphigus vulgaris, complete clinical response was achieved, while 1 patient (2. patient) showed partial regression in skin lesions. In both of the patients (6., 7. patients) with paraneoplastic pemphigus the therapy discontinued due to complications. In all of the evaluated patients, the analysis of the antibody titers before and after the therapy revealed lower levels in comparison to those detected at the initiation of the therapy. In 2 patients hypoalbuminemia and in 2 patients catheter infection were developed as the side effects of the therapy. Conclusion: Even though plasmapheresis or <b>immunoadsorption</b> may be chosen as a good mid-treatment method to decrease the severity of the disease especially in resistant patients with pemphigus, it must be borne in mind that because of the exacerbations that may be seen after the treatment, these therapies should be used in combination with immunosuppressives, and are not effective in the long-term...|$|E

40|$|Background—Idiopathic dilated {{cardiomyopathy}} (IDC) frequently is {{a progressive}} disease without causative therapy options. Following {{the hypothesis that}} in certain patients autoantibodies against cardiac structures may induce, maintain, or promote the progression of the disease, we investigated whether the elimination of these autoantibodies through <b>immunoadsorption</b> would improve cardiac function. Methods and Results—This prospective case-control study included 34 patients with IDC. Each patient presented with moderate to severe heart failure and evidence of autoantibodies directed against � 1 -adrenoceptors (� 1 -AABs). Seventeen patients received standard medical therapy (control group), whereas 17 were also treated with <b>immunoadsorption</b> (treatment group) to eliminate � 1 -AABs. A 1 -year follow-up included echocardiographic assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction and internal diameters, � 1 -AAB levels, and clinical status every 3 months.

40|$|<b>Immunoadsorption</b> {{possesses}} {{an attractive}} combination of selectivity and yield, {{and in some}} cases may replace many conventional purification steps with a single step. The economic performance of <b>immunoadsorption</b> is dependent on apparatus configuration (e. g. Sepharose(R) bed, perfusive bed and membrane.), operating conditions (e. g. bed depth, flow rate and concentration of adsorbate in the effluent at break-through) and antibody binding kinetics. The solution space for the lowest operating cost is potentially very large and is prohibitive to exhaustively investigate in the laboratory. A mathematical model of a generic <b>immunoadsorption</b> process is useful in identifying the most promising configurations, operating conditions and antibodies, without having to resort to experiments that explore every possibility. The model system was chosen to represent the purification of a valuable biochemical product (1000 mg) from mammalian cell culture media or milk where the protein is present at low concentration (2 mg l(- 1)). The antigen-antibody kinetic rate constants for a bovine serum albumin-monoclonal antibody system are available in the literature and were representative for this study. A modified chromatographic model was developed to predict the dimensionless operating cost of the generic <b>immunoadsorption</b> system subject to different apparatus configurations, operating conditions and antibody kinetics. Optimal operating conditions {{for each of the three}} configurations were identified. Under these conditions, the operating costs for a perfusive bed and a membrane were comparable and 28 % lower than for a packed bed. The antibody binding kinetics significantly affected the dimensionless operating cost of the system and, therefore, the model can help select the most suitable antibody from a panel of prospective antibodies.

40|$|<b>IMMUNOADSORPTION</b> APHERESIS FOR SEVERE SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS WITH NEPHRITIS: A PIVOTAL STUDYClaudia Stefanutti, M. D.,Ph. D. Extracorporeal Therapeutic Techniques Unit - Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, University of Rome 'La Sapienza', ROME, ItalyIntroduction: The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have glomerulonephritis is poor, despite treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. Indications for the use of apheresis technologies in managing SLE have undergone numerous remodelling since the first attempt of treatment in 1974. Once thought to be a promising treatment for SLE, apheresis has been limited as an adjunct in managing the disorder. <b>Immunoadsorption</b> Apheresis (IA) has been only recently used to a wider extent in complicated autoimmune diseases. Aim: Randomized, controlled data related to the treatment of autoimmune diseases with IA and immunosuppressive therapy, are still scarce. To assess effectiveness and safety IA was given in combination with immunosuppressive drugs to five patients with severe complicated SLE in a pivotal open label study. Patients and Methods: Five patients with severe SLE and nephritis, who had not responded to conventional therapy, were submitted to IA (Selesorb®, Kaneka MA- 03 System, Osaka-Japan) and subsequent pulse cyclophosphamide. Results:Patient M/F Age Complication IA sessions Remission 1 F 44 VasculitisNephritis 18 YesNo 2 F 26 Nephritis 12 Yes 3 M 28 Nephritis 12 Yes 4 F 35 Nephritis 15 Yes 5 F 49 Nephritis 17 YesIA in combination with immunosuppressive drugs showed to be effective in 4 patients and of limited efficacy in 1 individual, as reported above. Conclusion: Further investigations, {{increase in the number of}} subjects to be studied, a multicenter study approach, and a long-term follow-up are necessary to confirm the advantages of IA. It is to be underlined that adverse events are very rare and advances in apheresis technologies, like <b>immunoadsorption,</b> might, in the future, play a role in the therapeutic approach for severe SLE.

40|$|Plasma {{exchange}} {{therapy is}} currently used to remove antibody from the circulation {{in a number}} of autoimmune diseases. It has been suggested that the decrease in antibody level may affect synthesis rate by the removal of inhibitory feedback. This would then cause a rapid rise in antibody levels to or beyond those prior to depletion. Based on this supposition immunosuppression is nearly always used concomitantly with plasma exchange to prevent the expected increase in synthesis rates. An assessment of the effect of specific antibody removal by <b>immunoadsorption</b> on synthesis and catabolic rates was undertaken to clarify the nature of the response. Rabbits were immunized to bovine serum albumin (BSA) injected with 125 I-anti-BSA IgG and later underwent extracorporeal <b>immunoadsorption</b> with BSA-Sepharose. At least 60 % of circulating anti-BSA-IgG was removed. Mathematical analysis of 125 I-anti-BSA IgG and anti-BSA-IgG levels demonstrated a reduction in catabolic clearance following <b>immunoadsorption.</b> Conversely synthesis rate was not altered. No significant overshoot of anti-BSA-IgG beyond pre-removal levels occurred. Based on these findings it is postulated that an increase in antibody synthesis does not generally occur following plasma exchange. The rise in antibody levels seen following plasma exchange probably reflect a reduction of catabolism combined with an unchanged rate of synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{specific}} {{removal of}} circulating bovine serum albumin (BSA) antibodies in canine hosts with a BSA collodion charcoal extracorporeal immunoadsorbent {{is followed by}} a rebound and overshoot of specific antibody levels within 7 days after perfusion. Studies were carried out in dogs actively immunized to BSA and human serum albumin (HSA) to determine whether the post-immunoadsorption antibody rebound could be modified by the administration of various chemotherapeutic agents given alone or in combination, at various intervals in the post-perfusion period. Control extracorporeal <b>immunoadsorption</b> was carried out in each dog and its own pattern of post-perfusion antibody rebound was recorded. After a second extracorporeal perfusion, single drug chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate or cytosine arabinoside resulted in a slight delay, or had no effect on the recovery of antibody levels to pre-perfusion values. In contrast, dual (cyclophosphamide and cytosine arabinoside) or triple (cyclophosphamide, cytosine arabinoside and methotrexate) chemotherapy resulted in specific attenuation or arrest of BSA antibody rebound after specific <b>immunoadsorption.</b> BSA binding of serum rebounded to 62 % of pre-perfusion values in one dog, but declined 37 % and 22 % below post-perfusion levels in two others. The immunosuppressive effect of dual or triple chemotherapy on BSA binding was specific, since control levels of HSA binding in sera were unchanged by the extracorporeal <b>immunoadsorption</b> and the chemotherapeutic treatment. Drug toxicity, including myelosuppression, diarrhoea and fever was transient and reversible upon cessation of treatment, but was more severe in dogs given a dual or triple drug treatment. Therefore, chemotherapeutic agents employed after extracorporeal <b>immunoadsorption</b> may result in specific reduction and lasting suppression of circulating antibody levels. Conclusions {{based on the number of}} dogs studied must be guarded, but these findings suggest a potentially effective therapeutic approach to many antibody mediated diseases...|$|E
