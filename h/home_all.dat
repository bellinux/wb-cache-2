5|$|Seven still-standing club {{records were}} set this season, {{including}} three Football League records. One Football League record {{was for the}} fewest Football League goals conceded in a 46 match season – 26, just over one every two games. Just five of these were conceded at home, another Football League record. This was based upon 30 clean sheets, again a Football League record. They also recorded a club record low of three league defeats, and a club record home clean sheet streak of eleven matches, lasting from 7 September 1953 to 13 February 1954.

5|$|Among all predators, ants are the {{greatest}} enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning <b>home,</b> <b>all</b> the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on termites. In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume termites.|$|E

25|$|During much of {{the twentieth}} century, Australian governments had removed many {{aboriginal}} children from their families.

Since the publication in 1997 of a federal government report, Bringing Them <b>Home</b> <b>all</b> state governments have followed {{the recommendation of the}} report in issuing formal apologies for their past practices to the Aboriginal people, as have many local governments. The Howard government refused to make such an apology on behalf of the federal government, despite pleas from the Aboriginal people and from many sections of the wider community, saying that it implied intergenerational guilt on modern non-indigenous Australia. However, the new government under Kevin Rudd led a formal bi-partisan apology on 13 February 2008.|$|E
25|$|With {{the victory}} over Providence, the Phantoms were {{back to the}} Calder Cup Finals {{for the first time}} since 1998 and would meet the Chicago Wolves, another {{powerhouse}} team that up until that point had breezed through the playoffs including a sweep of the Manitoba Moose in the Western Conference Finals. While both teams had plenty of scoring power, it was expected to be a battle of two stellar Finnish goaltenders—the Phantoms' Niittymaki and the Wolves' Kari Lehtonen—who had both been stellar performers all season long. Even though the Phantoms had finished the regular season with 103 points on a record of 48–25–3–4, for the first time in the 2005 post-season they would have to open a series on the road, as Chicago had finished with 105 points (49–24–5–2) and had lost just seven times at <b>home</b> <b>all</b> season.|$|E

25|$|The Germans {{arrived to}} a deserted island, {{and began to}} follow their orders to fortify Alderney as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall. In January 1942 they built four camps in Alderney: two work camps, Lager Helgoland and Lager Borkum, and two {{concentration}} camps, Lager Sylt and Lager Norderney. They were built by the Nazi Organisation Todt (OT) to house the labour used to build fortifications including bunkers, gun emplacements, tunnels, air-raid shelters and other concrete and field fortifications. Lager Norderney, containing Russian and Polish POWs, and the Lager Sylt camp holding Jewish slave labourers, were transferred to SS administration in March 1943 {{under the control of}} Hauptsturmführer Maximilian List. There are 397 graves in Alderney, which when added to the men who died in ships, takes the total to over 700 out of a total inmate population of 6,000 who lost their lives before the camps were closed and the remaining inmates transferred to France in 1944. On the return to their island, Alderney evacuees had little or no knowledge of the crimes committed on their island during the occupation, because by December 1945, the first date civilians could return <b>home,</b> <b>all</b> the slave labourers had been sent away and the majority of the German troops left behind were not senior staff. Evidence, however, was all over the island, with concrete fortifications and graveyards for the prisoners kept there during the occupation.|$|E
