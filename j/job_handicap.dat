40|$|To {{evaluate}} job participation, career-related problems, {{and actual}} job problems in adults with complex {{congenital heart disease}} (CHD) compared with adults with mild CHD and reference groups. Cross-sectional study. Patients {{were randomly selected from}} the archives of the Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, the Netherlands. In total, 76 patients with complex CHD and 80 with mild CHD (age range, 17 - 32 years) completed a self-reported questionnaire on employment and handicaps, with reference data available (response rate, 70 %). In the study groups, 45 (59 %) of 76 patients with complex CHD had a paid job compared with 61 (76 %) of 80 patients with mild CHD. Patients older than 25 years with complex CHD had significantly lower job participation (64 %) than the general population (83 %). Multiple logistic regression showed that type of CHD and level of education were significantly and independently related to job participation (odds ratio, 4. 8; 99 % confidence interval, 1. 2 - 19. 6; and odds ratio, 4. 7; 99 % confidence interval, 1. 3 - 17. 2, respectively). Of the 76 patients with complex CHD, 42 (55 %) experienced disease-related career problems, in contrast to only 1 patient with mild CHD. Both CHD groups had more job-related mobility handicaps than did the reference group. However, in the mild CHD group, handicaps could be attributed to additional noncardiac diseases. Patients with complex CHD have reduced job participation compared with patients with mild CHD and the general population. Many receive disability benefits or experience career problems or <b>job</b> <b>handicaps.</b> Career counseling focusing on physical abilities and level of education may help prevent or reduce these job-related problem...|$|R

5000|$|Educational {{researcher}} Raymond H. Hartjen {{asserts that}} expanded opportunities for social interaction enhances intelligence. This suggests that children require continuous opportunities for interpersonal experiences {{in order to}} develop a keen 'inter-personal psychology'. Traditional classrooms do not permit the interaction of complex social behavior. Instead, students in traditional settings are treated as learners who must be infused with more and more complex forms of information. The structure of schools today allows very few of these skills, critical for survival in the world, to develop. Because we so limit the development of the skills of [...] "natural psychologist" [...] in traditional schools, graduates enter the <b>job</b> market <b>handicapped</b> {{to the point of being}} incapable of surviving on their own. In contrast, students who have had an opportunity to develop their skills in multi-age classrooms and at democratic settings rise above their less socially skilled peers. They have a good sense of self, know what they want in life and have the skills to begin their quest.|$|R
40|$|International agreements, Czech {{constitutional}} law and labour code ensure an equal treatment in a job, equal chances {{and the right}} to have satisfactory work conditions. Furthermore it is stipulated that handicapped persons can claim a higher level of health protection when working, special work conditions, special protection in work relations and assistance in career preparation in order to prevent discrimination. Even though the society provides higher protection to handicapped people, problems with their employment are still deepening. The objective of the present diploma thesis was to give an insight in this situation. The main goal of this thesis was to determine the effectiveness of benefits provided by the Labour Office in České Budějovice. A sub-goal was to ascertain employers comments on the benefits which are provided by the Labour Office in České Budějovice. The supposed hypothesis to the main goal reads: "The higher the amount of benefits, the smaller the number of <b>handicapped</b> <b>job</b> seekers recorded with the Labour Office. And thus benefits are considered effective. q The supposed hypothesis to the sub-goal is: "Employers comments are related to the insufficient amount of the benefits to support employment of handicapped people. q In order to achieve the main goal in the research, the author applied analysis of documents, the quantitative technique, secondary analysis of data, making use of statistics from 2004 to the end of 2008 provided by the Labour Office in České Budějovice.

40|$|O objetivo do presente trabalho consistiu em desenvolver uma escala de atitudes sociais em relação ao trabalho da pessoa com deficiência. Para isso, realizou-se dois estudos, sendo o primeiro com a finalidade de identificar a concepção dos empregadores sobre a pessoa com deficiência, o seu trabalho e a sua inserção no quadro de funcionários. A partir de entrevistas {{realizadas}} com os responsáveis pelo setor de Recursos Humanos de empresas dos ramos de comércio, indústria e prestação de serviços, obteve-se os dados que forneceram subsídios para delimitar o universo de conteúdo da escala de atitudes sociais pretendida. Analisou-se cuidadosamente cada trecho das falas dos entrevistados, tendo em vista os temas e sub-temas previamente identificados. Então, extraiu-se um conjunto de conteúdos relacionados ao objeto psicológico do estudo, para elaborar a lista de enunciados que compuseram a versão preliminar da escala, desenvolvida no segundo estudo. Elaborado no formato Lickert, com 5 alternativas que expressam diferentes graus de concordância ou discordância com relação ao enunciado, o instrumento ficou composto de 64 itens. Posteriormente, foi aplicado em uma amostra de 234 estudantes universitários dos cursos de Psicologia, Pedagogia, Fisioterapia e Serviço Social para identificar os itens com boa capacidade discriminativa. O procedimento estatístico inicialmente utilizado foi o teste t de Student que revelou boa capacidade discriminativa em 75 % dos itens. Para que a versão final da escala ficasse composta de 30 itens, sendo 15 positivos e 15 negativos, realizou-se, também, a análise da discriminação dos itens pela correlação item-total, mediante a sua depuração em três etapas.

The aim on {{the present}} thesis {{was to develop a}} scale of social attitudes related to the <b>job</b> of <b>handicapped</b> people. Two studies were carried out. The purpose of the first study was to identify the concept of the employers about the handicapped people, including their job and their insertion on the board of employees. Data that provided the base for the delimitation of the content universe of the desired scale of social attitudes were obtained from the interviews with the person in charge of the division of Human Resources of trading, industry and service companies. Each part of the interviews were carefully analyzed according to the themes and sub-themes previously identified. Thereafter, a group of contents related to the psychological subject matter were extracted to elaborate a list of statements that composed the preliminary version of the scale which was developed on {{the second part of the}} study. The instrument was elaborated with 5 alternatives that expressed different degrees of agreements or disagreements with the statement, according to the Lickert format. Therefore, the instrument was initially composed by 64 items. Then, it was applied to a sample of 234 students of Psychology, Pedagogy, Physiotherapy and Social Service to identify the items with strong discrimination power. The Student's ttest indicated strong discrimination power in 75 % of the items. In order to obtain a final version of the scale with 30 items (15 positive and 15 negative) a discriminative analysis of the items by means of item-total correlation was made with a three-step depuration. The alfa coefficient of Cronbach was used along with the elimination of the items on each step to check the internal consistency of each statement with the total score of the instrument.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} the occupational situation {{of people with}} lower limb amputations in The Netherlands and to compare the health experience of workings and nonworking amputee patients with a nonimpaired reference population. Design: Cross-sectional study in which patients completed a questionnaire about their job participation. type of job, workplace adjustments to their limb loss, {{their position in the}} company, and a general health questionnaire. Setting: Orthopsdic workshops in The Netherlands with a population of lower limb amputees. Patients: Subjects were recruited from orthopedic workshops in the Netherlands. They ranged in age from Is to 60 years (mean, 44. 5 yr) and had a lower limb amputated at least 2 years (mean, 19. 6 yr) before this study. Main Outcome measures: A self-report questionnaire, with 1 part concerning patient characteristics and amputation-related factors, and the other concerning <b>job</b> characteristics, vocational <b>handicaps,</b> work adjustments, and working conditions; and a general health questionnaire (RAND- 36) to measure health status. Results: Responses were received from 652 of the 687 patients (response: rate, 95 %) who were sent the questionnaire. Sixty-foul percent of the respondents were working at the rime of the study (comparable with the employment rate of the general Dutch population), 31 % had work experience but were not presently working, and 5 % had no work experience. After their amputations, people shifted to less physically demanding work. The mean delay between the amputation and the return to work was 2. 3 years. Many people wished their work was better adjusted to the limitations presented by their disability and they mentioned having problems concerning possibilities fur promotion. Seventy-eight percent of those who stopped working within 2 years after the amputation said that amputation-related factors played a role in their decision. Thirty-four percent said that they might have worked longer if certain adjustments had been made. The health experience of people who were no longer working was significantly worse than that of the working people with amputations. Conclusions: Although amputee patients had a relatively good rate of job participation, they reported problems concerning the long delay between amputation and return to work, problems in finding suitable jobs, fewer possibilities for promotion, and problems in obtaining needed workplace modifications. People who had to stop working because of the amputation showed a worse health experience than working people...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much {{discussion}} about what occupation is but little discussion about why occupation became so important during the Progressive Era (1890 - 1914) during which time occupational therapy became organized and recognized. In other words, {{what was the problem}} to which occupation was the solution? This presentation proposes that the problem was idleness. Idleness according dictionaries involves not working, not being active, not spending of filling time with activities, not keeping busy, habitually doing nothing or avoiding work, lazy, not of real worth or importance, meaningless, loitering, and aimless. Herbert Hall, M. D. states that “idleness too long continued is as deadening to the spirit as it is disabling to the body [...] . Idleness [...] . which is forced upon us in long illness or in delayed convalescence, too often means degeneration, and in the end, increased suffering. ” Some popular quotes of the time period were “trouble springs from idleness, and grievous toil from needless ease (Benjamin Franklin). The way to be nothing is to do nothing (Nathaniel Howe). Evil thought often come from idleness (Gaelic Proverb). Idleness is the devil’s workshop (old proverb). Several themes emerge from the authors of the early twentieth century. Health and how to better attain and maintain it was one. So was getting work done at institutions for the insane and tuberculosis as cheaply as possible. Another problem was finding a way for poor people to pay for their stay in the institution. In addition there was a need for manpower (person power) to work in an economy that was heating up due to World War I that required “all hands on deck. ” As the war progressed and ended there was another concern that disabled soldiers and sailors would not return to paying jobs and drain the economy to pay pensions. Occupation was often seen as the solution. Making idleness “the bad guy” was a popular message. The message was carried in a variety of ways: creating <b>jobs</b> for the <b>handicapped</b> (disabled), supporting <b>job</b> training and working conditions, encouraging voluntarism, infusing the idea of the work ethic into religious messages, publishing essays and editorials in the popular press lauding work and publishing articles in professional journals. Each of these communication approaches will be explored and discussed in the presentation...|$|R
