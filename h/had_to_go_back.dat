5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm {{the plans for the}} launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E

The boy of course became Nostradamus and the ripped pages from books explained his visions of the future. The story was made by Massimo Marconi and Massimo De Vita.|$|E
25|$|To get Railtrack out of administration, the {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the High Court and present {{evidence that the}} company was no longer insolvent. The principal reason given by {{the government}} to the court for this assertion was the decision of the rail regulator – announced on 22 September 2002 – to carry out an interim review of the company's finances, with the potential to advance significant additional sums to the company. The High Court accepted {{that the company was}} not therefore insolvent, and the railway administration order was discharged on 2 October 2002.|$|E
25|$|Bulgaria, {{which also}} {{suffered}} heavy losses and great material damage during Nicephorus' campaign, {{also had to}} reorganize its army and resources and {{was not able to}} advance until next year. The Bulgarian attacks were concentrated mainly in Thrace but also along the valley of Strymōn (Struma) river. Many towns were seized and their population was sent far to the north in Bulgaria across the Danube. The attack created such panic among the Byzantine population that several towns were emptied even without being attacked by the Bulgarians. The attempts of Michael I to resist were fruitless – he organized an army but soon after he set off from Constantinople he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> due to a conspiracy.|$|E

25|$|After the Spanish–American War {{began in}} April 1898, Allen left from his {{position}} in Germany and by June 1898 was placed in command of Troop D of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. He then became a major of volunteers and was ordered off to Cuba. He and the volunteers served as scouts and on escort duty during the Santiago Land Campaign. They also fought on July 1, 1898, in the Battle of El Caney. On July 10, Allen {{took control of the}} town and its camp containing over 20,000 refugees. Though there was not adequate food nor medicine, a disaster was averted when Santiago de Cuba surrendered only six days later, allowing the refugees to return to their homes. Allen then developed a case of malaria or yellow fever and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the United States to recover. His service in the war made him highly regarded by Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt would later try to make Allen part of a planned division of volunteers during World War I, but the division was never formed.|$|E
25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, and the thought of dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them to see a doctor in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not treated fairly, arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E

500|$|Contemporaneous {{reviews of}} Be Here Now were, in John Harris's words, {{unanimous}} with [...] "truly amazing praise." [...] According to Harris, [...] "To find an album that had attracted gushing notices in such profusion, one <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> thirty years, {{to the release}} of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band." [...] While Q magazine described the album as [...] "cocaine set to music", most early reviews praised the record's length, volume and ambition. Reviews in the British music press for Oasis' previous album (What's the Story) Morning Glory? had been generally negative. When it went on to become, in the words of Select editor Alexis Petridis, [...] "this huge kind of Zeitgeist defining record" [...] the music press was [...] "baffled". Realising they had got it wrong the last time, Petridis believes the initial glowing reviews were a concession to public opinion.|$|E

500|$|On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died {{of liver}} failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Three days later, during Megadeth's {{performance}} at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated [...] "Peace Sells" [...] to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover {{version of the}} Black Sabbath's [...] "Never Say Die" [...] for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: [...] "I told [...] after Risk that we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to our roots and play metal, and he quit."

500|$|Grohl {{decided to}} take a two-week period before the QOTSA went on tour to work on the Foo Fighters record, and after {{consulting}} Raskulinecz decided to promote him to producer. First, Grohl visited Hawkins in Topanga to rework the songs that had already been done and show new compositions, such as [...] "Times Like These", [...] "Low", and [...] "Disenchanted Lullaby". Then Grohl and Hawkins went to Virginia to redo the drum, vocal and guitar tracks across a twelve-day period, and Mendel and Shiflett were later called to record their parts in Los Angeles' The Hook Studios, which were mostly done with the supervision of Raskulinecz, as Grohl <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to QOTSA.

Elliott worked on The Cookbook with such producers as the Neptunes, Rich Harrison and Scott Storch. The album included only two songs produced by Timbaland, who produced most or all songs on Elliott's previous albums. She explained, [...] "Me and Tim, this like our sixth album, so if we go any further left, we gonna be on Mars somewhere. We've done everything it is to do. I think both of us came to a spot where we didn't know where to go with each other." [...] She said Timbaland was very involved with the album, supporting or opposing certain producers.

500|$|On July 25, 1967, Forrestal reached Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin {{and joined}} Operation Rolling Thunder, the 1965–1968 air interdiction and {{strategic}} bombing campaign against North Vietnam. [...] The alpha strikes flown from Forrestal were against specific, pre-selected targets such as arms depots, factories, and bridges. [...] They were quite dangerous, {{due to the}} strength of the North Vietnamese air defenses, which used Soviet-designed and -supplied surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery, and MiG jet interceptors. [...] McCain's first five attack missions over North Vietnam went without incident, and while still unconcerned with minor Navy regulations, McCain had garnered the reputation of a serious aviator. McCain and his fellow pilots were frustrated by the micromanagement of Rolling Thunder from Washington; he later wrote, [...] "The target list was so restricted that we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> and hit the same targets over and over again...

500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not always doing exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't Hardly Wait, Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much it sucks when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities.
