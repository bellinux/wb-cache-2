5000|$|A {{computer}} mouse {{is a small}} handheld device that users hold and slide across a flat surface, pointing at various elements of a graphical user interface with an on-screen cursor, and selecting and moving objects using the mouse buttons. Almost all modern personal computers include a mouse; it may be plugged into a computer's rear mouse socket, or as a USB device, or, more recently, may be connected wirelessly via an USB dongle or Bluetooth link. In the past, mice had a single button that users could press down on the device to [...] "click" [...] on whatever the pointer on the screen was hovering over. Modern mice have two, three or more buttons, providing a [...] "right click" [...] function button on the mouse, which performs a secondary action on a selected object, and a scroll wheel, which users can rotate using their fingers to [...] "scroll" [...] up or down. The scroll wheel can also be pressed down, and therefore {{be used as a}} third button. Some mouse wheels may be tilted from side to side to allow sideways scrolling. Different programs make use of these functions differently, and may scroll horizontally by default with the scroll wheel, open different menus with different buttons, etc. These functions may be also user-defined through software utilities. Mice traditionally detected movement and communicated with the computer with an internal [...] "mouse ball", and used optical encoders to detect rotation of the ball and tell the computer where the mouse has moved. However, these systems were subject to low durability, accuracy and required <b>internal</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Modern mice use optical technology to directly trace movement of the surface under the mouse and are much more accurate, durable and almost maintenance free. They work on a wider variety of surfaces and can even operate on walls, ceilings or other non-horizontal surfaces.|$|E

40|$|In Paper [I], we {{theoretically}} assess green {{public procurement}} (GPP) as an environmental policy instrument {{and its ability to}} lead to the achievement of environmental objectives. Central to our analysis {{is the extent to which}} polluting firms choose to adapt to the public sector's environmental requirements and to invest in greener technologies. Our main finding is that the potential of GPP to function as an objective-effective instrument of environmental policy is limited and can actually be counterproductive. From an environmental policy point of view, it is crucial that GPP aims for environmental standards beyond just the technology of the polluting firms and that it is designed with reference to defined environmental objectives. In Paper [II], we use data on Swedish public procurement auctions for <b>internal</b> regular <b>cleaning</b> service contracts to provide novel empirical evidence regarding GPP and its effect on the potential suppliers' decision to submit a bid and their probability of being qualified for supplier selection. We find only a weak effect on supplier behavior, and this suggests that GPP, as used in practice, does not live up to its political expectations. However, several environmental criteria appear to be associated with increased complexity, as indicated by the reduced probability of a bid being qualified in the post-qualification process. As such, GPP appears to have limited or no potential to function as an environmental policy instrument. In Paper [III], I examine how GPP is organized in Sweden and how the potential suppliers respond to varying buyer market shares using data on Swedish public procurement auctions for <b>internal</b> regular <b>cleaning</b> service contracts. The level of GPP stringency is found to vary systematically across authority types, buyer market share, and political coalition in the relevant council or in Parliament. The results also indicate quite a substantial dispersion in GPP stringency, suggesting a low degree of coordination among contracting authorities when implementing the policy. After controlling for GPP stringency and other covariates, increased buyer market share is associated with a significant increase in the probability of potential suppliers submitting a bid. The European Commission encourages public authorities to split procurement contracts into multiple contracts in order to increase the competiveness of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). In Paper [IV], I use data from Swedish public procurement auctions for <b>internal</b> regular <b>cleaning</b> service contracts to study the effect of contract size and number of contracts on SME participation and probability of winning. The results indicate that SME participation is negatively related to both contract size and the number of contracts in the procurement. A possible interpretation is that reduced contract size in order to stimulate SME participation is counteracted by reduced incentives for them to enter into procurements with multiple contracts. Medium-sized firms are also more successful when bidding for smaller contracts relative to large firms. Nevertheless, the results indicate that the award rate for SMEs is positively correlated with the number of contracts in the procurement.

50|$|On the {{component}} design level, fouling can often (but not always) be minimized by maintaining {{a relatively high}} (for example, 2 m/s) and uniform fluid velocity throughout {{the component}}. Stagnant regions need to be eliminated. Components are normally overdesigned to accommodate the fouling anticipated between cleanings. However, a significant overdesign can be a design error because it may lead to increased fouling due to reduced velocities. Periodic on-line pressure pulses or backflow can be effective if the capability is carefully incorporated at the design time. Blowdown capability is always incorporated into steam generators or evaporators to control the accumulation of non-volatile impurities that cause or aggravate fouling. Low-fouling surfaces (for example, very smooth, implanted with ions, or of low surface energy like Teflon) are an option for some applications. Modern components are typically required to be designed for ease of inspection of <b>internals</b> and periodic <b>cleaning.</b> On-line fouling monitoring systems are designed for some application so that blowing or cleaning can be applied before unpredictable shutdown is necessary or damage occurs.|$|R

40|$|Dissolved and Colloidal {{substances}} (DisCo) and metals {{are released}} from wood during thermomechanical pulp (TMP) production. The mechanical treatment causes that these components {{have a tendency}} to accumulate in process waters, as the water circulation systems in integrated paper mills are being closed. Disturbances such as pitch depositions on the paper machine (pitch problems), specks in the paper, decreased wet and dry strength, interference with cationic process chemicals, and impaired sheet brightness and friction properties appear in the presence of DisCo substances. The presence of transition metal ions such as manganese results in higher consumption of bleaching chemicals (hydrogen peroxide) and lowers the optical quality of the final product, and addition of complexing agents, such as EDTA or DTPA, to prevent this is needed. The never ending trends to decrease water consumption and increase process efficiency in pulp and paper production stress that it is very important both to know the effects of wood substances on pulping and papermaking {{and to be able to}} remove them in an efficient way. Carried out investigations presented in this thesis show that the lipophilic extractives can be removed from TMP press water to high extent. A 90 % decrease in turbidity and a 91 % removal of lipophilic extractives from TMP press water can be obtained by addition of a cationic surfactant as foaming agent during flotation. Additionally, fibres located in TMP press water are not removed with the foam fraction but purified. A retained concentration of hydrophilic extractives in the process water indicates that the flotation is selective. Moreover, by introduction of a new recoverable surface active complexing agent, a chelating surfactant, manganese ions in the form of chelates can be successfully removed from the pulp fibres and separated from the process water in the same flotation process. iii The findings presented above indicate new possibilities for <b>internal</b> water <b>cleaning</b> and decreased emissions to water if flotation technology is applied in an integrated mechanical pulp mill.

To analyze the epidemiology of injuries and the treatment imparted at a secondary rural hospital in the Kutch district, Gujarat, India following the January 26, 2001 earthquake. Discharge reports of patients admitted to the hospital over 10 weeks were analyzed retrospectively for earthquake-related injuries. Orthopedic injuries, (particularly fractures of the lower limbs) were predominant and serious injuries like head, chest, abdominal, and crush syndrome were minimal. Wound infections were reported in almost 20 % of the admitted cases. Surgical procedures were more common than conservative treatment. The most frequently performed surgical procedures were open reduction with <b>internal</b> fixation and <b>cleaning</b> and debridement of contaminated wounds. Four secondary deaths and 102 transfers to tertiary care due to complications were reported.
