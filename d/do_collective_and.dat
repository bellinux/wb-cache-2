Resource: The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine whether and to what extent people experience flow in overcoming ropes obstacles and how their flow is affected by their previous experiences from other sports. Methods: Polling had one hundred and fifty respondents who were regular visitors to the rope sling. Polling was carried out immediately after crossing the rope obstacles using a questionnaire-Flow Kurzskala (FCS). The data obtained were divided into individual files, depending on the hypotheses posed. Using the Student's distribution, it was determined if there is a statistically significant difference in mean values of the individual files and then the related hypothesis was accepted. Results: Carried out testing showed a statistically significant difference in the flow experience in the rope obstacles park in a group of adolescents and adults. Also showed a difference between sportsmen who are engaged in everyday life competition sports and sports oriented on performance, unlike sportsmen <b>doing</b> <b>collective</b> <b>and</b> individual sports where a statistically significant difference in mean values did not show.

40|$|The Israeli and Palestinian {{societies}} {{are involved in}} a long-lasting and violent conflict, where any considerable de-escalation has been conspicuously absent for the last twenty years. The seemingly never-ending spirals of escalation, de-escalation, negotiations, breakdowns and upheavals wear immensely on both societies, which, at the current stage are at an all-time low regarding their beliefs in finding a peaceful solution that involves co-existence with their adversaries. These dynamics also contribute to the creation of large social, political and cultural gaps between the conflicting parties. These differences are often developed on the basis of fear and resentment deriving from the conflict. The fear and resentment become particularly visible in conflict narratives, which express the collective understandings of the conflict itself, developed by the conflict-torn Israeli and Palestinian societies. In this thesis, a qualitative literature study is conducted with the aim to explore sociopsychological aspects of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict with the help of conflict narratives. Emphasising demands for security and expressions of fear in Israeli and Palestinian societies, this thesis investigates: 1) What themes in the conflict narratives are revealed when exploring demands for security in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? 2) How are security aspects in the conflict narratives related to a collective sense of fear? and; 3) How <b>do</b> <b>collective</b> fear <b>and</b> demands for security affect Palestinian and Israeli mainstream interpretations of recent events? Through the analysis of security aspects in the conflict narratives, interesting findings related to <b>collective</b> fear emerge, <b>and</b> it becomes clear how security aspects in conflict narratives connect the narratives to fear experienced within the societies. Using the conflict narrative to interpret current events, the collective fear coupled with previous experiences blends with the fear generated by the current event, creating a cycle where the conflict narrative <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> fear work to enhance the fear in the Israeli and Palestinian societies...|$|R

In both Christian and Muslim samples, previous research has found a relationship between religious overclaiming and communal narcissism, as well as a relationship between religious overclaiming and support for religious violence. The present research extends previous work by including several different measures of narcissism including grandiose (agentic), vulnerable, communal, <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> narcissism to predict religious overclaiming for the Bible and the Qur’an. Moreover, the present research investigates the relationship between support for violence, peace, and apathy using an Internet Commenter task. The results found that grandiose (agentic), <b>collective,</b> <b>and</b> communal narcissism were associated with religious overclaiming and poor religious accuracy. Moreover, though grandiose (agentic) narcissism did not extend to support for violence, communal <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> narcissism <b>did.</b> <b>Collective</b> narcissism had a direct association with support for violence. While the relationship between communal narcissism and support for violence was fully mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity. Finally, poor religious knowledge and, interestingly, overclaiming a religion that is not your own predicted support for violence. Additional findings and implications are discussed.

40|$|Cities are {{manifestations of}} fluctuant {{dynamics}} with spatial qualities that aggregate and interact in time especially when infrastructure is under transformation. 1 In this paper the emerging and volatile qualities of collective spaces {{related to that}} transforming infrastructure are investigated, enabling speculations on future conditions. How <b>do</b> <b>collective</b> spaces raise, <b>and</b> fluctuate? How are their transitory spatial configurations linked to temporary communal appropriations? How do material and immaterial forces come together through voices that are spatially situated? Collective spaces embedded in dynamic infrastructures {{are the focus of}} this PhD-research that seeks to produce new insights on urban territories related to them. Glòries Square (Barcelona, Spain) is the case-study. This infrastructure-based open space, once exposing a variety of emerging logics linked to a complex development process, is now turning into a formalized urban complex that simplifies, thus overwrites that variety. 2 Paradoxically responding to long standing demands for public housing and facilities by neighborhood associations, the case gathers the “most advanced” of urban development, exposing how architects’ future visions tremble when mismatching existent qualities are simplified and dismissed, leaving little space to alternative urban processes. The case is experimentally explored through spatial (morphologic/material-programmatic / domain / territorial configurations); human (uses / appropriations / atmospheres) and symbolic (voices / engagement / discussions / imaginaries) compounds. The research aims to tackle the overlapping, unexpected, and fluctuant characters of urban space by means of studying <b>collective</b> spaces <b>and</b> infrastructures as extreme territorial entities; and to test the possibilities of design as a tool to unveil unforeseen spatial relations. The paper advocates for the investigation of volatile urban processes as means to imagine the livability of our cities, in contrasts with the conception of development as static outcomes, in which {{in the name of a}} “perfect picture”, the crystallization and extreme formalization become the ultimate goals. status: accepte...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} theories of collectivity or social grouphood presupposed by accounts of collective intentionality, <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility. I consider the intentionalist theories of social grouphood proposed by John Searle and Margaret Gilbert, Larry May’s conceptual account of social grouphood, and Paul Sheehy’s realist conception of social grouphoood. All three approaches {{are found to be}} problematic. The theories of Searle and Gilbert fail to adequately explain the causal relationship between <b>collectives</b> <b>and</b> their members, the heterogeneity of social groups and non-voluntary social groups; May’s theory is problematic insofar as it relies on sameness among individual group members; and, as a consequence of his failure to recognize that the causal powers of a social group are mediated by, and thereby depend upon, the perspectives of individuals, Sheehy’s account is unable to explain non-voluntary social groups. A conception of social grouphood that is able to avoid these shortcomings is identified. However, it raises doubts about the possibility of collective agency, something that theories of <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility tend to assume. Consequently, I explore whether <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility require collective agency. Theories of <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility that <b>do</b> not require <b>collective</b> agency have been proposed. These proposals conceive of <b>collective</b> action <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> moral responsibility as joint action and joint moral responsibility, respectively.

40|$|The {{level of}} {{protection}} against social risks that is organised in a welfare state is not only dependent upon the arrangements {{of the welfare state}} itself, but also, as {{we have seen in the}} previous chapter, on arrangements organised in firms or in collective bargaining. The previous chapter investigated the introduction of the idea of employability as a strategy to enhance job security and concluded that the collective bargaining process facilitated the introduction and relative success of this strategy in <b>collective</b> labour agreements <b>and</b> in the labour policies of firms. This was explained by the institutional complementarity that exists in the Dutch corporatist welfare state between the norm of job security and the normative ideals of the strategy of enhancing employability. In this chapter, we focus on the corporatist institution of collective bargaining that is so important to Dutch labour policy and investigate the role this institution plays in risk management and the contribution it makes to the protection against old and new social risks. In this chapter, we investigate the interaction between risk protection by the welfare state <b>and</b> provisions in <b>collective</b> labour agreements. If one diminishes, how does the other react? We investigate this interaction in relation to welfare state retrenchment (is this compensated for in collective labour agreements?), in relation to old and new social risks (to what extent <b>do</b> <b>collective</b> labour agreements <b>and</b> the traditional institution of social security protect against new social risks?) and in relation to the decentralisation of <b>collective</b> labour agreements (<b>does</b> decentralisation lead to a decrease in risk-protection?).

40|$|The {{concepts}} of self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy {{have both been}} used by scholars to explain involvement in individual-level crime. Scholars have found that both types of efficacy are related to crime at the individual level. However, little research has {{examined the relationship between}} self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy <b>and</b> its influence on youths' involvement in crime. Using the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) data, this study focuses on the independent influences of self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy on involvement in crime among youths ages 9 to 19, and examines the potential moderating effect of collective efficacy on the relationship between self-efficacy and crime. The relationship between self-efficacy, <b>collective</b> efficacy, <b>and</b> crime is addressed by asking three questions. First, does a general measure of youth's self-efficacy influence their involvement in crime? Second, does a macro level measure of collective efficacy influence youths' involvement in crime? Third, <b>does</b> <b>collective</b> efficacy moderate the relationship between self-efficacy and crime? To control for the contexts in which youths live and individual-level factors that can influence involvement in crime, and may influence efficacy, neighborhood context, family context, and individual-level demographic variables are also examined. Using Hierarchical Linear Modeling, the analyses indicate mixed support for a relationship between efficacy and individual-level involvement in crime. First, a significant negative relationship exists between self-efficacy and crime. Second, no significant effects emerge between <b>collective</b> efficacy <b>and</b> crime. Third, <b>collective</b> efficacy completely moderates the relationship between self-efficacy and crime, but not in the expected direction. After controlling for collective efficacy, the significant negative relationship between self-efficacy and crime is nullified. The conclusion then is that a general measure of self-efficacy influences a youth's involvement in crime, while a macro level measure of <b>collective</b> efficacy <b>does</b> not.

Exporting further decreases average production costs for large firms in the collective bargaining regime, allowing them to benefit from additional external economies of scale due to lower bargaining costs. Our findings suggest that the positive correlation between export status <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining can be explained through size.

40|$|Excerpt] This article {{examines}} the relationship between <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions <b>and</b> high-involvement management practices in new service workplaces, based on case study and survey evidence from U. S. and German call centers. Call centers are a particularly good setting for a comparative study of work organization. The number of call center jobs has grown rapidly, as firms in most industries have made them the central mechanism for interacting with customers. At the same time, standardized call center technologies have diffused worldwide, leading managers to adopt similar approaches to call distribution, productivity measurement, the use of electronic monitoring to manage employee behavior, and workflow standardization. These establishments also face {{a common set of}} competitive conditions, with high cost pressures and unpredictable demand flows. They thus represent a constrained work setting in which skill levels and the bargaining power of workers and unions are typically low. Finally, because call centers are relatively new, many have either no collective bargaining institutions or, in the case of Germany, only recently established works councils—making it feasible to examine variation in these institutional arrangements. The analysis focuses on three questions. First, <b>do</b> national <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions influence the adoption of high-involvement management practices? I use the term “high-involvement management” to describe management practices that engender employee discretion and collaboration and that rely on trust rather than on intensive monitoring and control. Second, I ask whether national <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions <b>and</b> high- involvement management practices are associated with lower voluntary employee turnover. Third, I consider whether high-involvement management mediates the relationship between national <b>and</b> <b>collective</b> bargaining institutions <b>and</b> employee turnover. That is, do these institutions affect turnover directly or only indirectly through their effects on work organization and performance monitoring? The study answers these questions through a “mixed-method” analysis, drawing on data from extensive qualitative field research as well as identical establishment-level surveys of 472 U. S. and 154 German call centers...|$|R

Network governance is an emerging con-cept {{that has not yet}} been consolidated. In network governance, processes of (collective) learning become an essential feature.

We address two main research questions: (1) What are the characteris-tics of networks that foster collective learning {{in each of the three}} dimensions?
