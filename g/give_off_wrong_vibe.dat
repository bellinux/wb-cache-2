50|$|The {{principles}} of journalistic {{codes of ethics}} are designed as guides through numerous difficulties, such as conflicts of interest, to assist journalists in dealing with ethical dilemmas. The codes and canons provide journalists a framework for self-monitoring and self-correction. Journalism is guided by five important values. The first is honesty, journalist should not makeup news, or share news that <b>give</b> <b>off</b> <b>wrong</b> impressions. The second is independence, journalist should avoid topics they have an interest in. The third is fairness, a journalist should not tell the truth if it is with bad intentions. The fourth is productiveness; a journalist should be hard working and try to gather all the facts. The last value is pride, a journalist {{needs to be able}} to accept all credit for their work bad or good.|$|R

6000|$|This {{method of}} the Schools, {{which have been}} thought the fountains of knowledge, introduced, as I suppose, the like use of these maxims into {{a great part of}} {{conversation}} out of the Schools, to stop the mouths of cavillers, whom any one is excused from arguing any longer with, when they deny these general self-evident principles received by all reasonable men who have once thought of them: but yet their use herein is but {{to put an end to}} wrangling. They in truth, when urged in such cases, teach nothing: that is already done by the intermediate ideas made use of in the debate, whose connexion may be seen without the help of those maxims, and so the truth known before the maxim is produced, and the argument brought to a first principle. Men would <b>give</b> <b>off</b> a <b>wrong</b> argument before it came to that, if in their disputes they proposed to themselves the finding and embracing of truth, and not a contest for victory. And thus maxims have their use to put a stop to their perverseness, whose ingenuity should have yielded sooner. But the method of the Schools having allowed and encouraged men to oppose and resist evident truth till they are baffled, i.e. till they are reduced to contradict themselves, or some established principles: it is no wonder that they should not in civil conversation be ashamed of that which in the Schools is counted a virtue and a glory, viz. obstinately to maintain that side of the question they have chosen, whether true or false, to the last extremity; even after conviction. A strange way to attain truth and knowledge: and that which I think the rational part of mankind, not corrupted by education, could scare believe should ever be admitted amongst the lovers of truth, and students of religion or nature, or introduced into the seminaries of those who are to propegate the truths of religion or philosophy amongst the ignorant and unconvinced. How much such a way of learning is like to turn young men's minds from the sincere search and love of truth; nay, and to make them doubt whether there is any such thing, or, at least, worth the adhering to, I shall not now inquire. This I think, that, bating those places, which brought the Peripatetic Philosophy into their schools, where it continued many ages, without teaching the world anything but the art of wrangling, these maxims were nowhere thought the foundations on which the sciences were built, nor the great helps to the advancement of knowledge.] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} nervus trigeminus of Mabuya quinquetaeniata. The {{results showed that the}} nervus trigeminus has one root, and two {{separate}} ganglia, a maxillomandibular ganglion and an ophthalmic one. The maxillomandibular ganglion is continuous with the ophthalmic ganglion. The lateral part of the ventromedial division of the trigeminal root <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the anguli oris nerve and nerves to the adductor mandibularis externus and the pseudotemporalis muscles. The constrictor dorsalis nerve innervates the protractor pterygoideus, levator pterygoideus, and depressor palpbrae inferioris muscles. It has no anastomosis with ramus palatinus of the nervus facialis. The ramus frontalis is connected with the lacrimal plexus. The ramus nasalis anastomoses with the ethmoidal ganglion and divides into its to rami lateralis and medialis nasi within the nasal capsule. The ramus maxillaris <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> lacrimal and temporal branches in the postorbital region. In the orbital region, it is termed infraorbital nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a nerve to the Harderian gland, the supralabial gland and the upper teeth. It fuses with the ramus palatinus lateralis of the nervus facialis. It receives an anastomosing branch from the ramus palatines medialis and fuses with the ramus palatines intermedialis for a short distance. It carries ganglionic cells at the point of fusion. It enters the maxilla as superior alveolar nerve and <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> nerve to the narial muscles. The ramus mandibularis <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> nerves to the pseudotemporalis and pterygomandibularis muscles. It <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> the ramus cutaneous recurrens and then enters the primordial canal as the inferior alveolar nerve, where it <b>gives</b> <b>off</b> a mixed nerve and a sensor...|$|R
