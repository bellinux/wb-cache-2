The major disadvantage of anisochronous PIM techniques {{is that they}} have a variable symbol length, and hence the time required to transmit a data packet containing a fixed number of bits is not constant. Employing some form of a source coding scheme, packet length variation can be limited still maintaining the increase in information capacity over <b>isochronous</b> <b>modulation</b> techniques. Simpler receiver complexity and very high achievable bit-rates make PIM modulation very attractive for IR-UWB short-range communication systems.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to make a comparison between <b>isochronous</b> and anisochronous <b>modulation</b> scheme categories from Discrete (digital) pulse time modulations (PTM) through the simplest scheme in each family; PPM and DPIM respectively, in term of bandwidth requirement, power efficiency and transmission capacity. This is done to give a wider view on the performance of such schemas under wide range of design parameters. In this paper, the properties of PPM and DPIM have been analyzed, from this analysis it has been shown that DPIM or anisochronous modulation schemes in general are strong candidates when synchronization and transmission capacity are taken into account, and when it comes to power performance PPM or <b>isochronous</b> <b>modulations</b> are better...|$|R
