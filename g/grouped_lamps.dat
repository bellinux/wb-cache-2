Methods: All related studies published up to August 2015 were acquired by searching PubMed and EMBASE. Exclusion criteria were case reports, revision surgeries, combined anterior and posterior surgeries, the other posterior approaches including laminectomy or laminectomy and instrumented fusion, non-English studies, and studies with quality assessment scores of < 7. The main end points including Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, recovery rate of JOA, cervical lordosis, complication rate, reoperation rate, and late neurological deterioration were analyzed. All available data was analyzed using RevMan 5. 2. 0 and Stata 12. 0. Results: A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis. The mean surgical level of ADF was 3. 1, and the mean preoperative occupation ratios of ADF and <b>LAMP</b> <b>group</b> were 55. 9 % and 51. 9 %, respectively. No statistical difference was observed with regard to preoperative occupation ratio and preoperative JOA score. Although <b>LAMP</b> <b>group</b> had a higher preoperative cervical lordosis than ADF group (P< 0. 05, weighted mean difference [WMD] =- 5. 73, 95 % confidence interval [CI] =– 9. 67 –– 1. 80), significantly decreased cervical lordosis was observed in <b>LAMP</b> <b>group</b> after operation. ADF group had higher postoperative JOA score (P< 0. 05, WMD = 2. 18, 95 % CI = 0. 98 – 3. 38) and neurological recovery rate (P< 0. 05, WMD = 27. 22, 95 % CI = 15. 20 – 39. 23). Furthermore, ADF group had a lower late neurological deterioration rate than the <b>LAMP</b> <b>group</b> (P< 0. 05, risk difference = 0. 16, 95 % CI = 0. 04 – 0. 73). The complication rates of both groups had no statistical difference. However, <b>LAMP</b> <b>group</b> had a significantly lower reoperation rate than ADF group. The reoperation rate of ADF group (20. 5 %) was almost six times that of <b>LAMP</b> <b>group</b> (3. 5 %). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggested that ADF was associated with better postoperative neurological function, neurological recovery rate, and less late neurological deterioration than LAMP in the treatment of multilevel cervical OPLL with a high mean occupation ratio. LAMP was associated with a decreased postoperative cervical lordosis, which might be a cause of late neurological deterioration. The complication rates of both groups showed no statistical difference. However, the reoperation rate was significantly higher in ADF <b>group</b> compared with <b>LAMP</b> <b>group.</b> Benefits and risks should be balanced when ADF or LAMP is selected.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} the long-term efficiency {{and safety of}} overnight orthokeratology in myopia correction and control in adolescents. METHODS: Sixty-five myopia adolescents treated in our hospital from August 2011 to February 2012 were retrospectively analyzed and followed up to 2 a. Among them, 35 cases(67 eyes) wearing overnight orthokeatology were included as trial group, and 30 cases(60 eyes) wearing spectacles were included as control group. The trial group were divided into 2 subgroup according the myopic grading in the initial visit: subgroup A(35 eyes, ≤- 3. 00 D), B subgroup(32 eyes,>- 3. 00 D and ≤- 6. 00 D). In the trial <b>group,</b> slit <b>lamp,</b> visual acuity, refraction, intraocular pressure, corneal tomography were collected before wearing overnight orthokeratology, 1 d, 1 wk, 1 month, 3 mo, and every 6 mo after wearing overnight orthokeratology,with axial length, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, corneal endothelial cell count, abjective refraction and tear film were also collected before and 2 a after wearing overnight orthokeratology. In the control <b>group,</b> slit <b>lamp,</b> visual acuity, refraction and intraocular pressure were collected before wearing and 2 a after wearing spectacles. Paired t test were {{used to compare the}} intragroup difference. One-way analysis of variance(ANOVA) was used to compare the differences among the groups. P RESULTS: The uncorrected visual acuity of the trial group was improved obviously after wearing Orthokeratology Lens 1 d, the visual acuity of a group patients improved more significantly. The corneal curvature(including vertical curvature and horizontal curvature) of the trial group became more flat after wearing Orthokeratology Lens 2 a and stopped 2 wk; The length of ocular axis was also increased, the growth rate of B group(0. 33 ± 0. 31) mm was lower than that of group A(0. 43 ± 0. 25) mm; Subjective refraction of myopia was increased 0. 68 ± 0. 49 D than wearing Orthokeratology Lens before, but compared with the growth(2. 08 ± 0. 57) D of the control, the effect of myopia control was more obviously. Grade of dry eye was more severely than that of wearing Orthokeratology Lens before, but {{there was no significant difference}} between groups A and B. Compared with wearing Orthokeratology Lens before, corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, corneal endothelial cell number and the intraocular pressure were all no significant differences between the trial and control group. CONCLUSION: Orthokeratology is a safe and effective method for the correction of myopia, and long-term use of Orthokeratology Lens can effectively control the development of myopia.

40|$|The last CCPR intercomparison in 1985 showed {{variations}} of #+-# 1 % in the units of luminous intensity (candela) and luminous flux (lumen) maintained by 14 and 10 participating laboratories, respectively. Meanwhile, the BIPM (Bureau International des Poids et Mesures) {{and some of}} the participating laboratories changed their units, as reported by BIPM. Therefore, VNIIOFI and PTB have an interest in the cooperation on important scientific work in photometry, and this also provides the framework for this bilateral intercomparison. Measurements were carried out at both laboratories to compare the values of luminous intensity, photometric responsivity and luminous flux assigned to artifacts. At VNIIOFI the primary standard of luminous intensity is a high-temperature blackbody. Its temperature is determined by help of a non-selective cavity radiometer. A (primary) photometer with a liquid V(#lambda#) -correcting filter transfers the unit to a group of luminous intensity standard lamps, which are used for the maintenance of the unit. At present, luminous intensity and illuminance calibrations at VNIIOFI are carried out as substitution method with <b>groups</b> of standard <b>lamps</b> and V(#lambda#) -corrected (silicon) photometers. The luminous flux calibrations are carried out by means of a group of luminous flux reference standard lamps and a 2 -meter integrating sphere. The value of luminous flux was established during bilateral comparisons with the BIPM, 1990 and the CSIRO (Australia, 1991). At PTB, the photometric base unit of luminous intensity is realised annually based on radiometric power measurements with absolute radiometers. The unit is maintained by <b>groups</b> of incandescent <b>lamps.</b> In any case, the maintained unit was within the uncertainty range of the realisations and no adjustments were carried out within the last decade.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that radar returns of {{extended}} targets are not only sparse but also exhibit a tendency to cluster into randomly located, variable sized groups. However, the standard techniques of Compressive Sensing as applied in radar imaging hardly considers the clustering tendency into account while reconstructing the image from the compressed measurements. If the group sparsity is taken into account, it is intuitive that one might obtain better results both in terms of accuracy and time complexity as compared to the conventional recovery techniques like Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). In order to remedy this, techniques like Block OMP have been used in the existing literature. An alternate approach is via reconstructing the signal by transforming into the Hough Transform Domain where they become point-wise sparse. However, these techniques essentially assume specific size and structure of the groups and are not always effective if the exact characteristics of the groups are not known, prior to reconstruction. In this manuscript, a novel framework that we call locally adapting matching pursuit (LAMP) have been proposed for efficient reconstruction of group sparse signals from compressed measurements without assuming any specific size, location, or structure of the groups. The recovery guarantee of the LAMP and its superiority compared to the existing algorithms has been established with respect to accuracy, time complexity and flexibility in <b>group</b> size. <b>LAMP</b> has been successfully used on a real-world, experimental data set.

[...] "Merezhkovsky flew up to the Nurnberg fires with the agitation of a newly born butterfly... By this time most of us stopped visiting them," [...] wrote V. Yanovsky, a Green <b>Lamp</b> <b>group</b> member.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{identify}} the effects of aromatherapy on an anxiety of nursing students at the first time practice about intravenous injection. To learn intravenous injection skill is one of the most stressful situations for the nursing students. We expected that aromatherapy used as nursing intervention will be helpful to decrease their anxiety. Method: Subjects of this study were fifty-five nursing students who attended in fundamental of nursing class. The experiment and data collection were conducted on May 25, 2010. Anxiety was measured by five variables, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, McNair's tension-anxiety scale, and VAS for anxiety. Treatment of this study was aroma lamp inhalation using lavender, chamomile, and sweet-orange essential oil. Data were analyzed using PASW. Results: There were significant differences in pulse between experimental and control groups just before practice. And degree of increase in systolic blood pressure and pulse rate were significantly low in the experimental <b>group.</b> Conclusions: Aroma <b>lamp</b> inhalation, an easy to use intervention was useful to decrease anxiety in practice of intravenous injection...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} risk by being exposed by artificial UV-sources at the workplace in Austria was measured and evaluated. A representative {{overview of the}} measurement results, {{the evaluation of the}} UV-exposure risk and recommendations to reduction of the risk is given. The international organizations ACGIH and ICNIRP have promulgated guidelines on exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), to protect the general public and workers from hazards which result from being exposed to UVR sources. As the two guidelines differ in some definitions of the exposure duration to calculate the radiant exposure, different results may be obtained. Further it is possible to use the concept of minimal erythema doses - MED's in order to analyze the ability of UV radiation to produce erythema in the human skin. The differences have been analyzed by using the ICNIRP and ACGIH guidelines and the concept of MED's. The different results were compared and discussed. Measurements of UV-radiation concerning photobiological hazards were performed with spectral or integral methods. To increase the accuracy of the measurement a wavelength-dependent correction factor for the integral detectors was used. For simplified handling, the correction factors were classified into different spectra, <b>lamp</b> <b>groups</b> respectively...|$|R
