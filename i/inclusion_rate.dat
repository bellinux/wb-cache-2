The U.S. Grain Council reported that corn DDGS is used primarily as an energy source in swine diets because it contains approximately the same amount of digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) as corn, although the ME content may be slightly reduced when feeding reduced-oil DDGS. A 2007 study highlighted the recent trends in the use of DDGS, as many producers are including 20% DDGS in diets of swine in all categories. Although 20% is the recommended level of inclusion, some producers are successfully using greater inclusion rates. <b>Inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> of up to 35% DDGS has been used in diets fed to nursery pigs and finishing pigs.|$|E

These are all important aspects in a high performance sporting dog diet. Vitamins and minerals are essential {{for all types of}} dogs and the <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> of them is dependent on factors such as age, size, activity level, etc.19 Not meeting an animal's mineral and vitamin requirements can impact the level of performance tremendously.19 However, too high of a concentration of vitamins and minerals will increase the concentration of ash in the feed. Currently, it is stated that dog foods containing above 7% ash content may have long-term negative consequences on canines.1 Antioxidants such as vitamin E, beta carotene, rosemary oil, sage oil and lutein have been demonstrated in numerous studies to decrease immune response DNA damage linked to cancer, cataracts and arthritis by attaching to free radicals.23 This is important to consider with high performance sporting dogs due to the athlete's high prevalence of developing arthritis later in life. Various antioxidants will be used by the sporting dog to preserve animal and vegetable fats, vitamins and other ingredients prone to rancidity caused by oxidation, all of which are found in relatively high concentrations in performance canine diets.27As a preventative of arthritis, other additives may be included in the diet. These include glucosamine, chondroitine sulphate and omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA from fish oil.14,27 These factors have been shown to limit the development of chronic swelling and decrease existing inflammation caused by arthritis, which is essential in the high performance sporting dog.14,19 ...|$|E

Evidence-based practice for the elderly patient is difficult because elderly patients, especially the frail, are often excluded from clinical trials. To facilitate the participation of frail elderly patients in clinical trials, investigators should be more aware of possible barriers when setting up research. While conducting a trial entitled 'A randomized controlled trial of geriatric liaison intervention in frail surgical oncology patients' (LIFE) the main problem was low <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates.</b> This was due to: 1) limited physical and cognitive. reserve of frail elderly patients making participation and extra visits to the hospital a burden for patients; 2) difficulty with understanding written information and information given by telephone; and 3) insufficient awareness of the study by health care professionals. To increase <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates,</b> follow-up measurements were taken at a home visit. To overcome barriers to understanding written information and information given over the phone, patients were informed face to face and questionnaires were filled in an interview format. To increase awareness, posters, pencil and sweets with the logo of the study were distributed and the study protocol was repeatedly explained to new staff. Moreover, it was checked if possible eligible patients coming to the hospital were indeed screened for participation. The mentioned measures, increased <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> but also caused an increased time investment and consequently extra financial resources for staff costs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Screening {{for genetic}} {{variants}} that predispose individuals or their offspring to disease may be {{performed at the}} general population level or may instead be targeted at the relatives of previously identified carriers. The latter strategy {{has come to be}} known as “cascade genetic screening. ” Since the carrier risk of close relatives of known carriers is generally higher than the population risk, cascade screening is more efficient than population screening, in the sense that fewer individuals have to be genotyped per detected carrier. The efficacy of cascade screening, as measured by the overall proportion of carriers detected in a given population, is, however, lower than that of population-wide screening, and the respective <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> vary according to the population frequency and mode of inheritance of the predisposing variants. For dominant mutations, we have developed equations that allow the <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> of cascade screening to be calculated in an iterative fashion, depending upon screening depth and penetrance. For recessive mutations, we derived only equations for the screening of siblings and the children of patients. Owing to their mathematical complexity, it was necessary to study more extended screening strategies by simulation. Cascade screening turned out to result in low <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> (< 1 %) when aimed at the identification of heterozygous carriers of rare recessive variants. Considerably higher rates are achievable, however, when screening is performed to detect covert homozygotes for frequent recessive mutations with reduced penetrance. This situation is exemplified by hereditary hemochromatosis, for which up to 40 % of at-risk individuals may be identifiable through screening of first- to third-degree relatives of overt carriers (i. e., patients); the efficiency of this screening strategy was found to be ∼ 50 times higher than that of population-wide screening. For dominant mutations, <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> of cascade screening were estimated to be higher than for recessive variants. Thus, some 80 % of all carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation would be detected if screening were to be targeted specifically at first- to third-degree relatives of patients with venous thrombosis. The relative cost efficiency of cascade as compared with population-wide screening (i. e., the overall savings in the extra managerial cost of the condition) is also likely to be higher for dominant than for recessive mutations. This notwithstanding, once screening has become cost-effective at the population level, it can be expected that cascade screening would only transiently represent an economically viable option...|$|R

In the simulated grower diets, {{the increase in}} DDGS <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> between months at 5.6 % was used to substitute 5.4 % corn and 1 % SBM. However, soy oil was increased by 0.8 %, and lysine inclusion was increased at 0.002 %. Similarly, in the simulated finisher diet, an increase in DDGS <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> of 8 % combined with 1.1 % soy oil and 0.0025 % lysine was used to substitute 7.5 % corn and 1.4 % SBM. Loar et al. (2012) suggested an upper inclusion limit of DDGS in finisher diets of 14 %. The difference found {{in the current study}} could be due to the differences in feeds included in the diets, as well as the constraint of fiber set at 3 % in the current study. However, a DDGS <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> of about 14 % was possible in our model when the total fiber limit was set at 4 %. Therefore, 1 % of DDGS combined with 0.00032 % lysine and 0.14 % soy oil in broiler diets could replace 0.95 % corn and 0.2 % SBM. This means that, when using DDGS in the diet formulation, it should be considered that additional oil and lysine sources are required. This analysis demonstrates the viability of the proposed method to evaluate feed resources, particularly feed byproducts which are used to substitute typical feeds such as corn, wheat, and SBM.|$|E

40|$|Research on {{the effect}} of dietary ethanol {{by-products}} on beef quality has been limited. Some Universities have reported a decrease in marbling due to distillers grains inclusion, while others have not. It is unclear why marbling deposition may be decreased when increasing amounts of distillers grains are fed; however, decreased starch availability, increased vitamin A and D, and the high oil content in ethanol by-products may contribute. In contrast, distillers grains can increase unsaturated fatty acid content of beef, thus increasing healthfulness. Our objective was to measure the effect of wet distillers grains (0, 20, or 40 % of the diet) on growth, feed intake, and marbling deposition and to determine what may be responsible for decreased marbling. Average daily gain and feed intake did not differ between wet distillers grains treatments, but cattle fed distillers grains were more efficient. Marbling score decreased in high-concentrate-fed steers as WDG concentration was increased, but increased in high-foragefed steers from the 0 to 20 % WDG <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> and then decreased from the 20 to 40 % WDG <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate.</b> Backfat thickness decreased in high-concentrate-fed steers as WDG concentration increased but increased in high-forage-fed steers from the 0 to 20 % WDG <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> and then decreased from the 20 to 40 % WDG <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate.</b> Cattle fed distillers grains had lower plasma total vitamin A and plasma vitamin D.

The rapid expansion of the ethanol industry will saturate the dairy and hog markets for DDGS {{by the end of}} 2009, while the beef and poultry use must triple to consume all available product.

Meat colour and marbling score were similar across all treatments whereas fat and lean firmness was reduced by the 30 % ESB <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> (P< 0. 05) compared with all other treatments. Increasing ESB in the diet altered the fatty acid content of the pork by decreasing the amount of short-chain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids and increasing the amount of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The results of this study indicate that ESB can be used as the sole source of supplemental protein in barley-based diets for pigs with no detrimental effects on performance and minimal negative effects on carcass and meat quality. Alteration of fatty acid content of pork from feeding ESB has both positive and negative implications for consumer acceptance by increasing PUFA content while concomitantly increasing the risk of premature oxidation. ...|$|E

At day 112 replacing SS (T 2) with SY (T 3) increased the SeMet concentration of milk from 36 to 111 ng Se/g and its concentration increased further to 157 ng Se/g as the <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> of SY increased further (T 4) to provide 0. 45 mg Se/kg TMR. Neither Se source nor <b>inclusion</b> <b>rate</b> effected the keeping quality of milk. At day 112, milk from T 1, T 2, and T 3 was made into a hard cheese and Se source had a marked effect on total Se and the proportion of total Se comprised as either SeMet or SeCys. Replacing SS (T 2) with SY (T 3) increased total Se, SeMet and SeCys content from 180 to 340 ng Se/g, 57 to 153 ng Se/g and 52 to 92 ng Se/g, respectively.

40|$|A {{total of}} 210 pigs (PIC 327 × 1050, {{initially}} 15. 12 lb BW) {{were used in}} a 35 -d trial to evaluate the effects of increasing dietary wheat middlings (midds) on growth performance of 15 - to 50 -lb nursery pigs. Pens of pigs were balanced by initial BW and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 dietary treatments with 6 replications per treatment. The 5 corn-soybean meal–based diets contained 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 % midds. Pigs were fed in a 2 -phase feeding program from d 0 to 14 and d 14 to 35. Diets were not balanced for energy; thus, as midds increased, dietary energy concentrations decreased. From d 0 to 14, midds {{had no effect on}} growth performance; however, from d 14 to 35, pigs fed increasing midds had decreased ADG (linear, P < 0. 02) and poorer F/G (linear, P < 0. 004). Furthermore, pigs fed increasing midds had lower (linear, P < 0. 05) feed cost/pig, revenue/pig, and income over feed cost (IOFC), and a tendency for increased (quadratic, P < 0. 07) feed cost/lb gain. Overall (d 0 to 35), increasing dietary midds worsened F/G (quadratic, P < 0. 01), driven by poorer F/G for pigs fed 15 and 20 % midds. We also observed a quadratic effect (P < 0. 004) for feed cost/lb gain, with <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> of 0 and 20 % having the highest value. Caloric efficiency responded in a quadratic manner (P < 0. 01) on both an ME and NE basis with improved caloric effi¬ciencies at intermediate levels (mainly 5 %) of dietary middlings compared with 0 and 20 % inclusions. These data suggest that the inclusion of midds at levels up to 15 % do not negatively affect performance in 15 - to 50 -lb nursery pigs. Although we observed a linear decrease in overall IOFC, both <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> of 5 and 10 % were numerically more profitable than the control...|$|R
40|$|Most {{nutritional}} {{studies with}} seaweed meals or seaweed extracts have investigated low dietary <b>inclusion</b> <b>rates</b> (less than 10 %) {{to establish their}} possible usefulness as functional (binder effect), nutritional, and nutraceutical (health protective effect) supplements in shrimp feeds. The optimum inclusion level varies depending on algae or consumer species. In many instances, the inclusion of algae in feed formulations has resulted in improved pellet quality (water stability, water holding capacity and texture), higher feed intake, improved feed efficiency, better growth performance and higher animal product quality (higher pigmentation, lower cholesterol content). Additionally, macroalgae contain some active compounds that can improve animal resistance against bacterial and virus diseases. Some seaweed species can be co-cultivated with shrimps, resulting in a sustainable alternative to {{reduce the need for}} artificial feed. In this paper the studies on the effects of seaweed inclusion in shrimp feeds or seaweed co-culture with shrimp will be reviewed...|$|R
