5|$|In a Grey Cup rematch to <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> 2010 CFL season, Durant and the Roughriders {{staged a}} second half {{comeback}} {{to defeat the}} Alouettes in overtime. Durant threw five touchdown passes and picked up 478 passing yards during the game. For his efforts, he was named the CFL's Offensive Player of the Week. At the halfway point of the season, Durant had thrown 11 touchdown passes and 14 interceptions, while rushing for another five touchdowns. The CFL named Durant Offensive Player of the Month for September after a month where he passed for 1387 yards and five touchdowns. After Game 17 versus the BC Lions, Durant became only the second Roughrider quarterback to throw for over 5000 yards in a season, with the first being former head coach Kent Austin.

5|$|Sam {{died while}} him, Nathan and their {{associate}} Rafe Adler attempted {{to find the}} whereabouts of Henry Avery's Gunsway haul in a Panamanian prison. Nathan and Rafe escaped, while Sam is shot 'dead'. In reality, he was imprisoned once again after his wounds were tended to,a distraught Nate did attempt to find him, still thinking he was alive but was lead {{to believe that he}} was dead by the guards who wanted Sam to rot in prison as revenge for them indirectly killing a guard. 15 years later, he tracks down a retired Nathan and convinces him to pick up where they left off in the search for the Gunsway haul by feeding Nathan a false breakout story. The story involves Hector Alcazar, who broke Sam free and demands half of the treasure of the Gunsway. These events <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> main story of Uncharted 4: A Thief's End. It is later revealed that Rafe bribed the prison to release Sam, and that Sam double crossed Rafe to resume the search with Nathan.|$|E

5|$|Football {{games last}} {{for a total of}} 60 minutes in {{professional}} and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes. High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes. The two-halves are separated by a halftime period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break. Prior {{to the start of the}} game, the referee and team captains for each team meet at midfield for a coin toss. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend. Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters. If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.|$|E
5|$|The Bears won {{the coin}} toss and elected to <b>kick</b> <b>off.</b> <b>The</b> Rams scored {{on the opening}} {{possession}} with Gurley's six-yard touchdown run, but the Bears tied the score on a two-play drive; after Jeremy Langford was stopped for a one-yard loss, Jay Cutler threw a short pass to Zach Miller, who managed to break free and score on the 87-yard play. The next drive for the Rams saw the offense go three-and-out, but on the punt return, Marc Mariani was quickly hit by Bradley Marquez and fumbled, with the ball being recovered by St. Louis' Maurice Alexander. On the first play since the turnover, Austin scored on a 17-yard reverse, but the touchdown was nullified by Greg Robinson's holding penalty; the Rams eventually {{had to settle for}} Zuerlein's 26-yard field goal. After the Bears punted, they regained possession on the first play of the Rams' next drive, when Shea McClellin stripped Tre Mason and recovered the ball. Robbie Gould eventually kicked a 35-yard field goal to tie the score {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Rams punted on their next drive, and the Bears took the lead with Cutler throwing a two-yard touchdown pass to Miller. St. Louis later punted again, and Chicago's next series started at their own 14-yard line due to cornerback Alan Ball's holding penalty on the punt return. After Langford's three-yard run, Cutler held off a blitzing defense to throw a screen pass to Langford, who scored on the 83-yard play. The two teams exchanged punts for the remainder of the half; the first three drives of the second half also ended in punts. Afterwards, the two teams traded field goals, Zuerlein's being 38 yards and Gould's being 33 yards. On St. Louis' next drive, the team elected to try a fake punt, but Hekker's pass to Cody Davis fell short. The Bears increased the lead to 17 points with Gould's 36-yard field goal, and after the Rams' turned the ball over on downs again, scored on Langford's six-yard touchdown run. The next two drives ended with turnovers for both teams: Willie Young intercepted Foles, but runningback Ka'Deem Carey fumbled after being hit by Rodney McLeod, with the fumble being recovered by Aaron Donald. With 2:23 left in the game, the Rams reached the Bears' 28-yard line before time expired.|$|E

25|$|Games are officiated by one referee {{who usually}} has two assistants, {{one on each}} side of the field. The referee is {{responsible}} for ensuring the game is played according to the laws, keeping the time and recording the score. Prior to the start of the match, the referee organises the team captains for a coin toss. The winner chooses to either kick-off or selects an end of the playing field to defend in the first half. If the decision is made to <b>kick</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> loser of the coin toss chooses an end to defend, otherwise they must kick off. After half time the teams swap ends and the team that did not kick off in the first half starts play. The referee blows a whistle to begin each half, stop play or indicate a score. The assistant referees raise a flag if the ball has crossed the touch line or scored a goal. They can also signal foul play by holding the flag out horizontally and in some games are able to communicate with the referee using microphones. In higher level matches a fourth official is appointed who can replace an assistant if needed and is usually responsible for allowing the substitutions to enter the playing field. A television match official is also sometimes appointed and the referee can consult them if they are unsure of a score.|$|E
25|$|The eighth {{match was}} between Rob Van Dam (RVD) (ECW) and Jeff Hardy (WWF) for the WWF Hardcore Championship. Before the match began, RVD {{attacked}} Matt Hardy from behind with a steel chair. The match started {{back and forth}} with a quick pace. Hardy gained the advantage after a dropkick to the back. After Hardy missed a crossbody, RVD performed a standing moonsault, a lifting double underhook facebuster, and a rolling thunder. RVD then climbed the turnbuckles, but Hardy shoved him outside. Outside, Hardy walked the barricade, but RVD sent him into the crowd. After a moonsault from the barricade, Hardy was placed over the barricade, and RVD performed a spinning heel <b>kick</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> apron. Hardy fought back with a sunset flip powerbomb from the apron, took out a ladder, and climbed it. However, RVD tipped the ladder, causing Hardy to fall. RVD attempted to use a chair, but Hardy used the ladder. After Hardy hit RVD with the chair, RVD came back with a Van Daminator, sending Hardy off the stage. Back in the ring, RVD performed a Chair Surf, and attempted a split-legged moonsault, but Hardy blocked it with his knees. Hardy followed with a DDT, a German suplex, and a sitout jawbreaker. Later on, RVD avoided a Swanton Bomb, RVD placed the title belt on Hardy, and performed a Five Star Frog Splash onto the title. RVD then pinned Hardy to win the Hardcore title.|$|E
