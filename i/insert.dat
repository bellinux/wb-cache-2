5|$|All LDL {{receptor}} family proteins {{contain a}} cytoplasmic tail {{with at least}} one NPXY motif. This motif is important for binding intracellular adapter proteins and endocytosis. ApoER2 is distinct from most other members of the LDL family of receptors due to a unique <b>insert</b> on its cytoplasmic tail. In ApoER2, there is a proline-rich 59 amino acid <b>insert</b> encoded by the alternatively spliced exon 19. This <b>insert</b> allows for protein interactions that are unable to occur with other LDL receptors. It binds the PSD-95 adapter protein, cross-linking ApoER2 and the NMDA receptors during the process of long-term potentiation, and is also bound specifically by JIP-2, an important interaction in the JNK signalling pathway. It is also speculated that this <b>insert</b> may diminish the function of ApoER2 in lipoprotein endocytosis by somehow disrupting the NPXY motif.|$|E
5|$|Although the MP 40 was {{generally}} reliable, a major weakness was its 32-round magazine. Unlike the double-column, dual-feed magazine <b>insert</b> {{found on the}} Thompson M1921-28 variants, the MP 40 used a double-column, single-feed <b>insert.</b> The single-feed <b>insert</b> resulted in increased friction against the remaining cartridges moving upwards towards the feed lips, occasionally resulting in feed failures; this problem was exacerbated {{by the presence of}} dirt or other debris. Another problem was that the magazine was also sometimes misused as a handhold. This could cause the weapon to malfunction when hand pressure on the magazine body caused the magazine lips {{to move out of the}} line of feed, since the magazine well did not keep the magazine firmly locked. German soldiers were trained to grasp either the handhold on the underside of the weapon or the magazine housing with the supporting hand to avoid feed malfunctions.|$|E
5|$|Ensuring a plasmid accepts an <b>insert</b> is {{a common}} problem of DNA cloning. Toxin-antitoxin systems {{can be used to}} {{positively}} select for only those cells that have taken up a plasmid containing the inserted gene of interest, screening out those that lack the inserted gene. An example of this application comes from CcdB-encoded toxin, which has been incorporated into plasmid vectors. The gene of interest is then targeted to recombine into the CcdB locus, inactivating the transcription of the toxic protein. Thus, cells containing the plasmid but not the <b>insert</b> perish due to the toxic effects of CcdB protein, and only those that incorporate the <b>insert</b> survive.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then <b>insert</b> part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by force, or they bore a hole into the shell and <b>insert</b> a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fluid {{adsorption}} and {{the associated}} mass gain behaviour in tibial <b>inserts</b> of total knee replacements was investigated in polyethylene (PE) manufactured from extruded GUR 1050 resin. Repeatedly removing the PE <b>inserts</b> from the soak fluid for gravimetric assessment (including cleaning, desiccation, and weighing) increased the mass gain. Soaking PE <b>inserts</b> for 46 days or 92 days seemed to give about the same mass gain. PE <b>inserts</b> that were soaked at 37 uC gained more mass than PE <b>inserts</b> soaked at room-temperature. Gas-plasma sterilized PE <b>inserts</b> gained less mass than gamma-in-air sterilized PE <b>inserts.</b> No statistically significant differences were detected in mass gain between PE <b>inserts</b> that were of 10 mm and 14 mm thickness. The mass gain of PE <b>inserts</b> was higher in protein-rich soak fluid compared with low-ion distilled water. Prior to knee simulator wear testing, tibial PE <b>inserts</b> should be conditioned in the same medium and under the same test conditions (gravimetric assessment frequency, fluid protein content, and fluid temperature). This approach would help improve the accuracy and precision of the gravimetrically determined PE wear rate during knee simulator wear testing...|$|R

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{explores the}} use of porous <b>inserts</b> for heat transfer enhancement in recirculating flows, specifically flow over a backward-facing step. Numerical computations are performed for laminar flow with high porosity <b>inserts,</b> which are composed of small-diameter (150 μm) silicon carbide fibers aligned transverse to the streamwise flow. The <b>inserts</b> are varied in length and porosity {{in order to determine}} the most favorable combinations of maximum temperature reduction and head loss penalty. In general, the porous <b>inserts</b> reduce or eliminate the lower wall recirculation zone; however, in some cases the recirculation zone is lengthened if the <b>inserts</b> are short and extremely porous. Excellent heat transfer characteristics are shown within the <b>inserts</b> themselves due to the high-conductivity fiber material. Non-Darcy effects are shown to be important primarily as the porosity is increased. Deviation from local thermodynamic conditions between the <b>inserts</b> and the fluid is most apparent for the shortest <b>inserts</b> considered...|$|R
