40|$|This work {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} two methods of determination of soil water (laboratory method and field method) and four levels of soil water availability (20; 40; 60 and 80 %) on biomass of the aerial part, crop evapotranspiration, leaf area, plant height and yield in pit of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>plant,</b> cultivar CNPA- 7 H. The randomized blocks experimental design was used in factorial scheme 2 x 4, with three replications. The determination of available soil water by the field method overcame {{the results of the}} studied variables in relation to the laboratory method and it represents more real conditions of the readiness of water for the cotton plant. The leaf area and the evapotranspiration, determined by field method, increased significantly with the levels of available soil water. The management with the available water of 61. 61 % by laboratory method promoted the maximum leaf area of 1755. 4 cm 2 and, with 74. 4 % of levels of available water, the maximum evapotranspiration was of 238 mm. There were earnings of 0. 2 g of biomass per unit of levels of available soil water by field method; already by laboratory method the maximum biomass of 17. 6 g was reached with the management of levels of available water of 62. 9 %. The best response for the cotton incomes in pit was given by field method with earnings in the income of 0. 26 g for the field method and of 0. 11 g for the laboratory method per unit of available soil water...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo foi conduzido no período de julho a dezembro de 1998, em galpão coberto, no DSER/CCA/UFPB, município de Areia, PB, com o objetivo de se avaliar o efeito dos níveis de água disponível no solo (AD) (20, 40, 60 e 80 %) sobre a emissão/abscisão de estruturas reprodutivas do algodoeiro herbáceo, cv. CNPA 7 H; utilizou-se delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, com quatro tratamentos e três repetições, em três épocas de amostragem. O crescimento vegetativo e o reprodutivo, aumentaram com os níveis de AD no solo, sendo a menor média de altura de plantas (34, 5 cm), área foliar (633, 05 cm²), acumulação de fitomassa da parte aérea (9, 04 g), botões florais (4, 67), flores (3, 50), maçãs (2, 33) e capulhos (1, 33) por planta, observada no tratamento com o nível de 20 % da AD e a maior, 74, 33 cm, 2. 634, 81 cm², 24, 86 g, 9, 67, 7, 0, 6, 0 e 4, 3 por planta, respectivamente, no tratamento com o nível de 60 % da AD. Apesar do estresse hídrico ter afetado (p The {{present study}} was conducted from July to December 1998, in a covered area at DSER/CCA/UFPB, Areia/PB {{with the objective of}} evaluating the effect of four levels of available water (AW - 20, 40, 60 and 80 %) in soil on the emission/abscission of reproductive structures of <b>herbaceous</b> <b>cotton</b> <b>plant,</b> cv. CNPA 7 H. A completely randomized experimental design was used, with four treatments replicated three times and sampled at three different dates. Vegetative and reproductive growth increased with AW levels in soil. Minimum mean values for plant height (34. 5 cm), leaf area (633. 05 cm²), biomass accumulation of aerial parts (9. 04 g), number of flower buds (4. 67), flowers (3. 50), fruits (2. 33) and bolls (1. 33) per plant, were observed for the 20 % AW treatment. In contrast, the highest mean values observed for the 60 % AW treatment, respectively, were 74. 33 cm, 2, 634. 8 cm², 24. 86 g, 9. 67, 7. 0, 6. 0 and 4. 3. Water stress showed significant effect (p< 0, 05) on emission and abscission of reproductive structures of cotton plants in an independent way. Thus, an increase or a {{decrease in the number of}} retained flower buds precedes a similar pattern for the number of flowers, fruit and mature bolls, keeping a standard proportionality, regardless of the water stress level...|$|E
40|$|Mocó cotton was {{the most}} {{important}} crop in Northeastern Brazil. Local varieties had been developed before governmental breeding programs, which should be identified and preserved as a genetic resource. The aim of this work was to select SSR markers which can be used to monitor gene flow from <b>herbaceous</b> to mocó <b>cotton</b> <b>plants,</b> using non transgenic upland cotton as a pollen source. Unique mocó cotton feral populations were identified in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, and mother plants and their seeds were collected. Allele frequencies were studied among fifteen plants from these populations using 64 SSR primer pairs. Ten SSR markers, with alleles exclusive to mocó or upland genotypes, were selected to monitor gene flow by paternity analysis (BNL 3627; 2960; 2572; 3261; 3398; 3948; 3502; 3646 and CIR 094; 097). The collected seeds had none of the upland cotton alleles. The absence of exclusive alleles from upland cotton in the offspring showed that gene flow to mocó cotton was absent or lower than the analysis could detect. Among the mother plants, the number of homozygous individuals at four polymorphic loci was greater than expected, showing that reproduction occurs preferentially by self-fertilization or crossing among related individuals. Paternity analysis is an accurate measure of gene flow, and the methodology can be used for monitor these populations or others. Preservation of the plants is spoiled mainly by drought...|$|R

40|$|When {{investigating}} {{strategies for}} Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) control, {{it is important}} to understand oviposition behaviour. Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) was sown into standing wheat (Triticum astivum L.) stubble in a closed arena to investigate the effect of stubble on H. armigera moth behaviour and oviposition. Infrared cameras were used to track moths and determine whether stubble acted as a physical barrier or provided camouflage to <b>cotton</b> <b>plants,</b> thereby reducing oviposition. Searching activity was observed to peak shortly before dawn (03 : 00 and 04 : 00 h) and remained high until just after dawn (4 h window). Moths spent more time resting on <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> than spiralling above them, and the least time flying across the arena. While female moths spent more time searching for <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> growing in wheat stubble, the difference in oviposition was not significant. As similar numbers of eggs were laid on <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> with stubble (3. 5 /plant SE +/- 0. 87) and without stubble (2. 5 /plant SE +/- 0. 91), wheat stubble does not appear to provide camouflage to <b>cotton</b> <b>plants.</b> There was no significant difference in the location of eggs deposited on <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> with and without stubble, although more eggs were laid on the tops of cotton leaves in wheat stubble. As the spatial and temporal distribution of eggs laid on the <b>cotton</b> <b>plant</b> is a crucial component of population stability, eggs laid on the upper side of leaves on <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> may be more prone to fatalities caused by environmental factors such as wind and rain. Therefore, although stubble did not influence the number of eggs laid, it did affect their distribution on the plant, which may result in increased mortality of eggs on <b>cotton</b> <b>plants</b> sown into standing wheat stubble...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} had as {{objective}} to carry through a climatic zoning of the Northeast Region of Brazil for sugar cane, orange and <b>herbaceous</b> <b>cotton</b> cultures. The choice of these cultures was made through {{the identification of}} factors as the production performance, the dissemination of the culture in the region, the potential market and the social importance. The results were gotten through analysis of the water balance and average, maximum and minimum temperatures for meteorological stations located in 23 cities in the region. Waterbalance, calculated for the method of Thornthwaite & Mather (1955), and temperature data were gotten through the Climatic Data base of Brazil (EMBRAPA, 2003). The cities have been classified in apt, restricted, restrictedinapt and inapt, {{in accordance with the}} climatic equirements of each culture.
