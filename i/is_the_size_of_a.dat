5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling {{on one of the}} mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E

25|$|A perfect {{matching}} (a.k.a. 1-factor) is a matching which matches all vertices of the graph. That is, every vertex of the graph is incident to exactly one {{edge of the}} matching. Figure (b) above {{is an example of}} a {{perfect matching}}. Every perfect matching is maximum and hence maximal. In some literature, the term complete matching is used. In the above figure, only part (b) shows a perfect matching. A perfect matching is also a minimum-size edge cover. Thus, , that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maximum matching is no larger than the size of a minimum edge cover.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a legend}} in East Anglia about a ghostly black hound from hell that roams the coast and lonely lanes of Norfolk. The hound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small horse and appears {{from the depths of}} Beeston Bump with malevolent flaming red eyes. Anyone confronted by the Doom Dog will be dead within a year. Sometimes, Black Shuck has {{appeared}} headless and, at other times, he appears to float on a carpet of mist, rather than running. The Black Shuck often terrifies his victims out of their wits, although the apparition is said not to harm its victims. The legend was the inspiration behind Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes story, The Hound of the Baskervilles. Conan Doyle had been on a golfing holiday at the nearby Links Hotel in West Runton, and it was in the sitting room of the hotel that his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, recounted the legend of the Black Hound from the Bump.|$|E

25|$|Over the years, some of {{the most}} {{prominent}} projects at the University have been associated with the Department of Physics. In 1948, the university built the first betatron facility in Canada. Three years later, the world's first non-commercial cobalt-60 therapy unit was constructed. (The first female Chancellor of the University, Sylvia Fedoruk, {{was a member of the}} cobalt-60 research team. She also served as Saskatchewan's Lieutenant-Governor from 1988–1994.) The success of these facilities led to the construction of a linear accelerator as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory in 1964 and placed university scientists at the forefront of nuclear physics in Canada. Experience gained from years of research and collaboration with global researchers led to the University of Saskatchewan being selected as the site of Canada's national facility for synchrotron light research, the Canadian Light Source. This facility opened October 22, 2004 and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> football field. The Plasma Physics Laboratory operates a tokamak on campus.

2500|$|The [...] "canon obusier" [...] was a smoothbore cannon firing either shells, balls, or canister.

2500|$|Australia has the world's {{largest and}} most diverse range of marsupials. Marsupials are characterised by the {{presence}} of a pouch in which they rear their young. The carnivorous marsupials—order Dasyuromorphiaare represented by two surviving families: the Dasyuridae with 51 members, and the Myrmecobiidae with the numbat as its sole surviving member. The Tasmanian tiger was the largest Dasyuromorphia and the last living specimen of the family Thylacinidae died in captivity in 1936. The world's largest surviving carnivorous marsupial is the Tasmanian devil; it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small dog and can hunt, although it is mainly a scavenger. It became extinct on the mainland some 600 years ago, and is now found only in Tasmania. There are four species of quoll, or [...] "native cat", all of which are threatened species. The Eastern quoll for example {{is believed to have been}} extinct on the mainland since the 1960s, though [...] The remainder of the Dasyuridae are referred to as [...] "marsupial mice"; most weigh less than 100g. There are two species of marsupial moleorder Notoryctemorphiathat inhabit the deserts of Western Australia. These rare, blind and earless carnivorous creatures spend most of their time underground; little is known about them.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson often {{discusses}} {{high speed}} driving on public roads, criticising road safety campaigns involving cameras and speed bumps. In 2002, a Welsh Assembly Member Alun Pugh wrote to BBC director general Greg Dyke {{to complain about}} Clarkson's comments that he believed encouraged people to use Welsh roads as a high speed test track. A BBC spokesman said that suggestions Clarkson had encouraged speeding were [...] "nonsense". Clarkson has also made similar comments about driving in Lincolnshire. As of 2004 Clarkson was reported as having a clean licence. In a November 2005 Times article, Clarkson wrote on the Bugatti Veyron, [...] "On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted {{to reach the top}} speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240 mph," [...] and [...] "From the wheel of a Veyron, France <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small coconut.

[...] In 2007, solicitor Nick Freeman represented Clarkson against a charge of driving at 86mph in a 50mph zone on the A40 road in London, defeating it on the basis that the driver of the car loaned to Clarkson from Alfa Romeo could not be ascertained. In 2008, Clarkson claimed in a talk at the Hay Festival to have been given a speeding ticket for driving at 186mph on the A1203 Limehouse Link road in London.|$|E
