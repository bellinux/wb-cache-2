5|$|After their modernization, both ships {{participated in}} the normal {{activities}} of the fleet, including fleet problem exercises, and then joined the entire Pacific Fleet in their new base in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, after {{the beginning of the}} Second World War in Europe. Two years later, on 7 December 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor sank Arizona in a tremendous explosion and slightly damaged Pennsylvania, which was in dry <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> the time.

5|$|Although Carnival Cruise Lines did {{not operate}} from Mobile after the Carnival Fantasy left in 2011, the Carnival Triumph was towed into the port {{following}} a crippling engine room fire. It {{was the largest}} cruise ship ever to <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> the cruise terminal in Mobile. Later it was eclipsed by the Carnival Conquest, which docked in Mobile when the Port of New Orleans was temporarily closed. Larger commercial ships routinely arrive at the Port of Mobile.|$|E
5|$|Kymer's <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> Kidwelly {{continued}} {{to be used for}} the export of coal by coasters for another 50 years. It was used as a rubbish dump during the 1950s, but together with a short section of the canal was restored in the 1980s. A few of the structures of the canal can still be traced in the landscape, and the route of the now closed railway can be followed for most of its length.|$|E
5|$|On February 29, 2016, The Northwest Seaport Alliance {{invited the}} CMA CGM Benjamin Franklin, the largest cargo ship {{to visit the}} United States, to <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> the Port of Seattle's Terminal 18. The move {{was used to test}} the terminal's {{capabilities}} in handling a ship of that size (in the range of 18,000 twenty-foot equivalent units, or TEUs) and promote expansion of Terminal 5 into a facility to handle larger ships. In April 2016, the alliance approved $141 million in funding to upgrade piers and cranes at the Port of Tacoma's Husky Terminal.|$|E

However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour is the presence of an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} {{considered}} second-class battleships, lightly constructed, armed, and armoured by British standards; Swiftsure, in fact, suffered from structural weakness while in service and required hull strengthening, although Triumph {{did not have}} such problems. Chile had required the ships {{to fit into the}} graving <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> Talcahuano, so they had to be longer and narrower for their displacement than ships built to British standards. Details in mast and anchor arrangements as well as the arrangement of magazines and shell-handling rooms also were different from British standards.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} the first {{to be able to be}} resupplied by the newly {{developed}} unmanned Progress freighters, although they could only <b>dock</b> <b>at</b> the rear port, as the front port lacked the plumbing used to refuel the propulsion system. The freighters docked automatically to the station via the Igla, and were then opened and emptied by the cosmonauts on board, whilst transfer of fuel to the station took place automatically under supervision from the ground.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine {{arrived at}} Bombay {{in the early}} morning of 12 April. Having taken on a pilot shortly before 10:00 she was docked at the Victoria <b>Dock</b> <b>at</b> midday. The {{practice}} of flying a red flag to signify dangerous cargo on board had been discontinued in wartime as doing so would identify such vessels {{in the event of an}} enemy air raid on a port. Also, the practice on unloading such vessels into lighters offshore had also been discontinued due to the war. At the time, explosives were graded as Category A, B, or C. Category A explosives, such as those carried on board Fort Stikine, were the most dangerous. These were only allowed to be offloaded onto lighters, and not directly to the quayside.|$|E
