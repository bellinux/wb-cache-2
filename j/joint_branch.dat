40|$|Given a {{directed}} Cartesian product T {{of locally}} finite, leafless, rooted directed trees T_ 1, [...] ., T_d of finite <b>joint</b> <b>branching</b> index, one may associate with T the Drury-Arveson-type C[z_ 1, [...] ., z_d]-Hilbert module H_ c_a(T) of vector-valued holomorphic functions {{on the open}} unit ball B^d in C^d, where a > 0. In case all directed trees under consideration are without branching vertices, H_ c_a(T) {{turns out to be}} the classical Drury-Arveson-type Hilbert module H_a associated with the reproducing kernel 1 /(1 - 〈z, w〉) ^a defined on B^d. Unlike the case of d= 1, the above association does not yield a reproducing kernel Hilbert module if we relax the assumption that T has finite <b>joint</b> <b>branching</b> index. The main result of this paper classifies all directed Cartesian product T for which the Hilbert modules H_ c_a(T) are isomorphic in case a is a positive integer. One of the essential tools used to establish this isomorphism is an operator-valued representing measure arising from H_ c_a(T). Further, a careful analysis of these Hilbert modules allows us to prove that the cardinality of the k^th generation (k = 0, 1, [...] .) of T_ 1, [...] ., T_d are complete invariants for H_ c_a(·) provided ad ≠ 1. Failure of this result in case ad = 1 may be attributed to the von Neumann-Wold decomposition for isometries. Along the way, we identify the joint cokernel E of the multiplication d-tuple M_z on H_ c_a(T) with orthogonal direct sum of tensor products of certain hyperplanes. Comment: 32 page...|$|R

The depot was mainly used to receive coal for domestic distribution. The area occupied by the freight depot was later used for the construction of The Concourse. The West Kirby goods depot was principally served by a daily goods train along the electric line from Birkenhead, which also served goods depots at Hoylake, Moreton, and the Cadbury's factory near Leasowe.|$|E

A finite element model (FEM) for a space-frame based military vehicle is presented in this paper. An approach is developed to optimize the design of the joints within the space frame structure to reduce the mass of the vehicle while maintaining its structural integrity. The process starts by creating a parametric FEM of the vehicle. The optimization variables are the lengths of <b>joint</b> <b>branches.</b> The effect of joint location within the space frame is also explored. The problem is subject to geometry and stress constraints. Results show that a mass reduction can be achieved without adversely affecting integrity of the vehicle...|$|R

40|$|Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{powerful}} methods used to analyze the integrity of the signal propagating in a transmission line.

The fault points, <b>joints,</b> <b>branches,</b> junctions, abrupt cross-section changes, etc., cause such reflections. The reflectometry technique involves the excitation of the circuit under test with either a fast edge step function or a well-defined impulse confined in time and frequency domains, and thereafter detection of the amplitude and time of the reflections. Both variants of the method were successfully applied to localize open circuit faults in the voltage tap connections, pressure transducers, and temperature sensing carbon gages circuits of the LHC String Dipole Magnet MB 2 and Short Straight Section Quadrupole...|$|R
