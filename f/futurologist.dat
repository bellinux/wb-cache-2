The book Moondust by Andrew Smith, a collection of accounts {{of the men who}} had walked on the Moon, was required reading for cast members. The book had been assigned by Boyle because it described the lasting psychological changes experienced by that particular group of astronauts. The director sought to manifest the effect by showing the Sun's awesome, radiant power influencing the psyches of the ship's crew.|$|E

50|$|Futurists or <b>futurologists</b> are {{scientists}} {{and social scientists}} whose specialty is futurology or the attempt to systematically explore predictions and possibilities {{about the future and}} how they can emerge from the present, whether that of human society in particular or of life on Earth in general.|$|R
50|$|Futures {{techniques}} {{used in the}} multi-disciplinary field of futures studies by futurists in Americas and Australasia, and futurology by <b>futurologists</b> in EU, include a diverse range of forecasting methods, including anticipatory thinking, backcasting, simulation, and visioning. Some of the anticipatory methods include, the delphi method, causal layered analysis, environmental scanning, morphological analysis, and scenario planning.|$|R
50|$|The {{optimism}} of these <b>futurologists,</b> even if just in {{their focus on}} the future, was overtaken by the pessimism of the 1980s. Even during the 1970s the Club of Rome's report (forecasting the problems posed by population growth {{at the same time}} as the depletion of natural resources) was already offering a very pessimistic, indeed alarmist alternative.|$|R

50|$|In fact, many <b>futurologists</b> {{believe the}} {{empirical}} situation {{is worse than}} Gott's DA estimate. For instance, Sir Martin Rees believes that the technological dangers give an estimated human survival duration of ninety-five years (with 50% confidence.) Earlier prophets made similar predictions and were 'proven' wrong (e.g., on surviving the nuclear arms race). It is possible that their estimates were accurate, and that their common image as alarmists is a survivorship bias.|$|R
50|$|The {{result was}} that many {{organizations}} reverted to planning only for the relatively short term, if at all. The optimism of the <b>futurologists</b> was judged {{to be out of}} step with the gloomier mood of the times. Planning horizons, even for some of the more sophisticated organizations, shrank from ten years to five to three. Most concentrated once more on the one-year (budgetary) planning cycle they knew and understood.|$|R

50|$|The United States of Europe, the European state, the European federation, and Federal Europe are names used {{to refer}} to several similar {{hypothetical}} scenarios of the unification of Europe as a single sovereign federation of states, similar to the United States of America, both as projected by writers of speculative fiction and science fiction, and by political scientists, politicians, geographers, historians, and <b>futurologists.</b> At present, while the European Union (EU) is not officially a federation, various academic observers regard it as having the characteristics of a federal system.|$|R
50|$|The 1970s {{brought an}} end to this stability, most notably in the repercussions of the ending of the Bretton Woods {{agreement}} on currency stability closely followed by the oil shock of 1973. The emphasis moved to the development of alternative forecasts. The attempt then was to see what the possible range of alternative futures might be, so that contingency plans could be laid to handle whatever occurred in practice. It was the decade of the <b>futurologists,</b> led by the group at SRI (Stanford Research Institute) and, in particular, publicized by Herman Kahn (of the Hudson Institute).|$|R
5|$|In fact, process {{theology}} {{is difficult to}} define because process theologians are so diverse and transdisciplinary in their views and interests. John B. Cobb, Jr. is a process theologian who has also written books on biology and economics. Roland Faber and Catherine Keller integrate Whitehead with poststructuralist, postcolonialist, and feminist theory. Charles Birch was both a theologian and a geneticist. Franklin I. Gamwell writes on theology and political theory. In Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age, <b>futurologists</b> Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist repeatedly credit Whitehead for the process theology they see {{rising out of the}} participatory culture expected to dominate the digital era.|$|R

50|$|Working in University and ISIG {{also gave}} him the {{opportunity}} to resume publication of the prediction journal Futuribili. Running parallel to the English-language Futures and the French Futuribles, it was founded in 1967 by Pietro Ferraro and continued until his death in 1974. Twenty years later I restarted the journal under the ownership of ISIG and with the Angeli publishing house in Milan. Issued in Italian every four months, it deals with the prediction of social and political developments that have included the Yugoslav wars, Russia, the lives of <b>futurologists,</b> the concepts underpinning prediction, the future of religion and the Italy of the future.|$|R
30|$|One of the <b>futurologists</b> {{anticipated}} in {{his report}} [21 – 23] that following the rapid increase in global demand of marine products, the aquaculture business would become a high value-added business as other cutting-edge technology-based industries and emerge {{as one of the}} major industries in 2018. The report also predicted that the volume of cultured marine products would exceed more than 50 % of entire marine products starting from 2015, and due to their continued price increase and demand, the global market size for the these products would reach around one trillion US dollars. Thus, the relevant ROK government agencies have been conducting various researches and pilot projects pertaining to the ‘u-Farms’ (Urban Farms).|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we attempt to show that men have aimed at cyborgizing {{themselves}} from the dawn of history. We will present selected current perspectives {{on the process of}} cyborgization that we symbolically call the restoring and extending ones. We will show selected exemplifications of cyborgizing activities and visions on the cyborgization of tomorrow. The analysis of these concepts is crucial for teachers, as they show the dichotomous relation between education and cyborgization. The dichotomy is related to the fact that on the one hand <b>futurologists</b> claim cyborgization is a technology of a tremendous educational potential, {{and on the other hand}} they conjecture about the concept of a world of cyborgs that exists without education...|$|R

5000|$|Elsewhere in {{the book}} Smoley {{discusses}} the larger dilemma faced by those who try to predict the future:The scientific or quasi-scientific <b>futurologist</b> can base his forecasts only on the continuation of current trends. And yet if we know nothing else about the future, it is that current trends do not continue. There are disruptions, dislocations, surprises. The <b>futurologist</b> cannot foresee these.The apocalyptic prophet faces no such restrictions. He has no incentive to predict more of the same; who would read him then? Consequently, he is entirely happy to foretell all kinds of upheavals, natural and supernatural—the submerging of continents, the manifestation of extraterrestrials, the shifting of the earth’s pole, the return of Jesus Christ. In one sense, he too is right. Cataclysms do occur. But somehow they never occur {{in the way they}} were predicted.|$|E
5000|$|The work of Bakis {{demonstrates}} that ICT {{does not lead}} to the [...] "death of distance", or [...] "the end of geography [...] " [...] in spite of the assertions of some <b>futurologists</b> as Richard O'Brien, Frances Cairncross, Kenichi Ohmae. ICT would minimize the importance of geographical locations, the development of networks but simultaneously leads to greater spatial heterogeneity with enhanced polarization and metropolisation. The development of infrastructure networks is closely related to demographic, social and economic pre-existing environment. Bakis dismissed the unfounded hopes of positive spatial effects. Bakis wrote that despite the development of infrastructure and communications services [...] "space continues to be differentiated {{and this is one of}} the reasons why networks are heterogeneous".|$|R
40|$|This {{working paper}} explores {{the role of}} the future as a space of {{scientific}} exchange and dialogue in the Cold War period. We argue that in East and West the governance of the future were understood as both intellectual and technical problem that, importantly, challenged existing notions of the nature of liberal democratic and communist political regimes. Casting the future as a governable sphere {{led to the development of}} new forms of scientific governance which sought explicitly to depoliticize the future and turn it into a new transnational domain of technocratic politics. The paper focuses on the parallels and exchanges among American and Soviet <b>futurologists.</b> East-West collaboration was essential to the invention of the future as a governable technoscientific space, situated beyond political dispute...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} a sociological {{perspective on the}} study of utopias and utopian thinking by focussing on the disciplinary assumptions of various major writers on the subject. The historians deploy a static and theoryless narrative code lacking a dynamic sense of social structure. <b>Futurologists</b> have made specific, but limited and risky, statistical predictions of future social trends. Sociologists have shown how modern socialist utopias presuppose that society is malleable and amenable to secular control. Others have speculated about the catalytic function of utopias {{in the face of the}} repressive Soviet regime. The social philosophers of the ‘Critical Theory’ school have justified the possibility of the socialist utopia through ever more complex transcendental arguments. The article doubts the cognitive value of the results and warns of the costs of striving to achieve the unachievable...|$|R
