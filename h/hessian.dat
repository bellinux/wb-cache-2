5000|$|The small German {{states of}} the Holy Roman Empire had {{professional}} armies, which their ruling princes were sometimes willing to hire out for service with other armies as mercenaries. When military conflict broke out, the German states provided a ready supply of trained troops that {{was ready to go}} into action immediately. Hesse-Kassel was particularly prominent in this role: Between 1706 and 1707, 10,000 <b>Hessians</b> served as a corps in Eugene of Savoy's army in Italy before moving to the Spanish Netherlands in 1708. In 1714, 6,000 <b>Hessians</b> were rented to Sweden for its war with Russia whilst 12,000 <b>Hessians</b> were hired by George I of Great Britain in 1715 to combat the Jacobite Rebellion. ... In the midst of the War of the Austrian Succession in 1744, 6,000 <b>Hessians</b> were fighting with the British army in Flanders whilst another 6,000 were in the Bavarian army.

5|$|On September 29, Washington {{moved the}} army closer to Yorktown and British gunners {{opened fire on}} the infantry.

5|$|The Continental Army had {{previously}} suffered several defeats in New York {{and had been}} forced to retreat through New Jersey to Pennsylvania. Morale in the army was low; to end the year on a positive note, George Washington—Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army—devised a plan to cross the Delaware River on the night of December25–26 and surround the <b>Hessian</b> garrison.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May and into early June, ships {{carrying}} troops and war supplies continued to arrive at Quebec. By June 2, Carleton had added the 9th, 20th, 29th, 53rd and 60th Regiments of Foot, along with General John Burgoyne, to his command. Also arriving in the fleet were <b>Hessian</b> troops from Brunswick commanded by Baron Riedesel.|$|E

5|$|After the Hessians {{entered the}} fort, the American {{officers}} attempted to placate the <b>Hessian</b> commander, Captain von Malmburg, {{who was in}} charge of the surrender. They invited him into their barracks, and offered him punch, wine, cake, with compliments. As they left the fort, the Hessians stripped the American troops of their baggage and beat some of them. Their officers intervened to prevent further injuries or deaths. The British captured thirty-four cannons, two howitzers, along with many tents, blankets, tools and much ammunition.|$|E
5|$|At family gatherings, Victoria {{had often}} met Prince Louis of Battenberg, who {{was her first}} cousin once removed {{and a member of}} a morganatic branch of the <b>Hessian</b> royal family. Prince Louis had adopted British {{nationality}} and was serving as an officer in the Royal Navy. In the winter of 1882, they met again at Darmstadt, and were engaged the following summer.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{launched}} his attack on November 16. He led an assault from three sides: the north, east and south. Tides in the Harlem River prevented some troops from landing and delayed the attack. When the British moved against the defenses, the southern and western American defenses fell quickly. Patriot {{forces on the}} north side offered stiff resistance to the <b>Hessian</b> attack, but they too were eventually overwhelmed. With the fort surrounded by land and sea, Colonel Magaw chose to surrender. A total of 59 Americans were killed and 2,837 were taken as prisoners of war.|$|E

5|$|Howe {{fired his}} signal guns at 09:00 and the <b>Hessians</b> began to attack up Battle Pass, while the main army came at Sullivan from the rear. Sullivan left his advance guard {{to hold off}} the <b>Hessians</b> while he turned {{the rest of his}} force around to fight the British. Heavy {{casualties}} mounted between the Americans and the British, and men on both sides fled out of fear. Sullivan attempted to calm his men and tried to lead a retreat. By this point, the <b>Hessians</b> had overrun the advance guard on the heights and the American left had completely collapsed. Hand-to-hand fighting followed, with the Americans swinging their muskets and rifles like clubs to save their own lives. Many of the Americans who surrendered were bayoneted by the <b>Hessians.</b> Sullivan, despite the chaos, managed to evacuate most of his men to Brooklyn Heights though he himself was captured.|$|R

5|$|In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is {{deployed}} to the Westchester County hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, New York, {{which has been}} plagued by a series of brutal slayings in which the victims are found decapitated: Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau), a wealthy farmer; his son Dirk; and the widow Emily Winship. Crane learns that locals believe the killer is the undead apparition of a headless <b>Hessian</b> mercenary (Christopher Walken) from the American Revolutionary War who rides a black steed in search of his missing head.|$|E
5|$|John Fortescue's History of the British Army {{says that}} Howe's {{casualties}} numbered 214 British and 99 Hessians. However, Rodney Atwood {{points out that}} Fortescue's figure for the Hessians includes the entire <b>Hessian</b> casualties from 19–28 October and that in fact only 53 of these casualties were incurred at the Battle of White Plains. This revised figure would give a total of 267 British and Hessians killed, wounded or missing at White Plains. Henry Dawson, on the other hand, gives Howe's loss as 47 killed, 182 wounded and 4 missing.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{eventually}} captured, but Newport, Rhode Island {{in the hands}} of the Americans posed a threat as a base for recapturing New York, so in November 1776 a fleet, which included Lord Sandwich 2 carrying <b>Hessian</b> Troops, set out to take Rhode Island, which was taken but not subdued, and Lord Sandwich 2 was needed as a prison ship.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, Howe landed {{his army}} in an amphibious {{operation}} at Kip's Bay, {{on the eastern}} shore of Manhattan, along the East River. After a bombardment of the American positions on the shore, 4,000 British and <b>Hessian</b> troops landed, and they fought the Battle of Kip's Bay. The American troops began to flee {{at the sight of the}} enemy, and even after Washington arrived on the scene and took immediate command, demanding that his soldiers fight, they refused to obey orders and continued to flee.|$|E
5|$|Out {{in front}} of his army, Cornwallis placed a {{skirmish}} line of <b>Hessian</b> jägers and British light infantry. Two days before, Washington had troops under the command of Matthias Alexis Roche de Fermoy place an outer defensive line halfway between Trenton and Princeton, with the goal of delaying the British advance. As the British approached, Fermoy returned to Trenton, drunk. Colonel Edward Hand took over his command.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Hessian</b> forces lost 22 {{killed in}} action, 83 wounded, and 896 capturedincluding the wounded. The Americans {{suffered}} only two deaths from bare feet causing frostbite and five wounded from battle, including a near-fatal wound to future president James Monroe. Other losses incurred by the Patriots due to exhaustion, exposure, and illness {{in the following}} days may have raised their losses above those of the Hessians.|$|E
500|$|The <b>Hessians</b> in {{the field}} {{attempted}} to reorganize, and make one last attempt to retake the town so {{they could make a}} breakout.

5|$|The Hessians, in {{the center}} {{under the command of}} General von Heister, began to bombard the American lines {{stationed}} at Battle Pass under the command of General John Sullivan. The <b>Hessian</b> brigades did not attack, as they were waiting for the pre-arranged signal from the British, who {{were in the process of}} outflanking the American lines at that time. The Americans were still under the assumption that Grant's attack up the Gowanus Road was the main thrust, and Sullivan sent four-hundred of his men to reinforce Stirling.|$|E
5|$|The pro-war faction {{was led by}} Carteret, {{who claimed}} that French power would {{increase}} if Maria Theresa failed to succeed to the Austrian throne. George agreed to send 12,000 hired <b>Hessian</b> and Danish mercenaries to Europe, ostensibly to support Maria Theresa. Without conferring with his British ministers, George stationed them in Hanover to prevent enemy French troops from marching into the electorate. The British army had not fought in a major European war in over 20 years, and the government had badly neglected its upkeep. George had pushed for greater professionalism in the ranks, and promotion by merit rather than by sale of commissions, but without much success. An allied force of Austrian, British, Dutch, Hanoverian and <b>Hessian</b> troops engaged the French at the Battle of Dettingen on 16/27 June 1743. George personally accompanied them, leading them to victory, thus becoming the last British monarch to lead troops into battle. Though his actions in the battle were admired, the war became unpopular with the British public, who felt that the king and Carteret were subordinating British interests to Hanoverian ones. Carteret lost support, and to George's dismay resigned in 1744.|$|E
5|$|Alice, heavily {{pregnant}} with her third child, saw Louis depart to command the <b>Hessian</b> cavalry against the Prussians, and sent her children to stay with Queen Victoria in England.

On 11 July, {{she gave birth to}} Princess Irene; Prussian troops {{were on the verge of}} entering Darmstadt, she begged the Grand Duke to surrender on Prussia's terms. This provoked fury from the fiercely anti-Prussian Prince Alexander, but Alice realised that the conquered German states would likely form a union which she, like her sister Victoria, supported.|$|E
