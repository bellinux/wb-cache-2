500|$|Reception of Marvel Trading Card Game {{across all}} three {{platforms}} was mixed. [...] The game {{was compared to}} other collectible card games such as Pokémon, Magic, and Munchkin. [...] Reviewers were pleased with the game's representation of the VS System rules, but {{felt that it was}} less accessible to players who weren't familiar with the physical version. [...] Several reviews referred to the gameplay as addictive; IGN's Hilary Goldstein said [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> am somewhat addicted to the Marvel Trading Card Game. It's not a great game by any measure, but it does an excellent job of tapping into the collector's mentality of comic-book fans." ...|$|E
500|$|Only {{two songs}} [...] "Vacant" [...] and [...] "Potions", {{have ever been}} {{identified}} as Tapeworm songs. Neither have been released, though cover versions by Maynard James Keenan's other projects have surfaced. The first, [...] "Vacant" [...] was initially conceived during the Tapeworm sessions; the track being written by Lohner and re-arranged by Clouser, with lyrics and melody by Keenan and chorus and backing vocals by Reznor. The song was first performed live by A Perfect Circle throughout their 2001 tour. MTV reported that Reznor was apparently not happy that Keenan performed the song: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>I</b> find it mildly irritating for [...] "Vacant" [...] to debut in this fashion before feeling it has been properly realized," [...] Shortly after {{the dissolution of the}} Tapeworm project, Keenan released a reworked version on A Perfect Circle's 2004 cover album Emotive under the title [...] "Passive".|$|E
500|$|Nick Campbell of TV.com {{felt that}} the episode was [...] "a decent if uneven {{penultimate}} episode that gave us {{one last look at}} this quirky group of people in their office environment". He was largely happy with the return of the fun-loving version of Jim, noting that [...] "Pam mentioned that she loves 'Goofy Jim' and I, [...] <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> love Goofy Jim myself". Campbell {{felt that the}} episode dabbled in fan service, but that it was expected and needed for the show to have a successful ending. Roth Cornet of IGN awarded the episode an 8.5 out of 10, denoting a [...] "great" [...] episode. She wrote that [...] "The interplay between Jim, Dwight, and Pam has been the core of the series since Michael Scott's departure, and it was good to see the trio front and center once again as The Office comes to a close." [...] Furthermore, Cornet was happy with Dwight's proposal and the dance party that signaled Darryl's leaving, calling the latter [...] "a slice of bliss".|$|E

2500|$|Regarding {{most people}} not knowing {{she is the}} actual artist of the artwork, Ward stated: And who am I going to tell that I am behind the artwork? I don’t think most people {{think about all the}} work that happens behind the scenes. And it should be that way. The viewers should be caught up in the show. Anyway, it doesn’t come up much. I do have a niece who thinks it’s pretty cool. And I {{impressed}} a bunch of third-graders at career day at my daughter’s school. But they were much more excited by the work I did for the [...] Go figure...And drawing for [...] was exceptional. It wasn’t just a one-time gig for a movie that is out in theaters for a couple weeks. It was ongoing and evolving.

60|$|She could appear, at times, he says, {{as real as}} you or I, {{and again}} came mystery all about her. There were times when {{it seemed to him}} you might have hurt her or killed her as you can hurt and kill anyone--with a {{penknife}} for example--and there were times when it seemed to him you could have destroyed the whole material universe and left her smiling still. But of this ambiguous element in the lady, more is to be told later. There are wider seas than ever keel sailed upon, and deeps that no lead of human casting will ever plumb. When it is all summed up, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit,</b> <b>I</b> do not know, I cannot tell. I fall back upon Melville and my poor array of collected facts. At first there was amazingly little strangeness about her for any who had to deal with her. There she was, palpably solid and material, a lady out of the sea.|$|E

5000|$|Mark Trammell of TV Equals said [...] "Given some people’s {{complaints}} {{that the show}} was losing touch with what made them like {{it in the first}} place, this one should have hit the target for the most part, playing like a classic episode of the show.

50|$|It {{was around}} this time that Sibelius finally {{abandoned}} his cherished aspirations as a violinist:My tragedy was that I {{wanted to be a}} celebrated violinist at any price.
