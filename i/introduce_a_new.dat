5|$|Senator Roberts {{proposed}} legislation {{at the start}} of session regarding the surety bond required for towing carriers in rural areas. SB12-049 would have lowered the surety bond from $50,000 to $10,000 for local entities. The bill was assigned to the Senate Transportation Committee, but was postponed indefinitely after it was introduced. However, after the bill was killed, public upheaval caused Roberts to <b>introduce</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> bill, this time in the House, which resolved the same issue. HB12-1347 passed the second time around with a resounding 98-1 vote.|$|E
5|$|Sleaze-busting package: Following {{the cash}} for honours scandal, Brown {{said he would}} reduce sleaze, {{which led to the}} belief that Brown would <b>introduce</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Ministerial Code that would set out clear {{standards}} of behaviour for ministers. Brown said that he intended to strip the Prime Minister of some the powers conferred on it by royal prerogativeincluding the ability to declare war. This would give Parliament more powers and rights to vet and veto appointments to senior public positions, in a bid to eliminate cronyism.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{became aware}} of their losses to night fighters, and began a rush program to <b>introduce</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> radar {{operating}} on different frequencies. This led to the lower-VHF band FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2, which began to reach operational units in small numbers between August and October 1943, with about 50 units in use by November. In February 1944, No. 80 Sqn noticed a marked decrease in FuG 202 transmissions. By this time the Germans had produced 200 SN-2 sets, and this had reached 1,000 by May. This set deliberately selected a frequency close to that of their ground-based Freya radar sets, {{in the hopes that}} these sources would swamp any wide-band receiver set used on RAF aircraft. Early Serrate units were effectively useless by June 1944, and their replacements were never as successful.|$|E
5|$|Written by Basil Dawson, this four-part story {{involving}} {{murders in}} Victorian London. Dawson, a veteran screenwriter, {{was approached by}} script editor Robert Holmes to develop a story which would <b>introduce</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> companion to replace Sarah Jane Smith following her departure. The new character {{was to be a}} Cockney girl whom the Doctor would take under his wing and educate, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle in the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. This story was planned to be the fourth story of Season 14. The Gaslight Murders was quickly abandoned, however. Its spot in the schedule was ultimately filled by The Face of Evil, while Holmes reused the general framework in The Talons of Weng-Chiang.|$|E
