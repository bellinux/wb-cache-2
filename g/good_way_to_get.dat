Iron replacement is essential in menstruating females, and supplementation of iron and calcium is preferable in all patients. Ferrous sulfate is poorly tolerated. Alternative forms of iron (fumarate, gluconate, chelates) are less irritating and probably better absorbed. Calcium carbonate preparations should also be avoided; calcium as citrate or gluconate (with 1200mg as calcium) has greater bioavailability independent of acid in the stomach, and will likely be better absorbed. Chewable calcium supplements that include vitamin K are sometimes recommended by doctors as a <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> calcium.|$|E

500|$|Giving {{the album}} 8 on 10, Alex Needham from NME criticized the compilation's lack of new tracks, and said [...] "while far from immaculate, {{this is still}} quite a collection". About GHV2, New Strait Times Christie Leo commented that [...] "this second volume of {{greatest}} hits isn't as immediately accessible as the first. But that's not what this collection is all about. This 14-track set actually provides a more daring glimpse into the inner machinations of the music marketing juggernaut, Madonna". AllMusic writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a mixed review calling it [...] "slightly disappointing", justifying {{that it was because}} during the 1990s, Madonna was an album artist. He finished his review saying that [...] "the end result is less {{than the sum of its}} parts, even if this is a <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all of Madge's 90s hits at once." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that [...] "GHV2 certainly encapsulates the second decade of the performer's boundary-bridging career", but criticized the lack of new material, and its [...] "choppy edits, random sequences and missing links", saying: [...] "the collection doesn't seem to do justice to a career that has always been ahead of the game and focused on the future". Charlotte Robinson from PopMatters criticized its sequencing, stating, [...] "Chronological sequencing would have made it easier to follow the course of Madonna's musical evolution. But would these changes have made GHV2 a significantly better album? Probably not. As it stands, it's the best summary of Madonna's second decade as a performer we're going to get." ...|$|E

[...] In addition, Cherry observed that Chamberlain was neither a natural leader nor a loyal follower, which made him difficult to fit in. While he was on cordial terms with Jerry West, he often argued with team captain Elgin Baylor; regarding Baylor, he later explained: [...] "We were good friends, but... black culture... you never let the other guy one-up you." [...] The greatest problem was his tense relationship with Lakers coach Butch Van Breda Kolff: pejoratively calling the new recruit [...] "The Load", he later complained that Chamberlain was egotistical, never respected him, too often slacked off in practice and focused too much on his own statistics.

Nowadays, it supports before and after-treatment for patients and should satisfy all stakeholders such as practitioners, nurses, researchers, administrators and financial departments and so on. In accordance with the database maintenance, DAS (Data as Service) model is one solution for outsourcing. However, there are some scalability and strategy issues {{when we need to}} plan to use DAS model properly. We constructed three kinds of databases such as plan-text, MS built-in encryption which is in-house model and custom AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) - DAS model scaling from 5 K to 2560 K records. To perform custom AES-DAS better, we also devised Bucket Index using Bloom Filter. The simulation showed the response times arithmetically increased in the beginning but after a certain threshold, exponentially increased in the end. In conclusion, if the database model is close to in-house model, then vendor technology is a <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> perform and <b>get</b> query response times in a consistent manner. If the model is DAS model, it is easy to outsource the database, however, some techniques like Bucket Index enhances its utilization. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> faster query response times, designing database such as consideration of the field type is also important. This study suggests cloud computing would be a next DAS model to satisfy the scalability and the security issues...|$|R

40|$|Enabling less highly-trained {{hospital}} {{workers to}} play a bigger role could improve jobs for doctors and nurses, save public hospitals nearly $ 430 million a year and fund treatment for more than 85, 000 extra people, argues this report. Overview Hospitals are under pressure. They face rising demand, a squeeze on funding and skills shortages in key areas. They have to change. One problem is that too many health professionals squander their valuable skills on work that other people could do. In most cases, it doesn’t take 15 years of post-school training to provide light sedation for a stable patient having a simple procedure. Nor does it take a three-year degree to help someone bathe or eat. But tradition, professional culture and industrial agreements often dictate that highly-trained health professionals spend their time doing straightforward work. This wastes money, makes professional jobs less rewarding and often does not improve care. There are many ways that hospitals can get a better match between workers and their work. This report looks at three examples. The first is using more nursing assistants to provide basic care to patients. The second is letting specialist nurses do common, low-risk procedures currently done by doctors. The third is employing more assistants to support physiotherapists and occupational therapists. These changes can maintain or improve the safety and quality of care. They are among the easiest to take up. Hospitals don’t have to be reorganised or new professions created. They would save public hospitals $ 430 million a year. That could fund treatment for more than 85, 000 extra people. These ideas are supported by solid evidence. They have been tried successfully in Australia, with good results for patients. Hospital CEOs we surveyed for this report strongly support them. Despite all this, progress is painfully slow. Formidable barriers {{in the form of}} regulations, culture, tradition and vested interests stand in the way. We need a new mechanism to overcome these barriers – a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> from isolated trials to broad change. Creating that mechanism is even more important than the examples in this report. People may disagree with specific examples. But no-one can argue that all hospital work is done by the right person, or that a <b>good</b> <b>way</b> currently exists <b>to</b> <b>get</b> change throughout the system. Two things are needed. Hospitals, regulators and professional bodies must improve rules and regulations. State governments must invest money and expertise in spreading good practices. If we don’t update workforce roles, there will be a cost. Hospitals already struggle to provide enough care. Waiting lists are long and demand is growing fast. It’s hard to keep some hospital workers in their jobs. Government budgets are also under pressure. If action isn’t taken to make hospitals more efficient, tougher decisions about who will miss out on care are inevitable. Current workforce roles were designed {{in the days of the}} horse and buggy. The choice to update them should be easy. It means more and better care, more rewarding jobs for hospital professionals and a more sustainable system...|$|R

Now and then a mother caribou would come from the shadows and push a little one gently from his retreat under a bush out into the company. Another would push her way between two heads that lowered at each other threateningly, and say with a warning shake of her head that butting was no <b>good</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along together.
