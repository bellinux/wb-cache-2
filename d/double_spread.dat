5000|$|In New York, Ingeborg {{managed to}} find a large {{apartment}} on 470 Park Avenue which became her studio. Every morning she read the New York Times and once saw a section about cameras.

50|$|As {{activity}} in the Amstrad world declined, the editorial staff, and subsequently the editorial content, was constantly being reduced and the magazine adopted an increasingly eccentric style, with one edition in particular featuring an eight-page script for a Christmas pantomime. Later on, a <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> review for the 2nd Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles game was split between the review itself and a bizarre transcribed interview between Rod Lawton and Adam Peters (pretending {{to be one of}} the turtles). Peters would usually try and promote his band in some way (he featured on the cover of music orientated issue and had one of his techno-MIDI bands songs on the covertape). The magazine is also notable for pioneering the kind of responses - sometimes dry, sometimes surreal, usually humorous and mildly rude - to readers letters of a form now seen throughout UK gaming magazine culture. These characteristics, for many readers, added to AAs charm.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 90s, an artist Shaowei Liu hand painted many {{backgrounds}} and animations, {{which were then}} digitized for the games. For the games designed in the mid-90s, artist Frank Cirocco pencil drew the characters and foregrounds and he hired Mick Gray to ink the lineart. For the games made in the late 90s, the characters and backgrounds were worked on by Fred Dianda started as sketches. The sketches were then refined, coloured and animated on computer. For the later games, Fred was made the Primary and Lead Artist. Some lineart was worked on by Gerald Broas who used a 2B pencil to hand draw the backgrounds and characters on 12 field animation paper. As for the story books included in the interactive journey and library games, artist Marc Diamond used a LeapPad tablet <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> to sketch the pictures in blue before coloring and shading them. For some of the games in the late 90s, the art was provided by Chester Aldridge's company US Equity Holdings.|$|E

Philippa's narration keeps readers guessing about Philip, who, through her eyes, fluctuates between normalcy and arrogant secrecy. <b>Double</b> <b>spreads</b> occasionally feature Gerstein's (A Book) b&w cartoon-styled line art, {{breaking up the}} action for budding chapter book readers.

50|$|In 1955, {{the story}} “Flagrant-Dali” broke in the {{newspaper}} “Combat”. In the previous year, the French book club had published a new work entitled “The secret life of Salvador Dali”. A <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> at the start {{and at the end}} of the publication featured a reproduction of “The Hand Multiplied by a Play of Mirrors”, a hypnagogic photograph by Raymond Hains from 1947. The inclusion of the photograph in the paper probably was an editorial error. As a reaction, Raymond Hains asserted his rights as an author to write a protest to be published in “Combat”: “It's on my beard and certainly not on your moustache that I see this hand being used for Dali's purpose: Guided by the antennae-moustaches, your henchman spotted it….”. Hains eventually decided not to proceed further with the matter.In 1956, Hains met the art critic Pierre Restany at Yves Klein's home. Then, in 1957, he opened his first torn posters exhibition in Paris in collaboration with Jacques Villeglé. The invitation read: “Colette Allendy invites you to cross the exhibition fence: The Act of July, 29 188, or 'lyricism on the sly'”.|$|E
5000|$|Flessel began {{drawing for}} the pulp {{magazines}} of the time, including Street & Smith's The Shadow. [...] "They {{would give you}} {{a copy of a}} story and the space. <b>Double</b> <b>spread</b> would be $15; single would be seven, sometimes ten," [...] Flessel recalled in 2001. He broke into comics after answering an ad in The New York Times by Major Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, whose National Allied Publications would eventually become DC Comics, and began freelancing there. His first known work for the publisher appeared in More Fun Comics #10 (cover-dated May 1936), penciling and inking the two-page sword-and-sorcery feature [...] "Don Drake" [...] and the two-page humor strip [...] "Fishy Frolics". Flessel recalled, I don’t think they were looking for any pedigree or “Would you do this?” More like, “You’re a live body. What do you want to do? Take this and do it, then.” I realized they were desperate so I had {{to go out and buy}} a drawing table. They had just one table that they were doing all of the mechanical work on. So I got a table and managed to find a chair and sat down and they said, “Here. Do this.” I think I did a couple of center spreads for More Fun. I did feature [...] "Fishy Frolics", I did an [...] "Acorn and Andy" [...] double-spread. Little nonsense cartoons.|$|E
40|$|This {{reflection}} {{is inspired}} by from {{the recognition of the}} relationship between textuality and macro-textuality in picturebooks, where the story depends on the arrangement of a succession of verbal-visual elements - the <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> - that lead conceptually and rhythmically to the function of verses in poems. The recognition of the semantic and structural analogy between <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> and verse helps to identify four broad categories of structures: anaphoric simple, anaphoric articulated, irregular recursive and irregular free. These are of considerable heuristic effectiveness both for a reflection on picturebook conceived as complex and multifaceted textual machine, and for grasping important pedagogical implications. The closing of the essay highlights how the experience of reading picturebooks serves to foster a culture of listening and respect, and involves at least three aspects significantly interconnected: learning to observe, the mental habitus of reflective slowness and fostering reciprocal listening...|$|E

30|$|Meanwhile, many low {{probability}} interception (LPI) radar waveforms {{have been}} designed. Linear frequency modulated/binary {{phase shift keying}} (LFM/BPSK) hybrid modulated signal is a novel kind of LPI radar signal. It has a <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> spectrum and has been applied in some radar and fuse systems [2]. For the parameter estimation of LFM/BPSK signal intercepted by the conventional receiver, an algorithm based on Zhao, Atlas, and Marks (ZAM) transformation has been studied [12]. However, for the parameter estimation of LFM/BPSK signal intercepted by the NYFR, {{there has been no}} public report.|$|E
40|$|This thesis identifies, {{develops}} and applies {{methods for}} the decomposition of fading dispersive channels. Such channels arise in wireless communication {{as a result}} of multipath and relative motion of the transmitter, scatterers and receiver. The decompositions considered are the f-power series and Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansions. For the KL expansion generalisations to rapid time variation are possible with the separate options of single spread and <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> decomposition. The single spread decomposition involves a model of the instantaneous channel transfer function with time variation supported by sample spaced coefficients. The <b>double</b> <b>spread</b> decomposition employs a model of each received pulse and requires symbol spaced coefficients. The decompositions are applied to pulse shaping, channel modelling for equalisation and the determination of performance limits for linear modulation over fading dispersive channels. The results on pulse shaping show that, with moderate bandwidth expansion and appropriate design, it is possible to significantly lower the complexity of a mobile receiver. The approach suggests a way to move complexity and power consumption away from the mobile unit and into the base station. The effects of diversity on performance are investigated by assuming a single pulse from a linear modulation format. This removes the need to consider intersymbol interference and allows conclusions about the impact of fading and dispersion on the probability of error and the average mutual information...|$|E

However, it wasn't until she read the Nun's Priest's Tale that she realised where and how she could express this artistic impulse. There followed a period of research on medieval times. As with much of her illustration for the previous twenty years, Cooney used a scratchboard technique. As each additional color cost money, Cooney was granted five colors, at least for half the pages, by Crowell. Some pages would be in two colors, red and black, while some <b>double</b> <b>spreads</b> would be split, ideally so that the discrepancy would not be noticed or, better, that the picture would benefit.|$|R
