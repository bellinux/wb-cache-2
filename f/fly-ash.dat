The <b>fly-ash</b> which gets generated during the burning of coal disperses {{into the air and}} hence pollutes the atmosphere. This gets deposited on the surrounding land, thereby making the land infertile. The <b>fly-ash</b> may also cause breathing problems for humans.

The <b>fly-ash</b> is disposed of by converting it into a wet slurry and dumping it into vacant tracts of land (which become what are known as ash-ponds). This is not environment friendly and hence RTPS has come up with ways to make better use of <b>fly-ash.</b> It has entered into a collaboration with the Indo-Norwegian Environment Programme (INEP) and has set up a technology demonstration center called CASHUTEC (Center for Ash Utilization and Environment Conservation) near its plant.

40|$|Sewage sludge and its ashes after {{combustion}} are {{contaminated with}} metals in various concentrations. In the work {{described in this}} paper, the mobility of metals during recovery of phosphorus by acid leaching of <b>fly-ashes</b> from co-combustion of sewage sludge with wood was investigated. The metal concentrations in two sewage sludges, fly ashes and leachates from acid phosphorus extraction were compared with phosphorus rock and different fertilisers used in the agriculture. The secondary cyclone ashes {{were found to be}} less contaminated with trace elements than the bag filter ashes. The largest problem is cadmium, which in all ashes studied has a too high level to meet the legislative limits for the maximum dosage in Sweden and the proposed limits in the European Union. The legislation includes limits for cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) calculated for an amendment of X kg of fertiliser per year and ha of land. The solubility of the trace metals in the cyclone ash, with Cd as an exception, is in general much lower than the solubility of phosphorus. A decrease in pH results in an increased release of Cd but has just a slight influence on the other metals analysed in this study. The Cd yield increases by 30 % when pH is lowered from 2. 5 to 1. 0 whereas the Hg release is not affected at all. The trace element concentrations in the leachates are far below the European and Swedish limitations of metal concentrations in fertilisers. The leachates thus fit as fertilisers and also as raw material to the industry, if the Cd is removed. In part I of the project [1] focus was on the phosphorus recovery only...|$|R

The bridges crossing Teynham Road and the mainline were removed in the 1950s, although their abutments are still in place. The famous bridge at Old Bridge Road (previously Church Road) was demolished in 1969. The track bed leading {{from the site of}} the bridge adjacent to Whitstable railway station to the site of South Street Halt was surfaced in 1983 as a designated footpath and cycle track. There is no trace of South Street Halt, although remains of the level crossing gates were visible until the early 1980s. The railway embankment can be clearly seen from the adjacent cycle route bridge as it crosses fields and is cut through by the A299 road. A bridge remains near Bogshole Brook, which dates from the line's construction, although it was almost certainly reconstructed c.1846. A section of trackbed through Clowes Wood is also a footpath where the site of the winding house can be found. The site of Blean & Tyler Hill Halt is occupied by the driveway leading to a bungalow. About half mile section of trackbed remains abandoned leading to the visible blocked up tunnel mouths of Tyler Hill Tunnel. At {{the south end of the}} tunnel the blocked up tunnel can be seen with a short section of embankment. South of Beaconsfield Road there is a short section of embankment near St. Stephen's Pathway. The arch of a buried pedestrian tunnel is visible probably built during the 1830s following a death on the line. The site of Canterbury North Lane station was a goods yard until around 1980 when it was closed. A plan was mooted in the 1980s to open a railway museum on the site, but it remained derelict until being sold for housing development and the extension of Station Road West in about 1998. The Goods Shed was restored and became the country's first 6-day farmers Market and restaurant. The original weighbridge house and a level crossing gate into the former goods yard are preserved in the development. The Invicta has been preserved, having been extensively restored in 1979, and can be seen in the Museum of Canterbury. The locomotive is not in its original form, since various modifications were made around 1836 in an effort to improve its performance. One of the stationary steam engines also survives, having been in the possession of the University of Kent and is currently (2012) undergoing restoration. Its wheel is visible in Gas Street, Canterbury. Part of the Tyler Hill tunnel collapsed at the beginning of July 1974, causing severe subsidence to some buildings at the University of Kent at Canterbury that had been built on the hill above.
