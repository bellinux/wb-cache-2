These companies included Google, along with HTC, a company who was at the time, one of the largest manufacturers of phones. While Google indicated in 2008 that several linux devices were being tested in preparation for the official public launch of Android, only one was to be released in the United States that year—the HTC Dream. Plans called for the Dream to be released on T-Mobile USA {{by the end of the}} year (with some reports suggesting October 2008), targeting the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season. Sprint had worked with the OHA, but had not yet unveiled any plans to release an Android phone of its own, while Verizon Wireless and AT did not have any plans for Android devices yet at all.|$|E

25|$|Though selling well in {{its early}} months, many Famicom units {{reportedly}} froze during gameplay. After tracing the problem to a faulty circuit, Nintendo recalled all Famicom systems just before the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season, and temporarily suspended production of the system while the concerns were addressed, costing Nintendo millions of dollars. The Famicom was subsequently reissued with a new motherboard. The Famicom easily outsold its primary competitor, the Sega SG-1000. By the end of 1984 Nintendo had sold over 2.5 million Famicoms in the Japanese market.|$|E

25|$|In mid-November, Bayshore {{has its own}} Santa's Arrival, which {{consists}} of {{a wide array of}} entertainment for the whole family. This is usually the kick-off of the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season in which the mall's hours are extended until 10 pm from Monday to Saturday except Sundays which keeps regular hours (although in previous years the mall also had extended hours on Sundays). During the last week of the Christmas rush, the mall is open until 11:00 pm. Other traditional features of the shopping centre at this period is the Gift Wrapping Service on the third level in which patrons can have their gifts wrapped. In 2013, Bayshore worked with the Senators Foundation raising over $10,000 during the Holiday season.|$|E
25|$|However, {{according}} to research firm NPD, sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to {{the same time period}} in 2011. As the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season wrapped up, Windows 8 sales continued to lag, even as Apple reported brisk sales. The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter, and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features. This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region, as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs.|$|E

500|$|Cars was {{originally}} {{set to be}} released on November 4, 2005, but on December 7, 2004, its release date was changed to June 9, 2006. Analysts looked at the release date change as a sign from Pixar that they were preparing for the pending end of the Disney distribution contract by either preparing non-Disney materials to present to other studios, or they were buying time {{to see what happened}} with Michael Eisner's situation at Disney. [...] When Pixar's chief executive Steve Jobs made the release date announcement, he stated that the reasoning was due to wanting to put all Pixar films on a summer release schedule, with DVD sales occurring during the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season.|$|E
500|$|Wide Awake in Europe is a live {{extended}} play (EP) by {{rock band}} U2. The release {{was created by}} the organizers of Record Store Day to bring customers into independent record shops for <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping.</b> A limited number of 5,000 EPs were produced, and were released on Black Friday in 2010, mostly to record shops in North America. The EP features three live tracks on a 12-inch vinyl record, taken from three different concerts during the U2 360° Tour in 2009 and 2010. The EP comprises the songs [...] "I'll Go Crazy If I Don't Go Crazy Tonight", [...] "Moment of Surrender", and [...] "Mercy", the latter a previously unreleased track that was debuted on tour.|$|E

The EP was released by Interscope Records on 26 November 2010, exclusively for independent record shops in the North America, with a select number of copies available in Europe.

500|$|The banks {{accustomed}} {{themselves to}} seasonal need for coins, as for quarters and half dollars in Michigan to pay cherry pickers the traditional 75-cent rate, and to local preferences; for example, half dollars were not popular in New York, two quarters being preferred instead. [...] Beginning in late 1959, the Mint {{failed to provide}} enough coins to satisfy demand, and the Fed, through its district banks and branches, imposed rationing. By 1963, there was often rationing of all denominations, commercial banks (and their retail customers) receiving less than they needed. There were widespread shortages of some denominations during the 1962 <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season. [...] Traditionally, the heavy demand for coinage {{late in the year}} resulted in a large amount of flowback in the winter, but in early 1963, few coins returned to the banks, or to the Fed. [...] Officials suggested responsibility might lie with coin collectors and investors, as well as uncollected coins remaining in the nation's millions of vending machines. The Mint increased production to around-the-clock shifts at Philadelphia and Denver. A new Philadelphia Mint was authorized in 1963, though the hoped-for opening date of 1966 was soon pushed back to 1967 (it eventually opened in 1969).|$|E
500|$|Ware found Flight Unlimited approachable {{and noted}} its [...] "simplicity {{of use and}} depth of instruction".

The Washington Posts John Gaudiosi wrote that, while many games in the genre are overly complex, Flight Unlimited lets [...] "those who aren't rocket scientists ... experience the thrills of stunt flying." [...] He found its control scheme simple to understand. By contrast, Bailey found the game difficult and initially [...] "frustrating": he complained {{that he had to}} play the lesson mode before even taking off. Denny Atkin of Computer Gaming World characterized the game's learning curve as steep, thanks to the accuracy of the physics programming, but he noted the scalable difficulty options. Bailey later recommended the game in a <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> guide. He wrote that [...] "it can be difficult to master. But once you're up, it's worth the trouble." ...|$|E

500|$|Andy Kellman from AllMusic {{wrote in}} his review that #1's was {{formatted}} the same was as other music scores and anthologies packed for the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season. He further commented that its title should have been different and concluded, [...] "the disc reaffirms that Destiny's Child released {{some of the biggest}} R singles of the late '90s and early 2000s." [...] Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani criticized the album's title as only four of the singles reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. However, he praised Destiny's Child's [...] "impressive output, which includes some of the most recognizable R hits of the past bling/celly/status-obsessed five years". BBC Online's writer James Blake called the album [...] "more than decent" [...] and added that the group's success in the music industry was a notable reason for a greatest hits release. However, he argued that it was very soon to include songs from their final studio album, Destiny Fulfilled, as it was released only eleven months before #1's. Pitchfork Media's Jess Harvell felt that it was a [...] "smart" [...] move not to arrange the songs on the compilation in a chronological order and felt it [...] "has the odd knock-on effect of suggesting that their legacy may be based on a smaller body of work than imagined". Harvell finished the review by writing, [...] "you can take #1's as pure product and not feel wrong for doing so". Despite classifying its title as [...] "misleading" [...] and criticizing the new material, Houston Chronicles editor Michael D. Clark wrote the album was [...] "dolled up as beautiful and immaculate as" [...] the members of the group and included their best singles from their four studio albums.|$|E

2500|$|What {{has become}} known as [...] "Christmas creep" [...] refers to a {{merchandising}} phenomenon in which merchants and retailers exploit the commercialized status of Christmas by moving up the start of the <b>holiday</b> <b>shopping</b> season.
