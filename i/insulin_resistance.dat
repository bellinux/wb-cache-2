The discriminatory power of various prediction models for development of type 2 diabetes was tested with the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS — <b>Insulin</b> secretion/insulin <b>resistance</b> index (0 - to 30 - and 0 - to 120 -min time periods) had the greatest areas under the ROC curve (0. 85 and 0. 86, respectively), which were significantly greater than the 2 -h plasma glucose concentration during the OGTT or the San Antonio Diabetes Prediction Model (SADPM) (P 0. 001 and P 0. 0001, respectively).

5|$|In a dissenting opinion, a {{systematic}} review of four head-to-head comparative trials of metformin and clomifene found them equally effective for infertility. Four positive studies of metformin were in women not responding to clomifene, while {{the population in}} the negative studies was drug-naive or uncontrolled for the previous treatment. Metformin should be used as a second-line drug if clomifene treatment fails. Another review recommended metformin unreservedly as a first-line treatment option because it has positive effects not only on anovulation, but also on <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance,</b> hirsutism and obesity often associated with PCOS. A Cochrane Collaboration review found metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, particularly when combined with clomifene, but is not associated with {{an increase in the number}} of live births.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the risk}} factors for endometrial cancer involve high levels of estrogens. An {{estimated}} 40% of cases {{are thought to be}} related to obesity. In obesity, the excess of adipose tissue increases conversion of androstenedione into estrone, an estrogen. Higher levels of estrone in the blood causes less or no ovulation and exposes the endometrium to continuously high levels of estrogens. Obesity also causes less estrogen to be removed from the blood. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which also causes irregular or no ovulation, is associated with higher rates of endometrial cancer for the same reasons as obesity. Specifically, obesity, typeII diabetes, and <b>insulin</b> <b>resistance</b> are risk factors for TypeI endometrial cancer. Obesity increases the risk for endometrial cancer by 300–400%.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundBoth fish (FO) and {{flaxseed}} oils (FLX) are n- 3 polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (PUFA). Fish oil contains long chain while FLX contains essential n- 3 PUFA. We demonstrated that FO altered <b>insulin</b> secretion and <b>resistance</b> in {{polycystic ovary syndrome}} (PCOS) women but FLX did not. Surprisingly, the effects of FO {{were similar to those}} of the n- 6 PUFA-rich soybean oil (SBO). Since increased branched chain (BCAA) and aromatic amino acids (AA) affect <b>insulin</b> secretion and <b>resistance,</b> we investigated whether FO, FLX and /or SBO affect plasma metabolites, especially AA. Methods and findingsIn this six-week, randomized, 3 -parallel arm, double-blinded study, 54 women received 3. 5 g/day FO, FLX or SBO. In 51 completers (17 from each arm), fasting plasma metabolites were measured at the beginning and at the end. As compared to FLX, FO and SBO increased <b>insulin</b> response and <b>resistance</b> as well as several BCAA and aromatic AA. Pathway analysis indicated that FO exerted the largest biochemical impact, affecting AA degradation and biosynthesis, amine, polyamine degradation and alanine, glycine, l-carnitine biosynthesis and TCA cycle, while FLX had minimal impact affecting only alanine biosynthesis and l-cysteine degradation. ConclusionEffects of FO and SBO on plasma AA were similar and differed significantly from those of the FLX. The primary target of dietary PUFA is not known. Dietary PUFA may influence <b>insulin</b> secretion and <b>resistance</b> directly and alter plasma AA indirectly. Alternatively, as a novel concept, dietary PUFA may directly affect AA metabolism and the changes in <b>insulin</b> secretion and <b>resistance</b> may be secondary...|$|R

40|$|Overnutrition {{caused by}} {{overeating}} {{is associated with}} <b>insulin</b> and leptin <b>resistance</b> through IKK beta activation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in the hypothalamus. Here we show that physical exercise suppresses hyperphagia and associated hypothalamic IKK beta/NF-k beta activation by a mechanism dependent upon the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL) - 6. The disruption of hypothalamic-specific IL- 6 action blocked the beneficial effects of exercise on the re-balance of food intake and <b>insulin</b> and leptin <b>resistance.</b> This molecular mechanism, mediated by physical activity, involves the anti-inflammatory protein IL- 10, a core inhibitor of IKK beta/NF-k beta signaling and ER stress. We report that exercise and recombinant IL- 6 requires IL- 10 expression to suppress hyperphagia-related obesity. Moreover, in contrast to control mice, exercise failed to reverse the pharmacological activation of IKK beta and ER stress in C 3 H/HeJ mice deficient in hypothalamic IL- 6 and IL- 10 signaling. Hence, inflammatory signaling in the hypothalamus links beneficial physiological effects of exercise to the central action of insulin and leptin...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIntra-abdominal fat {{accumulation}} {{is involved}} in development of the metabolic syndrome, which is associated with <b>insulin</b> and leptin <b>resistance.</b> We show here that ectopic expression of very low levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP 1) in epididymal fat (Epi) reverses both <b>insulin</b> and leptin <b>resistance.</b> UCP 1 expression in Epi improved glucose tolerance and decreased food intake in both diet-induced and genetically obese mouse models. In contrast, UCP 1 expression in Epi of leptin-receptor mutant mice did not alter food intake, though it significantly decreased blood glucose and insulin levels. Thus, hypophagia induction requires a leptin signal, while the improved insulin sensitivity appears to be leptin independent. In wild-type mice, local-nerve dissection in the epididymis or pharmacological afferent blockade blunted the decrease in food intake, suggesting that afferent-nerve signals from intra-abdominal fat tissue regulate food intake by modulating hypothalamic leptin sensitivity. These novel signals are potential therapeutic targets for the metabolic syndrome...|$|R
40|$|White {{adipose tissue}} {{is not just}} a storage organ. It is now {{recognised}} as an endocrine organ. It secretes many substances known as adipokines, which are thought to link obesity with type 2 diabetes (T 2 D). One of the most important adipokines is adiponectin. It is a peptide hormone consisting of 244 amino acids with molecular weight of 30 KD. It circulates in plasma in high concentrations (3 - 30 4 g/ml). Adiponectin polymerises to form many bigger forms. Those are low molecular weight (LMW); middle molecular weight (MMW) and high molecular weight (HMW). The HMW adiponectin is the active form of the hormone. The concentrations of most adipokines are increased in obese people. Adiponectin is unusual in that its concentration is lower in obese people. Consequently its concentration is decreased in some related metabolic disorders. Its concentrations decrease in cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dyslipidemia and <b>insulin</b> <b>resistances.</b> It is well known that exercise increases insulin sensitivity, also adiponectin was reported to regulate insulin. The effect of exercise on the adiponectin concentrations in plasma is controversial, but {{the extent to which the}} exercise regulates the interstitial adiponectin concentrations is not fully examined. The main site of adipokines secretion is adipose tissue. Therefore the study of these substances at the site of their production has a special interest. Recently, microdialysis techniques have been extended to become important in the measurement of substances in the extracellular fluid of many tissues such as subcutaneous adipose tissue. In particular, it has been used for measurement of adipokines. This thesis includes three studies. The first study was aimed at examining the effect of one hour of moderate exercise at 50...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInsulin and leptin play {{complementary}} {{roles in}} regulating the consumption, uptake, oxidation and storage of nutrients. Chronic consumption of diets that contain {{a high proportion}} of calories from saturated fat induces a progressive deterioration in function of both hormones. Certain rat lines and strains of mice are particularly sensitive to the obesogenic and diabetogenic effects of high fat diets, and have been used extensively to study the developmental progression of <b>insulin</b> and leptin <b>resistance</b> in relation to the increasing adiposity that is characteristic of their response to these diets. Some aspects of the diminished efficacy of each hormone are secondary to increased adiposity but a consensus is emerging to support the view that direct effects of dietary components or their metabolites, independent of the resulting obesity, play important roles in development of <b>insulin</b> and leptin <b>resistance.</b> In this minireview, we will examine the implications of crosstalk between leptin and insulin signaling during the development of diet-induced obesity, emphasizing potential interactions between pathways that occur among target sites, and exploring how these interactions may influence the progression of obesity and diabetes...|$|R
