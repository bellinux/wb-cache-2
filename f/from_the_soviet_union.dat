5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers {{with the ability}} to deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook the development of interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} fall of Phnom Penh to Vietnamese forces and their Kampuchean allies in January 1979, representatives of Democratic Kampuchea called for an {{emergency}} meeting of the United Nations Security Council, so Prince Norodom Sihanouk could present the deposed regime's case. Despite strong objections <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and Czechoslovakia, the UN Security Council gave Sihanouk this chance. Although Sihanouk distanced himself from the human rights abuses of the Khmer Rouge, he accused Vietnam of using aggression to violate Kampuchea’s sovereignty. As such, he demanded all UN countries to suspend aid to Vietnam and not recognise the Vietnamese-installed regime. Subsequently, seven non-aligned members of the UN Security Council submitted a draft resolution calling for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Kampuchea, which was endorsed by the People's Republic of China, France, Norway, Portugal, the United States and the United Kingdom. However, the resolution was not approved due to strong opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> and Czechoslovakia. Ted Galen Carpenter, a foreign policy analyst from the Cato Institute argues that Vietnam did not invade Cambodia out of any noble desire to stop the atrocities committed by Pol Pot's regime but rather to consolidate their domination of Indochina.|$|E

5|$|The laconic Act is {{the legal}} basis for the {{existence}} of modern Lithuania, both during the interwar period and since 1990.

5|$|The small pro-democracy Monday demonstrations soon swelled into {{crowds of}} {{hundreds}} of thousands of people in cities across East Germany.

Reformist members of the East German Politbüro sought to rescue the situation by forcing the resignation of the hardline Party chairman Erich Honecker, replacing him in October 1989 with the marginally less hardline Egon Krenz.|$|E
