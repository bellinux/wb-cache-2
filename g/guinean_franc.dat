50|$|An {{interrogation}} of Souaré, {{along with three}} other former mining ministers, was broadcast on state television {{on the night of}} 7 March 2009. According to an official audit committee, the four of them were guilty of embezzlement during their tenures {{at the head of the}} Ministry of Mines and they collectively owed the government about 5.3 million in US dollars; Souaré was accused of stealing nearly half of the total. Speaking on the radio the next day, Souaré said that the allegedly misappropriated money had merely been used as a matter of necessity to fund the ministry's operations. Souaré was arrested on 23 March. He was later released, but on 30 June 2009 he was arrested again after failing to make sufficient repayments of the money (12 billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs)</b> that was allegedly stolen. He had been ordered to pay back the money in quarterly installments, but he said that he could not do so and only had 100 million of the three billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> necessary for one quarterly payment. He was consequently arrested after going to a government office to pay the 100 million <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2010, a {{commemorative}} {{series of}} 1000, 5000, and 10,000 francs banknotes celebrating the fiftieth anniversary {{of both the}} <b>Guinean</b> <b>franc</b> and the Banque Centrale de la République de Guinée (BCRG)http://www.bcrg-guinee.org/presentation/historique was issued featuring a diamond-shaped logo of the event on the front side of each denomination inside of the watermark window to the right.|$|E
50|$|Dramé {{served in}} the first council of the Politburo of the First Republic of Guinea as Minister of Finance from 1957.In this role, he signed the first bank notes of the republic, and {{established}} the <b>Guinean</b> <b>franc</b> in 1960.Drame was made responsible for the plans for economic development of Guinea for the periods 1960-1963, 1964-1971 and 1973-1979.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Guinean</b> <b>franc</b> was reintroduced as Guinea's {{currency}} in 1985, at {{par with the}} syli. The coins came in denominations of 1, 5 and 10 francs made of brass clad steel, with brass 25 francs (1987) and cupronickel 50 francs (1994) added later. Banknotes were first issued in denominations of 25, 50, 100, 500, 1000 and 5000 francs. Guinean notes of this series are unique from those of other countries in that the date of issue features very prominently {{as part of the}} overall design on the lower left hand corner of each note.|$|E
50|$|It was {{reported}} in late August that about three billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> would be provided to parties by the government for campaign purposes, although 90% of this money would go to parties already represented in the National Assembly, such as the governing PUP, the opposition Union for Progress and Renewal (UPR), and the opposition Union for the Progress of Guinea (UPG).|$|R
50|$|Boiro was {{appointed}} National Director of the State Treasury of the Republic of Guinea by a decree of President Alpha Condé {{at the beginning}} of 2012. Aïssatou Boiro played a decisive role in dismantling a network which held around 13 billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> (about 1.5 million euros) in May 2012. A number of employees of the Ministry of Finance, the State Treasury and the Central Bank were arrested.|$|R
50|$|Early on May 30, {{supporters}} of Conté held a demonstration at the Palace of the People in Conakry, condemning the unrest. The soldiers began receiving their back pay on May 30, as initial payments of one million <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> were distributed; subsequently, Conakry was reported calm, but on May 30 most markets, shops, offices, and gas stations remained closed. On the same day, Conté {{met with the}} mutinous soldiers at the Samory Touré camp.|$|R
50|$|The first <b>Guinean</b> <b>franc</b> was {{introduced}} in 1959 to replace the CFA franc. There were 1, 5, 10 and 25 francs coins (made of aluminium bronze) with banknotes (dated 1958) in 50, 100, 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 francs denominations. A second series of banknotes dated 1er MARS 1960 was issued on 1 March 1963, without the 10,000 francs. This series was printed without imprint by Thomas De La Rue, and includes more colors, enhanced embossing, and improved security features. A new issue of coins in 1962 was made of cupronickel.|$|E
5000|$|Tariffs {{increased}} substantially, {{starting with}} an increase {{right at the beginning}} of the contract from 60 to 150 <b>Guinean</b> <b>franc</b> (GF)/m3 ($0.12/m3 to $0.25/m3). By 1994 the tariff had increased to 880 GF/m3 ($0.90/m3), having increased [...] "far more quickly than originally planned", according to the World Bank. The increased revenues were used to reduce government subsidies and to repay debt. In 1994 tariffs were frozen and due to inflation the real value of the tariff had declined to $0.63/m3 by 1999. Due to high levels of inflation real water tariffs declined to $0.21/m3 in 2005, which was below their level {{at the beginning of the}} lease contract.|$|E
50|$|Any indecent act or {{act against}} nature {{committed}} {{with an individual}} {{of the same sex}} will be punished by imprisonment of six months to three years and a fine of 100,000 to 1,000,000 <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs.</b> If the act was committed with a minor under 21 years of age, the maximum sentence must be pronounced. If the act was consummated or attempted with violence or attempted violence, the guilty person will be condemned to five to ten years of imprisonment.|$|R
50|$|In early July, Souaré toured Conakry {{and spoke}} to the people, {{promising}} to improve their situation with regard to food, water and electricity; he also said that his government would focus on reducing unemployment among young people. In early August, it was reported that Souaré planned to establish a Minimum Emergency Programme, which was designed to improve security, services, and youth employment, reduce food prices, and repair infrastructure. This programme was expected to cost about 75 billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs.</b>|$|R
50|$|In October 2007, {{the budget}} for the {{election}} was placed at about 79 billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs,</b> with about 18 billion coming {{from the government and}} foreign aid required for the remainder. As of June 2008, the government had contributed 26% of the total; the European Union had contributed $6.2 million, while the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) had contributed $500,000 and France had contributed $155,600 (sums in United States dollars). Germany has also said that it would contribute. Many feel that the Guinean government is relying excessively on donors and should pay for a larger portion of the budget.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the unrest, Souaré's government promised to pay the soldiers. Speaking on television on May 27, Souaré called for calm, noting {{that the government had}} agreed to meet most of the soldiers' demands. He said that up to five million <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> would be paid to each soldier to account for wage arrears, which in some cases dated back to 1996; additionally, he assured the soldiers that they would not face punishment and said that soldiers who had been arrested in connection with 2007 unrest would be freed. Regarding the soldiers' demand that the price of rice be subsidized, he said that the government would try to improve the army's living conditions.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1980 s, Guinea's {{agricultural}} {{research and development}} (R&D) {{has been marked by}} contracting expenditures, whereas its human resource capacity has remained more or less unchanged. In 2008, the country employed 229 full-time equivalent (FTE) agricultural researchers, and public agricultural R&D expenditures totaled 3. 9 billion <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> or 3. 2 million PPP dollars (both in constant 2005 prices), which is well below the levels recorded in the 1980 s. Unless otherwise stated, all prices in this note are based on purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates, which relect the purchasing power of currencies more efectively than do standard exchange rates because they compare the prices of a broader range of local-as opposed to internationally traded-goods and services.

50|$|Guinea {{has seen}} {{year on year}} {{inflation}} rates hover well above 50% since the late 1990s, though many months have seen much lower levels in the single digits. In Guinea the normal drivers of inflation are food supply and distribution, and global commodity prices. Political instability has also contributed greatly to the fall in the <b>Guinean</b> <b>franc's</b> value in recent years due {{to a series of}} coups following the ouster of longtime military strongman Lansana Conté and mass protests. Some government mitigation policies and economic growth have progressively stabilized inflation rates which reached their peak in July 2005 at 42.6% for the month to a current average of 9.7% per month. On 21 July 2010, Yahoo! Finance quoted the rate as 5,050 GNF to 1 USD. As of August 12, 2014, the exchange rate was 7,023 GNF to 1 USD.|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} to the unrest, Souaré's government promised to pay the soldiers, and Minister of Defense Mamadou Bailo Diallo was dismissed by Conté. Speaking on television on May 27, Souaré called for calm, noting {{that the government had}} agreed to meet most of the soldiers' demands. He said that up to five million <b>Guinean</b> <b>francs</b> would be paid to each soldier to account for the wage arrears; additionally, he assured the soldiers that they would not face punishment and said that soldiers who had been arrested in connection with 2007 unrest would be freed. Regarding the soldiers' demand that the price of rice be subsidized, he said that the government would try to improve the army's living conditions. Souaré also said that a commission, including both civilians and members of the military, had been set up {{at the beginning of the}} crisis to review the soldiers' demands. He said that [...] "stability and social peace in the country depend mainly on order and discipline within our national armed forces".|$|R
40|$|In Guinea, the {{national}} rice consumption exceeds rice production, leading to concerns about food security. Thus, recent governmental {{measures have been}} directed towards promoting rice production, particularly in the coastal areas, the only zone where the mangrove rice production is practiced. Rice {{is the most important}} food crop and its production is the most organized food production system in the country. Therefore, it’s of interest to examine the efficiency of mangrove rice production, in this study an attempt is made to determine the technical efficiency of mangrove rice production by using the stochastic frontier model. The study used primary data collected through a field survey. The analysis revealed that farm area and depreciation cost of farm tools contribute to significantly enhance the mangrove rice productivity. The inefficiency model revealed that age of household head, household size, farming experience, off-farm income and remittance significantly influenced the technical efficiency. The mean level of the technical efficiency was estimated at 23 %, while the efficiency ranged from 0. 0 % to 100 %. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that the loss due to the inefficiency was significant with a value of 8, 838, 762 <b>Guinean</b> <b>Francs</b> per acre. Policy recommendations and strategies for improving the efficiency o...|$|R
