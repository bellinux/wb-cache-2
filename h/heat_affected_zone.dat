The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zone.</b> Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and hydrogen embrittlement.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work has been to {{investigate}} the ultimate capacities of aluminium plates. The aluminium plates {{are supposed to be}} part of a marine structure. Their behaviour has been explored by taking advantage of non-linear finite element simulations. The loading conditions included axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading. Different patterns of <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> have been studied with particular attention on conventionally welded plates and extruded, welded plates. The plates have been given realistic boundary conditions in addition to boundary conditions believed to represent the extremities in plate collapse behaviour. The initial deflection patterns chosen, were generally conservative, and the variations in collapse capacities for different initial deflection patterns have been investigated. The initial deflection amplitudes were systematically varied to cover all values of the initial deflection amplitudes likely to occur. In addition to studying different patterns of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> systematic variations of the breadths of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> have been performed. Systematic variations in the magnitudes of the residual stresses and systematic variations of the reductions of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stresses in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> have also been carried out. Three different aluminium alloys were studied. They were believed to represent a high, medium and low utilised aluminium alloy. The aspect ratio of the plates was varied to cover both plates that were completely square to plates with a length equal to five times the breadth of the plates. It was found that axially loaded plates with <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along loaded edges had lower ultimate capacities than plates with <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along unloaded edges, and if the plates had <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along loaded edges, having additional <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along unloaded edges did not alter the buckling capacities. The reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the breadth of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> and the reduction in ultimate capacity could be modelled to vary linearly with the relationship between the value of the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress in the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> and the 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress of the base material. The ultimate capacities of transversally loaded plates could be found as the sum of a square plate and a plate strip, even if the plates contained <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones.</b> Square plates and plate strips with relevant patterns of <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> had to be employed. Biaxial interaction curves showed a considerable slenderness dependence for all values of the aspect ratio investigated. The biaxial interaction curves were only slightly affected by introduction of different patterns of <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones.</b> The stress corresponding to equal elastic and plastic strain was better suited as the normalising stress than the more commonly used 0. 2 percent tensile proof stress. One design curve could be used to represent all the different aluminium alloys investigated. Changing the aluminium alloy did not change the shape of the biaxial interaction curves. Based on the detailed study of the collapse behaviour of aluminium plates carried out, and established practice, new ULS design formulas for axial compression, transverse compression, pure shear loading, axial compression in combination with transverse compression and axial compression in combination with shear loading were proposed. The new design formulas accounted for reductions in ultimate capacities due to <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones,</b> including <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> along loaded edges. They took full advantage of non-linear residual strength for slender plates; and the slenderness dependence and aspect ratio dependence for biaxial interaction curves were systematically incorporated. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R

40|$|The {{relatively}} recent application of laser welding and spot welding to platinum has supplemented the traditional joining techniques of conventional welding and brazing with a gas torch. Several recent publications (1 - 3) have promoted {{the use of}} laser welding, because of the superior strength of the joins {{compared with that of}} joins by conventional welding and brazing. In this paper we compare welds in three different platinum alloys, produced with three different welding techniques: conventional welding, laser welding and spot welding. The welds joining cold-rolled bars were performed by jewellers operating in their own workshops. The extents of the <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> and consequent decrease in hardness were assessed in our laboratory.

50|$|Friction stir {{processing}} (FSP) is {{a method}} of changing the properties of a metal through intense, localized plastic deformation. This deformation is produced by forcibly inserting a non-consumable tool into the workpiece, and revolving the tool in a stirring motion as it is pushed laterally through the workpiece.

50|$|Flame {{hardening}} is used {{to harden}} {{only a portion of}} a metal. Unlike differential hardening, where the entire piece is heated and then cooled at different rates, in flame hardening, only a portion of the metal is heated before quenching.

However, steel is sometimes annealed through a process called normalizing, leaving the steel only partially softened.

40|$|Titanium alloys {{are known}} to exhibit unique {{weldability}} issues, particularly atmospheric contamination from interstitial species such as oxygen. The prevention of such impurities from entering the weld region and surrounding <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> is critical for engineering applications as these species are seen to dramatically alter the microstructure and so mechanical properties of the material. Of greatest concern is embrittlement of the weld region. During this study, the influence of inert shielding gas on atmospheric contamination by interstitial species, namely hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, was investigated {{as a function of}} post-weld gas shielding temperature. Gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) was used to compare samples of commercially pure (CP) titanium and Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy formed by conventional manufacturing methods. The influence of post-weld gas shielding on mechanical properties was quantified ex-situ through microhardness testing with observations of microstructure also made. It is shown that mechanical hardness levels are inversely proportional to the temperature to which continuous post-weld inert gas shielding is maintained. Hence interstitial impurity levels within the weld and <b>heat</b> <b>affected</b> <b>zones</b> are seen to increase with increasing post-weld shielding temperature. This effect was more pronounced in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V material, and may be attributed to the comparatively low thermal conductivity...|$|R

50|$|Oxygen is used {{in small}} amounts as an {{addition}} to other gases; typically as 2-5% addition to argon.

Argon-oxygen (Ar-O2) blends are often being replaced with argon-carbon dioxide ones. Argon-carbon dioxide-oxygen blends are also used.
