25|$|The Pakistani Ministry of Water and Power {{reported}} in 2002 that only 1% {{of the domestic}} and industrial wastewater receives treatment. According to the Pakistan Water Situational Analysis, there are three wastewater treatment plants in Islamabad, of which only one is functional. Karachi has two trickling filters, where effluents generally receive screening and sedimentation. Lahore has some screening and <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> <b>systems,</b> but they are hardly functional. In Faisalabad, there is a wastewater treatment plant, in which wastewater receives primary treatment, but it treats only 7 percent of the collected wastewater in the city. Multan, Rawalpindi and Gujranwala have no wastewater treatment plants at all. In rural areas, wastewater treatment is nonexistent, leading to pollution of surface and groundwater.|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{innovative}} hybrid waterjet cleaning (HWJC) {{process which}} aims to combine the benefits of both abrasive waterjet (AWJ) and plain waterjet (PWJ) processes has been proposed in this paper as an innovative solution for bulk removal of thick alpha case from titanium alloys. In the HWJC process, AWJ is firstly applied to the target surface in order to remove the surface material to a near- desired depth; the PWJ operation is then applied to clean the AWJ-machined surface. The PWJ process is designed to remove the embedded abrasive particles from the AWJ-machined surface {{and to provide a}} polishing effect (reduction in surface roughness). In order to evaluate the performance of HWJC, a series of experimental runs have been conducted on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V with an alpha case layer. The influence of PWJ processing parameters on the efficiency of <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> was examined. The results showed that the HWJC process can effectively reduce the area coverage of grit contamination. However, the <b>grit</b> <b>removal</b> efficiency is dependent not only on the operating parameters of the PWJ, but also upon the embedment behavior of the abrasive particles...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{fractional}} {{volume of}} the reservoir sand shall {{be taken to the}} ground when the crude oil is brought up from the ground. With the deepening of the oil extraction the sand content of oil recovery is increasing. Although many measures have been used such as prevent sand, block sand and so on, the viscosity of heavy oil is big and the fractional of sand is carried into the crude oil gathering system inevitably, causing a series of problems at ground equipment, having a serious impact on the normal production and gathering of crude oil. The larger size of sand can be removed by the sedimentation and the smaller sand can be removed by hydrocyclone devices. Hydrocyclone is a separation plant used to separate non-uniform phase mixtures. It can be used to complete the liquid clarification and to wash particles, liquid degassing and <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> grading and classification of solid particles and the separation of two non-miscible liquids and others. Hydrocyclone separation technique is simple and convenient operation, high separation efficiency, no rotating units, small size and easy to realize automatic control. On the offshore platform，if the sand mixed with oil is discharged into sea unsatisfactory the standard, it will pollute the sea. It will cause a serious of marine pollution; this is a problem that should be solved quickly.

40|$|Wastewater {{contains}} large solids {{and grit}} that {{can interfere with}} treatment processes or cause undue mechanical wear and increased maintenance on wastewater treatment equipment. To minimize potential problems, these materials require separate handling. Preliminary treatment removes these constituents from the influent wastewater. Preliminary treatment consists of screening, <b>grit</b> <b>removal,</b> septage handling, odor control, and flow equalization. This fact sheet discusses screening and <b>grit</b> <b>removal.</b> Screening Screening is the first unit operation used at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Screening removes objects such as rags, paper, plastics, and metals to prevent damage and clogging of downstream equipment, piping, and appurtenances. Some modern wastewater treatment plants use both coarse screens and fine screens. Figure 1 depicts a typical bar screen (a type of coarse screen). Coarse Screens Coarse screens remove large solids, rags, and debris from wastewater, and typically have openings of 6 mm (0. 25 in) or larger. Types of coarse screens include mechanically and manually cleaned bar screens, including trash racks. Table 1 describes {{the various types of}} coarse screens. Fine Screens Fine screens are typically used to remove material that may create operation and maintenance problems in downstream processes, particularly in systems that lack primary treatment. Typical opening sizes for fine screens are 1. 5 to 6 mm (0. 06 to 0. 25 in). Very fine screens with openings of 0. 2 to 1. 5 mm (0. 01 to 0. 06 in) placed after coarse or fine screens can reduce suspended solids to levels near those achieved by primary clarification. Comminutors and Grinders Processing coarse solids reduces their size so they can be removed during downstream treatment operations, such as primary clarification, where both floating and settleable solids are removed. Comminuting and grinding devices are installed in the wastewater flow channel to grind and shred material up to 6 to 19 mm (0. 25 to 0. 75 in) in size. Comminutors consist of a rotating slotted cylinder through which wastewater flow passes. Solids that are too large to pass through the slots are cut by blades as the cylinder rotates, reducing their size until they pass through the slot openings...|$|R
