5|$|Tennessee's {{delegation}} did {{not attend}} the convention. Edward Rucker, a Tennessean who happened to be in Baltimore, was picked to cast its 15 votes, so that all the states would endorse Van Buren. Senator Silas Wright, of New York, prevailed upon Rucker to vote for Johnson, giving <b>him</b> <b>just</b> more than twice the votes cast for Rives, and the nomination.|$|E

5|$|After Brian reveals Meg's {{secret to}} Peter and Lois, who don't want her seeing Luke again, he soon breaks {{out of jail}} during a prison riot and tries {{to hide in the}} Griffins' house. When Brian comes to Meg's room to {{apologize}} for what he did to her, he finds <b>him</b> <b>just</b> as Peter enters. Peter only knows what is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E
5|$|After {{pitching}} to a 4-13 {{record and}} a 4.86 ERA, with a 5.71 ERA in the second half, the Yankees removed Hughes from the rotation on September 4, replacing him with David Huff. Hughes went 1–10 in home starts in 2013, making <b>him</b> <b>just</b> the second MLB pitcher to win fewer than two games when making at least 15 home starts in a season; the other being Phil Huffman of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1979. He has the third-highest ERA in Yankee history among pitchers with at least 500 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Sports Illustrated {{magazine}} estimated Vick's {{annual income}} between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking <b>him</b> <b>just</b> below NASCAR's Dale Earnhardt, Jr. in a listing of highest earning athletes. Vick's finances suffered, however, from poor management, bad investments and lawsuits. Certified Financial Planner Michael Smith advised Vick from 2003-2005, but resigned after Vick took bad advice from friends, made ill-conceived investments, overspent, and otherwise undermined the wealth-building plan that Smith had created. Smith's plan was for Vick to have a net wealth of $100 million by 2010; by that date Vick was actually an estimated $20million in debt.|$|E

5|$|In 429 BC {{during the}} Plague of Athens, Pericles {{witnessed}} {{the death of}} his sister and of both his legitimate sons, Paralus and Xanthippus, from his first wife. With his morale undermined, he burst into tears, and not even Aspasia's companionship could console <b>him.</b> <b>Just</b> before his death, the Athenians allowed a change in the citizenship law of 451 BC that made his half-Athenian son with Aspasia, Pericles the Younger, a citizen and legitimate heir, a decision all the more striking in considering that Pericles himself had proposed the law confining citizenship to those of Athenian parentage on both sides. Pericles died of the plague in the autumn of 429 BC.|$|E
5|$|Marty (Eddie Jones) is {{a former}} boxer, now {{a high school teacher}} and boxing trainer/manager who had {{previously}} coached a fighter to a title shot, only to have the fighter leave <b>him</b> <b>just</b> before the fight. Marty and his business partner Diane (Diane Tayler) arrive at the gym where Tommy spars to scout his sparring partner. The fighter's manager instructs Tommy to make his fighter look good, but after he suffers a low blow, Tommy knocks the fighter out with one punch. The manager and the gym's owner angrily order Tommy from the gym but Marty and Diane chase after him, inviting him to train with Marty.|$|E
5|$|Ra's loads the {{microwave}} emitter onto Gotham's monorail system, intending {{to release the}} drug as the train travels toward the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and fights <b>him</b> <b>just</b> as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy {{a section of the}} track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.|$|E

Despite {{numerous}} warnings that the treasure and the island are haunted, Roman continues to use his men in search of the treasure. Roman captures Fisher, but Drake and Sullivan catch up to <b>him,</b> <b>just</b> in time to see Roman about to leave with the statue. However, Navarro tells Roman the real treasure is inside the statue. Roman opens the statue to collect the riches inside. As soon as Roman does, he is cursed and zombified. Apparently angered at this betrayal, Roman savagely charges towards Navarro, who shoots Roman in the head and reveals to Drake that he intended to sell the statue as a weapon the whole time.|$|E
5|$|Sean Glennon's four {{turnovers}} tied {{a career-high}} for interceptions and brought his season interception mark to 11. He completed 13ofhis26passes for 94yards and a completion percentage of 50%. The passing total of 94yards was the second-lowest total {{in the entire}} season, coming behind only a November 4 game in Miami where Glennon passed for just 86yards {{in the face of}} a tough defense. In a statistic unusual for the 2006 season, Glennon was not the only Tech player to complete a pass. Wide receiver Eddie Royal's 53-yard TD pass made <b>him</b> <b>just</b> the third Virginia Tech player to complete a pass during the 2006 season. The play on which Royal made his throw, a lateral WR pass, had been attempted once previously in the season during a 38–27 loss to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the ground game, seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put <b>him</b> <b>just</b> eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is even more impressive {{when one considers that}} he had been suspended for the entire first quarter of the game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E

5|$|The {{concession}} conferred on the grantees {{the sole}} rights to mine throughout Lobengula's country, {{as well as}} the power to defend this exclusivity by force, in return for weapons and a regular monetary stipend. Starting in early 1889, the king repeatedly tried to disavow the document on the grounds of alleged deceit by the concessionaires regarding the settled terms; he insisted that restrictions on the grantees' activities had been agreed orally, and apparently considered these part of the contract even though the written text had been translated and repeatedly explained to <b>him</b> <b>just</b> before he signed it. He attempted to persuade the British government to deem the concession invalid, among other things sending emissaries to meet Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle, but these efforts proved unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The second sub-plot {{depicts the}} lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making <b>him</b> <b>just</b> as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
5|$|Vasile Kogălniceanu, the {{youngest}} son, was noted for {{his involvement in}} agrarian and left-wing politics during the early 20th century. A founder of Partida Țărănească (which served as an inspiration for the Peasants' Party after 1918), he was a collaborator of Vintilă Rosetti in campaigning for the universal suffrage and legislating Sunday rest. A manifesto to the peasants, issued by <b>him</b> <b>just</b> before the Peasants' Revolt of 1907, was interpreted by the authorities as a call to rebellion, and led to Kogălniceanu's imprisonment for a duration of five months. A member of the Chamber of Deputies for Ilfov County, {{he served as a}} rapporteur for the Alexandru Averescu executive during the 1921 debates regarding an extensive land reform.|$|E

5|$|Kratos surprises Zeus, seizes the Blade of Olympus, {{and finally}} incapacitates him. Athena {{intervenes}} and implores Kratos to stop, as by killing Zeus, he will destroy Olympus. Kratos ignores her {{and tries to}} kill Zeus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. Before she dies, Athena reveals that Kratos is actually Zeus' son. Zeus was afraid Kratos would usurp <b>him,</b> <b>just</b> as Zeus had usurped his own father, Cronos. Kratos declares that {{the rule of the}} gods is at an end, then travels back in time and rescues the Titans just before their defeat in the Great War. He returns with the Titans to the present, and the gods watch as their former foes climb Mount Olympus. Kratos, standing on the back of Gaia, declares that he has brought the destruction of Olympus, setting up the events of God of War III.|$|E
5|$|Many Democrats {{were anxious}} to return Senator J. C. S. Blackburn to his seat in Congress, but some were instead {{supporting}} ex-Governor John Y. Brown. Democratic state senator Albert Berry was also making overtures about being considered for the seat. Republican legislators nominated W. Godfrey Hunter for the seat, and ultimately, Blackburn and Hunter emerged as the leading candidates. The Gold Democrats refused to back Blackburn, a free silver supporter, instead opting for ex-Governor James B. McCreary. On ballot after ballot, no candidate received a majority, though Blackburn received 65 votes once, leaving <b>him</b> <b>just</b> two votes shy of election. Treasury Secretary John G. Carlisle was put forward as a compromise candidate, but never received more than 61 votes. Other proposed compromise candidates included Louisville Courier-Journal editor Henry Watterson, congressman Walter Evans, ex-Governor Buckner, Judge William H. Holt, and Augustus E. Willson.|$|E
5|$|On lap 37, Trulli and Nico Rosberg were {{battling for}} {{position}} going into turn 1. Both span {{off the track}} in almost synchronised fashion without touching each other. This occurrence amused reporters due to it resembling a form of dance. Both drivers were able to keep going. Also on this lap Anthony Davidson made an unscheduled pit stop. He claimed after the race that a beaver had damaged his front wing although Canadian reports said it {{more likely to have}} been a groundhog. One lap later David Coulthard was forced to retire due to a gearbox problem. Ralf Schumacher also stopped on this lap and this allowed Massa, Fisichella and Sato to move ahead of both of them. Räikkönen had his second pit stop on lap 52 at the same time as Alonso. The latter was able to pass <b>him</b> <b>just</b> after they had exited the pits side-by-side. This moved him into 5th.|$|E
