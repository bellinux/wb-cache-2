5|$|The group, {{with the}} legal {{authority}} and financial assistance of SirDoi, buy {{the help of the}} town of Ochiai {{in order to create a}} trap. They also enlist the help of Makino, a minor lord whose daughter-in-law was raped and son murdered by Naritsugu. With troops, Makino blocks the official highway, forcing Naritsugu to head into town and the trap. During the assassins' own journey to the town, they are attacked by ronin who have been paid off by Hanbei to kill the plotters. The group decides to <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mountains but end up getting lost. In the process they encounter a hunter named Kiga Koyata who becomes their guide; Shinzaemon eventually recruits him as the thirteenth assassin.|$|E
5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{was the use}} of a dummy head to {{find the}} location of an enemy sniper. The tempting target of a realistic papier-mâché head was raised above the parapet on a stick running in a groove on a fixed board. To increase the realism, a lit cigarette could be inserted into the dummy's mouth and be smoked by a soldier via a rubber tube. If the head was shot, it was dropped rapidly, simulating a casualty. The sniper's bullet would have made a hole in the front and back of the dummy's head. The head was then raised in the groove again, but lower than before by the vertical distance between the glasses of a trench periscope. If the lower glass of a periscope was placed before the front bullet hole, its upper glass would be at exactly the same height as the bullet had been. By looking through the rear hole in the <b>head,</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> front hole and up through the periscope, the soldier would be looking exactly along the line the bullet had taken, and so would be looking directly at the sniper, revealing his position.|$|E
5|$|MD 404 enters Caroline County upon {{crossing}} the Tuckahoe Creek, where it becomes Shore Highway. It widens into a four-lane divided highway and {{emerges from the}} woods into agricultural areas, intersecting MD 480 (Ridgely Road) near Hillsboro. Past that intersection, the route heads through a mix of woods and residences, narrowing back into a two-lane undivided road, before intersecting MD 404 Alt. (Hillsboro Road), where MD 404 heads into a mix of farms and woodland. Unsigned MD 485 (Saathoff Road) loops {{to the south of}} MD 404, returning to the route before the intersection with the southern terminus of MD 312 (Downes Station Road). The route continues to the southeast through farms, heading toward Denton. As the road approaches Denton, it widens into a four-lane divided highway that heads through rural areas with some residences and businesses. MD 404 Bus. (Meeting House Road) splits from MD 404 to <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> center of Denton while MD 404 continues east to bypass Denton to the north.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so {{they can}} sneak {{him out of the}} house. That night, Elliott and E.T. <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> forest, where they make a {{successful}} call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert, being investigated by a raccoon. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses telekinesis to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.|$|E

Frodo is then {{approached}} by a man, Tom Bombadil (Daran Norris), who tells him the tree is called Old Man Willow. Tom puts Willow to sleep, and releases the hobbits. They go to his house, meeting his wife, Goldberry (Kath Soucie). The hobbits spend the night, before heading to the Barrow-downs, where Sam, Pippin and Merry are captured by a Barrow-wight. Tom arrives, again saving them, and leads them to Bree, advising them {{to stay in the}} Prancing Pony.|$|E
25|$|These are baby {{carriers}} {{that use}} dynamic tension, {{a length of}} cloth and metal (such as aluminum) or nylon rings. One end of the cloth is sewn to two rings. The cloth wraps around the wearer's body from shoulder to opposite hip and {{back up to the}} shoulder, and the end is threaded through the rings to create a buckle effect. The baby sits or lies in the resulting pocket. Once a sling is threaded, it can be taken off and put back on without rethreading. A threaded sling forms a loop of cloth. The wearer can put one arm and the <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> loop of cloth to put the sling back on.|$|E
25|$|He {{was brought}} to trial later that same year, {{but this time it}} was {{for his role in the}} Sullan proscriptions. At the insistence of Cato the Younger, who was then quaestor, all men who had profited during the proscriptions were brought to trial. For his involvement, Catiline was accused of killing his former {{brother-in-law}} Marcus Marius Gratidianus, carrying this man’s severed <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of Rome and then having Sulla add him to the proscription to make it legal. Other allegations claimed that he murdered several other notable men. Despite this, Catiline was acquitted again, though some surmise that it was through the influence of Caesar, who presided over the court.|$|E

He then hears a call from Consuela Alvarez (Meg Savlov), Ernesto's wife, asking Ernesto to call her. She tells him that herself and the girls are fine, but there is a fire in the nearby forest getting closer to their house.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} World Wrestling Federation, the Bulldogs {{returned}} to Stampede Wrestling, {{and also to}} All Japan Pro Wrestling. Stampede officials were hopeful that {{the return of the}} Bulldogs would revive a struggling promotion, but they were unsuccessful. Eventually in May 1989, {{the decision was made to}} split up the Bulldogs, which caused some problems with All Japan owner Shohei Baba, who was still promoting the Bulldogs as a tag team. On 4 July 1989 Smith, along with fellow wrestlers Chris Benoit, Ross Hart, and Jason the Terrible, was involved in a serious automobile accident. Smith, who was not wearing a seatbelt at the time, needed 135 stitches after slamming his <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windshield and being thrown 25 feet onto the pavement. He recovered, and the Bulldogs continued teaming in All Japan against teams such as Joe and Dean Malenko, Kenta Kobashi and Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, and The Nasty Boys. Personal problems began to surface between Smith and Billington, and Smith later left All Japan to return to the WWF.|$|E
25|$|An able commander, Catiline had a {{distinguished}} military career. He {{served in the}} Social War with Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus and Cicero, under Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo in 89 BC. During the regime of Gaius Marius, Lucius Cornelius Cinna and Gnaeus Papirius Carbo, Catiline played no major role, but he remained politically secure. He later supported Lucius Cornelius Sulla {{in the civil war}} of 84–81 BC. It was during Sulla's proscriptions that Catiline, according to accusations made by Cicero, maimed and then killed and beheaded his brother-in-law, Marcus Marius Gratidianus, at the tomb of Catulus; he then carried the <b>head</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> streets of Rome and deposited it at Sulla's feet at the Temple of Apollo. Catiline is also accused of murdering his first wife and son so that he could marry the wealthy and beautiful Aurelia Orestilla, daughter of the Consul of 71 BC, Gnaeus Aufidius Orestes. In the early 70s BC he served abroad, possibly with Publius Servilius Vatia in Cilicia. In 73 BC, he was brought to trial for adultery with the Vestal Virgin, Fabia, who was a half-sister of Cicero's wife, Terentia, but Quintus Lutatius Catulus, the principal leader of the Optimates, testified in his favor, and eventually Catiline and Fabia were acquitted.|$|E
