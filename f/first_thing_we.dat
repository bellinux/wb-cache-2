5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and fully clothed fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The <b>First</b> <b>Thing</b> <b>We</b> Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
500|$|Krankel and Hines {{looked at}} other story-focused games, {{and felt that}} they either were linear stories driven by set pieces, or branching, player choice-influenced stories [...] told through cut scenes. [...] "We thought, why not let you move freely while communicating, interacting, and {{exploring}} a branching narrative?" [...] Krankel recalled. [...] "The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> wanted {{to do is make}} a game where communication is really sort of a key mechanic, but that people have more freedom than they do with all the other narrative-focused games. At its core, we wanted to never have a cut scene in the game, where you could walk and move freely and communicate with your friends, and even communicate with other beings and other kind of strange things." [...] Rather than developing the gameplay and attaching a story to it, Night School focused on developing gameplay that would support the story they wanted to tell.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to nail down a visual image to put on a title like that. The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E
6000|$|... "Woman's {{right to}} follow the {{dictates}} of her own heart, uncontrolled by any law," [...] the Human Document was insisting: [...] "That {{is one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must fight for." ...|$|R
50|$|One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> {{discover}} {{in these}} groups is that personal problems are political problems. There are no personal solutions at this time. There is only collective action for a collective solution.|$|R
6000|$|... “One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must do,” said Will, “is to dirty {{these white}} jackets and {{trousers}} {{so that we}} may look like field labourers, for then if anyone should catch sight of us in the distance we should attract no attention.” ...|$|R
500|$|The Escapist, {{thinking}} {{the issues of}} a year past had died down, especially since they hadn't aroused much concern on first coming to light, did not expect the discord that ensued; response on their forums was heated, and the ESRB took [...] "vigorous exception" [...] to the piece. Zenke conducted a follow-up interview with ESRB President Patricia Vance, who clarified {{that the reason for}} the re-classification, aside from the previously-undisclosed gore, centered around the fact that the texture for nude female breasts was created by Bethesda and already existed in the game's files, and was not created or added after the fact by the modder, similarly to the infamous [...] "Hot Coffee" [...] minigame from [...] [...] "In the case of Oblivion, the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> had heard about was the topless characters, where you can actually opt-in to play throughout the whole game with a topless character. That sounded like a mod to us, and we investigated, and we actually called Bethesda to determine if the art file being used in this mod was theirs, and they did confirm that it was. ... fully rendered. ... It wasn't a Barbie Doll image, it was fully rendered." [...] In regard to what is considered by the ESRB for rating a game, Vance stated, [...] "Our policies are quite clear: it's what's created by the publisher and included on the disc, not what's created or introduced by a mod. The mod may unlock it, the mod may make it accessible, but again, going back to the publisher's burden; putting the accountability on the publisher to fully account for the content that they create and they ship – that's all we care about." [...] Vance went on to state that [...] "ESRB can't rate content that is created by other players. We never have, we never tried, nor will we ever," [...] and that the only warning ESRB issues regarding third-party content is [...] "Game Experience May Change During Online Play." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{perversion}} {{of justice is}} also a dominant theme throughout the play, despite Henry's inability to see it. One {{of the most famous}} lines in the play, spoken by the rebel Cade's sidekick Dick the Butcher, is [...] "the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> do, let's kill all the lawyers". Whether this means that lawyers are the protectors of justice, or the agents of its corruption is disputed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Miriam, [...] "we {{are truly}} going home, and I do not {{remember}} ever doing that before. And, Ralph," [...] she continued, after gazing right and left from the cab windows, [...] "one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to do is}} to get a new man to take charge of the place. That person isn't fit. I never saw such slouchy clothes." ...|$|R
5000|$|Minister for Foreign Affairs Micheál Martin did {{not rule}} out the idea of honouring the aid workers, saying [...] "Humanitarian workers are special people. They bring great honour on our country and {{certainly}} we will be looking at that issue. But <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>first,</b> <b>we</b> will welcome her Commins back warmly".|$|R
50|$|Songs for a Tailor is the 1969 debut {{solo album}} by the Scottish musician, {{composer}} and singer Jack Bruce, {{who was already}} famous {{at the time of}} its release for his work with the supergroup Cream. Originally released on the Polydor label in Europe and on Atco Records in the U.S., Songs for a Tailor was the second solo album that Bruce recorded, though he did not release the <b>first,</b> <b>Things</b> <b>We</b> Like, for another year.|$|R
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{saw were}} {{two little boys}} doing tricks on a {{horizontal}} bar.|$|E
60|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{see is a}} {{quantity}} of stones, more or less rounded, lying in gravel and poor clay.|$|E
60|$|It was the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{had heard}} outside. We heard the cry, the heavy fall. The servant {{rushed to the}} curtain.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, uncle George," [...] said Rollo, [...] "we'll get ready, {{and then}} the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> will do, will be to go down {{into the dining room}} and get some breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{a bit of}} {{good news}} to cheer Arthur," [...] said Mr. Irwine to his mother, as they drove off. [...] "I shall write to him the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> when <b>we</b> get home." ...|$|R
6000|$|The last {{sentence}} raised my dashed spirits again, and I said, confidently: [...] "You must find {{our system of}} baggage-checks delightful." [...] I said this because {{it is one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> brag of to foreigners, and I had the habit of it. [...] "By-the-way," [...] I ventured to add, [...] "I suppose you meant to say you brought two checks when I asked you for them at the train just now? But you really said you bought them." ...|$|R
60|$|Meantime Eustace {{had brought}} us safely home, where the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{did was to}} hurry up to the balcony, where Annora was already {{watching}} anxiously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, who," [...] she said, [...] "could have {{an object}} in {{stealing}} Mary Louise? Complications threaten us in this matter and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> must do is----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm told Sicily is {{an island}}," [...] grumbled Uncle John. [...] "Here we are, {{on a trip}} to Eu-rope, and emigrating to an island the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you ever}} noticed," [...] he began, [...] "that the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> get stiff in, as we advance in life, are our tastes? We suppose {{that it is}} our joints which feel the premonitions of age; and that because we no longer wish to dance or play ball or sprint in college races {{we are in the}} {{earliest}} stage of that sapless condition when the hinges of the body grind dryly upon one another, and we lose a good inch of our stature, through shrinkage, though the spine still holds us steadfastly upright." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} century BC, the Roman {{architect}} Vitruvius said all buildings should have three things: strength, utility, and beauty. [...] Vitruvius's work De Architectura, the only surviving work on the subject from classical antiquity, would have profound influence on architectural theory {{for thousands of years}} to come. Even in space architecture {{these are some of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> consider. However, the tremendous challenge of living in space has led to habitat design based largely on functional necessity with little or no applied ornament. In this sense space architecture as we know it shares the form follows function principle with modern architecture.|$|R
500|$|A lot of {{the special}} was more [...] "edgy" [...] and dark than {{what had been done}} {{previously}} on Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends. A major reason behind this was the peril, danger, and conflict that constructed the plot so heavily. McCracken explains, [...] "When we start a show one of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> think about is tone, is this a goofy one, is it a serious one, whatever it may be we stay true to that tone. This one had some higher stakes so we let it naturally unfold that way. This was the first show/special on Cartoon Network to receive a TV-PG rating." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, dear Abner!" [...] cried Mary. [...] "We {{must not}} dig there! Think of that young pirate. Almost the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{would come to}} would be him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold ON, I tell you, {{and let me}} finish. The swag I {{gathered}} won't half square me up, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> know, my creditors--well, {{you know}} what'll happen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose the}} <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{shall have to}} do is to build a snow-house," [...] said Benjy, looking ruefully round, for, as usual, he was {{depressed}} by first appearances.|$|E
6000|$|... " [...] But how can {{we leave}} the letters?" [...] Maria {{appeared}} {{to be full of}} doubts, even though Aggie's plan seemed so promising. [...] "The boys will be sure to come here the <b>first</b> <b>thing,</b> and <b>we</b> shall look rather silly carrying the letters around to the desks when they are all here." ...|$|R
5000|$|The first demo was {{composed}} by Tim Rice-Oxley in about 2001. Rice-Oxley {{said that the}} song came from [...] "hammering away on the piano" [...] explaining [...] "I was thinking of something like David Bowie's [...] "Heroes", which you drive along to a really rocking beat. ... It {{was one of the}} <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> recorded for the album." [...] It was first played on the guitar just before Dominic Scott left the band, and recorded as a demo the same year with a Yamaha CP70 instead of the guitar. Keane recorded the final version in 2003 at the Helioscentric Studios, Rye, East Sussex for the album. Keane also played this song at the historic concert Live 8 in London, along with the single [...] "Bedshaped".|$|R
5000|$|Rivero now {{resides in}} Miami Beach, Florida. Rivero used {{to reside in}} New York City. She was married to Cuban financer Jorge Mora. They welcomed their first child in 2001. Rivero {{has been known to}} express what is needed in a healthy {{relationship}} in her interviews, based on her long lasting marriage with her husband. She {{said in an interview with}} Cupid’s Pulse that she and Mora know how to respect each other’s space and to always talk through their issues. [...] "One of the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> did was learn how to fight effectively, so that helped us through a lot of problems," [...] she says. [...] "Learning to talk about things is key, and we’re pretty good at it now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{the girl}} said, [...] "it's all done with Laboratory Work. We take, for instance, {{department}} stores. I {{think that is}} the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> do, we take up the department store." ...|$|E
6000|$|We went aft to {{find some}} breakfast, and the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> noticed {{was that there was}} a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood. Then Tom was disturbed. He says: ...|$|E
6000|$|The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>we</b> {{did was to}} dock in a mine-field, [...] Which isn't a {{place where}} repairs should be done; [...] And there we lay doggo in twelve-fathom water [...] With tri-nitro-toluol hogging our run.|$|E
6000|$|A steeple appears {{far away}} upon the horizon. (The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that <b>we</b> ask of men is their faith: [...] "What do you believe?" [...] The <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> that they show us is their church: [...] "This we believe.") Then a tall chimney ranges itself alongside. (First faith, then works.) Then a {{confused}} jumble of roofs, out of which, at last, stand forth individual houses, factories, streets, and we draw up in a sleeping town.|$|R
6000|$|... "If we do that, Skip will {{be sure he}} {{has driven}} us out. I think we'd better go right up to City Hall, an' start in straight; but the <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> is, where'll <b>we</b> live?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Crane and White Lightning" [...] is a {{piece of}} music that Quentin wanted on the soundtrack, but was {{originally}} set for a Metallica track. There’s only one piece of music that I didn’t feel comfortable with when we were done. We lost a sample, I made one Hip Hop beat. I was like I gotta throw one in there. Quentin loved this beat. We rocked with it {{and it was one of}} the <b>first</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> did. I could've gotten away with it. It was a sample, but so undetectable. So unnoticeable. I wanted to take a chance, but in the movie business you can’t take those kind of chances. I wouldn’t risk nobody else. If it was my movie, I would have taken a chance. But this is Quentin Tarantino’s movie.|$|R
