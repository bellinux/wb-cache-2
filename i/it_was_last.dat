5|$|A typhoon was {{observed}} on October13 east of Guam, which moved generally northwestward for three days; then, it recurved to the northeast, and was last reported on October18. Another typhoon originated southeast of Guam on October19. It moved generally westward toward the Philippines before curving {{more to the}} north on October24. The track shifted to the northeast, and the typhoon passed between Japan and the Bonin Islands. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> observed on October30.|$|E
5|$|Adjacent to {{the palace}} is the Royal Mews, also {{designed}} by Nash, where the royal carriages, including the Gold State Coach, are housed. This rococo gilt coach, designed by SirWilliam Chambers in 1760, has painted panels by G. B. Cipriani.

5|$|After {{continuing}} through the southeast United States, the storm became extratropical {{near the border}} of North Carolina and Virginia midday on September18. Although it initially maintained tropical storm-force winds, the former hurricane weakened below gale-force on September19 while it was near Philadelphia. The storm continued rapidly to the northeast, moving through New England and {{along the coast of}} Maine before turning more to the east. Late on September19, the storm moved across Nova Scotia, passing southeast of Newfoundland the next day. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> observed late on September20 dissipating to the east of Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|CharlesII, {{unmarried}} when he {{took the}} throne, persuaded his Treasury to pay for a christening font and basin. His marriage to Catherine of Braganza produced no heir, but the font may have been used to baptise some of his 13 illegitimate children. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> used in 1796, while the basin found a new role as an altar dish in the 19thcentury and is on display with the altar plate at the Tower of London.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the five tropical systems, another storm was operationally believed to have existed in late August and early September. The ship Atlantic encountered a very heavy gale while located west of Sable Island, Nova Scotia on August31. The storm moved rapidly east-northeastward offshore Atlantic Canada. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> noted on September2 and was thought to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. However, HURDAT no longer includes this system in its database.|$|E

5|$|On August24, {{satellite}} imagery indicated a hurricane with a defined eye was located over the central Pacific Ocean. It slowly weakened {{as it moved}} over lukewarm waters, and deteriorated more rapidly after wind shear increased. By August28, the system consisted of a circulation with only weak associated convection. It weakened to a tropical depression on August30, although it remained a tropical cyclone until September2. At that time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> observed about 200mi (320km) south of Hilo, Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural race, held in 2001, was {{marred by}} {{drainage}} problems, and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> held the following year when a poor trading environment and inclement weather conditions affected the track. The race was moved to Brands Hatch for 2003 under the name London Champ Car Trophy. The event was instrumental in helping the Rockingham Motor Speedway become established on the world motor sport scene, and brought {{a new type of}} racing to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The priory was {{responsible}} for St Leonard's leper hospital at Hutton Lowcross to the south-west of Guisborough. The hospital was probably founded in the 12th century and became a dependency of the priory in 1275. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> documented in 1339. Its fate is unclear but it probably survived until the Dissolution in 1540. Archaeological excavations in a field near Hutton Village in the 1960s did not find definite evidence of the leper hospital.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} {{was located}} in the central Gulf of Mexico on September 9, potentially the same hurricane as the previous storm. It tracked generally eastward toward the coast of Florida, with its hurricane intensity estimation based on two ship reports. At about 0000UTC on September 12, it moved ashore near Clearwater, Florida as a minimal hurricane, with an estimated minimum barometric central pressure of 985mbar. Accelerating east-northeastward while crossing the state, the cyclone emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as a weakened tropical storm before regaining hurricane status on September 13. Later that day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> observed about 250mi (400km) east-southeast of Cape Hatteras.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} change {{at this time}} was that players were no longer required {{to be members of}} the Catholic Young Men's Society. Hibs are not seen today as being an Irish or Roman Catholic institution, {{as it was in the}} early years of its history. For instance, the Irish harp was only re-introduced to the club badge when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> re-designed in 2000. This design reflects the three pillars of the club's identity: Ireland, Edinburgh (the castle) and Leith (the ship). Geography rather than religion is now seen as the primary reason for supporting Hibs, who draw most of their support from the north and east of Edinburgh.|$|E

5|$|Another storm {{appeared}} {{east of the}} Philippines on May26, located {{south of}} Yap. Initially, the system moved west-northwestward, passing over Palau, where 80% of houses were destroyed; damage was estimated at ¥400,000. The storm turned to the north-northwest, then later curved back to the west-northwest, reaching the Balintang Channel north of Luzon on June2. That day, the town of Basco, Batanes in the waterway recorded a pressure of 973mbar (28.73inHg). On June3, the storm crossed over Taiwan and recurved to the northeast. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> noted on June6 {{just south of the}} Japanese island of Kyushu.|$|E
5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, before it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, before the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph). During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, before during {{the next day it}} started to gradually weaken. Arthur degenerated into a shallow depression during December 17, before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> noted during the next day as it dissipated {{to the north of the}} Pitcairn islands.|$|E
5|$|From Bates, {{the picture}} passed to Walter Tyrell; {{another member of}} the Tyrell family, Edward, {{presented}} it to the National Gallery, London, in 1863, after it had failed to sell at an auction at Christie's in 1854. The painting was transferred to the Tate Gallery in 1929, although it was actually on loan to Derby Museum and Art Gallery between 1912 and 1947. It has been lent out for exhibitions to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. in 1976, the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm in 1979–1980, and Paris (Grand Palais), New York (Metropolitan) and the Tate in London in 1990. It was reclaimed by the National Gallery from the Tate in 1986. They describe its condition as good, with minor alterations visible on some figures. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> cleaned in 1974.|$|E

5|$|On November9, a weak {{circulation}} remained nearly stationary off {{the coast}} of Acapulco, Mexico. It did not have significant convection, although it organized enough to be considered a tropical cyclone at 0000UTC on November10, about 230mi (365km) {{off the coast}} of Mexico. By the afternoon of the 10th, it was a tropical depression moving northeastward toward the coastline. Tara intensified, reaching hurricane status and its peak intensity of 85mph (140km/h) late on November11. Early on November12, Hurricane Tara made landfall near Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, between Acapulco and Manzanillo, near where Hurricane Iva moved ashore five months earlier. Continuing inland, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> observed at 1200UTC on November12. At the time, it was known as Cyclone Tara, as the term cyclone was the more common equivalent for hurricane in the region.|$|E
5|$|On September8, a low {{pressure}} area formed east of the Philippines. It intensified into a tropical storm while moving to the northwest, passing near the Ryukyu Islands on September17. After bypassing Taiwan to the north, the storm approached {{the mouth of the}} Yangtze in eastern China, before recurving to the northeast. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>last</b> noted on September21 in the Sea of Japan. On {{the last day of the}} month, a typhoon formed west of Palau. Steered to the northwest, the storm moved across northern Luzon, hitting Nueva Ecija and Pangasinan. After emerging into the South China Sea, the storm turned to the northeast, brushing the Batanes islands as well as southeastern Taiwan on October4. Crossing the Ryukyu Islands, the storm was last noted on October6 to the southwest of Kyushu.|$|E
