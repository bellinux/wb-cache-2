A <b>discrete</b> <b>variate</b> method for optimising caudal fin configuration is proposed to optimise its propulsive force and drive efficiency under the constraints of fixed surface area and sufficient fin end strength.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} and frequently used operations in the process of simulating a stochastic discrete event system is the generation of a nonuniform <b>discrete</b> random <b>variate.</b> The simplest form of this operation can be stated as follows: Generate a random variable which is distributed over the integers 1, 2, [...] ., n such that P(X = i) = pi. A more difficult problem is to generate X when the pi's change with time. For this case, there is a well-known algorithm which takes O(1 og n) time to generate each variate. Recently Fox [4] presented an algorithm that takes an expected o(1 og n) time to generate each variate under: assumptions restricting the way the pi's can change. In this paper we present algorithms for <b>discrete</b> random <b>variate</b> generation that take an expected O(1) time to generate each variate. Furthermore, our assumptions on how the pa's change are less restrictive than those of Fox. The algorithms are quite simple and can be fine-tuned to suit a wide variety of applications. The application to the simulation of queueing networks is discussed in some detail. Key Words: Simulation, Queueing Networks, Randomized Algorithms...|$|R

We consider risk models based on compound distributions assuming several examples of <b>discrete</b> <b>variate</b> time series as specific temporal dependence structures: Poisson MA(1) process, Poisson AR(1), Markov Bernoulli process and Markov switching regime process. In these models, we derive expressions for a function {{that allows us to}} find the Lundberg coeficient.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{slippage}} tests for variates following various specified distributions, viz the normal, the Poisson, the binomial {{and the negative}} binomial, {{as well as a}} slippage test for the method of m rankings and a distributionfree k-sample slippage test, are discussed. These tests are all of the general type discussed in section 2. The choice of a test criterion for this type is a plausible one, but in some cases the tests can be proved to be optimal in a sense as described by a theorem of W ALD. For <b>discrete</b> <b>variates</b> the tests are derived as special cases of a slippage test for a general class of distribution functions. The class of distribution functions consists of all distribution functions, for which a close approximation to the true significanee levels using a specified method is possible. In the case of a test for Poisson variates it is possible to give the powerfunctions of the test in very good approximation, using the same method. The same techniques were used previously for obtaining slippage tests for gamma variates by W. G. COCHRAN (1941), R. DOORNBOS (1956), and R. DOORNBOS and H. J. PRINS (1956) and for normal variates by E. PAULSON (1952). The slippage test for normal variates given here is a generalization of the one given by PAULSON. H. A.

40|$|It {{is shown}} here that Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho are {{monotone}} {{with respect to}} the concordance ordering of pairs of discrete as well as continuous random variables. This extends and completes results of [Tchen, A.

B., 1999, An Introduction to Copulas. Lecture Notes in Statistics no. 139 (New York: Springer). ] remain valid for discrete variables. In particular, a result of [Caperaa, P. and Genest, C., 1993, Journal of Nonparametric Statistics, 2, 183 - 194. ] is extended to the case of discrete random pairs. Finally, an analytic expression is given for the most extreme values of Kendall's tau and Spearman's rho associated with <b>discrete</b> uniform <b>variates...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present and}} analyze {{efficient}} new algorithms for generating a random variate distributed {{according to a}} dynamically changing set of N weights. The base version of each algorithm generates the <b>discrete</b> random <b>variate</b> in O(log* N) expected time and updates a weight in [...] . time in the worst case. We then show how to reduce the update time to O(log* N) amortized expected time. We show how to apply our techniques to a lookup-table technique {{in order to obtain}} expected constant time in the worst case for generation and update. The algorithms are conceptually simple. We give parallel algorithms for parallel generation and update having optimal processor-time product. We also apply our techniques to obtain an efficient dynamic algorithm for maintaining an approximate heap of N elements, in which each query is required to return an element whose value is within a c multiplicative factor of the maximal element value. For c = 1 /polylog(N), each query, insertion, or deletion takes O(log log log N) time...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} operations when simulating a stochastic discrete-event dynamic system is the generation of a nonuniform <b>discrete</b> random <b>variate.</b> The simplest form of this operation can be stated as follows: Generate a random variable X which is distributed over the integers 1; 2; : : :; n such that P (X = i) = a i =(a 1 + ΔΔΔ +a n), where the a i 's are fixed non-negative numbers. The well-known `alias algorithm' is available to accomplish this task in O(1) time. A more difficult problem is to generate variates for X when the a i 's are changing with time. We present three rejection-based algorithms for this task, and for each algorithm we characterize the performance in terms of acceptance probability and the expected effort to generate a variate. We show that, under fairly unrestrictive conditions, the long-run expected effort is O(1). Applications to Markovian queueing networks are discussed. We also compare the three algorithms with competing schemes [...] ...|$|R

The paper also modifies the Parisian option design by assuming the option is exercised when the barrier condition is met rather than at maturity. We obtain formulas for this new design when the underlying is continuously monitored and develop an efficient Monte Carlo method for the discrete case. Our method {{can also be used}} for the case of multiple barriers. We use numerical examples to illustrate the approach and reveal important features of the different types of options considered. Some performance-based executive stock options include different tranches of discretely monitored Parisian options and we illustrate this with a practical example.

40|$|A {{method for}} Monte-Carlo {{simulation}} of Markov chains is considered. Here, Markov chains are described with a highlevel modelling technique called transition classes. State spaces {{may be very}} large, Markov chains may be stiff, i. e. rare events may occur, simulations can be executed highly in parallel, and hybrid evaluation is possible. INTRODUCTION Monte-Carlo simulation for discrete-event models [Mit 82] is a very popular and general technique in model-based performance or reliability evaluation which is easily to apply. However, this simulation has some drawbacks, and problems appear. Some of them are addressed in this paper. Estimators may have a bias, and their variance may be high which leads to large confidence intervals. The last occurs when rare events are present. Ingenious variance reduction methods have been invented [HH 64, Fis 78, Mit 82, Rip 87, Ros 89, McG 92], e. g. conditioning, control <b>variates,</b> <b>discrete</b> time methods [HIS 96], hybrid methods [SS 84], antithetic variates, impor [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Response {{time delays}} caused by I/O {{are a major}} problem in many systems and {{database}} applications. Prefetching and cache replacement methods are attracting renewed attention because of their success in avoiding costly I/Os. Prefetching can be looked upon as a type of online sequential prediction, where the predictions must be accurate as well as made in a computationally efficient way. Unlike other online problems, prefetching cannot admit a competitive analysis, since the optimal offline prefetcher incurs no cost when it knows the future page requests. Previous analytical work on prefetching [J. Assoc. Comput. Mach., 143 (1996), pp. 771 – 793] consisted of modeling the user as a probabilistic Markov source. In this paper, we look at the much stronger form of worst-case analysis and derive a randomized algorithm for pure prefetching. We compare our algorithm for every page request sequence with the important class of finite state prefetchers, making no assumptions as to how the sequence of page requests is generated. We prove analytically that the fault rate of our online prefetching algorithm converges almost surely for every page request sequence to the fault rate of the optimal finite state prefetcher for the sequence. This analysis model can be looked upon as a generalization of the competitive framework, in that it compares an online algorithm in a worst-case manner over all sequences with a powerful yet nonclairvoyant opponent. We simultaneously achieve the computational goal of implementing our prefetcher in optimal constant expected time per prefetched page using the optimal dynamic <b>discrete</b> random <b>variate</b> generator of Matias, Vitter, and Ni [Proc. 4 th Annual SIAM/AC...|$|R
