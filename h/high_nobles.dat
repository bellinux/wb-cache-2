25|$|In the 16th century, Finland had a {{relatively}} high number of recognized noble families (derived often from the Middle Ages), whereas in Sweden proper, the proportionally much rarer nobility often was {{at the level of}} high nobility (which is measured by having members of the royal council as ancestors) as Fleming and Wadenstierna. Only a few Finnish families can be seen as recognized <b>high</b> <b>nobles.</b> This high number of lower nobility in Finland is explained to come from its military location, there having been a constant need of tapping the frälse system for troops and officers which led to a high number of ennoblements to Finland, whereas Sweden proper had lived more peacefully as to foreign wars and additionally had its nobility axed from time to time by civil war.|$|E

In 1526, Joachim I had intervened when the Pomeranian dukes {{were invited to participate}} in an Imperial Diet in Speyer. The Pomeranian case was negotiated in Speyer, and <b>high</b> <b>nobles</b> of the Holy Roman Empire mediated the conflict thereafter. In 1529, the Treaty of Grimnitz finally settled the conflict, confirming and amending the treaty of Pyritz: In Grimnitz, Pomerania was confirmed as an immediate imperial fief, yet the Electors of Brandenburg had to be present at every formal investiture and were allowed to touch the Pomeranian flag during the process, furthermore they were allowed to entitle themselves as dukes of Pomerania with the exception of cases when both the Pomeranian dukes and the Brandenburgian electors were present.|$|E
500|$|Once he {{realized}} that a full-fledged revolution was underway, Charles responded vigorously. [...] Through Cardinal Adrian, he undertook new policy initiatives, such as canceling the taxes granted in the Cortes of Corunna. [...] Most important was the appointment of two new Castilian co-regents: the Constable of Castile, Íñigo Fernández, and the Admiral of Castile, Fadrique Enríquez. [...] This negated {{two of the most}} salient complaints of the rebels. [...] In addition, Adrian approached the nobles to convince them that their best interests lay with the king. [...] The Royal Council was re-established in the fief of Admiral Enríquez, Medina de Rioseco, which enabled the Council to be nearer to the revolting cities and reassure skeptical supporters. [...] While the royal army was still in tatters, many <b>high</b> <b>nobles</b> maintained their own well-trained mercenary armies—armies that with the revolt's recent radicalization would now fight for the king.|$|E

2500|$|The rest, {{thought to}} number several thousand, were bound {{together}} {{in groups of}} three or four and had their hands tied to be marched naked before the Sultan. [...] Ordered to proceed, a group of executioners proceeded to kill each group in turn, either by decapitation or by severing their limbs from the body. [...] Nevers {{and the rest of the}} noble captives were forced to stand beside Bayezid and watch the executions. [...] Jean Le Maingre, called [...] "Boucicaut", was recognized in the line, and Nevers fell to his knees before the Sultan and indicated with intertwined fingers that they were like brothers. [...] Thus convinced that Boucicaut was worth a noble ransom, he was spared and grouped with the other <b>high</b> <b>nobles.</b> [...] The killing continued from early morning until late afternoon, at which point Bayezid, either himself sickened by the bloodshed or convinced by his ministers that he was unnecessarily enraging Christendom against him, called off the executioners. [...] Leaving aside the more hyperbolic account, the number of dead is said to have ranged from 300 to 3,000, though the number of dead on the battlefield was much more.|$|E

60|$|The Queen {{could not}} help shrugging her {{shoulders}} slightly even at this second suggestion; and the Duchess of Rutland, who read in the Queen's manner that she had expected that Sussex would have named Raleigh, and thus would have enabled her to gratify her own wish while she honoured his recommendation, only waited the Queen's assent {{to what he had}} proposed, and then said that she hoped, since these two <b>high</b> <b>nobles</b> had been each permitted to suggest a candidate for the honours of chivalry, she, in behalf of the ladies in presence, might have a similar indulgence.|$|E
60|$|But hark! the sprightly music {{calls to}} the dance; and first the stately Polonaise, in easy {{gradation}} between walking and dancing. To the surprise of the whole room and the indignation of main of the <b>high</b> <b>nobles,</b> the Crown Prince of Reisenburg led off the Polonaise with the unknown fair one. Such an attention to Beckendorff was a distressing proof of present power and favour. The Polonaise is a dignified promenade, with which German balls invariably commence. The cavaliers, {{with an air of}} studied grace, offer their right hands to their fair partners; and the whole party, in a long file, accurately follow the leading couple through all their scientific evolutions, as they wind through every part of the room. Waltzes in sets speedily followed the Polonaise; and the unknown, who was now an object of universal attention, danced with Count von Sohnspeer, another of Beckendorff's numerous progeny, if the reader remember. How scurvily are poor single gentlemen who live alone treated by the candid tongues of their fellow-creatures! The commander-in-chief of the Reisenburg troops was certainly a partner of a different complexion from the young lady's previous one. The crown Prince had undertaken his duty with reluctance, and had performed it without grace; not a single word had he exchanged with his partner during the promenade, and his genuine listlessness was even more offensive than affected apathy. Von Sohnspeer, on the contrary, danced in the true Vienna style, and whirled like a Dervish. All our good English prejudices against the soft, the swimming, the sentimental, melting, undulating, dangerous waltz would quickly disappear, if we only executed the dreaded manoeuvres in the true Austrian style. One might as soon expect our daughters to get sentimental in a swing.|$|E

5000|$|The court {{developed}} gradually {{during the}} early 12th century AD, along with the kingdom itself, {{in the aftermath of}} the First Crusade. Technically all vassals of the king which were subject to its decisions had the right to sit and vote, but in practice only the more wealthy nobles did so; certain nobles attended regularly and tended to serve as presiding judges when necessary. This developed into a system of <b>higher</b> <b>nobles</b> (direct vassals of the king) and lesser nobles (indirect vassals, who owed service to the <b>higher</b> <b>nobles),</b> with different privileges depending on idiosyncratic circumstances. Anyone who had committed perjury or had broken an oath (whether a <b>higher</b> or lesser <b>noble)</b> forfeited his right to speak and vote.
