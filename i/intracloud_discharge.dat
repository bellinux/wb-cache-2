The objective of this work is to study the electric field signature of these discharges preceding the positive return stroke. Particularly, it will study: breakdown waveforms, breakdown rise time, breakdown pulse train, time interval between pulses in a pulse train, time interval between initial breakdown and return stroke.

25|$|Anvil crawler lightning, {{sometimes}} called Spider lightning is created when leaders propagate through horizontally-extensive charge regions in mature thunderstorms, usually the stratiform regions of mesoscale convective systems.

If the leader becomes too long, it may separate into multiple bidirectional leaders. When this happens, the positive end of the separated leader may strike the ground as a positive CG flash and/or crawl {{on the underside of}} the cloud, creating a spectacular display of lightning crawling across the sky. Ground flashes produced in this manner tend to transfer high amounts of charge, and this can trigger upward lightning flashes and upper-atmospheric lightning.|$|R

This CG warning time is increased to 16. 1 minutes when using the radar-defined criterion of when the 30 -dBZ contour first reaches the - 10 ?C isotherm level.

Based on the average radar characteristics during the last CG flash in each thunderstorm case, CG activity comes to an end when the 45 -dBZ echo falls below the - 10 ?C isotherm. Detection efficiencies that remain slightly less than perfect for each network may have allowed for some error when analyzing VHF sources and ground flashes for each convective case. Exhibiting this possible error, four cases actually recorded a greater number of CG flashes than intracloud flashes, which is contrary to typical lightning characteristics. Future studies hope to increase the number of thunderstorm cases to analyze as the LDAR network continues to observe more lightning events.

40|$|Theoretical model {{calculations}} recently {{predicted the}} existence of mesospheric irregularities which assist the initiation of sprites. Here we report the experimental detection of a ∼ 3 - 19 km large mesospheric irregularity at ∼ 80 - 85 km height which is illuminated by the electromagnetic field of an intense positive cloud-to-ground lightning discharge. While the lightning discharge causes a prompt group of four sprites above the lightning discharge, the mesospheric irregularity is found at a horizontal distance at least ∼ 15 - 20 km away from the sprite group and it rebrightens ∼ 40 - 60 ms after the sprite group occurrence. This rebrightening is driven by a local quasi-static electric field enhancement with a charge moment ∼ 4 - 20 Ckm which causes the irregularity to develop a downward descending luminous column from ∼ 75 - 85 km height. The quasi-static electric field enhancement {{is caused by the}} reorganization of residual charge inside the thundercloud during a high-level activity of <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges</b> with ∼ 10 - 20 pulses per ms.

Vertical development occurred during periods of rapid wildfire growth, as indicated by the shortwave infrared channel on a geostationary satellite, as well as by incident reports.

Based on Doppler and polarimetric radar observations, they likely were caused by ice-based electrification processes that did not involve significant amounts of high-density graupel. Plumes that did not feature sig-nificant amounts of radar-inferred ice at high altitudes did not produce lightning, which means lightning ob-servations may assist in diagnosing pyrocumulus features that could affect the radiative characteristics and chemical composition of the upper troposphere. The lightning was not detected by the National Lightning Detection Network, implying that pyrocumulus lightning may occur more frequently than past studies (which lacked access to detailed intracloud information) might suggest. Given the known spatial and temporal ad-vantages provided by lightning networks over radar and satellite data, the results also indicate a possible new application for lightning data in monitoring wildfire state. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{lightning}} stroke {{called a}} "Narrow Bipolar Event", or NBE, is an <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharge</b> responsible for significant charge redistribution. The NBE occurs within 10 – 20 μs, and some associated process emits irregular bursts of intense radio noise, fading at shorter timescales, sporadically during the charge transfer. In previous reports, the NBE has been inferred {{to be quite}} different from other forms of lightning strokes, in two ways: First, the NBE has been inferred to be relatively dark (non-luminous) compared to other lightning strokes. Second, the NBE has been inferred to be isolated within the storm, usually not participating in flashes, but when {{it is in a}} flash, the NBE has been inferred to be the flash initiator. These two inferences have sufficiently stark implications for NBE physics that they should be subjected to further independent test, with improved statistics. We attempt such a test with both optical and radio data from the FORTE satellite, and with lightning-stroke data from the Los Alamos Sferic Array. We show rigorously that by the metric of triggering the PDD optical photometer aboard the FORTE satellite, NBE discharges are indeed less luminous than ordinary lightning. Referred to an effective isotropic emitter at the cloud top, NBE light output is inferred to be less than 3 × 10 8 W. To address isolation of NBEs, we first expand the pool of geolocated intracloud radio recordings, by borrowing geolocations from either the same flash's or the same storm's other recordings. In this manner we generate a pool of 2 × 10 5 unique and independent FORTE intracloud radio recordings, whose slant range from the satellite can be inferred. We then use this slant range to calculate the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) at the radio source, in the passband 26 – 49 MHz. Stratifying the radio recordings by ERP into eight bins, from a lowest bin (140 kW), we document a trend for the radio recordings to become more isolated in time as the ERP increases. The highest ERP bin corresponds to the intracloud emissions associated with NBEs. At the highest ERP, the only significant probability of temporal neighbors is during times following the high-ERP events. In other words, when participating in a flash, the high-ERP emissions occur at the apparent flash initiation...|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} lightning flash {{scheme is}} {{implemented in the}} three-dimensional (3 -D) nonhydrostatic mesoscale model Méso-NH of the French community. The scheme, {{which is part of}} the electrical scheme, follows a new approach with two steps. First, lightning flashes are modeled as bidirectional leaders to mimic the vertical propagation of the initial discharge channels along the electric field. Then, a probabilistic branching algorithm is adapted from the dielectric breakdown concept to reinforce the flash propagation toward distant regions of high charge density but immersed in a weak electric field. This results in a high increase of the total length of the lightning flash channel and also in a better capture of the morphology of intracloud lightning flashes. The electrification and lightning schemes are tested for an ideal case of a supercellular storm. The model succeeds in reproducing the general features of a storm and the electric charge cycle. Sensitivity analyses show that the implementation of a branching stage is necessary and efficient enough to relax the growth of the electric field. The <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges</b> generated by the model look realistic with a two-layer horizontal structure extending over tens of kilometers from the triggering area. The lightning flash length and the quantity of charge neutralized are ten times more important when the branching algorithm is taken into account.

The amplitudes of leader pulses in Florida increase {{just prior to the}} return stroke, the largest usually being about 10 % of the return-stroke peak. In Arizona the leader pulse amplitudes are smaller than those in Florida, in relation to the return stroke, and are not as easy to identify. The shapes of the fields produced by normal steps are similar to dart steps, and the dart steps are very similar to regular sequences of pulses produced by many <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges.</b> The 10 - 90 % rise times of individual step wave forms are often less than 0. 3 microsec, and the full width at half maximum of a step pulse is typically 0. 4 - 0. 5 microsec under conditions where the propagation distortion is minimal. The amplitudes and the shapes of leader step wave forms suggest that the peak step current is at least 2000 - 8000 A close to the ground and that the maximum rate of change of step current is 6 - 24 kA/microsec or larger.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Compact <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges</b> (CIDs) {{represent}} a distinct class of electrical discharges that occur within intense regions of thunderstorms. They are singular discharges that produce brief (typically 3 µs in duration) broadband RF emissions that are 20 to 30 dB {{more powerful than}} radiation from all other recorded lightning processes in the HF and VHF radio spectrum. Far field electric field change recordings of CIDs consist of a single, large-amplitude, narrow bipolar pulse (NBP) that begins to rise during the RF-producing phase of the CID and typically lasts for 20 µs. During the summer of 1998 we operated a 4 -station array of electric field change meters in New Mexico to support FORTÉ satellite observations of transient RF and optical sources and {{to learn more about}} the phenomenology and physical characteristics of CIDs. Over 800 CIDs were detected and located during the campaign. The events were identified on the basis of their unique field change waveforms. CID source heights determined using the relative delays of ionospherically reflected source emissions were typically between 4 and 11 km above ground level. Events of both positive and negative polarity were observed with events of initially-negative polarity (indicative of discharges occurring between underlying positive and overlying negative charge) occurring at slightly higher altitudes. Within CID field change waveforms the CID pulse was often followed within a few ms by one or more smaller-amplitude pulses. We associate these subsequent pulses with the initial activity of a “normal ” intracloud flash, the inference being that some fraction of the time, a CID initiates an intracloud lightning flash...|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} {{distributions of}} the peak magnetic field {{associated with the}} first detected return stroke {{of positive and negative}} cloud-to-ground (CG) flashes were studied using lightning data from northeastern Colorado. These data were obtained during 1985 with a medium-to-high gain network of three direction finders (DF's). The median signal strength of positive flashes was almost two times that of the negatives for flashes within 300 km of the DF's, which have an inherent detection-threshold bias that tends to discriminate against weak signals. This bias increases with range, and affects the detection of positive and negative flashes in different ways, because of the differing character of their distributions. Positive flashes appear to have a large percentage of signals clustered around very weak values that are lost to the medium-to-high gain Colorado Detection System very quickly with increasing range. The resulting median for positive signals could thus appear to be much larger than the median for negative signals, which are more clustered around intermediate values. When only flashes very close to the DF's are considered, however, the two distributions have almost identical medians. The large percentage of weak positive signals detected close to the DF's has not been explored previously. They have been suggested to come from <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges</b> and thus are improperly classified as CG flashes. Evidence in hand, points to their being real positive, albeit weak CG flashes.

40|$|International audienceFive {{gigantic}} jets (GJs) {{have been}} recorded with video and photograph cameras on 7 March 2010 above an isolated tropical storm east of Réunion Island. Three of them were produced before the storm reached its coldest cloud top temperature (approximately − 81 °C), and two others occurred during the cloud extension. Thanks to the close distance of observation (∼ 50 km), the luminosity within the cloud was recorded, and the events are analyzed in unprecedented detail. The tops of the GJs are estimated between 80 and 90 km. All these GJs are accompanied by long, continuous cloud illumination, and they are preceded and followed by intermittent optical flashes from the cloud, most of time without any cloud-to-ground (CG) flash simultaneously detected, which suggests they originated mainly as <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges</b> and without any charge transfer to Earth. The CG lightning activity is observed to cease a few tens of seconds before the jets. According to ELF data recorded at Nagycenk, Hungary, the five GJs serve to raise negative charge. Their duration ranges from 333 to 850 ms. The leading jet has the most variable duration (33 - 167 ms) and propagates faster at higher altitudes. The trailing jet exhibits a continuous decrease of luminosity {{in different parts of}} the jet (lower channel, transition zone and, for most events, carrot sprite-like top) and in the cloud, with possible rebrightening. The lower channels (∼ 20 - 40 km altitude) produce blue luminosity which decreases with altitude and become more and more diffuse with time.

40|$|Pyrocumulus clouds above three Colorado {{wildfires}} (Hewlett Gulch, High Park, and Waldo Canyon; all {{occurred during}} summer 2012) electrified and produced small <b>intracloud</b> <b>discharges</b> whenever the smoke plumes grew to high altitudes (over 10 km above mean sea level, or MSL). This occurred {{during periods of}} rapid wildfire growth, {{as indicated by the}} shortwave infrared channel on a geostationary satellite, as well as by incident reports. In the Hewlett Gulch case, the fire growth led to increased updrafts within the plume, as inferred by multiple Doppler radar syntheses, which led to the vertical development and subsequent electrification a life cycle as short as 30 minutes. The lightning, detected by a threedimensional lightning mapping network, was favored in highaltitude regions (~ 10 km MSL) containing modest reflectivities (25 dBZ and lower), ~ 0 dB differential reflectivity, and reduced correlation coefficient (~ 0. 60. 7). This indicated the likely presence of ice particles (crystals and aggregates, possibly rimed) mixed with ash. Though neither multipleDoppler nor polarimetric observations were available during the electrification of the High Park and Waldo Canyon plumes, their NEXRAD observations showed reflectivity structures consistent with Hewlett Gulch. In addition, polarimetric and multipleDoppler scanning of unelectrified High Park plumes indicated only irregularly shaped ash, and not ice, was present (i. e., reflectivities 5 dB, correlation < 0. 4), and there was no broaching of the 10 km altitude. Based on these results, the electrification likely was caused by icebased processes that did not involve significant amounts of graupel. The results demonstrate the scientific value of multipleDoppler and polarimetric radar observations of wildfire smoke plumes including the ability to distinguish between regions of pure hydrometeors, regions of pure ash, and mixtures of both and also suggest a possible new application for lightning data in monitoring wildfires...|$|R
40|$|Certain <b>intracloud</b> {{lightning}} <b>discharges</b> emit energetic, multi-microsecond pulsetrains {{of radio}} noise. Observations of this distinctive form of lightning date from 1980 and have involved both ground-based and satellite-based radio recording systems. The underlying <b>intracloud</b> lightning <b>discharges</b> have {{been referred to}} as "Narrow Bipolar Pulses", "Narrow Bipolar Events", and "Compact Intracloud Discharges". An important discriminant for this species of radio emission is that, in the range above 30 MHz, it consists of several microseconds of intense radio noise. When the intracloud emission is viewed from a satellite, each radio pulsetrain is received both from a direct lightning-to-satellite path, and after some delay, from a path via ground. Thus one recording of the radio emission, if of sufficient length, contains the "view" of the intracloud emission from two different angles. One view is of radiation exiting the emitter into the upper hemisphere, the other for radiation exiting into the lower hemisphere. However, the propagation conditions are similar, except that one path includes a ground reflection, while the other does not. One would normally expect a stereoscopic double view of the "same" emission process to provide two almost congruent time series, one delayed from the other, and also differing due to the different propagation effects along the two signal paths, namely, the ground reflection. We present somewhat unexpected results on this matter, using recordings from the FORTE satellite at a passband 118 – 141 MHz, with simultaneous data at 26 – 49 MHz. We find that the 118 – 141 MHz pulsetrain's detailed time-dependence is completely uncorrelated between the two views of the process. We examine statistics of the 118 – 141 MHz pulsetrain's integrated power and show that the power emitted into the lower hemisphere, on average, exceeds the power emitted into the upper hemisphere. Finally, we examine statistical measures of the amplitude distribution and show that the 118 – 141 MHz signal emitted downward is slightly more dominated by discrete, temporally-narrow impulses than is the signal emitted upward...|$|R
