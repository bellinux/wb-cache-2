25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the canteen}} {{continued}} to operate as men were returning home. Eventually it closed on April 1, 1946 having served over six million servicemen and women. Sixteen trains were scheduled on the final day and regular Monday workers were in charge along with Lutheran Church women from North Platte, and Gothenburg, Nebraska. They would work from five <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> midnight, as they wouldn't know when the troop trains would come through as it was secret. Food was also donated during a time of rationing so that the soldiers could experience a taste of home of sorts.|$|E
25|$|Sala dos Archeiros (Archer's Hall), {{named because}} it was {{occupied}} by the guard of honour (from 8:00a.m. <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> 11:00p.m.), is a hall illuminated by two windows and three rectangular doors, all with golden metal shields and covered in decorative paintings representing military victories. The vaulted hall ceiling is painted by José da Cunha Taborda with the Portuguese Royal coat of arms, the windows and doors surmounted by paintings, and the floor, while paved in parquet, is covered partially in carpet. It is currently used as the principal entrance for visits to the Palace and concierge.|$|E

25|$|He {{wished to}} {{advance in the}} army, and on Williams's advice, applied to a local army school, from which the best {{graduates}} {{got the chance to}} attend West Point. Gavin passed the physical examinations and was assigned with a dozen other men to a school in Corozal, which was a small army depot in the Canal Zone. He started school on September 1, 1924. In order to prepare for the entrance exams into West Point, Gavin was tutored by another mentor, Lieutenant Percy Black, from 8 o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> noon on algebra, geometry, English and history. He passed the exams and was allowed to apply to West Point.|$|E
25|$|Under the superintendence of the engineers, workmen {{were told}} off {{to cut through}} the {{carriage}} and foot roads, that being the only way of preventing the flames from spreading along the bridge. The men worked with good will and soon succeeded in cutting several holes through the asphalte and timber. How to play with the water on the underside was a difficulty soon got over. Four or five men, with a courage most commendable, volunteered to be lowered down, through the holes in the pathway, by means of ropes, enabling them to direct the water directly on to the burning woodwork. For a long time their efforts seemed to be without effect; no sooner was the fire put out {{in one part of the}} bridge than another beam burst into flames. For several hours streams of water were thrown against the bridge, ultimately with success. In order to put the spreading of the fire beyond doubt, the workmen on the bridge cut through the entire width of the carriage and footway, making a gap at both the Newcastle and Gateshead side... In no way, however, is the safety of the bridge endangered. The railway traffic was suspended from about half past eight o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>until</b> two in the afternoon, not from any apprehensions that the upper level was insecure, but on account of the smoke and flames, and also because of the hose which was lying across the rails.|$|E
500|$|Evans {{was born}} in Southwark, London, on 23 February 1826, to Henry and Mary Evans. He {{attended}} school in Jamaica Row, where he enjoyed mathematics but wished he had learned Latin. As a 13-year-old he began work as a [...] "reading boy" [...] at the printing house of Samuel Bentley in London in 1839. However, he was reassigned as a general errand boy because his stutter interfered with his duties. The hours were long—from seven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> nine or ten at night—but the printmaking process itself, and the books produced by the establishment, fascinated Evans. Bentley soon realized the boy was talented after seeing his early attempts at scratching illustrations on slate, and arranged for Evans to begin an apprenticeship with wood-engraver Ebenezer Landells.|$|E

After two weeks, the knee injury he suffered when he ejected had worsened, and he was taken to a hospital where the infection was drained. After a two-day respite while he recuperated, [...] "the wall" [...] torture continued for two more months. Coker called this [...] "probably my worst experience in Vietnam".|$|E
500|$|From 1904 until 1967, when {{television}} finally {{killed them}} off, newsreels preceded films. In the early sound-film era, they lasted around eight minutes and featured highlights and clips of the world's biggest stories. Updated {{twice a week}} by the five major studios, they became a highly profitable enterprise: in 1933, newsreels had a total box office take of almost $19.5 million against an outlay of under $10 million. The sound-film era created the narrator; among the first was Graham McNamee, who provided voiceover during the clips, often delivering hackneyed jokes while delineating the on-screen action. Sound newsreel interviews and monologues featured famous subjects unaccustomed to the new medium. These clips changed public perception of important historical figures depending on their elocution, {{the sound of their}} previously unheard voices, and their composure in front of the camera. Around 12 [...] "newsreel theaters" [...] were soon created around the United States, the most successful being the Embassy Newsreel Theater on Broadway. The Embassy was a 578-seat facility that presented fourteen 45–50 minute programs a day, running from 10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> midnight. It was noted for its discerning, intellectual audience, many of whom did not attend motion-picture theaters.|$|E
500|$|Massenet was a {{prolific}} composer; he put this {{down to his}} way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 {{and was one of}} the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: [...] "M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success." ...|$|E
50|$|Galgalatz {{broadcasting}} {{began on}} October 31, 1993, at 7:00 a.m., {{in a show}} called Medina BaDerech (מדינה בדרך, Nation on the Road) with Amir Asher. The station broadcast for 17 hours a day, beginning at 7 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and <b>until</b> midnight. From day one the programs included mostly music and traffic reports. The musical guidelines were to prefer popular songs, known and favored {{by the majority of}} listeners, in an attempt to target the largest possible audience.|$|R

At many stations, a live readerboard shows the destination and time-to-arrival of the next several trains, using data gathered by a vehicle tracking system.|$|E
2500|$|On 28 April 1828, a major {{improvement}} in public transportation arrived; the first omnibus began service, running every fifteen minutes between La Madeleine and la Bastille. [...] Before long, there were one hundred omnibuses in service, [...] with eighteen different itineraries. [...] A journey cost twenty-five centimes. [...] The omnibuses circulated between {{seven in the}} morning and seven in the evening; each omnibus could carry between twelve and eighteen passengers. [...] The busiest line was that along the Grand Boulevards; [...] it ran from eight <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> midnight.|$|E
50|$|The band {{recorded}} the album at Liverpool's Parr Street Studios with co-producer Richard Turvey <b>in</b> 2015. <b>The</b> band took a disciplined approach to recording, {{in which they}} would arrive at <b>the</b> studio <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> work <b>until</b> 10 pm and then go home. Most of the album was recorded live, with overdubs kept to a minimum and the first take (of usually three) often being <b>the</b> chosen one. <b>In</b> total, recording took approximately three weeks, followed a lengthier process of piecing the tracks together.|$|R

The Guard fought magnificently and deserve every praise. The Amhara troops also did their best. Our troops, even though they are not adapted for fighting of the European type, were able to bear comparison throughout the day with the Italian troops." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cambridge {{remained}} on this station for several years. In January 1759 Sir John was reinforced with a fleet dispatched from England {{under the command}} of Commodore Robert Hughes, consisting of eight two-deckers, a frigate and four bomb ketches. They were also transporting a number of troops {{under the command of}} General Peregrine Hopson. They were instructed to make attacks on French settlements in the West Indies. [...] The first of these was a British expedition against Guadeloupe, for which Moore transferred his flag to HMS Woolwich. Cambridge, in company with HMS Norfolk and HMS St George, were ordered to attack the main citadel. The resulting attack lasted from nine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> <b>until</b> four in the afternoon, and succeeded in silencing the defences. After this success Commodore Hughes returned to Britain in June, taking Burnet and the Cambridge with him.|$|E
