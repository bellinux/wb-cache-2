500|$|I think I should {{rephrase}} {{myself from}} my previous letters when I {{was talking about}} taking a 'break'. What I meant was <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> a break from being told what to do. ... It's cool {{when you look at}} someone and don't know whether they are at work or play since it's all the same to them. The things I've been doing for work lately have been so much fun, because it's not like work to me anymore. I've been even more 'hands on' in my management and the business side of things, and I feel more in control than ever.|$|E
2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France. [...] On March 1, 1918, {{five days before}} he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: [...] "I do not {{want you to think}} for a moment that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> this thing entirely light-mindedly. [...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. [...] If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referring to that, in July 2011, Townshend wrote at his blog: [...] "My {{hearing is}} {{actually}} {{better than ever}} because after a feedback scare at the indigO2 in December 2008 <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> good care of it. I have computer systems in my studio that have helped me do my engineering work on the forthcoming Quadrophenia release. I have had assistance from younger forensic engineers and mastering engineers to help me clean up the high frequencies {{that are out of}} my range. The same computer systems work wonderfully well on stage, proving to be perfect for me when the Who performed at the Super Bowl and doing Quadrophenia for TCT at the Royal Albert Hall in 2010. I'm 66, I don't have perfect hearing, and if I listen to loud music or go to gigs I do tend to get tinnitus." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gandhi's {{advocacy}} for women's rights began with her help {{in establishing the}} Congress Party's Women's Section. In 1956, she wrote in a letter: [...] "It is because of this that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> a much more active part in politics. I {{have to do a}} great deal of touring in order to set up the Congress Party Women's Section, and am on numerous important committees." [...] Gandhi {{spent a great deal of}} time throughout the 1950s helping organize women. She wrote to Norman in 1959, irritable that women had organized around the communist cause but had not mobilized for the Indian cause: [...] "The women, whom I have been trying to organize for years, had always refused to come into politics. Now they are out in the field." [...] Once appointed president in 1959, she [...] "travelled relentlessly, visiting remote parts of the country that had never before received a VIP...she talked to women, asked about child health and welfare, inquired after the crafts of the region" [...] Gandhi's actions throughout her ascent to power clearly reflect a desire to mobilize women. Gandhi did not see the purpose of feminism. Gandhi saw her own success as a woman, and also noted that [...] "Given the opportunity to develop, capable Indian women have come to the top at once." ...|$|E

60|$|PRIEST This? {{this is a}} cloak picked up. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> it home, I tell you.|$|E
60|$|I {{handed over}} the money without a word. Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> {{advantage}} of the man's present state, but <b>I</b> considered <b>I</b> <b>was</b> doing things for the best.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have you and Lady Glyde {{been out}} this evening?" [...] asked the Count, while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> {{a book from}} the shelves to {{preserve}} appearances.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} {{difficult}} to answer. For one thing, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> beginning to feel that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>taking</b> life too easily in England, It's a habit that grows on one." ...|$|R
60|$|HECTOR. I {{have taken}} care. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> care. I'm {{taking care of}} my honor and my {{position}} in English society.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is twenty dollars. I reckon {{that will}} prove that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> an {{interest}} in you." [...] And the bright, crisp bill was handed over.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Only six! What {{an endless}} day! There, I am ready. There is no use in delaying. I suppose I must show what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> with me.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If it were money--a {{question}} of monetary recompense--the secret service purse {{of my country}} opens easily, and it is well filled. If it were anything less simple, the proposal could but be made. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> the thing, you understand, at your own computation of its worth! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>taking</b> {{it for granted that}} it carries with it the power you claim for it. Assuming these things, I am prepared to treat with you. I am going on leave very shortly, and I could myself conduct the negotiations." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have a plan}} in my mind," [...] he said slowly. [...] "Duke, should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>taking</b> a liberty if <b>I</b> {{asked to}} <b>be</b> left alone with this young man for five minutes?" ...|$|R
