500|$|On {{the dawn}} of the final month of campaigning, Barr {{appeared}} on National Public Radio, and discussed his political positions, including those on health care, a topic that had rarely been discussed by Barr {{over the course of his}} campaign. Barr gave his shortest response to the issue, saying that [...] "everybody ought to be able to <b>get</b> <b>health</b> <b>care,</b> but that's up to them..." [...] and went on to say that [...] "the government could be...reducing and removing the onerous regulations that actually prevent people from being able to afford health care." [...] Close to the end of the campaign, Barr's polling numbers remained stagnant. An Associated Press-GfK poll from late October placed the candidate at 1% nationally, the same figure he had stood at three weeks previously.|$|E

40|$|Around the world, {{as in the}} United States, {{concern is}} growing about who <b>gets</b> <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Individuals from {{different}} socioeconomic backgrounds face distressingly different prospects of living a healthy life. Disparities in various measures of health between the privileged and the deprived still remain wide, despite the long-term tendency toward a healthier society. Some investigators believe the shift in the <b>health</b> <b>care</b> system in industrial countries from the principle of universal access to a more market-oriented system may be one cause of the growing disparities; rising income inequality is another potential culprit. Policy makers worldwide speak of more efficiently delivering essential' <b>health</b> <b>care</b> [...] -but disagree on what counts as essential and on the optimal mix of private and government components of service.

50|$|Access to {{care and}} Rationing are {{important}} dimensions of Health Policy and Management (HPAM) because they address the market force that impacts {{how and when}} people <b>get</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> services. Rationing in health care occurs due to scarcity; everyone cannot have access to every service and treatment because {{it would not be}} an efficient use of resources. Some argue that price should not be the biggest factor in determining who has access to which services and treatments, but rather that healthcare is a right that we should all have access to.|$|E

5000|$|A {{government}} policy that requires equal treatment can pose problems for lawmakers. A requirement {{for government to}} provide equal health care services for all citizens can be prohibitively expensive. If government seeks equality of opportunity for citizens to <b>get</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> by rationing services using a maximization model {{to try to save}} money, new difficulties might emerge. For example, trying to ration health care by maximizing the [...] "quality-adjusted years of life" [...] might steer monies away from disabled persons even though they may be more deserving, according to one analysis. In another instance, BBC News questioned whether it was wise to ask female army recruits to undergo the same strenuous tests as their male counterparts, since many women were being injured as a result.|$|E
