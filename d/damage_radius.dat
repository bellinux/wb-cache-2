40|$|AbstractDamage {{identification}} of a thin disk struck by a penetrating projectile is analyzed. The disk is segmented into annular regions each with different properties. The footprint and <b>damage</b> <b>radii</b> form two of several segments in the discretization. Modal response of the segmented disk is determined by combining transfer matrices of successive annular segments and dynamic impedance of the central segment. Transient response of the intact disk proceeds by modal analysis until damage occurs. Following damage, transient response continues for the segmented disk excluding the damaged zone with initial conditions equal {{to those of the}} final state of the intact disk at the instant of damage. Peak amplitude of the damaged disk is smaller than that of the intact disk. This is caused by cessation of the forcing pulse and sudden stress release along the damaged perimeter.

40|$|International audienceStructural {{modification}} of vitreous SiO 2 by Au ion irradiation is investigated over an energy regime (∼ 0. 3 – 15 MeV) {{in which the}} decrease of the nuclear energy loss with increasing energy is compensated by the increase of the electronic energy loss, leading to a nearly constant total energy loss of ∼ 4 keV/nm. The <b>radii</b> of <b>damaged</b> zones resulting from the ion impact, deduced from changes in infrared bands {{as a function of}} ion fluence, decrease from 4. 9 nm at 0. 3 MeV to 2. 5 and 2. 6 nm at 9. 8 and 14. 8 MeV, respectively. Based on previous data where vitreous SiO 2 was irradiated with much higher energy Au ions, the <b>damage</b> zone <b>radius</b> increases from 2. 4 nm at 22. 7 MeV to 5. 4 nm at 168 MeV, and a U-shaped dependence on energy is observed is observed in the energy region from 0. 3 to 168 MeV.

40|$|The Multilayer Transient Test is a well-testing {{technique}} {{designed to}} determine formation properties in multiple layers, {{and it has been}} proved effective during the past two decades. To apply the Multilayer Transient Test, a combination of rate profiles from production logs and transient rate and pressure measurements are required at multiple surface rates. Therefore, this method can be time consuming and may involve significant errors due to inaccurate transient flow rate measurements. A new testing approach is proposed after realizing the limitations of the Multilayer Transient Test. The new testing approach replaces the transient flow rate measurement with transient temperature measurement by using multiple temperature sensors. This research shows that formation properties can be quantified in multiple layers by analyzing measured transient temperature and pressure data. A single-phase wellbore/reservoir coupled thermal model is developed as the forward model. The forward model is used to simulate the temperature and pressure response along the wellbore during the transient test. With the forward model, this work proves that the transient temperature and pressure are sufficiently sensitive to formation properties and can be used for multilayer reservoir characterization. The inverse model is formulated by incorporating the forward model to solve formation properties using nonlinear least-square regression. For the hypothetical cases, the proposed new multilayer testing method has successfully been applied for investigating formation properties in commingled multilayer reservoirs. Layer permeability, damaged permeability, and <b>damaged</b> <b>radius</b> can be uniquely determined using single-point transient pressure data and multipoint transient temperature data at appropriate locations. Due to the proposed data acquisition scheme, only one surface flow rate change is needed to implement this testing approach, which significantly reduces the test duration compared to the standard multilayer transient testing approach using a series of flow rate changes. Of special interest, this is the first test design that shows promise for determination of the <b>damaged</b> <b>radius,</b> which can be useful for well stimulation design. In addition, temperature resolution, data noise, and data rate impacts have been studied along with a data filtering approach that enable selection of suitable pressure and temperature sensor technologies for applying the new testing method...|$|R

50|$|In February 2011, photos {{began to}} appear of a Chinese weapon called the ZH-05. The ZH-05 {{combines}} the Type 03 assault rifle with a 20 mm airburst grenade launcher. This makes China the third country to develop an airburst infantry weapon, after the American XM29 Objective Individual Combat Weapon and XM25 CDTE, and the South Korean K11 DAW. Unlike foreign airburst weapons, the ZH-05 has a single-shot grenade launcher that requires each round to be manually loaded and reloaded after every firing, while the others are magazine fed; this makes it lightest of all the airburst weapons. The primary weapon {{of the system is}} the 20 mm grenade launcher, with the 5.8 mm rifle for secondary use. Grenades are pre-programmed and loaded into a manually operated bolt-action. Three types of grenade rounds available are impact detonation, airburst, and shotgun-type rounds. The U.S. encountered problems with the lethality of small 20 mm grenades during OICW development, causing the switch to larger 25 mm grenades for the XM25.

50|$|The U.S. Navy {{has a small}} {{corps of}} Naval Gunfire Liaison Officer trained to provide {{observation}} and correction of naval gunfire in support of Army and Marine Corps ground units during amphibious and coastal operations. As early as 1921 the United States Marine Corps identified Naval Gunfire {{as one of the}} six key elements for amphibious operations. The trajectory of high velocity naval artillery was significantly different from field artillery howitzers typically used for gunfire support. Infantry officers were surprised by the inability of flat trajectory naval guns to hit targets behind low hills; and the relatively wide distribution of fall of shot along the axis of fire sometimes endangered friendly troops behind or in front of the target. Shells intended to penetrate armored ships produced a relatively small <b>damage</b> <b>radius</b> against unfortified targets; and shipboard observation devices designed to observe shell splashes at sea were unable to determine whether their shells were striking intended shore targets. Although Marine Corps officers who have served aboard warships are more familiar with naval artillery, Army officers without such experience are often in positions requiring gunfire support during amphibious landings. Naval officers familiar with shipboard guns are able to advise infantry officers ashore concerning the capabilities of naval artillery to engage specific targets. The naval officer's familiarity with shipboard communications systems enables him to translate the infantry objectives and fall of shot observations to the appropriate shipboard personnel for effective engagement of targets. The tentative manual of 1934 became Fleet Training Publication 167 in 1938; and the Army issued a field manual with virtually identical text in 1941 The use of Naval Gunfire Support reached its peak during WWII with the numerous amphibious landings, to include a small number who completed the Army's elite Airborne School and parachuted into Normandy to provide gun fire support for paratroopers during the D-Day landings.|$|E

Because in- service aircrafts routinely experience impact damage during maintenance due to ground vehicle collision, dropped equipment, or {{foreign object damage}} (FOD) impact, {{it is necessary to}} understand their impact characteristics, particularly when blunt impact sources create internal damage with little or no external visibility. The objective of this investigation is to explore damage formation in lightweight composite sandwich panels due to low-velocity impacts of variable tip radius and energy level. The correlation between barely visible external dent formation and internal core damage was explored as a function of impact tip radius. A pendulum impactor was used to impact composite sandwich panels having honeycomb core while held in a 165 mm square window fixture. The panels were impacted by hardened steel tips with radii of 12. 7, 25. 4, 50. 8, and 76. 2 mm at energy levels ranging from 2 to 14 J.
