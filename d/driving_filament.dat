40|$|Magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) {{simulations}} {{of the emergence}} of twisted magnetic flux tubes from the solar interior into the corona are discussed to illustrate how twisted and sheared coronal magnetic structures (with free magnetic energy), capable of <b>driving</b> <b>filament</b> eruptions, can form in the corona in emerging active regions. Several basic mechanisms that can disrupt the quasi-equilibrium coronal structures and trigger the release of the stored free magnetic energy are discussed. These include both ideal processes such as the onset of the helical kink instability and the torus instability of a twisted coronal flux rope structure and the non-ideal process of the onset of fast magnetic reconnections in current sheets. Representative MHD {{simulations of}} the non-linear evolution involving these mechanisms are presented.

40|$|Myosin II {{filament}} {{assembly in}} Dictyostelium discoideum is regulated via phosphorylation of residues {{located in the}} carboxyl-terminal portion of the myosin II heavy chain (MHC) tail. A series of novel protein kinases in this system are capable of phosphorylating these residues in vitro, <b>driving</b> <b>filament</b> disassembly. Previous {{studies have demonstrated that}} at least three of these kinases (MHCK A, MHCK B, and MHCK C) display differential localization patterns in living cells. We have created a collection of single, double, and triple gene knockout cell lines for this family of kinases. Analysis of these lines reveals that three MHC kinases appear to represent the majority of cellular activity capable of driving myosin II filament disassembly, and reveals that cytokinesis defects increase with the number of kinases disrupted. Using biochemical fractionation of cytoskeletons and in vivo measurements via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), we find that myosin II overassembly increases incrementally in the mutants, with the MHCK A � /B � /C � triple mutant showing severe myosin II overassembly. These studies suggest that the full complement of MHC kinases that significantly contribute to growth phase and cytokinesis myosin II disassembly in this organism has now been identified...|$|E
40|$|Additive manufacturing, more {{specifically}} 3 D printing using fused filament fabrication (FFF), {{is a valuable}} technique; however, little {{has been done in}} developing a new mechanism for <b>driving</b> <b>filament</b> through the hot end of the 3 D printer. This investigation focuses on a prototype extruder mechanism that utilizes two counter rotating motors to force filament through the nozzle. The plastic passes through the armateurs of the two motors and the oppositely-threaded shafts drive the filament while balancing each others torque. This design provides better protection against jamming of the nozzle. A bench top prototype was able to extrude filament at a rate much greater than traditional mechanisms allow, but the threads on the aluminum shafts wore down with very little use. An abrasive wear model of the extruder shafts was developed {{in order to determine the}} theoretical lifetime of the shafts given a certain material hardness. The wear rate of the shafts is proportional to the hardness of the material and the square of the velocity of the extruded filament. Based on this model as well as experiments done with various materials, it is estimated that steel shafts will have a lifetime that is 3 to 10 times longer than aluminum shafts. Still, this lifetime is still far too short for a part meant to be used 24 / 7. The wear on the threads of the shafts is so severe that no feasible material could survive an adequate lifetime before failure. by Joseph Sandoval. Thesis: S.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a system of unusual HI filaments which appear to be associated with molecular clouds in the Perseus spiral arm of our Galaxy. We investigate the hypothesis that this system {{is the result of a}} directed flow of dissociated gas from clouds trapped within an extended wind flow from massive stars. The Wolf-Rayet star WR 5 and the OIb(f) star HD 17603 are identified as candidate driving sources. However, an examination of this hypothesis within the context of the theory of mass-loaded winds shows that these two stars alone cannot account for the energetics and kinematics of the required spherically symmetric wind flow. Unless the apparent association between HI, molecular gas, and stars is an accidental one, we suggest that other as-yet unidentified stars must have contributed to <b>driving</b> the <b>filaments.</b> Comment: 26 pages + 5 figures, accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|R

40|$|Resistive {{switching}} devices, {{also called}} memristors, have {{attracted much attention}} due to their potential memory, logic and even neuromorphic applications. Multiple physical mechanisms underpin the non-volatile switching process and are ultimately believed to give rise to the formation and dissolution of a discrete conductive filament within the active layer. However, a detailed nanoscopic analysis that fully explains all the contributory events remains to be presented. Here, we present aspects of the switching events that are correlated back to tunable details of the device fabrication process. Transmission electron microscopy and atomically resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) studies of electrically stressed devices will then be presented, {{with a view to}} understanding the <b>driving</b> forces behind <b>filament</b> formation and dissolution...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{migration}} is initiated by lamellipodia-membrane-enclosed sheets of cytoplasm containing densely packed actin filament networks. Although the molecular details of network turnover remain obscure, recent work points towards key roles in filament nucleation for Arp 2 / 3 complex and its activator WAVE complex. Here, we combine fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of different lamellipodial components {{with a new}} method of data analysis {{to shed light on}} the dynamics of actin assembly/disassembly. We show that Arp 2 / 3 complex is incorporated into the network exclusively at the lamellipodium tip, like actin, at sites coincident with WAVE complex accumulation. Capping protein likewise showed a turnover similar to actin and Arp 2 / 3 complex, but was confined to the tip. In contrast, cortactin-another prominent Arp 2 / 3 complex regulator-and ADF/cofilin-previously implicated in <b>driving</b> both <b>filament</b> nucleation and disassembly-were rapidly exchanged throughout the lamellipodium. These results suggest that Arp 2 / 3 - and WAVE complex-driven actin filament nucleation at the lamellipodium tip is uncoupled from the activities of both cortactin and cofilin. Network turnover is additionally regulated by the spatially segregated activities of capping protein at the tip and cofilin throughout the mesh...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria swim by {{rotating}} long thin helical filaments, each driven {{at its base}} by a reversible rotary motor. When the motors of peritrichous cells turn counterclockwise (CCW), their filaments form bundles that drive the cells forward. We imaged fluorescently labeled cells of Escherichia coli with a high-speed charge-coupled-device camera (500 frames/s) and measured swimming speeds, rotation rates of cell bodies, and rotation rates of flagellar bundles. Using cells stuck to glass, we studied individual filaments, stopping their rotation by exposing the cells to high-intensity light. From these measurements we calculated approximate values for bundle torque and thrust and body torque and drag, and we estimated the filament stiffness. For both immobilized and swimming cells, the motor torque, as estimated using resistive force theory, was {{significantly lower than the}} motor torque reported previously. Also, a bundle of several flagella produced little more torque than a single flagellum produced. Motors <b>driving</b> individual <b>filaments</b> frequently changed directions of rotation. Usually, but not always, this led to a change in the handedness of the filament, which went through a sequence of polymorphic transformations, from normal to semicoiled to curly 1 and then, when the motor again spun CCW, back to normal. Motor reversals were necessary, although not always sufficient, to cause changes in filament chirality. Polymorphic transformations among helices having the same handedness occurred without changes in the sign of the applied torque...|$|R
40|$|F 1 -ATPase hydrolyzes ATP into ADP and Pi and {{converts}} {{chemical energy}} into mechanical rotation with exceptionally high efficiency. This energy-transducing molecular motor increasingly attracts interest for its unique cellular functions and promising application in nanobiotechnology. To {{better understand the}} chemomechanics of rotation and loading dynamics of F 1 -ATPase, we propose a computational model based on enzyme kinetics and Langevin dynamics. We show that the torsional energy and stepwise rotation can be regulated {{by a series of}} near-equilibrium reactions when nucleotides bind or unbind, as well as characterized by an effective 'ratchet' drag coefficient and a fitting chemomechanic coefficient. For the case of <b>driving</b> an actin <b>filament,</b> the theoretical load-rotation profile is analyzed and comparison with experimental data indicates reasonable agreement.

40|$|We use a {{suite of}} cooling halo {{simulations}} to study a new mechanism for rapid accretion of hot halo gas on to star-forming galaxies. Correlated supernova (SN) events create converging ‘superbubbles' in the halo gas. Where these collide, the density increases, <b>driving</b> cooling <b>filaments</b> of low-metallicity gas that feed the disc. At our current numerical resolution (∼ 20 pc; mgas = 4 × 104 [*]M⊙) we are only able to resolve the most dramatic events; however, as we increase the numerical resolution, {{we find that the}} filaments persist for longer, driving continued late-time star formation. This suggests that SN-driven accretion could act as an efficient mechanism for extracting cold gas from the hot halo, driving late-time star formation in disc galaxies. We show that such filament feeding leads to a peak star formation rate of ∼ 3 [*]M⊙[*]yr− 1, consistent with estimates for the Milky Way (MW). The filaments we resolve extend to ∼ 50 [*]kpc, reaching column densities of N ∼ 1018 cm− 2. We show that such structures can plausibly explain the broad dispersion in Mgii absorption seen along sightlines to quasars. Our results suggest a dual role for stellar feedback in galaxy formation, suppressing hot-mode accretion while promoting cold-mode accretion along filaments. Finally, since the filamentary gas has higher angular momentum than that coming from hot-mode accretion, we show that this leads to the formation of substantially larger gas disc...|$|R
40|$|Non-muscle myosin II {{role has}} {{been implicated in}} the {{extension}} of lamellipodia, a critical step in the initiation of directed cell migration, invasion and other cellular processes, but the mechanistic details are limited to <b>driving</b> retrograde actin <b>filaments.</b> The present study reveals distinct localization of myosin IIA and IIB with an unexpected opposite mechanical roles in mediating lamellipodia extension during spreading. Attachment of cells to matrix is impaired {{in the absence of}} either isoforms, but differential regulation of focal contacts formation occurs in myosin IIA^-^; and IIB^-^; cells. Spreading cells expressing both isoforms display an organized actin network consisting of retrograde filaments, arcs and central filaments.

40|$|Current {{theories}} of muscle contraction {{propose that the}} power stroke of a myosin motor is the sole source of mechanical energy <b>driving</b> the sliding <b>filaments</b> of a contracting muscle. These models exclude titin, the largest protein in the human body, which determines the passive elasticity of muscles. Here, we show that stepwise unfolding/folding of titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domains occurs in the elastic I band region of intact myofibrils at physiological sarcomere lengths and forces of 6 – 8 pN. We use single-molecule techniques to demonstrate that unfolded titin Ig domains undergo a spontaneous stepwise folding contraction at forces below 10 pN, delivering up to 105 zJ of additional contractile energy, which {{is larger than the}} mechanical energy delivered by the power stroke of a myosin motor. Thus, it appears inescapable that folding of titin Ig domains is an important, but as yet unrecognized, contributor to the force generated by a contracting muscle...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{self-assembly}} {{of genetically engineered}} protein-based triblock copolymers consisting of a central pH-responsive silk-like middle block (SHn, where SH is a silk-like octapeptide, (GA) 3 GH and n {{is the number of}} repeats) flanked by hydrophilic random coil outer blocks (C 2). Our previous work has already shown that triblocks with very long midblocks (n = 48) self-assemble into long, stiff protein filaments at pH values where the middle blocks are uncharged. Here we investigate the self-assembly behavior of the triblock copolymers for a range of midblock lengths, n = 8, 16, 24, 48. Upon charge neutralization of SHn by adjusting the pH, we find that C 2 SH 8 C 2 and C 2 SH 16 C 2 form spherical micelles, whereas both C 2 SH 24 C 2 and C 2 SH 48 C 2 form protein filaments with a characteristic beta-roll secondary structure of the silk midblocks. Hydrogels formed by C 2 SH 48 C 2 are much stronger and form much faster than those formed by C 2 SH 24 C 2. Enzymatic digestion of much of the hydrophilic outer blocks is used to show that with much of the hydrophilic outer blocks removed, all silk-midblocks are capable of self-assembling into stiff protein filaments. In that case, reduction of the steric repulsion by the hydrophilic outer blocks also leads to extensive fiber bundling. Our results highlight the opposing roles of the hydrophilic outer blocks and central silk-like midblocks in <b>driving</b> protein <b>filament</b> formation. They provide crucial information for future designs of triblock protein-based polymers that form stiff filaments with controlled bundling, that could mimick properties of collagen in the extracellular matrix...|$|R

We show that such filament feeding leads to a peak star formation rate (SFR) of ∼ 3 M_ sun yr^- 1, consistent with estimates for the Milky Way. By contrast, direct cooling from the hot halo ('hot-mode' accretion, not present in the simulations that show filament feeding) falls short of the SNe-driven SFR by a factor of 3 - 4, and is sustained over a shorter time period. The filaments we resolve extend to ∼ 50 kpc, reaching column densities of ∼ 10 ^ 18 cm^- 2. We show that such structures can plausibly explain the broad dispersion in Mg II absorption seen along sight lines to quasars. Our results suggest a dual role for stellar feedback in galaxy formation, suppressing hot-mode accretion while promoting cold-mode accretion along filaments. This ultimately leads to more star formation, suggesting that the positive feedback effect outweighs the negative. Finally, since the filamentary gas has higher angular momentum than that coming from hot-mode accretion, we show that this leads to the formation of substantially larger gas discs.

40|$|Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is the {{phenomenon}} of non-radiative transfer of electronic excitations from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor, mediated by electronic dipole-dipole coupling. The transfer rate and, as a consequence, efficiency depend non-linearly on {{the distance between the}} donor and the acceptor. FRET efficiency can thus be used as an effective and accurate reporter of distance between two fluorophores and changes thereof. Over the last 50 years or so, FRET {{has been used as a}} spectroscopic ruler to measure conformations and conformational changes of biomolecules. More recently, FRET has been combined with microscopy, ultimately allowing measurement of FRET between a single donor and a single acceptor pair. In this review, we will explain the physical foundations of FRET and how FRET can be applied to biomolecules.
