5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent <b>in</b> <b>Quebec,</b> a province in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats <b>in</b> <b>Quebec,</b> it could attain a majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E

5|$|The {{technology}} utilized on Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie grid {{also came}} under fire from critics. It is claimed that this technology, used to improve performance, safety, and reliability, made people <b>in</b> <b>Quebec</b> over-dependent on the power grid for their energy needs, since electricity, especially hydroelectric power, makes up over 40% of Quebec's energy supply. This dependence, evidenced by the fact Ontario farmers had more backup generators than farmers <b>in</b> <b>Quebec,</b> can increase {{the severity of the}} consequences when the grid fails, as it did in January 1998.|$|E

40|$|Using {{a variant}} of the Blinder-Oaxaca {{decomposition}} method, I find that outside <b>Quebec,</b> <b>in</b> both public and private sectors, the wage premium enjoyed by anglophones between 1970 and 2000 can be fully explained by a higher relative demand for English skills. However, I find that <b>in</b> <b>Quebec's</b> public sector between 1970 and 2000, francophones enjoyed a wage premium that may have reflected more than a higher relative demand for French skills, opening the possibility of discrimination as a factor. Such a premium also seems to have been present <b>in</b> <b>Quebec's</b> private sector <b>in</b> 2000.
