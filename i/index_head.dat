40|$|Main memory {{index is}} built with the {{assumption}} that the RAM is suﬃciently large to hold data. Due to the volatility and high unit price of main memory, indices under secondary memory such as SSD and HDD are widely used. However, the I/O operation with main memory is still the bottleneck for query eﬃciency. In this paper, we propose a self-tuning indexing scheme called Tide-tree for RAM/Disk-based hybrid storage system. Tide-tree aims to overcome the obstacles main memory and disk-based indices face, and per- forms like the tide to achieve a double-win in space and performance, which is self-adaptive with respect to the running environment. Particularly, Tide- tree delaminates the tree structure adaptively with high eﬃciency based on storage sense, and applies an eﬀective self-tuning algorithm to dynamically load various nodes into main memory. We employ memory mapping technol- ogy to solve the persistent problem of main memory index, and improves the eﬃciency of data synchronism and pointer translation. To further enhance the independence of Tide-tree, we employ the <b>index</b> <b>head</b> and the level address ta- ble to manage the whole index. With the <b>index</b> <b>head,</b> three eﬃcient operations are proposed, namely index rebuild, index load and range search. We have conducted extensive experiments to compare the Tide-tree with several state- of-the-art indices, and the results have validated the high eﬃciency, reusability and stability of Tide-tree...|$|E

50|$|CNC <b>indexing</b> <b>heads</b> may be {{controlled}} {{in two different}} modes. The most basic method of operation uses simple control functions built into the dividing head. It {{does not require a}} CNC machine. The operator enters the desired angle into a control box attached to the <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> and it automatically rotates to the desired position and locks into place for machining. Changing angles is as simple as typing a new angle value onto the control pad. This is simpler than setting up a manual <b>indexing</b> <b>head</b> because {{there is no need to}} interchange indexing plates or to calculate which hole positions to use. It is also faster for repetitive operations because the work can be indexed by simply pressing a button, eliminating the need to count rotations of the hand crank or specific hole positions on the indexing plate. A CNC dividing head may be used in this manner on either manual or CNC machinery.|$|R
50|$|An <b>indexing</b> <b>head,</b> {{also known}} as a {{dividing}} head or spiral head, is a specialized tool that allows a workpiece to be circularly indexed; that is, easily and precisely rotated to preset angles or circular divisions. <b>Indexing</b> <b>heads</b> are usually used on the tables of milling machines, but may be used on many other machine tools including drill presses, grinders, and boring machines. Common jobs for a dividing head include machining the flutes of a milling cutter, cutting the teeth of a gear, milling curved slots, or drilling a bolt hole circle around the circumference of a part.|$|R

We investigated how impaired motor impairment and proprioceptive input due to neuropathy influences postural strategies. Platformless bisegmental posturography data were recorded in healthy subjects and patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP). Each subject stood on the floor, wore a head and a hip electromagnetic tracker. Sway amplitude and velocity were recorded and the mean direction difference (MDD) in the velocity vector between trackers was calculated as a flexibility <b>index.</b> <b>Head</b> and hip postural sway increased more in patients with CIDP than in healthy controls. MDD values reflecting hip strategies also increased more in patients than in controls. In the eyes closed condition MDD values in healthy subjects decreased but in patients remained unchanged.

Most studies showed strengths such as sample size, exclusion of the use of growth hormone and androgen, and analysis of confounding variables. However, the growth curves were restricted to height, lack of information about selection bias, limited distributional properties, and smoothing aspects.

40|$|We {{describe}} a programme {{for the prevention}} of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV that provided universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) to all pregnant women regardless of the CD 4 lymphocyte count and formula feeding for children with high risk of HIV transmission through breastfeeding in a district of India. The overall rate of HIV transmission was 3. 7 %. Although breastfeeding added a 3. 1 % additional risk of HIV acquisition, formula-fed infants had significantly higher risk of death compared to breastfed infants. The cumulative 12 -month mortality was 9. 6 % for formula-fed infants versus 0. 68 % for breastfed infants. Anthropometric markers (weight, length/height, weight for length/height, body mass <b>index,</b> <b>head</b> circumference, mid-upper arm circumference, triceps skinfold, and subscapular skinfold) showed that formula-fed infants experience severe malnutrition during the first two months of life. We did not observe any death after rapid weaning at 5 - 6 months in breastfed infants. The higher-free-of HIV survival in breastfed infants and the low rate of HIV transmission found in this study support the implementation of PMTCT programmes with universal ART to all HIV-infected pregnant women and breastfeeding in order to reduce HIV transmission without increasing infant mortality in developing countries...|$|E
50|$|Non-IT-assisted {{physical}} guidance was {{the first}} means of providing indexing capability, via purely mechanical means. It allowed the Industrial Revolution to progress into the Machine Age.

Eighty-five children with intrauterine growth retardation were followed up prospectively to 3 years of age, using biometric parameters, perinatal risk questionnaires, and neurodevelopmental evaluations. Forty-two children served as controls. A significant difference in neurodevelopmental score at 3 years of age was noted between the intrauterine growth retardation and control groups (P <. 001). In the intrauterine growth retardation group, the clinical parameters that most significantly correlated with outcome were cephalization <b>index</b> (<b>head</b> circumference:birthweight ratio), neona-tal risk score, and birthweight. The best predictor of 3 -year outcome was the cephalization index (P <. 01).
