25|$|In {{terms of}} cause and effect, however, {{availability}} and remuneration were effects only. The real distinction between amateur and professional, encapsulated by the Gentlemen v Players fixture which was first arranged by Lord Frederick Beauclerk in 1806 and played annually from 1829 to 1962, was social status within the English class structure. Amateurs (the Gentlemen) belonged to the upper and middle classes; professionals (the Players) invariably came from the working class. It was perceived that the amateur held a higher station in life and was therefore a class apart from the professional. The outlook of the two classes contrasted in {{that most of the}} amateurs played primarily for enjoyment, while most of the professionals took the game, as their living, very seriously indeed. Of underlying importance to the concept of amateurism were the schools, universities and other centres of education in which cricket was played, both as a curricular and <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activity.</b> The public schools (e.g., Eton, Harrow, Winchester) and the main universities (i.e., Oxford and Cambridge) produced most of the first-class amateur players and standards of amateur cricket rose during the 19th century through rivalry between the schools and then at university.|$|E

She works as a {{hospital}} nurse and is often portrayed as dutiful, protective, and comedic. She loves her family and does everything to care for and protect them. She appears out of her element when she isn't nurturing them, especially Nikki, but as the series progresses, she begins to feel assured that her youngest children are in good hands and trusts that her husband and three elder children can look after Nikki and Bobby. She is notoriously conceited and enjoys bragging about her accomplishments, be they admirable, real, or otherwise. Himani used to work on the local news team and was also a poet in her high-school days. A running gag on the show is that she was involved in virtually every <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activity</b> at Arya College of Arts and Science, but still earned a nursing degree. She lets special opportunities go to her head, such as being on TV or singing in front of a group.

Himani seldom accepts her children's misbehavior. It is revealed in the third special that she is pregnant again with her fifth child.

The addition of this section to the state education code {{was a part of}} the state's efforts toward educational reform. The perceived rationale implied in House Bill 72 is that <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> can inspire student motivation and increase student achievement. The No Pass-No Play Rule seems to imply that there is a relationship between student achievement and <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities,</b> and further implies that a student can be motivated to achieve by the desire to continue to participate in <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities.</b> The problem of this study was a comparison of academic achievement for high school pupils involved in <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> and those who did not participate in <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> under the Texas No Pass-No Play Rule. The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> on the academic achievement of high school students, specifically looking at the years 1983 through 1986, when the No Pass-No Play Rule was implemented. This study was an ex post facto study with data obtained from a cooperating Texas school district.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to the history and practice of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> in mathematics in Russia. It investigates both the views expressed by mathematics educators concerning the aims and objectives of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities,</b> and the daily organization of such activities, including the pedagogical formats and the mathematical assignments and questions to which <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> have given rise. Thus the dissertation provides an overview of the history of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> {{over the course of a}} century, as part of the general development of education (including mathematics education) in Russia. The study called for a multifaceted investigation of surviving sources, which include practically all available textbooks and teaching manuals, scholarly articles on conducting <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities,</b> magazine and newspaper articles on conducting <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities,</b> surviving memoirs of participants and organizers of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities,</b> and much else, including methodological materials preserved in archives, which have been located by the author. Summing up the results of the study, it may be said that two major goals have always been important in <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> in Russia: the first goal is motivating students; the second goal is preparing the mathematically strongest students and providing them with an opportunity to deepen and enrich their mathematical education. Of course, <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> have not been aimed exclusively at these two goals, and at different stages of development additional goals (such as ideological preparation) were also formulated. Broadly speaking, it may be said that the history of the Russian system of mathematical <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> in general has been strongly aligned with the history of the development of the system of Russian school education. The study analyzes the specific character of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> at each of the historical stages of Russia's development, in particular, it lists and described the basic forms of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities,</b> paying special attention to the indissoluble connection between the so-called mass-scale forms, in which millions of schoolchildren participate, and forms and activities that are engaged in only by a very few. Also provided is a survey of the changes that have occurred in the mathematical problems that are offered to students. The author believes that familiarity with the longstanding tradition of <b>extracurricular</b> <b>activities</b> in mathematics in Russia may be useful also to the international sphere of mathematics educators, since the issue of motivating students is becoming increasingly important.
