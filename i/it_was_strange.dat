He came close to becoming the challenger {{in all of the}} three big titles this year. He defended the NEC Cup and won the 34th Hayago Championship along with the Oza. Another tiring year for Cho, ending with 47 wins and 20 losses.|$|E
25|$|Laurence Hyde {{had some}} {{learning}} and {{a share of}} his father's literary genius. The main employment of his old age was the preparation for the press of his father's History of the Rebellion, to which he wrote a preface in which he expounded his Tory philosophy. The work was dedicated to his niece Queen Anne: the Queen, whose poor eyesight made reading something of an ordeal, was not especially pleased, particularly since the preface {{could be interpreted as}} an attack on her own policies. She remarked drily that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that a man who did not lack sense in other ways should be made ridiculous by his vanity.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the episode}} was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} {{in the first half of}} the series, many of the reviewers mentioned that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that Amy and Rory did not comment upon what had happened previously, such as what had happened to their child.

Sham and Secretariat were ridden by the same jockeys as in the Derby, Laffit Pincay, Jr. and Ron Turcotte, respectively. Sham was believed {{to have the best}} chance of beating Secretariat. Aside from Sham and Secretariat, Our Native was selected by Joe Nichols, a writer for The New York Times, as an outside contender for victory. In pre-race interviews, Deadly Dream's trainer Buddy Delp believed he could challenge for third place as he had no [...] "illusions about beating Secretariat and Sham." ...|$|E

500|$|In February 2011, Virgin/EMI label {{executives}} asked European {{radio stations}} to remove [...] "Who's That Chick?"

Due to how Rihanna's Loud was released {{at the same time}} as Guetta's album, label executives asked radio stations to favor her work instead. In an interview for the Daily Star, Guetta addressed the song being removed from European radio stations playlists, saying [...] "My record label sent letters to all the radio stations asking them to stop playing Who's That Chick as Rihanna's album was out at the same time. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> because normally record labels ask radio stations to play your music." ...|$|E

The Reverend Al Sharpton received a standing ovation with cheers when he told Jackson's children: [...] "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> what your daddy had to deal with.

[...] Jackson's 11-year-old daughter Paris Katherine, speaking publicly for the first time, wept as she told the crowd: [...] "Ever since I was born, Daddy {{has been the best}} father you could ever imagine ...

500|$|During the {{development}} of the series' pilot chapter, Rurouni, Meiji Swordsman Romantic Story, Watsuki and his editor argued over Kenshin's speech patterns, settling for a [...] "slangy" [...] one. For {{the final version of the}} first Romantic Story, Watsuki adjusted the dialogue; in his view, he made Kenshin sound [...] "more as I prefer him now". Nevertheless, Kenshin was concerned about how Kenshin's manner abruptly changed when facing his opponent. Watsuki added Kenshin's trademark [...] as a placeholder to be an expression of the English speech disfluency [...] "huh". Watsuki notes that he was surprised at how well it caught on, and how much he ended up having Kenshin use the sound during the series. Watsuki also planned to make Kenshin more 30 years old; his editor commented that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that the main character of a manga for teenagers to be of such an age, so he instead made him 28 years old.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series creator Chris Carter. He noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put {{everything}} you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up." [...] He expounded on the idea, saying that executive producer Frank Spotnitz and he decided [...] "it was probably time to go [...] <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> to be writing these things knowing {{it was the last}} time we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things." [...] Spotnitz explained that Carter made the announcement in January so that [...] "we had time to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due."

500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reported}} a 3% approval score {{and an average}} score of 3.4/10 based on 68 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "Speed2 falls far short of its predecessor, thanks to laughable dialogue, thin characterization, unsurprisingly familiar plot devices, and action sequences that fail to generate any excitement." [...] Website Metacritic rated the film [...] "generally unfavorable" [...] based on 22 reviews, with an average score of 23/100. Time said that Patric's character was [...] "fundamentally uninteresting", but blamed De Bont and the screenwriters for [...] "not providing their actors with stuff to act". Many critics stated that a major issue with the film {{was the lack of}} thrills due to the setting on the slow-moving ship. Entertainment Weekly heavily criticized the lack of story and said the film is [...] "as slow-moving as a garbage scow". According to the Los Angeles Times, even children who saw the film felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> that it took place on a ship [...] "not capable of going more than a few knots per hour [...] ", and claimed that Speed was [...] "much more logical".|$|E
500|$|Critics praised Trouble in Paradise new features. Mc Shea (GameSpot) {{thought that}} the sequel's in-game {{challenges}} resolved the core issue of the original game—the lack of motivation to continue breeding new species, whereas the challenges direct players to collect new species. He appreciated the two new trap areas for adding to the game's variety of characters, {{though he did not}} find the actual laying of traps and transport of piñatas interesting. Geddes (IGN) thought that it felt wrong but oddly satisfying to put piñatas in captivity. He considered the trap areas a good idea but unwelcome as another obstacle in the animal acquisition process. Geddes praised Trouble in Paradise cooperative features, but found local cooperative to lose most of the benefits of efficient multitasking. Mc Shea (GameSpot) on the other hand felt that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> to be {{on either side of the}} cooperative gardening experience, which lacks the game's creative element when the visitor is directed by the garden's owner. Bramwell (Eurogamer) saw a lack of depth in the online gameplay, both in feelings of connections with others and in how online matchmaking became a brief [...] "show and tell" [...] of a garden instead of a cross-exchange like in Animal Crossing or Spore. Reviewers agreed that cooperative was useful for introducing new players to the game.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal's first fixture of November {{was at home}} to Charlton Athletic. The team conceded four {{goals in}} 20 minutes and blew several chances to [...] "kill the game", in what was the club's biggest home defeat in the league under Wenger. An away trip to local rivals Tottenham Hostpur became {{magnified}} with interest, given it marked the return of Campbell following his move to Arsenal. An 81st-minute goal scored by Pirès put Arsenal into the lead, before a lapse by Wright in goal allowed Gus Poyet‘s shot to squirm from his grasp and enter the goalnet. Arsenal then faced league champions Manchester United {{and in spite of}} conceding inside 14 minutes through a Paul Scholes’ strike, Ljungberg equalised for them [...] "with a wonderful chipped finish, following Gary Neville's wretched error." [...] Arsenal improved in the second half but scored in unforeseen fashion: United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez passed the ball directly into the feet of Henry, who profited from the error and scored. Five minutes later, Barthez's failure to grasp the ball presented Henry the chance to score his second, which he did. Both Henry and Wenger defended the opposition goalkeeper, with the former, his international teammate saying: [...] "Of course I was happy to score the goals but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange.</b> He's my good friend and I feel sorry for him; I would rather have got them another way." ...|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} ninth season, the {{producers}} decided to drastically change the show. The {{style of the}} opening credits in [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today" [...] were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been {{the same for the}} previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, [...] "The Truth", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up."

500|$|As Public Works Minister, Cushing was {{a primary}} {{advocate}} of government {{intervention in the}} labour disputes plaguing Alberta's coal industry in 1907; Rutherford eventually appointed a commission to examine the problem. [...] Cushing also presided over the government's entry into the telephone business: in 1906, most telephone lines in Alberta were privately owned, and the largest of these private owners was the Bell Telephone Company. [...] Bell controlled all telephone service in Calgary, and refused to extend its operations into less densely populated, and therefore less profitable, regions of the province. [...] In response, Cushing attacked Bell as [...] "the most pernicious and iniquitous monopoly that had ever been foisted upon a people claiming to be free" [...] and sponsored legislation creating Alberta Government Telephones to service areas that Bell would not. [...] This new company later purchased Bell's lines, financing the venture by issuing debentures, {{in contrast to the}} government's usual policy of [...] "pay as you go". [...] Cushing's zeal for government involvement was such that member of the Canadian House of Commons Peter Talbot in 1908 warned Rutherford that his Public Works Minister was [...] "going crazy" [...] with public ownership and that Rutherford would [...] "someday find a lot of trouble through him". [...] Thomas has argued that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange</b> for a successful businessman like Cushing to be so aggressive rhetorically against a successful corporation, but Mount Royal College historian Patricia Roome has suggested that Cushing was soured by his own experience as a Calgarian living under the monopoly, hostile to what he saw as a symbol of [...] "eastern capitalism", and hopeful that bringing telephone service to rural areas would guarantee continued Liberal success.|$|E

500|$|The sudden {{surge in}} {{popularity}} was disorienting to Iyall. [...] "It was frightening: {{we played a}} college in Santa Barbara, and {{there were all these}} blond people crowding the stage, and I thought 'These are the people who hated me in high school!' When you grow up being 'outside' – because I wasn't white, and I was fat, and always a bit of a free thinker – <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>strange.</b> It was like, 'uh-oh, I must be doing something wrong – they like me!'" [...] Highly successful mainstream artists like Ann Wilson and Ric Ocasek were eager to meet the band. Ocasek extended an invitation to collaborate at his Synchro Sound studio in Boston. The recording sessions in Boston resulted in the Never Say Never EP in January 1982. The title track became (arguably) their best-known song and has remained synonymous with the band ever since. The song was also featured in the 1984 romantic teen drama Reckless. Additionally, the success of the single directly led to 415 Records signing a deal with Columbia Records, which elevated the indie label's roster to major-label status. Romeo Void released their second album, entitled Benefactor, in November 1982. The album appeared at No.119 on the Billboard 200. Benefactor was noticeably more commercial sounding than previous endeavors; the music was made more danceable and swearing was removed on the song [...] "Never Say Never". The different approach in the sound resulted in comparisons to Blondie, which Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann suggested was a deliberate attempt by Columbia. Iyall stated that there was more pressure to write sexually laced lyrics for Benefactor: [...] "I do like to be provocative, and I definitely have access to my sexuality, and as a topic I find it ripe, but I wasn't ever going to be a sex-pot diva, so that was kind of odd." [...] She also said there was pressure to produce more singles.|$|E
