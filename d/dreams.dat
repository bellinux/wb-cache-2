5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate <b>dreams</b> only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative <b>dreams</b> instead. Thus Riker <b>dreams</b> of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke <b>dreams</b> of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker <b>dreams</b> of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the <b>dreams</b> to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E

Her <b>dreams</b> had started only a few days after Corder married Moore, and it was suggested that jealousy was the motive for revealing the body's resting place and that the <b>dreams</b> were a simple subterfuge.|$|E

50|$|Throughout each game, {{the players}} find various colored/transparent gems. These are <b>Dream</b> Pieces, gems {{that make up}} the unique <b>Dream</b> Jewels collection. Each <b>Dream</b> Chronicles game has its own {{different}} <b>Dream</b> Jewels collection with different names, shapes and usages. Completion of <b>Dream</b> Jewels is necessary to complete each game in the series. In the original <b>Dream</b> Chronicles, 8 <b>Dream</b> Jewels give a lot of detailed information about fairies and their roles in <b>Dream</b> Realm. In <b>Dream</b> Chronicles 2, 15 <b>Dream</b> Jewels answer and explain many dark secrets about Lilith, Lyra and <b>Dream</b> Realm. While in The Chosen Child, 10 <b>Dream</b> Jewels are used to open new areas. Finally, in The Book of Air, <b>Dream</b> Jewels come with special powers. Overall, finding and completing <b>Dream</b> Jewels also adds to the player's score {{at the end of the}} game. There are numerous <b>Dream</b> Pieces molding some exact numbers of <b>Dream</b> Jewels to complete in each <b>Dream</b> Chronicles game. <b>Dream</b> Jewels collection is a unique element of <b>Dream</b> Chronicles, which differs this series from any other casual games on the market. Though often being credited for borrowing Myst concepts but, in fact, <b>Dream</b> Chronicles is one of the earliest casual game series which has adventure elements combining with hidden object proportions.|$|R

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Nights into <b>Dreams</b> with the working title Air Nights was {{originally}} outlined for the Sega Saturn and subsequently {{developed for the}} Dreamcast with motion control being a central element of gameplay. In an August 1999 interview, Yuji Naka confirmed that a sequel was in development, but by December 2000 the project had been cancelled. Naka expressed reluctance to develop a sequel after the Dreamcast's discontinuation, but later noted in 2003 {{that he would be}} interested in using the licence of Nights into <b>Dreams</b> to reinforce Sega's identity as a video game developer. Discussion concerning a new game in the series had increased in frequency by 2006. Rumours regarding a Wii version continued to appear when a list of upcoming games was published by Japanese developer G.rev, which included an unspecified Nights title. Before the development of Journey of <b>Dreams,</b> Naka confirmed in retrospective interviews that he had intended to base the next Nights game around a unique motion controller.|$|E

5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} <b>dreams</b> of the two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed to the next level. Development of Journey of <b>Dreams</b> began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E
5|$|Development of Burning Rangers started around November 1996, {{after the}} release of Sonic Team's {{previous}} game Christmas Nights (a Christmas-themed demo for Nights into <b>Dreams...).</b> The concept originated with the idea of rescuing people as opposed to killing them, which was an element that producer Yuji Naka felt was too common in contemporary video games. The development team of 31 (out of Sonic Team's staff of about 50) was directed by Naoto Ohshima, the director and lead designer Takao Miyoshi. The rest of the team consisted of three game planners, six programmers, eighteen designers, and two sound producers, most of whom had worked on Nights into <b>Dreams....</b>|$|E
