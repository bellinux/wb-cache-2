5|$|Hays {{died before}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> GTP through to completion. He was eulogized {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} railwaymen in Canada, and work on the GTR was stopped for five minutes, on April 25, 1912, in his memory. During the period in which Hays led the GTR it saw its most prosperous era.|$|E
5|$|In {{the right}} {{rear of the}} French {{position}} was the substantial village of Plancenoit, and at the extreme right, the Bois de Paris wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> entire battlefield, but moved to a position near La Belle Alliance early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.|$|E
5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his motorcade. The South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Snowy Mountains Scheme, a large hydroelectricity project in highland Victoria.|$|E

60|$|This {{was soon}} done, and Walter seizing the bar, hauled himself {{up so that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> through <b>the</b> loophole.|$|R
5|$|In June 1943 he {{was given}} the job of {{registrar}} in the quarantine section at Birkenau sector BII, which allowed him to speak to deportees selected as slave labour. He had his own office with a desk, chair and bunk bed. From the window <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> lorries driving towards the gas chambers, and estimated that 10 percent of each transport was selected to work and the rest killed. By April 1944 he calculated that 1,750,000 Jews had been killed, a figure higher than that accepted by historians, but which decades later he still insisted was accurate.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice actors on Backstage. Prior to actors being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the actors. All of the actors voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E
5|$|By mid-morning, Ney {{had moved}} toward the front with Gazan's brigade and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> enemy {{advancing}} toward him; still expecting Soult's reinforcements on his flanks, he anticipated an easy victory, like the one three days earlier in which Masséna's force had pounded Hotze's column at Frauenfeld. He did not realise, at least not yet, that Hotze had 8,000men with which to secure the crossroads north of Winterthur. Ney brought more of his men to the front, and moved against the Austrian left. In an Austrian volley, he and his horse went down; the horse was killed and Ney received a knee injury. He had his wound bandaged, called for another horse, and reentered the fight.|$|E

5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern that the people are being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{character}} {{designs were}} drawn by Etsushi Sajima and {{were based on}} the original designs by Suzuhito Yasuda which received praise from Director Kishi. The original designs of the Septentriones were created by Mohiro Kitoh who remarked that since he was not directly engaged in the production process, he had to wait until the finished product was released before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> animated versions of his designs. The other half of the series' creatures i.e. the various devils (demons) used were designed by Hiroyuki Kanbe, while prop designs were done by Hatsue Nakayama and color designs were done by Keiichi Funada. Finally leaving Kazuto Shimoyama to oversee this area of production as the art director. The musical score was composed by Kōtarō Nakagawa. Nakagawa was initially surprised to have been offered to be the musical composer but took up the role as a challenge. In addition to Nagakawa, Sound Direction was done by Satoki Iida along with Sound Effects by Iki Okuda. Other staff members included Assistant Director Yoshimichi Hirai, Animation Designer Eriko Ito, Composite Director Katsufumi Sato, CG Director Yuji Koshida and Ayumu Takahashi as the series Editor and Producer Yasuo Suda.|$|E
5|$|With {{the loss}} of Bucher and his aircraft, the C-130 Hercules had not {{completed}} a successful evacuation, and {{there were more than}} 600 people still on the ground. Next in line was Lieutenant Colonel William Boyd; he was flying an airlift mission into Chu Lai, until he was diverted into Khâm Đức to extract forces and civilians there. Just before Boyd touched down, an artillery shell exploded about 100 feet in front of his aircraft, so he was forced to pull the throttle forward. Boyd then pulled up and went around for a second approach, because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> desperation {{of the people on the}} ground. As he landed, hundreds of civilians and soldiers poured out of the ditches and rushed onto the aircraft. Because he had witnessed the destruction of Bucher's C-130 while taking off in the north direction, Boyd decided to fly out from the southwest. After Boyd's aircraft was airborne, he banked the aircraft so it would be masked by the rolling terrain. The aircraft sustained damages to the left wing, the fuselage, and the leading edge of both wings, but it landed safely in Chu Lai with all the passengers.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
25|$|Rett was {{supposed}} to help Deshwitat during his battle against Kalutika. He {{was too late to}} help, and tried to avenge his friend, but was severely wounded, and his men were killed. Kalutika made Rett immortal so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Armageddon.|$|E
25|$|Captain Lee, on Elwood, {{said to a}} {{reporter}} on November 1 that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> light on the car, and from the sound, {{he thought it was}} moving fast across the bridge, and the motorman might not realize that the draw was open.|$|E

25|$|During the {{evacuation}} of the camp, Ian expresses his love for Louise. They talk about life choices and whether he would change them if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> future.

25|$|Lair had {{reservations}} about {{increased use of}} US air power in Laos, fearing that the Hmong and other Lao forces would become too dependent upon it. However, {{in the wake of}} the Battle of Nam Bac, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> need for organized forward air control for close air support. His proposal to place Lao interpreters with US fighter pilots in light aircraft to direct air strikes became the Raven Forward Air Controllers. Moreover, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> utility of pilots and infantry sharing a common language. Vang Pao had already requested training slots for Hmong cadets at Project Waterpump at Udorn, and had been refused. Lair quietly scrounged a couple of Piper Cubs and began training Hmong pilots at Nong Khai. A PARU pilot, Somboun Sithoon, served as the first instructor. The instructional staff would come to include two pilots on loan from the Royal Thai Air Force and six more from Continental Air Services, Inc. Three classes of Hmong pilots would graduate by mid-1967, including the pilot who would become the star of the RLAF, Lee Lue.|$|E
25|$|The GCN, {{in which}} Codreanu thought <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> nucleus of {{nationalist}} trade unions, became active in crushing strike actions. Their activities did not fail in attracting attention, especially after students who obeyed Codreanu, grouped in the Association of Christian Students, started demanding a Jewish quota {{for higher education}} — this gathered popularity for the GCN, and it led to a drastic increase in the frequency and intensity of assaults on all its opponents. In response, Codreanu was expelled from University. Although allowed to return when Cuza and others intervened for him (refusing to respect {{the decision of the}} University Senate), he was never presented with a diploma after his graduation.|$|E

25|$|On April 12, 1204, {{during the}} siege of Constantinople, Emperor Alexios V Doukas Mourtzouphlos set his {{headquarters}} near the Monastery. From this vantage point <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> Venetian fleet under command of Doge Enrico Dandolo deploying between the monastery of the Euergetes and the church of St. Mary of the Blachernae before attacking the city. After the successful attack he took flight abandoning his purple tent on the spot, and so allowing Baldwin of Flanders to spend his victory night inside it. The complex was sacked by the crusaders, and afterward it was assigned to Benedictine monks of San Giorgio Maggiore. During the Latin occupation of Constantinople (1204–1261) the building became a Roman Catholic church.|$|E
25|$|On August 1, 1876, Hickok {{was playing}} poker at Nuttal & Mann's Saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory. When a seat opened {{up at the}} table, a drunk man named Jack McCall sat down to play. McCall lost heavily. Hickok {{encouraged}} McCall to quit the game until he could cover his losses and offered to give him money for breakfast. Though McCall accepted the money, he was apparently insulted. The next day, Hickok was playing poker again. He usually sat {{with his back to}} a wall so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> entrance, but the only seat available when he joined the game was a chair facing away from the door. He asked another man at the table, Charles Rich, to change seats with him twice, but Rich refused.|$|E
25|$|His journey {{started when}} {{he studied the}} Qur'an in a literal way, and he slowly began to {{understand}} the principles lined in the religion. Then something happened to him in America to remove his doubts. He says; {{that while he was}} going to America, he was on the boat (ferry), and he saw the way the boat he was travelling in – was rocking in the huge sea – all under the control of Allah without it sinking or capsizing. At that point he realized the power of Allah. He said Iman (belief) entered into his heart due to this. His second scenario was in San Francisco, when he went on top of a mountain, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> whole of creation in front of him, and he realized the beauty and harmony that existed amongst the creation as a whole. He said that, the sweetness of Iman hit him.|$|E
