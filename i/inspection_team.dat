5|$|The top-to-bottom system {{requires}} party committees {{at higher}} levels to supervise lower-level committees. According to the ISR, the central party leadership should regularly send central inspection teams to regions, state organisations and state-owned enterprises. The central inspection teams' structure was reformed by the ISR; before it, they were ad hoc institutions {{in the fight against}} corruption. The ISR introduced formal criteria for joining a central <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> and empowered its investigative authority.|$|E
5|$|Under Secretary Wu Guanzheng, the CCDI {{established}} {{its first}} central inspection teams in August 2003. These teams, led by retired ministerial-level officials and {{reporting to the}} CCDI rather than local party committees, were empowered to initiate investigations, conduct interviews and review relevant documents. The opinion of a central <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> was {{an important factor in}} determining whether or not an official was disciplined, and the teams {{played an important role in}} the expulsion of Shanghai party chief (and Politburo member) Chen Liangyu from the party because of corruption.|$|E
5|$|Responding to {{international}} pressures, in 1991 the Soviet government allowed a joint U.S.-British <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> to tour {{four of its}} main weapons facilities at Biopreparat. The inspectors were met with evasion and denials from the Soviet scientists, and were eventually ordered out of the facility. In 1992 Soviet defector Ken Alibek alleged that the Soviet bioweapons program at Zagorsk had produced a large stockpile—as much as twenty tons—of weaponized smallpox (possibly engineered to resist vaccines, Alibek further alleged), along with refrigerated warheads to deliver it. Alibek's stories about the former Soviet program's smallpox activities have never been independently verified.|$|E

Several prominent cases, such as that of Hubei Vice-Governor Guo Youming, Inner Mongolia politician Wang Suyi, Guangzhou Party Secretary Wan Qingliang, and a whole host of officials from Shanxi province, were initiated by the central <b>inspection</b> <b>teams.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bart and Lisa {{go fishing}} {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton pulls {{up just as}} Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} on Cuba {{to even the}} power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. ignored them, and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> into Cuba.|$|E

25|$|The {{shipwreck}} {{site was}} discovered {{in the summer of}} 1982 due to Mehmet Çakir’s sketching of “the metal biscuits with ears” recognized as oxhide ingots. Turkish sponge divers were often consulted by the Institute of Nautical Archaeology's (INA) survey team on how to identify ancient wrecks while diving for sponges. Çakir’s findings urged Oğuz Alpözen, Director of the Bodrum Museum of Underwater Archaeology, to send out an <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> of the Museum and INA archaeologists to locate the wreck site.

In 2010, the CCDI was authorised to send <b>inspection</b> <b>teams</b> to the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Despite this, there are several weaknesses to its institutional design {{in the sense that}} certain informal aspects of CPC rule compete with formal procedures (that the CCDI and its lower-level organs are tasked with supervising) for hegemony; examples are, as outlined Xuezhi Guo, [...] "vague institutional positions, incrementally declining effects as time goes by, vulnerability to patron-clientelism or guanxi network at the grassroots level, and the dilemma of 'open' or 'undercover’ investigation". The CCDI and its <b>inspection</b> <b>teams</b> initiate ordinary and intensive inspection of party organisations at all levels and, {{in the eyes of many}} in the provinces, are a [...] "tribunal of justice": handing down verdicts to the guilty and exonerating the innocent.|$|R

He made two attempted trips to Iraq. The first was on 19 May 2003 when he was prevented from entering Iraq from Kuwait because he did not have the proper documents.|$|E
25|$|Designers Bruno and Franz Steffen piloted the {{aircraft}} themselves {{on its first}} test flight on 24 May 1915. They ended this flight prematurely because of overheating in the gearboxes, and subsequent tests revealed other defects such as excessive vibration in the drive system. With these problems addressed, the R.I was ready for its Idflieg acceptance flights in June 1915. Bruno Steffen ferried the three-person <b>inspection</b> <b>team,</b> plus a number of passengers, from Neumünster to Döberitz. He had even placed two armchairs {{and a bottle of}} champagne in the cabin for the occasion. The R.I reached Döberitz safely and made around twenty-four test flights before it was accepted by the military on 26 July 1915.|$|E

25|$|The first salvos of the {{campaign}} was the abrupt sacking of Sichuan Deputy Party Secretary Li Chuncheng, {{which took place in}} December 2012, shortly after Xi took office as leader of the Communist Party. The first batch of central inspection teams were dispatched {{in the third quarter of}} 2013 to various Chinese provinces, including Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Chongqing, and Hubei. A handful of provincial-level officials were investigated for corruption and removed from office as a result of the first round of inspection work. Of these regions, the <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> in charge of Jiangxi uncovered far-reaching official corruption in the province, bringing down about a dozen officials, including Vice Governor Yao Mugen. The inspection work in Hubei province also resulted in about a dozen cases, including that of Vice Governor Guo Youming. In Inner Mongolia, head of the party's regional United Front department Wang Suyi was detained.|$|E
25|$|In 1989, Kelly was {{involved}} in investigations into Soviet violations of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and was a key member of the <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> visiting the USSR and former Soviet states on several occasions 1991 and 1994. His experience with biological weapons at Porton Down led to his selection as a United Nations weapons inspector in Iraq {{following the end of}} the Gulf War. Kelly's work {{as a member of the}} UNSCOM team led him to visit Iraq thirty-seven times, and his success in uncovering Iraq's biological weapons programme led to Rolf Ekéus nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize. He was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1996. Although he was never a member of the intelligence services, the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) regularly sought his opinion on Iraq and other issues. Kelly became a member of the Bahá'í Faith around 1999. He was introduced to this faith by Mai Pederson, a US military linguist and intelligence operative.|$|E
25|$|Although the ICRC {{inspected}} the camp {{on a few}} occasions, headed by Swiss Army Colonel Auguste Rilliet, the <b>inspection</b> <b>team</b> simply noted that sanitary conditions could be improved, and prisoners {{were not aware of}} the length of their sentences or why they were in the camp in the first place. Only just prior to the removal of the commandant in September 1945, Rilliet rated the camp conditions unsatisfactory, {{in spite of the fact}} that Wauwilermoos was the subject of official protests by the United States, Great Britain, Poland, Italy, and even prevented normalization of diplomatic relations with the USSR. This may have been due to a secret agreement between the ICRC and the Swiss Army, which gave the Swiss Army permission to review and censor inspection reports prior to their release to foreign powers. Numerous Swiss citizens reported that the conditions at Wauwilermoos were in violation of the 1929 Geneva Conventions, including as below-mentioned, a Swiss Army medical officer, an officer on the Swiss Army's General Staff, and also by the editors of two Swiss newspapers.|$|E
