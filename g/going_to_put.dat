5|$|While {{portraying the}} bonds between {{the members of}} Class Zero, and between them and their summoned monsters, along with the game's themes of death and war, Naora drew {{inspiration}} from {{when he saw a}} cat killed by a car surrounded by other cats. Nomura was in charge of choosing the voice cast, which featured several well-known voice actors. When listening to the samples and picking the actors, Nomura focused on whether they could successfully project the characters' personalities. The actors and actresses helped define the characters, adding individual touches during voice recording sessions. Sayoko Hoshino acted as the game's character texture artist. Originally, she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in black voids where a female character's panties would have been due to hardware limitations. However the staff realized that the players would be looking at the backs of characters a lot, so Hoshino designed panties for each female character and worked with the staff to incorporate them into the character models.|$|E
5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad {{we would}} have been all alone. There wouldn't have been anybody else with us. There would have been a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then what are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact {{we were able to do}} our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|On March 29, 2017, the Lightning head coach, Jon Cooper, {{said that}} after the team's {{upcoming}} game against the Detroit Red Wings Stamkos would be considered day-to-day. Stamkos {{said that he was}} not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> any dates on his return, however, he did say that he was very pleased and excited with how his knee was feeling. Stamkos did not return to the lineup for the Lightning that season.|$|E

25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that he {{knew where they were}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E
25|$|The Tar Heels {{were shut}} {{out for the}} first time since a 7–0 loss to Georgia Tech in 2006, and their first shut out by NC State since 1960. Bryn Renner was knocked out of the game with concussion-like {{symptoms}} early in the second half. The UNC offense had its worst performance of the season, being held to a game low of 165 total yards. Giovani Bernard was, however, able to become the 15th Tar Heel to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and the third freshman to rush for 1,000 yards. The only point in the game in which it seemed UNC was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> points on the scoreboard was on a 75 yard touchdown reception by Dwight Jones that was called back because of holding on the offensive line.|$|E
25|$|The {{eldest of}} eight children, Laine {{grew up in}} the Old Town {{neighborhood}} (first at 1446 N. North Park Avenue and later at 331 W. Schiller Street) and got his first taste of singing {{as a member of the}} choir in the Church of the Immaculate Conception's elementary school across the street from the North Park Avenue home. He later attended Lane Technical High School, where he helped to develop his lung power and breath control by joining the track and field and basketball teams. He realized he wanted to be a singer when he missed time in school to see Al Jolson's current talking picture, The Singing Fool. Jolson would later visit Laine when both were filming pictures in 1949, and at about this time, Jolson remarked that Laine was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> all the other singers out of business.|$|E

Carland said [...] "It's not that we're necessarily never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> out a band {{with men in}} it, but it's just kind of organically happened that way. We wanted to focus on putting out music by women. We do consider ourselves a feminist business {{and part of that}} involves prioritizing work made by women." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{appearance}} on CNN's Larry King Live, Cruise said that he founded the project out of concern that 9/11 survivors would suffer leukemia, parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis or cancer {{as a result of}} toxins in their fatty tissue. He advocated Hubbard's [...] "research" [...] as the only way to deal with these problems, claiming, [...] "Doctors {{do not know how to}} diagnose chemical exposures [...] You go to a doctor and now he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> you on more and more drugs, steroids and things that are ineffective." ...|$|E

500|$|Andrew Scott {{made his}} first {{appearance}} as Jim Moriarty in [...] "The Great Game". Moffat said, [...] "We knew {{what we wanted to}} do with Moriarty from the very beginning. Moriarty is usually a rather dull, rather posh villain so we thought someone who was genuinely properly frightening. Someone who's an absolute psycho." [...] Moffat and Gatiss were originally not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> a confrontation between Moriarty and Holmes into these three episodes, but realised that they [...] "just had to do a confrontation scene. We had to do a version of the scene in 'The Final Problem' in which the two archenemies meet each other." ...|$|E
500|$|Film analyst Lina Badley {{has written}} that the Alien's design, with strong Freudian sexual undertones, {{multiple}} phallic symbols, and overall feminine figure, provides an androgynous image conforming to archetypal mappings and imageries in horror films that often redraw gender lines. O'Bannon himself later described the sexual imagery in Alien as overt and intentional: [...] "One thing that people are all disturbed about is sex... I said 'That's how I'm going to attack the audience; I'm going to attack them sexually. And I'm {{not going to go}} after the women in the audience, I'm going to attack the men. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> in every image I can think of to make the men in the audience cross their legs. Homosexual oral rape, birth.

500|$|The {{next morning}} gay leaders convened in a {{committee}} {{room in the}} Civic Center. Supervisor Harry Britt, who had replaced Milk, along with the more militant gays of the Harvey Milk Democratic Club, {{made it clear that}} nobody was to apologize for the riots. Britt informed a press conference, [...] "Harvey Milk's people do not have anything to apologize for. Now the society {{is going to have to}} deal with us not as nice little fairies who have hairdressing salons, but as people capable of violence. We're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up with Dan Whites anymore." [...] Reporters were surprised that a public official would condone the violent acts of the previous night, expecting an apology from Britt. Subsequent attempts to find a gay leader who would give an apologetic statement proved unsuccessful.|$|E

During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out of this thing, and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my feet in the sand in a warm place.

500|$|Although World WarI distracted public {{attention}} from Meeker and his activities, {{he used the}} time {{to plan for the}} future. On December 29, 1919, his 89th birthday, he began work on another book, Seventy Years of Progress in Washington, which was published to favorable reviews. [...] In association with Dr. Howard R. Driggs, a professor of English education at the University of Utah and later at New York University, he published a revised version of his memoirs, Ox-Team Days on the Oregon Trail. [...] In 1922, he fell ill for {{one of the few times}} in his life.

If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> this ship on the map. Well, that died out.

500|$|Following {{the success}} of The Dark Knight, Eckhart next {{appeared}} in Alan Ball's Towelhead (2008), an adaption of the Alicia Erian novel of the same name, in which he played a Gulf War Army reservist who sexually abuses his 13-year-old Arab-American neighbor. The film was screened under the name Nothing is Private at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. When he was first approached for the role, Eckhart revealed {{that he did not}} want to play a [...] "pedophile". When asked about the sex scenes, Eckhart said: [...] "Those were difficult times.... The way I did it was to really trust Alan. It was in the words. I really trusted Summer , and I tried to get her to trust me, to build a relationship when we were doing physical scenes. We'd really rehearse them mechanically, and I'd say, 'OK, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> my hand here, I'm going to do this.'... I think I found it more difficult."

500|$|Frank {{was criticized}} by {{conservative}} organizations for campaign contributions totaling $42,350 between 1989 and 2008.

In 2006, a Fannie Mae representative stated in SEC filings that they [...] "did not participate in large amounts of these non-traditional mortgages in 2004 and 2005." [...] In response to criticism, Frank said, [...] "In 2004, it was Bush who started to push Fannie and Freddie into subprime mortgages, because they were boasting about how they were expanding homeownership for low-income people.
