40|$|SUMMARY-High. speed {{centrifugal}} pellets {{were prepared}} from defatted and <b>decaseinated</b> milk obtained from mice of 33 substrains of 15 different strains, 3 stocks, 2 germfree strains, and 2 hybrid lines with {{high or low}} lnel-dence of mammary cancer and high or low incidence of leukemia. Electron microscopic {{studies were carried out}} on sections of these pellets, some of which were tested for tumor-inducing and hyperplastic nodule-inducing ee-tivity. Type-B virus particles were found in the milk of mice of high and of some low cancer strains. In addition, type-C virus particles and "signet. ring" particles were observed in some strains. A high degree of correlation was noted between the presence of type. B particles and tumor-inducing as well as nodule-inducing activity in Rill and A, high mammaryÂ·cancer strains, and to a lesser extentin Af and C 3 Hf, low cancer strains, and (C 57 X AF) Fl mice. A high degree of correlation was found in the milk of BALB/c and CBA mice, low mammary-cancer strains, between the absence of type-B particles and lack of tumor-inducing and nodule. inducing activity.
