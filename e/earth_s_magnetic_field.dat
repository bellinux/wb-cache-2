40|$|The Vector Electric Field Investigation suite on the C/NOFS {{satellite}} {{includes a}} fluxgate magnetometer {{to monitor the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields</b> in the low-latitude ionosphere. Measurements yield full magnetic vectors every second over the range of +/- 45, 000 nT with a one-bit resolution of 1. 37 nT (16 bit A/D) in each component. The sensor s primary responsibility is to support calculations of both V x B and E x B with greater accuracy than can be obtained using standard <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> models. The data also contain information about large-scale current systems that, when analyzed in conjunction with electric field measurements, promise to significantly expand understanding of equatorial electrodynamics. We first compare in situ measurements with the POMME (Potsdam Magnetic Model of the Earth) model to establish in-flight sensor "calibrations" and to compute magnetic residuals. At low latitudes the residuals are predominately products of the storm time ring current. Since C/NOFS provides a complete coverage of all local times every 97 min, <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> data allow studies of the temporal evolution and local time variations of storm time ring current. The analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using instrumented spacecraft in low-inclination orbits to extract a timely proxy for the provisional Dst index and to specify the ring current s evolution...|$|R
40|$|Radiation from galactic {{cosmic rays}} (GCR) and solar {{particle}} events (SPE) is a serious hazard to humans and electronic instruments during space travel, particularly on prolonged missions outside the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>fields.</b> Galactic cosmic radiation (GCR) is composed of approx. 98 % nucleons and approx. 2 % electrons and positrons. Although cosmic ray heavy ions are 1 - 2 % of the fluence, these energetic heavy nuclei (HZE) contribute 50 % of the long-term dose. These unusually high specific ionizations pose a significant health hazard acting as carcinogens and also causing microelectronics damage inside spacecraft and high-flying aircraft. These HZE ions are of concern for radiation protection and radiation shielding technology, because gross rearrangements and mutations and deletions in DNA are expected. Calculations have shown that HZE particles have a strong preference for interaction with light nuclei. The best shield for this radiation would be liquid hydrogen, which is totally impractical. For this reason, hydrogen-containing polymers make the most effective practical shields. Shielding is required during missions in Earth orbit and possibly for frequent flying at high altitude because of the broad GCR spectrum and during a passage into deep space and LunarMars habitation because of the protracted exposure encountered on a long space mission. An additional hazard comes from solar particle events (SPEs) which are mostly energetic protons that can produce heavy ion secondaries as well as neutrons in materials. These events occur at unpredictable times and can deliver a potentially lethal dose within several hours to an unshielded human. Radiation protection for humans requires safety in short-term missions and maintaining career exposure limits within acceptable levels on future long-term exploration missions. The selection of shield materials can alter the protection of humans by an order of magnitude. If improperly selected, shielding materials can actually increase radiation damage due to penetration properties and nuclear fragmentation. Protecting space-borne microelectronics from single event upsets (SEUs) by transmitted radiation will benefit system reliability and system design cost by using optimal shield materials. Long-term missions {{on the surface of}} the Moon or Mars will require the construction of habitats to protect humans during their stay. One approach to the construction is to make structural materials from lunar or Martian regolith using a polymeric material as a binder. The hydrogen-containing polymers are considerably more effective for radiation protection than the regolith, but the combination minimizes the amount of polymer to be transported. We have made composites of simulated lunar regolith with two different polymers, LaRC-SI, a high-performance polyimide thermoset, and polyethylene, a thermoplastic...|$|R
40|$|Above the Atlantic Ocean, off {{the coast}} of Brazil, there is a dip in the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> {{surrounding}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> called the South Atlantic Anomaly. Here, space radiation can reach into <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> upper atmosphere to interfere with the functioning of satellites, aircraft, and even the International Space Station. "The South Atlantic Anomaly is a hot spot of radiation that the space station goes through at a certain point in orbit," Miria Finckenor, a physicist at Marshall Space Flight Center, describes, "If there s {{going to be a problem}} with the electronics, 90 percent of that time, it is going to be in that spot. " Space radiation can cause physical damage to microchips and can actually change the software commands in computers. When high-energy particles penetrate a satellite or other spacecraft, the electrical components can absorb the energy and temporarily switch off. If the energy is high enough, it can cause the device to enter a hung state, which can only be addressed by restarting the system. When space radiation affects the operational status of microprocessors, the occurrence is called single event functional interrupt (SEFI). SEFI happens not only to the computers onboard spacecraft in Earth orbit, but to the computers on spacecraft throughout the solar system. "One of the Mars rovers had this problem in the radiation environment and was rebooting itself several times a day. On one occasion, it rebooted 40 times in one day," Finckenor says. "It s hard to obtain any data when you have to constantly reboot and start over. ...|$|R

It can detect subtle changes in energy, up to 100 billion times weaker than the electromagnetic energy required to move a compass needle. SQUIDs are used for a variety of testing procedures where extreme sensitivity is required and where the test instrument need not come into direct contact with the test subject. NASA uses SQUIDs for remote, noncontact sensing in a variety of venues, including monitoring the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and tracking brain activity of pilots. Scientists at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center have been making extensive use of this technology, from astrophysical research, to tracking the navigational paths of bees in flight to determine if they are using internal compasses.

40|$|Relativistic {{electrons}} in the Earth's radiation belts are a widely recognized threat to spacecraft because they penetrate lightly shielded vehicle hulls and deep into insulating materials where they accumulate to sufficient levels to produce electrostatic discharges. Strategies {{for evaluating the}} magnitude of the relativistic electron flux environment and its potential for producing ESD events are varied. Simple "rule of thumb" estimates such as the widely used 10 (exp 10) e-/sq cm fluence within 10 hour threshold for the onset of pulsing in dielectric materials provide a quick estimate of when to expect charging issues. More sophisticated strategies based on models of the trapped electron flux within the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> provide time dependent estimates of electron flux along spacecraft orbits and orbit integrate electron flux. Finally, measurements of electron flux can be used to demonstrate mean and extreme relativistic electron environments. This presentation will evaluate strategies used to specify energetic electron flux and fluence environments along spacecraft trajectories in the Earth s radiation belts...|$|E
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{concept in}} in-space transportation currently being studied is the Momentum-Exchange/Electrodynamic Reboost Tether System (MXER). The MXER {{system is a}} permanently orbiting platform designed to boost payloads from low earth orbit (LEO). Unlike conventional rockets that use propellants, MXER acts as a large momentum wheel, imparting a Av to a payload {{at the expense of}} its own orbital energy. After throwing a payload, the system reboosts itself using an electrodynamic tether to push against <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and brings itself back up to an operational orbit to prepare for the next payload. The ability to reboost itself allows for continued reuse of the system without the expenditure of propellants. Considering the cost of lifting propellant from the ground to LEO to do the same Av boost at $ 10000 per pound, the system cuts the launch cost of the payload dramatically, and subsequently, the MXER system pays for itself after a small number of missions. As such, this technology is a valuable addition to NASA s mission for in-space transportation...|$|E
40|$|The Earth's fluid outer core is in {{vigorous}} convection {{through much}} of the Earth's history. In addition to generating and maintaining <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> time-varying <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (geodynamo), the core convection also generates mass redistribution in the core and a dynamical pressure field on the core-mantle boundary (CMB). All these shall result in various core-mantle interactions, and contribute to surface geodynamic observables. For example, electromagnetic core-mantle coupling arises from finite electrically conducting lower mantle; gravitational interaction occurs between the cores and the heterogeneous mantle; mechanical coupling may also occur when the CMB topography is aspherical. Besides changing the mantle rotation via the coupling torques, the mass-redistribution in the core shall produce a spatial-temporal gravity anomaly. Numerical modeling of the core dynamical processes contributes in several geophysical disciplines. It helps explain the physical causes of surface geodynamic observables via space geodetic techniques and other means, e. g. Earth's rotation variation on decadal time scales, and secular time-variable gravity. Conversely, identification of the sources of the observables can provide additional insights on the dynamics of the fluid core, leading to better constraints on the physics in the numerical modeling. In the past few years, our core dynamics modeling efforts, with respect to our MoSST model, have made significant progress in understanding individual geophysical consequences. However, integrated studies are desirable, not only because of more mature numerical core dynamics models, but also because of inter-correlation among the geophysical phenomena, e. g. mass redistribution in the outer core produces not only time-variable gravity, but also gravitational core-mantle coupling and thus the Earth's rotation variation. They are expected to further facilitate multidisciplinary studies of core dynamics and interactions of the core with other components of the Earth...|$|R
40|$|Space Technology 5, {{or better}} known as ST- 5, is a space {{technology}} development mission in the New Millennium Program (NMP) and NASA s first experiment {{in the design of}} miniaturized satellite constellations. The mission will design, integrate and launch multiple spacecraft into an orbit high above the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> protective <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> known as the magnetosphere. Each spacecraft incorporates innovative technology and constellation concepts which will be instrumental in future space science missions. A total of three ST- 5 spacecraft will be launched as secondary payloads into a highly elliptical geo-synchronous transfer orbit, and will operate as a 3 -element constellation for a minimum duration of 90 days. In order to correlate the time of science measurements with orbit position relative to the Earth, orbit position in space (with respect to other objects in space) and/or with events measured on Earth or other spacecraft, accurate knowledge of spacecraft and ground time is needed. Ground time as used in the USA (known as Universal Time Coordinated or UTC) is maintained by the U. S. Naval Observatory. Spacecraft time is maintained onboard within the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) system. The science requirements for ST- 5 are that spacecraft time and ground time be correlatable to each other, with some degree of accuracy. Accurate knowledge of UTC time on a spacecraft is required so that science measurements can be correlated with orbit position relative to the Earth, orbit position in space and with events measured on Earth or other spacecraft. The most crucial parameter is not the clock oscillator frequency, but more importantly, how the clock oscillator frequency varies with time or temperature (clock oscillator drift). Even with an incorrect clock oscillator frequency, if there were no drift, the frequency could be assessed by comparing the spacecraft clock to a ground clock during a few correlation events. Once the frequency is accurately known, it is easy enough to make a regular adjustment to the spacecraft clock or to calculate the correct ground time for a given spacecraft clock time. The oscillator frequency, however, is temperature dependent, drifts with age and is affected by radiation; hence, repeated correlation measurements are required...|$|R

Initialization of MAGNAV occured on September 4, 2004. MAGNAV is designed to autonomously estimate the spacecraft orbit, attitude, and rate using magnetometer and sun sensor data. Since the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is a function of time and position, and since time is known quite precisely, the differences between the computed magnetic field and measured magnetic field components, as measured by the magnetometer throughout the entire spacecraft orbit, are a function of the spacecraft trajectory and attitude errors. Therefore, these errors are used to estimate both trajec- tory and attitude. In addition, the time rate of change of the magnetic field vector is used to estimate the spacecraft rotation rate. The estimation of the attitude and tra- jectory is augmented with the rate estimation into an Extended Kalman filter blended with a pseudc-linear Kalman filter. Sun sensor data is also used to improve the accu- racy and observability of the attitude and rate estimates. This test serves to validate MAGNAV as a single low cost navigation system which utilizes reliable, flight qualified sensors. MAGNAV is intended as a backup algorithm, an initialization algorithm, or possibly a prime navigation algorithm for a mission with coarse constraints...|$|E

Assessing the detrimental effects to human skin under such adverse conditions could be predicted by conducting territorial experiments on animal models. In this study we apply a computational approach to simulate the experimental data of the radiation response of swine epidermis, which is closely similar to human epidermis [2]. Incorporating experimentally measured histological and cell kinetic parameters into a multiscale tissue modeling framework, we obtain results of population kinetics and proliferation index comparable to unirradiated and acutely irradiated swine experiments [3]. It is noted the basal cell doubling time is 10 to 16 days in the intact population, but drops to 13. 6 hr in the regenerating populations surviving irradiation. This complex 30 -fold variation is proposed to be attributed to the shortening of the G 1 phase duration. We investigate this radiation induced effect by considering at the sub-cellular level the expression and signaling of TGF-beta, as it is recognized as a key regulatory factor of tissue formation and wound healing [4]. This integrated model will allow us to test the validity of various basic biological rules at the cellular level and sub-cellular mechanisms by qualitatively comparing simulation results with published research, and should lead to a fuller understanding of the pathophysiological effects of ionizing radiation on the skin...|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} approach for spin-stabilized spacecraft attitude prediction is presented for {{the influence of}} the residual magnetic torques and the satellite in an elliptical orbit. Assuming a quadripole model for the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> an analytical averaging method is applied to obtain the mean residual torque in every orbital period. The orbit mean anomaly is used to compute the average components of residual torque in the spacecraft body frame reference system. The theory is developed for time variations in the orbital elements, giving rise to many curvature integrals. It is observed that the residual magnetic torque does not have component along the spin axis. The inclusion of this torque on the rotational motion differential equations of a spin stabilized spacecraft yields conditions to derive an analytical solution. The solution shows that the residual torque does not affect the spin velocity magnitude, contributing only for the precession and the drift of the spin axis of the spacecraft. The theory developed has been applied to the Brazilian s spin stabilized satellites, which are quite appropriated for verification and comparison of the theory with the data generated and processed by the Satellite Control Center of Brazil National Research Institute. The results show the period that the analytical solution can be used to the attitude propagation, within the dispersion range of the attitude determination system performance of Satellite Control Center of Brazil National Research Institute...|$|E

Primary and secondary particles for SPE and GCR are transported through the respective atmosphere of Earth or Mars, space vehicle, and astronaut s body tissues using the HZETRN/QMSFRG computer code. In LEO, exposures are reduced compared to deep space because particles are deflected by the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and absorbed by the solid body of the Earth. Geomagnetic transmission function {{as a function of}} altitude was applied for the particle flux of charged particles, and the shift or the organ exposures to higher velocity or lower stopping powers compared to those in deep space were analyzed. In the transport through Mars atmosphere, a vertical distribution of atmospheric thickness was calculated from the temperature and pressure data of Mars Global Surveyor, and the directional cosine distribution was implemented to describe the spherically distributed atmospheric distance along the slant path at each altitude. The resultant directional shielding by Mars atmosphere at solar minimum and solar maximum was used for the particle flux simulation at various altitudes on the Martian surface.

Bare tethers, bare and insulated tethers with a balloon termination, and insulated tethers with a grid-sphere termination have been proposed for different applications. Electrodynamic tether as a thruster is currently proposed for the Momentum exchange Electrodynamic Reboost (MXER) Tether System that currently under development at NASA Marshal Space Flight Center. The choice of a tether design for a specific mission is {{based on the}} analysis of tether system performance.

This 2 ̆ 2 space weather 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 can produce significant effects on modern technology, from interrupting satellite service, to causing serious damage to Earth-side power grids. These concerns have, over the past several years, prompted an out-welling of research in an attempt to understand the processes governing, and to provide a means of forecasting, space weather events. The research presented in this thesis couples to current work aimed at understanding Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and their influence on the evolution of Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and associated Van Allen radiation belts.

For long duration missions, space radiation presents significant health risks including cancer mortality. Probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) {{is essential for}} radiation protection of crews on long term space missions outside of {{the protection of the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and for optimization of mission planning and costs. For the assessment of organ dosimetric quantities and cancer risks, the particle spectra at each critical body organs must be characterized. In implementing a PRA approach, a statistical model of SPE fluence was developed, because the individual SPE occurrences themselves are random in nature while the frequency distribution of SPEs depends strongly upon the phase within the solar activity cycle. Spectral variability of SPEs was also examined, because the detailed energy spectra of protons are important especially at high energy levels for assessing the cancer risk associated with energetic particles for large events. An overall cumulative probability of a GCR environment for a specified mission period was estimated for the temporal characterization of the GCR environment represented by the deceleration potential (theta). Finally, this probabilistic approach to space radiation cancer risk was coupled with a model of the radiobiological factors and uncertainties in projecting cancer risks.

40|$|Prediction Algorithms for the Attitude Estimator The {{attitude}} estimator is {{an extended}} Kalman filter, a recursive algorithm to treat noisy inputs to a dynamical system. The filter is optimal {{to compute the}} system s states. One of the steps involves a model representation of the system. In {{the case of the}} attitude dynamics of a satellite that has sun sensors and a magnetometer, this requires prior knowledge of the position of the sun with respect to the satellite and the magnetic flux density vector of the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at the satellite location. These problems have all been solved already, good software is available online and no new discovery was made here. The innovation is the integration of these software parts, the harmonization of their interfaces and the legitimate simplifications done to prevent too high complexity on restricted hardware. The digital attachment contains ready to use software and test procedures for the further development of the attitude determination and control system. The thesis describes the theory and serves as user s guide for the five parts 1. Time Conversions: The algorithms depend on time. Different time systems (e. g. universal time, terrestrial time) and time representations (e. g. time and date, day of the year) are advantageous dependent on the application. The user deals only with the time and date representation of universal time. 2. Frame Transformations: As with the time, some reference frames are better suited than other for particular tasks. The user only sees vectors expressed in the Earth-Centered Inertial Frame, but internally a lot of transformations occur. 3. Sun Vector Predictor: A low accuracy Astronomical Almanac sun vector algorithm is used. The satellite is so close to the earth that there is no difference in the vector from the earth s centre to the sun compared to the vector from the satellite to the sun. 4. Orbit Position and Velocity Prediction: This is also called orbit propagation. The Simplified General Perturbations 4 propagator is used. It needs the Two-Line Element Set for NUTS for the orbit description and returns the satellite position needed for the next predictor. The velocity can be useful for the attitude controller. 5. Geomagnetic Field Prediction: There are currently two equally precise models implemented, The World Magnetic Model 2015 and The 12 th Generation International Geomagnetic Reference Field. Of course only one is necessary for the satellite. Hardware tests suggest to use the World Magnetic Model because it runs faster. Robust Spacecraft Attitude Stabilization using Magnetorquers Attitude control of a spacecraft with magnetic coils as only actuators does not suffice to attain and maintain any desired attitude. However if the aim is to stabilize the spacecraft such that one axis points to the earth, there are formal proofs that magnetorquers provide enough control action for the stabilization under certain assumptions. This chapter extends two such proofs. The need of knowledge of the spacecraft inertia is relaxed and no special property on the <b>earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is required. The first controller is a nonlinear D controller. A strict Lyapunov function is found with help of Matrosov s theorem. If the unknown inertia is viewed as the (small) perturbation of an estimate, the controller still stabilizes the attitude globally, uniformly and asymptotically. The second controller is designed with the sliding mode control method. If the torque that the unknown inertia raises, is viewed as part of a (small) disturbance, the controller still stabilizes the attitude globally, uniformly and asymptotically...|$|E
40|$|Electrodynamic tether (EDT) {{thrusters}} work {{by virtue}} of the force a magnetic field exerts on a wire carrying an electrical current. The force, which acts on any charged particle moving through a magnetic field (including the electrons moving in a current-carrying wire), were concisely expressed by Lorentz in 1895 in an equation that now bears his name. The force acts in a direction perpendicular to both the direction of current flow and the magnetic field vector. Electric motors make use of this force: a wire loop in a magnetic field is made to rotate by the torque the Lorentz Force exerts on it due to an alternating current in the loop times so as to keep the torque acting in the same sense. The motion of the loop is transmitted to a shaft, thus providing work. Although the working principle of EDT thrusters is not new, its application to space transportation may be significant. In essence, an EDT thruster is just a clever way of getting an electrical current to flow in a long orbiting wire (the tether) so that the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> will accelerate the wire and, consequently the payload attached to the wire. The direction of current flow in the tether, either toward or away from the Earth along the local vertical, determines whether the magnetic force will raise or lower the orbit. The bias voltage of a vertically deployed metal tether, which results just from its orbital motion (assumed eastward) through <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> is positive with respect to the ambient plasma at the top and negative at the bottom. This polarization is due to the action of the Lorentz force on the electrons in the tether. Thus, the natural current flow is the result of negative electrons being attracted to the upper end and then returned to the plasma at the lower end. The magnetic force in this case has a component opposite to the direction of motion, and thus leads to a lowering of the orbit and eventually to re-entry. In this generator mode of operation the Lorentz Force serves both to drive the current and then to act on the current to decelerate the system. One of the most important features of tether thrusters is that they use renewable energy sources to drive the electrical current flow in either the orbit-raising or orbit-lowering modes. Sources inherent to Earth orbit are used. To raise the orbit, sunlight can be converted to the electrical energy required to drive the tether current. To lower the orbit, the orbital energy itself (supplied by the Earth-to-orbit launcher when it raises the system into orbit) is the energy source of the tether current via the action of the Lorentz Force. Electrodynamic tethers can be directly applied to a wide spectrum of uses in space. As a propulsion system, they include satellite de-orbit, transfer of a satellite from one orbit to another, altitude maintenance for large spacecraft such as the International Space Station, and since it works wherever there is a magnetic field and an ionosphere planetary exploration missions. An electrodynamic tether upper stage could be used as an Orbit Transfer Vehicle (OTV) to move payloads within low earth orbit. The OTV would rendezvous with the payload and launch vehicle, grapple the payload and maneuver it to a new orbital altitude or inclination without the use of boost propellant. The tug could then lower its orbit to rendezvous with the next payload and repeat the process. Conceivably, such a system could perform several orbital maneuvering assignments without resupply, making it relatively inexpensive to operate...|$|E

40|$|For long {{duration}} missions {{outside of}} {{the protection of the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> space radiation presents significant health risks including cancer mortality. Space radiation consists of solar particle events (SPEs), comprised largely of medium energy protons (less than several hundred MeV); and galactic cosmic ray (GCR), which include high energy protons and heavy ions. While the frequency distribution of SPEs depends strongly upon the phase within the solar activity cycle, the individual SPE occurrences themselves are random in nature. We estimated the probability of SPE occurrence using a non-homogeneous Poisson model to fit the historical database of proton measurements. Distributions of particle fluences of SPEs for a specified mission period were simulated ranging from its 5 th to 95 th percentile to assess the cancer risk distribution. Spectral variability of SPEs was also examined, because the detailed energy spectra of protons are important especially at high energy levels for assessing the cancer risk associated with energetic particles for large events. We estimated the overall cumulative probability of GCR environment for a specified mission period using a solar modulation model for the temporal characterization of the GCR environment represented by the deceleration potential (^). Probabilistic assessment of cancer fatal risk was calculated for various periods of lunar and Mars missions. This probabilistic approach to risk assessment from space radiation is in support of mission design and operational planning for future manned space exploration missions. In future work, this probabilistic approach to the space radiation will be combined with a probabilistic approach to the radiobiological factors that contribute to the uncertainties in projecting cancer risks...|$|E
40|$|A {{concern for}} {{long-term}} space travel outside the <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is the late effects {{to the central}} nervous system (CNS) from galactic cosmic ray (GCR) or solar particle events (SPE). Human epidemiology data is severely limited for making CNS risk estimates and it is not clear such effects occur following low LET exposures. We are developing systems biology models based on biological information on specific diseases, and experimental data for proton and heavy ion radiation. A two-hit model of Alzheimer s disease (AD) has been proposed by Zhu et al. (1), which is the framework of our model. Of importance is that over 50 % of the US population over the age of 75 -y have mild to severe forms of AD. Therefore we recommend that risk assessment for a potential AD risk from space radiation should focus on the projection of an earlier age of onset of AD and the prevention of this possible acceleration through countermeasures. In the two-hit model, oxidative stress and aberrant cell cycle-related abnormalities leading to amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are necessary and invariant steps in AD. We have formulated a stochastic cell kinetics model of the two-hit AD model. In our model a population of neuronal cells is allowed to undergo renewal through neurogenesis and is susceptible to oxidative stress or cell cycle abnormalities with age-specific accumulation of damage. Baseline rates are fitted to AD population data for specific ages, gender, and for persons with an apolipoprotein 4 allele. We then explore how low LET or heavy ions may increase either of the two-hits or neurogenesis either through persistent oxidative stress, direct mutation, or through changes to the micro-environment, and suggest possible ways to develop accurate quantitative estimates of these processes for predicting AD risks following long-term space travel...|$|E
40|$|As Earth's main {{magnetic}} field weakens, our magnetic shield against {{the onslaught of}} the solar wind thins. And the field strength needed to fend off battering by solar coronal mass ejections is decreasing, just when the delicate complexity of modem, vulnerable, electro-technological systems is increasing at an unprecedented rate. Recently, a working group of distinguished scientist from across the nation has asked NASA's Solid Earth and Natural Hazards program a key question: What are the dynamics of <b>Earth</b> <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and its interactions with the Earth system? Paleomagnetic studies of crustal rocks magnetized in the geologic past reveal that polarity reversals have occurred many times during Earth s history. Networked super-computer simulations of core field and flow, including effects of gravitational, pressure, rotational Coriolis, magnetic and viscous forces, suggest how this might happen in detail. And space-based measurements of the real, time-varying {{magnetic field}} help constrain estimates of the speed and direction of fluid iron flowing {{near the top of}} the core and enable tests of some hypotheses about such flow. Now scientists at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center have developed and applied methods to test the hypotheses of narrow scale flow and of a dynamically weak magnetic field near the top of Earth s core. Using two completely different methods, C. V. Voorhies has shown these hypotheses lead to specific theoretical forms for the "spectrum" of Earth s main magnetic field and the spectrum of its rate of change. Much as solar physicists use a prism to separate sunlight into its spectrum, from long wavelength red to short wavelength blue light, geophysicists use a digital prism, spherical harmonic analysis, to separate the measured geomagnetic field into its spectrum, from long to short wavelength fields. They do this for the rate of change of the field as well...|$|E

40|$|Several {{species of}} aquatic {{bacteria}} which orient in the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> and swim along <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines in a preferred direction (magnetotaxis) {{have been observed}} in marine and freshwater sediments of the Northern Hemisphere 1, 2. Their orientation is due {{to one or more}} intracytoplasmic chains of single-domain magnetite particles 3. These linearly arranged particles impart a net magnetic dipole moment to the bacterium, parallel to the axis of motility. Northern Hemisphere magnetotactic bacteria with unidirectional motility swim consistently {{in the direction of the}} <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> that is, to the geomagnetic North 1, 2, 4. This implies that their magnetic dipole is systematically orientated with the North-seeking pole forward. The magnetic polarity can be reversed by single, magnetic pulses of high field strength (1 − 2 µs, 300 − 600 G), and these bacteria then swim along <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines to the South 5. Due to the inclination of the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> magnetotactic bacteria which swim to the North in the Northern Hemisphere are directed downward at an angle increasing with latitude. It has been suggested that this downward-directed motion confers a biological advantage by guiding the bacteria, when dislodged, back to the sediments 1. On the basis of this hypothesis, magnetotactic bacteria of the Southern Hemisphere would be expected to swim to the South to reach the bottom. We report here several morphological types of magnetotactic bacteria present in sediments of the Southern Hemisphere. These bacteria indeed swim consistently to the South, hence downward along the Earth 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> inclined <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> lines, as hypothesized. As revealed by electron microscopy, they contain internal chains of electron-opaque particles similar to those observed in magnetotactic bacteria from the Northern Hemisphere. Like their Northern Hemisphere counterparts, their magnetic polarity can be permanently reversed and they cannot be demagnetized. We also report on Northern Hemisphere magnetotactic bacteria incubated in Southern Hemisphere magnetic conditions, confirming the biological relevance of downward directed motility...|$|R
