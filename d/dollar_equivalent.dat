25|$|After World War II, France devalued its {{currency}} within the Bretton Woods system on several occasions. Beginning in 1945 {{at a rate}} of 480 francs to the British pound (119.1 to the U.S. dollar), by 1949 the rate was 980 to the pound (350 to the dollar). This was reduced further in 1957 and 1958, reaching 1382.3 to the pound (493.7 to the <b>dollar,</b> <b>equivalent</b> to 1 franc = 1.8 mg pure gold).|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1980s, {{passive solar}} {{building}} design and passive house have demonstrated heating energy consumption reductions of 70% to 90% in many locations, without active energy harvesting. For new builds, and with expert design, {{this can be}} accomplished with little additional construction cost for materials over a conventional building. Very few industry experts have the skills or experience to fully capture benefits of the passive design. Such passive solar designs are much more cost-effective than adding expensive photovoltaic panels on the roof of a conventional inefficient building. A few kilowatt-hours of photovoltaic panels (costing 2 to 3 dollars per annual kWh production, U.S. <b>dollar</b> <b>equivalent)</b> may only reduce external energy requirements by 15% to 30%. A [...] high seasonal energy efficiency ratio 14 conventional air conditioner requires over 7kW of photovoltaic electricity while it is operating, and that does not include enough for off-the-grid night-time operation. Passive cooling, and superior system engineering techniques, can reduce the air conditioning requirement by 70% to 90%. Photovoltaic-generated electricity becomes more cost-effective when the overall demand for electricity is lower.|$|E

5000|$|In {{places where}} £sd was used, the decimalisation process either defined one new penny = [...] pound, where the main unit (the pound) was unchanged, or {{introduced}} a new main unit (such as the <b>dollar),</b> <b>equivalent</b> to half a pound, with one cent = [...] dollar.|$|E

5000|$|... (b) Keep the <b>dollar</b> <b>equivalent</b> to {{an ideal}} “market basket dollar”, similar to Sweden’s market basket krona.

Under this “constant-cost-of-living” standard the Monetary Authority would, however, as has been found in Sweden, have to observe closely the movements of other, more sensitive indexes, with a view to preventing the development of disequilibrium as between sensitive and insensitive prices.|$|E

5000|$|Another {{example is}} the RCA [...] "SelectaVision" [...] video disk system project, begun in the early 1960s and {{continuing}} for nearly 20 years, long after cheaper and better alternatives had come to market. RCA was estimated to have spent about $750 million (1985 <b>dollars)</b> (<b>equivalent</b> to $1.65 billion in 2014 dollars) on this commercially nonviable system, {{which was one of}} the factors leading to its sale to GE and later breakup in 1986.|$|R
50|$|In a {{currency}} forward, the notional amounts of currencies are specified (ex: {{a contract to}} buy $100 million Canadian <b>dollars</b> <b>equivalent</b> to, say $75.2 million USD at the current rate—these two amounts are called the notional amount(s)). While the notional amount or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the leverage created, which is typical in derivative contracts.|$|R
50|$|On March 12, 1855, John B.
