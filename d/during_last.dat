40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} whether hyperventilation (HV) for 5 min increases the diagnostic yield of electroencephalography (EEG) compared to 3 min HV. Methodsdata were evaluated from 1084 consecutive patients, from three European centres, referred to EEG {{on suspicion of}} epilepsy. Seizures and interictal EEG abnormalities precipitated during the first 3 min and <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min of the HV period (totally 5 min) were determined. ResultsEight hundred seventy-seven patients (81 %) completed 5 min HV. Seizures were precipitated during the first 3 min of HV in 21 patients, and <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min in four more patients. Interictal EEG abnormalities were precipitated in the first 3 min of HV in 16 patients, and <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min in 7 more patients. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures occurred in eight patients during the first 3 min of HV and in two more patients <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min. No adverse events occurred <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min of HV, but eight patients (1 %) stopped HV <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min {{because they were not}} able to hyperventilate further. Conclusion 16 % of seizures and 30 % of interictal EEG abnormalities triggered by HV occurred <b>during</b> the <b>last</b> 2 min of HV, suggesting the clinical usefulness of prolonged hyperventilation for 5 min. The vast majority of patients (99 %) who are able to hyperventilate for 3 min can complete 5 min HV, without additional adverse events...|$|R

25|$|It is {{believed}} that the herons have nested near Juodkrantė since 17th century, but the cormorants arrived only {{at the beginning of}} 19th century. The cormorants were exterminated {{at the end of the}} 19th century due to Prussian administration regulations and started to reappear only in the 1970s. The large cormorant colony has damaged the old and fragile forest because the birds' excrement burns tree roots. <b>During</b> <b>last</b> 15 years about 10 ha (25 acres) of forest has died. Fishermen blame the birds for diminishing fish catches, but unlike in Prussia, the regulations now do not allow killing them as both grey heron and great cormorant are protected species in Lithuania.|$|E

25|$|<b>During</b> <b>last</b> week's game at Baltimore, the Colts' {{defense was}} {{the talk of}} the week, not their offense. This week was similar as the Colts {{surrendered}} only 3 points to the Jaguars. This game between AFC South division rivals was dominated by the running game for both teams, and the defensive lines. Colts QB Peyton Manning was 13 of 28 for 122 yards passing, with no touchdowns and an interception while Jacksonville QB Byron Leftwich finished the game 16 of 29 for 198 yards passing. Edgerrin James finished his day off with 27 carries for 128 yards rushing, and Jacksonville RB Fred Taylor finished with 16 carries for 81 yards. Jacksonville had seven fumbles in this game, but recovered every one of them. This game was scoreless until there was less than seven minutes to go in the third quarter.|$|E
25|$|The 3rd Army, {{with support}} of the German South Army, spearheaded the {{offensive}} against Russian positions in the Carpathian Mountains in January 1915 {{in an attempt to}} reverse the losses <b>during</b> <b>last</b> year's Galicia debacle. By then it had been built up to include fifteen infantry and four and a half cavalry divisions for the assault, which began on January 23 with the goal of securing the rail and communications hubs of Medzilaborce, Sambir, and Sanok. Despite some early successes against numerically inferior enemy units which allowed them to advance about 38 kilometers, the Habsburg troops suffered from a lack of reinforcements and logistical problems. The mountain winter weather also turned for the worse as the overstretched 3rd Army had to defend its line from Russian counteroffensives, as it occupied a large gap between two important passes on January 26. By early February, the Austro-Hungarian offensive had stalled without reaching the besieged Przemyśl fortress, and the Russians remained in control of the strategically important passes while 3rd Army divisions had been reduced to the size of brigades and lower. Thus it ended up losing its numerical advantage. By mid-February the Russian army had regained the initiative while the Austro-Hungarian troop strength had been badly depleted. The remaining men of 3rd Army were subjected to below freezing temperatures and other environmental dangers, lack of supplies, and no possibility of relief. By late February, it lost around 88,000 men—about 75% of its initial strength—and had to finally be reinforced by the newly-formed 2nd Army.|$|E

[...] Joginder Tuteja from Bollywood Hungama gave a rating 4 out 5 and wrote, [...] "Kaminey is certainly not a run of the mill album {{and this is where}} its prime strength lies. The album boasts of at least three chartbuster tracks'Dhan Te Nan' (sure shot superhit), 'Thode Bheege' (must for the hearts in love) and 'Raat Ke Dhai Baje' (for some 'masti' and 'hungama'). Songs like 'Fatak' and 'Kaminey' are innovative and situational which showcase the range of Vishal Bhardwaj.
