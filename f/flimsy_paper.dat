60|$|And now, fearing {{they might}} do more damage to the <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> people, they decided to go away. But first they thanked Miss Cuttenclip very warmly for her {{courtesy}} and kindness to them.|$|E
60|$|We {{took up a}} {{telegram}} that was lying {{on his desk and}} opened it. His face became a livid yellow. He put the <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> down with a slow, reluctant movement and took off his glasses.|$|E

50|$|A poster is a {{very simple}} and easy visual aid. Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. The biggest {{drawback}} of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional. Since a poster board <b>paper</b> is relatively <b>flimsy,</b> often the <b>paper</b> will bend or fall over. The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.|$|R
50|$|Around 1930, {{several types}} of thin, {{flexible}} records made of various plastic formulations were introduced in Europe, such as the German Phonycord, French Pathé Cellodisc, British Filmophone and Goodson, and Spanish Delfos records. In the US, this short-lived trend was represented by Hit of the Week records, which were made of a sturdy brown paper base coated with Durium, a lightweight synthetic resin. Apart from a tendency to low-frequency rumble due to their texture, their audio fidelity was equal to or better than most ordinary shellac records. Unusually, Hit of the Week records had a recording on one side only, an early record industry practice which other manufacturers had long since abandoned. As a consequence of being uncoated on the other side, they have a strong tendency to curl and now often {{require the use of}} a clip or weight around the turntable spindle to keep them sufficiently flat during play. A few releases had the performer's portrait printed on the uncoated paper side, or were imprinted there with advertising matter. They were issued in <b>flimsy</b> rice <b>paper</b> sleeves, few of which have survived.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Hauksbee {{was expecting}} some cut-out pattern things in <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> from a friend. As {{soon as she}} got the big square packet, therefore, she said, [...] "Oh, the DEAR creature!" [...] and tore it open with a paper-knife, and all the MS. {{enclosures}} tumbled out on the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Every morning, my bright boy, I {{get up and}} say to myself, 'Well! I reckon it's {{about time}} to take the route for London;' and every morning, if you'll believe me, I put it off till next day. Whether it's in the good feeding (expensive, I admit; but when your cook helps you to digest instead of {{hindering}} you, a man of my dyspeptic nation is too grateful to complain)--or whether it's in the air, which reminds me, I do assure you, of our native atmosphere at Coolspring, Mass., is more than I can tell, with a hard steel pen on a leaf of <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper.</b> You have heard the saying, 'When a good American dies, he goes to Paris'. Maybe, sometimes, he's smart enough to discount his own death, and rationally enjoy the future time in the present. This you see is a poetic light. But, mercy be praised, the moral of my residence in Paris is plain:--If I can't go to Amelius, Amelius must come to me. Note the address Grand Hotel; and pack up, like a good boy, on receipt of this. Memorandum: The brown Miss is here. I saw her taking the air in a carriage, and raised my hat. She looked the other way.|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a very}} {{important}} batch of papers in preparation at that time. It had to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand. It was not put into an official envelope, but a large, square, pale-pink one; the matter being in MS. on soft crinkley paper. It was addressed to [...] "The Head Clerk, etc., etc." [...] Now, between [...] "The Head Clerk, etc., etc.," [...] and [...] "Mrs. Hauksbee" [...] and a flourish, is no very great difference if the address be written in a very bad hand, as this was. The chaprassi who took the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis. He merely forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered, and so asked the first Englishman he met, who happened to be a man riding down to Annandale in a great hurry. The Englishman hardly looked, said: [...] "Hauksbee Sahib ki Mem," [...] and went on. So did the chaprasss, because that letter was the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over. There was no book to sign; he thrust the letter into Mrs. Hauksbee's bearer's hands and went off to smoke with a friend. Mrs. Hauksbee was expecting some cut-out pattern things in <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> from a friend. As soon as she got the big square packet, therefore, she said, [...] "Oh, the DEAR creature!" [...] and tore it open with a paper-knife, and all the MS. enclosures tumbled out on the floor.|$|E
60|$|Edie {{laid down}} the {{telegram}} with a sinking heart. In itself there was nothing so very strange in Harry's being detained by business; men are always being detained by business; {{she knew it was}} a way they had, a masculine peculiarity. But why had not Harry telegraphed himself? Why had he left the proprietor of Norton's Hotel to telegraph for him? Why was he at Norton's Hotel at all? And if he really was there, why could he not have written the telegram himself? It was very mysterious, perplexing, and inexplicable. Tears came into Edie's eyes, and she sat long looking at the <b>flimsy</b> pink Government <b>paper,</b> as if the mere inspection of the hateful message would help her to make out the meaning of the enclosed mystery.|$|R
5|$|Since {{fractional}} {{currency in}} three-cent denominations {{did not appear}} until late 1864, the cent was the only means then circulating of making change from the five-cent note, and came, in 1862 and 1863, to command a premium when sold in lots, of about 4%. The Philadelphia Mint tried {{to keep up with}} demand, limiting public purchases of cents to five dollars, and sending shipments to major cities. Despite these attempts, Mint Director James Pollock noted in his annual reports that cents were almost unobtainable, hoarded despite the fact that their metallic value remained less than one cent each. Numismatist Neil Carothers theorized that they were put aside by the public as the only circulating federal coinage, made of metal {{at a time when the}} public was forced to accept <b>flimsy</b> pieces of <b>paper</b> instead of silver and gold.|$|R
5000|$|Though {{he had not}} {{fought in}} a sanctioned MMA contest in eight years, Gracie claimed in 2008 that he could still beat the current top fighters easily. In an {{interview}} with Tokyo Sports, Gracie argued that Fedor Emelianenko was a great athlete, but possessed [...] "so-so" [...] technical ability, and that he (Gracie) was [...] "100% sure" [...] that he could defeat him. Two years after, Gracie stated that he disagreed with those who view Emelianenko as [...] "somehow special" [...] and that he believed Emelianenko deserved to lose the decision in his fight with Ricardo Arona; described Brock Lesnar as having [...] "zero defense from the bottom" [...] {{in the fight against}} Carwin; and criticized Shane Carwin for what he perceived were deficiencies in Carwin's jiu-jitsu game, characterizing him as [...] "strong as a bull but <b>flimsy</b> like a <b>paper</b> tiger." [...] Previous critical comments that Gracie made about Antônio Rodrigo Nogueira (claiming that Nogueira had [...] "no guard") prompted Wanderlei Silva to say that Gracie is [...] "living in a fantasy world" [...] and launch a new challenge to him.|$|R
6000|$|During {{his four}} days of {{seclusion}} he had received two messages from the outer world; from that world of Sambir which had, so suddenly and so finally, slipped from his grasp. One, a few words from Willems written on a torn-out page of a small notebook; the other, a communication from Abdulla caligraphed carefully on a large sheet of <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> and delivered {{to him in a}} green silk wrapper. The first he could not understand. It said: [...] "Come and see me. I am not afraid. Are you? W." [...] He tore it up angrily, but before the small bits of dirty paper had the time to flutter down and settle on the floor, the anger was gone and was replaced by a sentiment that induced him to go on his knees, pick up the fragments of the torn message, piece it together {{on the top of his}} chronometer box, and contemplate it long and thoughtfully, as if he had hoped to read the answer of the horrible riddle in the very form of the letters that went to make up that fresh insult. Abdulla's letter he read carefully and rammed it into his pocket, also with anger, but with anger that ended in a half-resigned, half-amused smile. He would never give in as long as there was a chance. [...] "It's generally the safest way to stick to the ship as long as she will swim," [...] was one of his favourite sayings: [...] "The safest and the right way. To abandon a craft because it leaks is easy--but poor work. Poor work!" [...] Yet he was intelligent enough to know when he was beaten, and to accept the situation like a man, without repining. When Almayer came on board that afternoon he handed him the letter without comment.|$|E
5000|$|The US Immediate vinyl LP {{looked the}} same as the British original, but was printed on <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> stock. The CBS/Immediate issue was always sold in a plastic bag with a {{foldover}} snap. The sound on the US was not as bright as the UK or most subsequent CD issues ...|$|E
5000|$|Whereas {{the former}} SPORTIS system was {{only able to}} print non-{{magnetic}}ally-encoded tickets on <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> rolls, AVANTIX Mobile can produce tickets both in this format and with magnetic stripe encoding on card tickets with a magnetic stripe. Paper tickets are provided in rolls of 450; card stock comes in [...] "fan-fold" [...] packs of 250 (however, roll-stock is no longer used as magnetically encoded card stock has become the Rail Settlement Plan standard).|$|E
50|$|Ten {{years after}} Crosfield's {{frustrated}} attempt {{to design a}} cheque sorting machine, the Scottish banks came to Crosfield {{and asked him to}} build a banknote sorting machine. The American equipment then used for cheque sorting could not handle the soft, light paper of used, sometimes sticky banknotes. In 1959, Crosfield set up a team of engineers at Fortress Road, London, and in 1964 they produced the first banknote sorting machines for the Scottish banks. He used optical character recognition and a new patented process for handling small, <b>flimsy</b> pieces of <b>paper,</b> called the 'Double curvature sheet feeder'. The banknote sorter was followed by machines for sorting and reading luncheon vouchers, postal orders and lottery tickets and for counting and dispensing banknotes. In 1966 Crosfield spun this new division off as Crosfield Business Machines, with its own management, offices, production and research in Watford. New equipment, built first for Nord West Lotto in Germany, coupled to small computers automatically printed out a list of prize winners and the weekly profit and tax liability for the lottery. Simultaneously a high-speed camera made a microfilm of the coupons as a security check. A few machines replaced hundreds of production staff. Another development, a sorting machine and 'garbler', first installed for the Dutch Central Bank, sorted good used banknotes from bad and bundled the good while shredding the bad, a task that formerly required a staff of thousands.|$|R
5000|$|A {{rare case}} of third party {{scenarios}} {{being done by}} license as an [...] "official" [...] product was the scenario pack released by World Wide Wargamers (WWW) in 1982, offered by The Wargamer Magazine, containing Scenarios 81-90 for Crescendo of Doom and released in 1982. The artwork published by WWW is poorly done on this offering, which was also printed on <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper,</b> in booklet style, rather than the separate card stock scenarios normally associated with Avalon Hill SL products. A second set was released for G.I.: Anvil of Victory.|$|E
40|$|M. Comm. (Industrial Psychology) The {{current study}} investigated, {{by means of}} an experiment, the {{influence}} of nonconscious incidental haptic sensation, encountered when completing self-report questionnaires, on formal ratings of a consumer brand. In total, 178 university students (mean age = 19. 82 years, males = 31. 5 %, females = 68. 5 %) participated in the study. Participants were allocated to one of two groups with Group 1 (n= 88) completing a questionnaire printed on rigid paper while Group 2 (n= 90) completed the same questionnaire printed on <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper.</b> The questionnaire scale was constructed using 28 sets of biploar pairs of adjectives related to the language association of rigidity and strength. An independent t-test revealed no differences between groups (t = 0. 67, p = 0. 50), but differences of distribution and polarisation of scores, evidenced by differences in kurtosis across groups (Group 1 : kurtosis = 1. 49, Group 2 : kurtosis = 0. 11), were apparent. In conclusion it appeared that a physically grounded mental framework, consistent with an embodied cognition approach to mental processes, had led to participants forming stronger product judgments when encountering an incidental, nonconscious, tactile experience of strength in a consumer context...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{familiar}} facts in monetary economics from an unfamiliar angle. It {{argues that it}} is not factual to regard the legal tender money and bank credit as of different genus: they work in tandem to the same ends in an economy, conventional or Islamic. Also, it does not matter what serves as money – solid gold or <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> – for keeping its value stable; only the blind would argue that staff is indispensable for walking. Money is just an instrument: it was never nor can ever be classified into Islamic and non-Islamic. What it does – good or bad – depends on how we use it. Money does not generate crises; its mismanagement does. It follows that the refuge the world is searching today from recurring financial crises does not lie in money substance: history testifies that national economies could not remain turmoil-free during the centuries of the yellow metal sway over the monetary scene. The paper concludes that it is the human factor that has been the source of good or evil for mankind including money matters. And the quality of human factor true religion can alone improve: morality without faith is rudderless. ...|$|E
40|$|M. Com. (Industrial Psychology) The {{current study}} investigated, {{by means of}} an experiment, the {{influence}} of incidental haptic sensations, encountered when completing self-report questionnaires, on formal ratings of an unestablished consumer brand. In total 128 university students (mean age = 20. 16 years, males = 31. 3 %, females = 68. 8 %) participated in the study. Initially, all the participants completed a pretest self-report questionnaire on standard weighted paper (80 gsm). A week later, the same participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} two experimental groups, where Group 1 (n= 64) completed a post-test self-report questionnaire on firm paper, and Group 2 (n= 64) completed a post-test self-report questionnaire on <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper.</b> The questionnaire scale comprised 30 sets of bipolar pairs of adjectives related to the language association of rigidity and strength. A robust Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) revealed a statistical difference between groups for scores between 80 and 104 on the pre-test, while no effect was found for scores of 109 and upwards. Further support of the hypothesis was evident in kurtosis across groups (Group 1 : kurtosis = 0. 73, Group 2 : kurtosis = - 0. 03), which indicated that more participants in Group 1 ('Firm') had formed stronger judgements of the unestablished consumer brand than those in Group 2 ('Flimsy'). In conclusion, it appeared that a physically grounded mental framework, consistent with embodied cognition, had nonconsciously led participants to form stronger product judgements, of an unestablished consumer brand, when encountering an incidental, tactile experience of strength when completing self-report questionnaires in the consumer context...|$|E
40|$|Utricularia is {{represented}} in Malaysia by two main kinds of plant, i. e., aquatic and terrestrial. The aquatic species can again {{be divided into two}} main groups, those which float freely in still water and those which are more or less anchored in and beneath shallow water. All of the aquatic species consist of long branching stolons bearing leaves which are divided into capillary segments and traps. The racemes of small yellow, violet, or purple flowers arise from the stolons and project a few inches above the surface of the water. The terrestrial species (including a few which are epiphytic) consist of slender rhizoids bearing linear, spathulate or peltate leaves and traps. These grow on or just below the surface of damp soil and are usually very inconspicuous. From these rhizoids arise the flowering scapes which are erect or twine round other plants and bear a few to many small yellow, white or purple flowers. In the few epiphytic species the rhizoids grow among moss on trees or rocks. Several of the terrestrial species often grow together and as they are all superficially alike, care is necessary to avoid making mixed gatherings. Some of the species exhibit a considerable amount of variation in the size and colouring of the flowers. In collecting Utricularia spp. {{it is very important to}} ensure that the specimens are complete, i. e., with flowers, leaves and traps, and if available ripe fruits. With the aquatic species the free floating plants can be lifted complete from the water and (preferably) ”floated out” on to <b>flimsy</b> <b>paper</b> before pressing. The anchored aquatic species must be lifted out with the mud which is carefully washed away before ”floating out”...|$|E
