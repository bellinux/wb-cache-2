Get some lessons learned about catalog design from the Hennepin County Library, who recently created a catalog from nothing. Find out how they handled some of these questions, found the right words and placement for features, and got a catalog design up and running (including an “All” search with features from dropping in an ISBN or other identifier, to calculating title popularity with its “best match” default sort). Specific topics will include new search workflow, making a very useful single search box, the never-quite-right add to list tool, what data is really useful on search results, what limiting options are most important, and more...|$|R

Horner and Bruce S. Corya <b>HOW</b> <b>DO</b> <b>YOU</b> DESIGN AN INSTRUMENT for the broad middle range of electronic counter appli cations? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> each user's needs pre cisely, yet offer room for future growth? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> decrease cost yet increase performance? The answers to these and many similar questions, we believe, {{are found in the}} new Model 5328 A Universal Counter, Fig. 1. This single instrument is the successor to six counters, Models 5326 A/B/C 1 and 5327 A/B/C. It offers improved performance, lower cost, and sever al new features. Its modular design makes it possible for a user to choose only the features he needs, yet leaves the door open for expansion at a later date. What It Is The 5328 A is basically a power supply and counter mainframe that supports user-selected op tions. In its standard configuration it offers a com plete portfolio of universal-counter functions: â€ ¢ Frequency â€ ” 100 -MHz direct count â€ ¢ Period â€ ” 100 -ns resolution> Period Average â€ ” 10 -MHz clock â€ ¢ Time Interval â€ ” 100 -ns single-shot resolutio...|$|R

40|$|A quick {{listen to}} Zuoxiao Zuzhou’s (左小祖咒）music {{would not be}} enough to explain his fame. His {{trademark}} is singing off key. In spite of the odd sounding vocals or perhaps because of its contrast to the saccharine sweet sounds of Chinese pop and rock, Zuoxiao has become one of China’s most successful rock musicians. He started his career in 1993 and has since produced ten albums. He has also published a best selling novel and created sculptures and artistic photography. He was {{a founding member of the}} avant garde artists residence called Beijing’s “East Village” in the early 1990 s where he first met Ai Weiwei and others whom he still collaborates with. Zuoxiao recently worked with the Canadian rock band Cowboy Junkies on their new album Renmin Park which came out in June. The Junkies covered one of his songs and asked him to do the vocals on another. The following is a compilation of two interviews I did with Zuoxiao regarding his collaboration with the Junkies and his own career as a Chinese musician, writer, and artist. TH: Can you explain why you have such a distinct singing style? What reactions has it gotten? ZXZZ: I’ve always wanted to make art more intimate and use a singing style that’s relatively easy to communicate with and to distill my art. But you know, when it comes to the aesthetics, most people stop at the level of enjoyment or its purported educational value, so there are people who say they like what I do. Others admire it. Others are indignant. There’s all kinds of reactions. TH: <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>meet</b> Michael Timmins of Cowboy Junkies? ZXZZ: We’ve never actually met, nor have we ever directly communicated because we speak different languages. For the last two years a rock critic named Eric Chen has been our go between and helped us communicate. I’m very thankful that Cowboy Junkies thought high enough of my work. Their cover of “I Cannot Sit Sadly by Your Side” has been better received than my own version...|$|E
