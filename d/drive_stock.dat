He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race.

The head of stock driven {{into and out of}} the town at this season to be sold by the local auctioneer was very large; and all these horned beasts, in travelling to and fro, sent women and children to shelter as nothing else could do. In the main the animals would have walked along quietly enough; but the Casterbridge tradition was that to <b>drive</b> <b>stock</b> it was indispensable that hideous cries, coupled with Yahoo antics and gestures, should be used, large sticks flourished, stray dogs called in, and in general everything done that was likely to infuriate the viciously disposed and terrify the mild. Nothing was commoner than for a house-holder on going out of his parlour to find his hall or passage full of little children, nursemaids, aged women, or a ladies' school, who apologized for their presence by saying, [...] "A bull passing down street from the sale." ...|$|E

A VAR modelling approach captures the short and long term effects of Twitter to stock price and stock price to Twitter. Effects were found for 5 of the 10 brand. For Coca-Cola and Toyota, the number of brand sentiment tweets <b>drives</b> <b>stock</b> price. For Microsoft and Disney the brand sentiment index (sentiment extracted from Twitter) <b>drives</b> <b>stock</b> price. For Nokia this relation is twisted, the <b>stock</b> price <b>drives</b> the number of brand sentiments tweets, the brand sentiment index and the number of followers.

These early squatters overlanded their stock through the New England district from Sydney as access to the Darling Downs through the penal settlement of Moreton Bay was not allowed, nor was any settlement within 50 miles of the penal colony permitted. This group of pastoralists were instrumental in settling the land which in subsequent decades was to become Queensland's prime pastoral and agricultural district and which also became a seat of political power in 19th century Queensland.|$|E

Previous empirical evidence on the index level indicates that the stock market’s reaction is business cycle dependent.

Our results suggest that during recessions labor market information affects primarily expected cash flows and equity risk premia while during expansions the interest rate interpretation dominates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} stock repurchase over a finite time horizon. We assume that a firm has a reservation price for the stock, which is the highest price that the firm {{is willing to pay}} to repurchase its own stock. We characterize the optimal policy for the trader to maximize the total number of shares he can buy over a fixed time horizon. In particular, we study a greedy policy, which involves in each period buying a quantity that <b>drives</b> <b>stock</b> price to the reservation price. Key words: stock repurchase, dynamic programming, reservation price. ...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{findings}} on herding behavior among institutional investors suggest that those market participants {{speed up the}} price adjustment to new information and as such stabilize stock prices. Other findings indicate the opposite, that institutional herds <b>drive</b> <b>stock</b> prices away from fundamental values, and thus destabilize stock prices. This study examines the effect that Swedish institutional investors have on the stock prices on the Stockholm Stock Exchange. More precisely, we analyze the relationship of institutional herding with future excess stock returns. Major findings from this paper suggest that persistent herding among Swedish institutional investors leads to future long-term return reversals, which to some extent indicates a destabilizing influence at long horizons...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the market efficiency consequences of accounting disclosure {{in the context}} of stock markets as a Keynesian beauty contest, an influential metaphor originally proposed by Keynes (1936) and recently formalized by Allen, Morris, and Shin (2006). In such markets, public information plays an additional commonality role, biasing stock prices away from the consensus fundamental value toward public information. Despite this bias, I demonstrate that provisions of public information always <b>drive</b> <b>stock</b> prices closer to the fundamental value. Hence, as a main source of public information, accounting disclosure enhances market efficiency, and transparency should not be compromised on grounds of the Keynesian-beauty-contest effect. ...|$|E
