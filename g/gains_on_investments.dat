50|$|The {{difference}} between UAWs and PAWs is wealth. Wealth is usually obtained through investment strategies that maximize unrealized (nontaxable) income and minimizes realized (taxable) income. UAWs tend {{to spend more}} time on purchasing a car than on looking at appreciating investments. Appreciating investments such as a 401k or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) constitute tax-deferred growth and produce an unrealized income for the individual holder. Some UAWs do hold a 401k or an IRA but with a low portfolio value. UAWs usually have the belief that in order to comply with the “Better Than” or “Better Off” theories, they need to maximize realized income. Maximized realized income minimizes unrealized income, increases taxes paid, and produces low portfolio values. Certainly there are some UAWs that invest in the stock market and are very active traders, but most don’t. Active traders move from stock to stock to try to maximize capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> based on daily fluctuations of the stock market. This investment strategy is very risky, but has potential for some enormous capital gains. UAWs also are more prone to being swindled out of money from cold callers. Cold callers, usually brokers who in fact know very little about the stock market, target high income earning families and persuade them into purchasing investments with them. Doctors and lawyers are especially susceptible. A vulnerability to cold callers can subject individuals to lose trust in the stock market and eventually become a UAW. Then there are UAWs that have relatively low risk tolerance for investments. Twenty percent of UAWs keep most of their cash in cash/near cash accounts (investment accounts such as a bank accounts that have low interest rates, high liquidity, and are federally insured) so that they can have quick access to cash when consumption habits rise. Then there are some UAWs who have considerable knowledge of the specific market of a company or type of investment, but do not utilize that knowledge to their advantage. The Millionaire Next Door uses Mr. Willis as an example. He is a six-figure, very successful executive for Walmart. He has been employed there for 10 years, during which the company has been explosively growing. Stock prices have shot up in this 10-year period of time. During this enormous growth period, Mr. Willis bought zero shares of the company he worked for, although he had firsthand knowledge of its success. A characteristic that determines if the individual is a UAW is their belief about investing. A UAW will usually state the following about investing: “it’s hopeless,” or “I never have the time needed to make it pay off,” or “we have never made so much… but the more we earn, the less we seem to accumulate.” Other remarks might include, “Our careers take up all of our time,” or “I don’t have 20 hours a week to fool around with my money”. A UAW does not spend a considerable amount of time evaluating their investment strategies. On average, they’ll invest only 4.6 hours a month evaluating their investment portfolios. This is about 83% less than the amount of time a PAW allocates to financial planning. Minimal time dedicated to financial planning is a leading indicator of a UAW.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} use of equity capital in the property-liability {{insurance}} industry. The objective is {{to determine whether the}} sharp decline in leverage over the past fifteen years represents the over-utilization of capital or a rational response to changing market conditions. Using best practice technical, cost, and revenue frontiers, estimated using data envelopment analysis (DEA), we estimate each insurer’s optimal capital utilization, which we compare with actual capital utilization. We conclude that measured capital over-utilization represents a true inefficiency which adversely affects firm financial performance. We also find that the decline in leverage was primarily attributable to capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> and provide evidence that insurers are reluctant to pay out capital accumulations as dividends, even if it means overutilizing capital.

40|$|Time-separability is a {{conventional}} assumption of utilities in financial economics. It produces often unrealistic results. This problem is solvable by ap-plying more general utility formulation. One generally used unconventional utility formulation is habit formation in preferences, {{which is a}} more general form of the utility function. It assumes that utility in period t depends on not just consumption in same period but also the level of consumption in the previous periods. This means that a consumer does not like consume less than his living standard today Some empirical studies implies that habit utilities is better description of consumer's behavior than time-separable utilities. In the seminal paper, Merton(1971) examines the continuous-time consumption-portfolio problem for an individual whose income is generated by capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>investments</b> in assets with prices assumed to satisfy the geometric Brownian motion hypothesis. The consumer/investor invests his wealth in risky assets and in a risk-free asset, whose rate of return is constant. Merton solves optimization problem using Ito's Rule and finds out the optimal consumption and portfolio choice. Merton assumes that the consumer's utiHties are time-separable. The optimal consumption can also be solved by the martingale approach. Then the dynamic problem can be reformulated as a static problem. Habit utility function {{can be applied to}} the Merton's problem. In this study, I review how the assumption of habit utilities changes the optimal consumption and investment choice. I consider different cases. In the sinrplest case the coefficients of interest and stock markets and the coefficients of habit utility function are assumed to be deterministic. In the more general case, these coefficients are assumed to be stochastic. In the literature has been shown isomorphism between solutions in the separable and linear habit cases. This isomorphism is useful for solving the problem in the habit case. Solutions in the separable case can transform to corresponding solutions with habit formation. I use this isomorphism in the case where all investment opportunities are stochastic. I also consider an interesting situation in which non-addictive consumption has been assumed. This assumption changes significantly results. Generally consumer/investor with habit presence invests less in the risky assets than consumer/investor with time-separable utilities. Through research, I accept the common assumption of complete markets. It makes easier or even possible to find closed-form solutions. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Despite the {{economic}} slowdown, {{the profitability of}} the U. S. commercial banking industry remained high in 2001. Although the weak economy contributed to a sharp rise in provisions for loan and lease losses, those losses were offset {{in large part by}} an advance in realized <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> account securities as banks' portfolios benefited from declining short- and intermediate-term market interest rates. Profits were also supported by reductions in noninterest expense, as large merger-related charges in 2000 were not repeated last year. Lower short-term interest rates also spurred a rapid increase in core deposits, which provided banks with plentiful, low-interest-rate funding. The expansion of bank balance sheets was slower in 2001 than in the preceding year, as weaker economic activity held down growth in loans to businesses. Loans to households advanced relatively rapidly, though at a somewhat slower pace than in 2000. An increase in the share of banks' portfolios consisting of mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies, which have lower risk weights than loans, together with continued strong earnings, contributed to an increase in risk-based capital ratios.

40|$|An {{investment}} that {{is characterized by}} exit flexibility requires both decisions <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> and holding period. As selling an investment often leads to tax-liable capital gains and capital <b>gains</b> crucially depend <b>on</b> the duration of an investment we investigate the impact of capital <b>gains</b> taxation <b>on</b> the holding period under three different tax systems. In our analytical investigation we examine {{whether there is an}} optimal exit time and if there is no optimal exit time, what would be an appropriate time of sale. Moreover, we determine the worst exit time which should be avoided by investors. We find that while often an immediate sale is optimal longer holding periods may be beneficial under certain conditions. Beyond the well-known impact of the retention policy we clarify that the minimal holding period particularly depends on the degree of income and corporate tax integration. We find, e. g., a high retention rate to extend the minimum holding period under a shareholder relief tax system but is likely to accelerate sales under a classic corporate tax system. These results help to anticipate the economic implications of capital <b>gains</b> taxes <b>on</b> <b>investment.</b> Obviously, depending <b>on</b> the underlying tax system the after-tax profitability of long-term and sustainable investments is particularly affected by capital gains taxes.

30|$|Whereas each {{of these}} {{intangible}} resources is essential for an entrepreneur, an individual who has both high psychological capital and high social competence might enjoy even higher levels of success. The findings of Study 1 revealed that the interaction between psychological capital and relational capital has significant effects on entrepreneurial performance. The findings of Study 2 further show significant effects of interactions between psychological capital and social intelligence on subjective outcomes (satisfaction and wellbeing). Specifically, entrepreneurs reported high entrepreneurial performance, satisfaction, and wellbeing when both psychological well-being and relational capital or social intelligence were high. Our findings indicate that these social competencies support the meaningful application of one’s psychological resources. For example, an entrepreneur with high psychological capital is likely to use the social networks for marketing, fundraising, and <b>gaining</b> information <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> opportunities. Strong social competence is also more useful if the entrepreneur has the psychological strength to identify and exploit opportunities in social relationships.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of capital <b>gains</b> taxes <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> decisions {{is a central}} issue of accounting and public finance research. However, the implications of capital <b>gains</b> taxes <b>on</b> investors' willingness to invest in irreversible projects with entry and exit flexibility {{have not yet been}} a focal issue. As a result, the effects of taxing capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> the interdependencies of investment and divestment decisions have to be identified, especially under timing flexibility. This paper closes this gap by simultaneously analyzing investment timing and abandonment decisions for risky irreversible investment projects with uncertain cash flows under differential tax rates for ordinary income and capital gains. We investigate whether capital gains taxes affect immediate and delayed investment asymmetrically. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of capital <b>gains</b> taxation <b>on</b> the optimal abandonment decision. Performing extensive numerical simulations we find that varying the liquidation proceeds affects the decision whether or not to postpone the investment decision. Higher cash flow volatility favors delayed investment. We find that the introduction of capital gains taxation tends to be harmful for immediate investment. Moreover, we show that taxing capital gains may induce a tax paradox for delayed <b>investment.</b> Depending <b>on</b> the pre-tax parameter setting the future value of delayed investment may even increase in absolute terms for increasing capital gains tax rates. For sufficiently high liquidation proceeds capital gains taxation tends to favor continuation of a project. We find taxing capital gains mainly induces other, but not necessarily less arbitrary distortions than exempting capital gains. [...] ...|$|R
