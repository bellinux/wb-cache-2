5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is {{distinguished}} from other Oryzomys species by its short rostrum, {{the form of}} its incisive foramina, the absence of sphenopalatine vacuities, and the near absence of a subsquamosal fenestra. Within the species, the Colombian specimen differs from the Venezuelan animals in being larger in some measurements, but having smaller teeth, and in having oddly shaped wear <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incisors. The Colombian animal was probably kept in captivity for some time after it was caught, which would explain its large size and odd wear facets. There are no substantial differences between mainland O.gorgasi and material from Cura√ßao.|$|E

5|$|Electric Music for the Mind and Body was {{released}} on May 11, 1967. Much of the album's material continued to expand upon the band's new psychedelic medium, with it embracing all <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members' influences, which ranged from their folk roots, blues, raga rock and hard rock. The album also saw Cohen coming forward in a larger role with inventive distorted-organ melodies. In addition, McDonald's lyrical content, which brazenly pronounced topics of political protest, recreational drug use, and love, augmented by satirical humor, clearly introduced the band's orientation and message. The compositional structures followed discrete movement patterns emulating the style of John Fahey, whom McDonald admired. Though Electric Music for the Mind and Body {{was among the most}} complex works to date, it possessed the quality that several other San Francisco acts shared of being recorded mostly live, with only the vocals being overdubbed after the instrumentals were completed.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{interaction}} between sea otters {{and the human}} economy are not as immediately felt. Sea otters have been credited with contributing to the kelp harvesting industry via their well-known role in controlling sea urchin populations; kelp {{is used in the}} production of diverse food and pharmaceutical products. Although human divers harvest red sea urchins both for food and to protect the kelp, sea otters hunt more sea urchin species and are more consistently effective in controlling these populations. The health of the kelp forest ecosystem is significant in nurturing populations of fish, including commercially important fish species. In some areas, sea otters are popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to local hotels, restaurants, and sea otter-watching expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} skull, the {{skeleton}} of Istiodactylus was {{similar to those of}} other ornithocheiroid pterosaurs. The vertebral column, forelimb, and trunk bones were pneumatised by air sacs. The neural arches of the vertebrae had tall, sloping laminae. The notarium (a structure consisting of fused vertebrae in the shoulder-region of some pterosaurs and birds) consisted of six fused trunk vertebrae, with their neural spines fused into a plate, on which the shoulder blades articulated with a depression on each side. The main part of the sternum was very deep, with a bowed front edge and a shallow, triangular keel. The <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sternum that contacted with the coracoids were saddle-shaped and arranged asymmetrically. The humerus (upper arm bone) was stout and had a sharply curved deltopectoral crest. The forelimbs of istiodactylids were large, up to 4.5 times longer than their legs. The long wing-finger may have occupied 50 percent of the wing-skeleton. The hindlimbs were short compared to the forelimbs, and the feet were as long as the small third finger.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not entirely}} certain what pachycephalosaurs ate; having very small, ridged teeth {{they could not have}} chewed tough, fibrous plants as {{effectively}} as other dinosaurs of the same period. It is assumed that their sharp, serrated teeth were ideally suited for a mixed diet of leaves, seeds, fruit and insects. Stegoceras may have had an entirely herbivorous diet, as the tooth crowns were similar to those of iguanid lizards. The premaxillary teeth show wear facets from contact with the predentary bone, and the maxillary teeth have double wear facets similar to those seen in other ornithischian dinosaurs. Every third maxillary tooth of UALVP 2 are erupting replacement teeth, and tooth replacement happened in backwards progression in sequential threes. The occipital region of Stegoceras was well-demarcated for muscle-attachment and it is believed that the jaw movement of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs was mostly limited to up-and-down motions with only a slight capability for jaw rotation. This is based on the structure of the jaw and dental microwear and wear <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teeth indicate that the bite-force was used more for shearing than for crushing.|$|E

5|$|Much {{controversy}} has surrounded {{the question of}} whether or not, and to what degree, Heterodontosaurus showed the continuous tooth replacement that is typical for other dinosaurs and reptiles. In 1974 and 1978, Thulborn found that the skulls known at that time lacked any indications of continuous tooth replacement: The cheek teeth of the known skulls are worn uniformly, indicating that they formed simultaneously. Newly erupted teeth are absent. Further evidence was derived from the wear <b>facets</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> teeth, which were formed by tooth-to-tooth contact of the lower with the upper dentition. The wear facets were merged into one another, forming a continuous surface along the complete tooth row. This surface indicates that food procession was achieved by back and forth movements of the jaws, not by simple vertical movements which was the case in related dinosaurs such as Fabrosaurus. Back and forth movements are only possible if the teeth are worn uniformly, again strengthening the case for the lack of a continuous tooth replacement. Simultaneously, Thulborn stressed that a regular tooth replacement was essential for these animals, as the supposed diet consisting of tough plant material would have led to quick abrasion of the teeth. These observations led Thulborn to conclude that Heterodontosaurus must have replaced its entire set of teeth at once on a regular basis. Such a complete replacement could only have been possible within phases of aestivation, when the animal did not fed. Aestivation also complies with the supposed habitat of the animals, which would have been desert-like, including hot dry seasons when food was scarce.|$|E

40|$|In {{polyhedral}} combinatorics one {{often has}} to analyze <b>the</b> facial structure <b>of</b> less than full dimensional polyhedra. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> implicit or explicit equations in the linear system defining such a polyhedron leads to technical difficulties when analyzing its facial structure. It is therefore customary to approach <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> such a polytope P through <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> {{one of its}} (full dimensional) relaxations (monotonizations) known as the submissive and <b>the</b> dominant <b>of</b> P. Finding sufficient conditions for an inequality that induces a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> submissive or <b>the</b> dominant <b>of</b> a polyhedron to also induce a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> polyhedron itself has been posed in the literature as an important research problem. Our paper {{goes a long way}} towards solving this problem. We address the problem in <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> a generalized monotonization of a polyhedron P, g-mon (P), that subsumes both the submissive and the dominant, and give a sufficient condition for an inequality that defines a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> g-mon(P) to define a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> P. For <b>the</b> important cases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traveling salesman (TS) polytope in both its symmetric and asymmetric variants, and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> linear ordering polytope, we give sufficient conditions trivially easy to verify, for a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monotone completion to define a <b>facet</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original polytope itself. ...|$|R
