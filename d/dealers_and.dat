5|$|The square is a hangout {{for drug}} users. An {{estimated}} 70 percent of teenagers who {{hang out in}} the square take drugs. The open, street-level basement of the Kikar Zion Hotel is a well-known haunt for both drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|At one time, Bond Street {{was best}} known for top-end art <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> antique shops that were {{clustered}} around the London office of Sotheby's auction house, which has been at Nos.34–35 Bond Street since 1917, and the Fine Art Society, founded in 1876. The sculpture over the entrance to Sotheby's is from Ancient Egypt and is believed to date from around 1600 BC. It is the oldest outdoor sculpture in London.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1990s, the O Street Market had once more become dilapidated. The {{structure}} fell into disrepair, trash collected around the building, many vendors were squatters without leases, and drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> gang members loitered nearby, driving customers away. The building's owner fell behind on tax payments, {{and the city}} threatened to place a lien on the building and foreclose.|$|E

5|$|Hergé took {{influence}} from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, particularly his books Secrets of the Red Sea and The Hashish Cruise. Having {{lived through the}} First World War, Hergé disliked arms <b>dealers,</b> <b>and</b> used Monfreid {{as the basis for}} the gunrunner character in Cigars.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{substantial}} hobby devoted to collecting old toy soldiers, {{with an abundance of}} small manufacturers, <b>dealers,</b> <b>and</b> toy soldier shows. There are published articles of these figures in some magazines, such as Plastic Warrior Magazine, and there are also published books totally or partially devoted to these figures.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduation}} from CCNY, Shakur briefly joined the Black Panther Party (BPP). She soon left the party, disliking the macho {{behavior of the}} men and believing that the BPP lacked knowledge and understanding of United States black history. Shakur then joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an offshoot of the BPP whose members, inspired by the Vietcong and the Battle of Algiers, led a campaign of armed struggle against the U.S. government using tactics such as planting bombs, holding up banks and executing drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> police.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} hotel, policemen Lobo and Lele kill three drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> collect a guitar case {{containing}} cocaine, which they must deliver to drug lord Tashi. Charlie {{and his men}} invade the jockey's hotel room and take all his possessions. The ensuing chase leads to the hotel car park where Lobo and Lele are placing the guitar case in their van. Charlie and his men seize the van {{to escape from the}} jockey's men and realise they had stolen a police vehicle, whilst also discovering the cocaine, which Charlie steals to sell. The policemen, upon returning, discover that the cocaine is missing and set out to find Charlie.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile eggs were scarcer and the ducks were {{more susceptible to}} disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|Connoisseurship in {{the late}} Ming period {{centered}} on these items of refined artistic taste, which provided work for art <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> even underground scammers who themselves made imitations and false attributions. The Jesuit Matteo Ricci while staying in Nanjing wrote that Chinese scam artists were ingenious at making forgeries and huge profits. However, there were guides to help the wary new connoisseur; Liu Tong (died 1637) wrote a book printed in 1635 that told his readers how to spot fake and authentic pieces of art. He revealed that a Xuande era (1426–1435) bronzework could be authenticated by judging its sheen; porcelain wares from the Yongle era (1402–1424) could be judged authentic by their thickness.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> to prosecute unlicensed sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the initial}} {{popularity}} of the PowerBook100 did not last. Sales decreased, and by December 1991 the 140 and 170 models had become more popular because customers {{were willing to pay}} more for a built-in floppy disk drive and second serial port, which the PowerBook100 lacked. By August 10, 1992, Apple quietly dropped the PowerBook100 from its price list but continued to sell existing stock through its own <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> alternative discount consumer-oriented stores such as Price Club. In these stores, a 4MB RAM/40MB hard drive configuration with a floppy drive sold for less than $1,000 (more than $1,500 less than the similar 2MB/20MB configuration's original list price).|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} home in Nova Scotia; a suburb of Toronto, Ontario; and a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. Her mother managed stores in the wedding {{industry}} and her father was a police officer with a vice squad, arresting drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> pimps. While she was growing up, Falle had multiple family members with addictions. When she was a young teenager, Falle's parents divorced, and she subsequently lived in a single-parent home with her mother. They moved into an apartment in downtown Toronto. Falle's father did not pay her mother alimony and there was often no money for food, so Falle began stealing food to survive.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much of the drama encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|Some <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> antique shops remain, {{but many}} of the shops have come to be {{occupied}} by fashion boutiques, some branches of global designer brands. The street still has a reputation as a fashionable place for shopping, including the flagship stores of Ralph Lauren and Cartier. Fenwick have had a department store on Bond Street since 1891. The Phillips building at No.101 is still used for auctions; the company was bought in 2001 by Bonhams, who spent £30million expanding and refurbishing the premises. In 2015, Valentino announced plans to build a new flagship store on Old Bond Street.|$|E
5|$|The bat'leth is {{considered}} an iconic image of the Star Trek universe. Replicas are widespread and are considered collectibles by some {{and a part of}} Klingon costume. A number of outlets, including replica merchants, weapons <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> pawn shops sell them. Ronald D. Moore, who has worked on Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica, displays one in his office. However, due to the dangers that real bat'leths can pose, no officially licensed replicas of the weapon are available from either Curry or Paramount Pictures.|$|E

Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, but he and his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the game}} {{takes place in the}} Mojave Wasteland, which {{encompasses}} parts of the former states of California, Nevada and Arizona. Along with the three main factions, the region also has a number of minor factions which include: Boomers – a tribe of heavily armed former vault dwellers who have taken shelter at Nellis Air Force Base; Powder Gangers – a violent group of escaped convicts; Great Khans – a tribe of drug <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> raiders; and the Brotherhood of Steel – technology-craving remnants of the U.S. Army, who are attempting to secure any technology that could cause significant harm. Along with the Hoover Dam and Nellis Air Force Base, the region has additional landmarks, including its own vaults and the HELIOS One solar energy plant.|$|E
5|$|Quite often {{milestone}} {{home runs}} such as round hundred and career records are considered breaking news, and sports news services give coverage to countdowns on impending milestone home runs. Several of Bonds' milestone home runs were given dedicated coverage on ESPN BottomLine, with Chasing Ruth and Chasing Aaron coverage being quite extensive {{for the few}} seasons preceding {{the breaking of the}} record. Sports collectible <b>dealers</b> <b>and</b> buyers pay exorbitant sums for paraphernalia associated with such milestones. The Baseball Hall of Fame covets such paraphernalia for display. In fact, players are even sensitive {{to the way in which}} their paraphernalia is displayed. A baseball that was hit for a milestone causes such a mêlée and such hysteria that special balls have to be used to stop counterfeiting, and police escorts are necessary for those who catch such balls.|$|E
