50|$|Although <b>isooctanol</b> (and the derived isooctyl prefix) is {{commonly}} used in industry to refer to 2-ethylhexanol and its derivatives, IUPAC naming conventions dictate that this name is properly applied to another isomer of octanol, 6-methylheptan-1-ol. The Chemical Abstracts Service likewise indexes <b>isooctanol</b> (CAS# 26952-21-6) as 6-methylheptan-1-ol.|$|E
40|$|A {{synergistic}} {{solvent extraction}} method for recovering chromium (III) was proposed using the mixed extractant consisting of di (2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA) and <b>isooctanol.</b> Based on the synergistic effect {{and the price}} of extractant, <b>isooctanol</b> was selected as the effective synergistic extractant in the D 2 EHPA-based extraction system. The chromium (III) extraction was found to increase and then decrease with increasing <b>isooctanol</b> concentration. The effects of D 2 EHPA concentration, initial pH, contact time, temperature, and anions concentration on the synergistic extraction of chromium (III) were investigated. The comparative study on the stripping of chromium from the loaded D 2 EHPA-isooctanol and the loaded D 2 EHPA was carried out. Based on the experiment results and the analysis of UV-vis and FT-IR spectra, the mechanism on the synergistic extraction of chromium (HI) by D 2 EHPA-isooctanol mixed extractant was discussed.

40|$|Abstract: TPA was {{synthesized}} by a {{two step}} reaction. Firstly, water-soluble coal acids (CA) {{was obtained by}} oxygen-oxidation at 260 °C in all aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide, and then crud TPA was got by isomerization of the CA with the existence of CdCO 3 catalyst and CO 2 pressure. The optimum reaction conditions to get crude TPA were 4 % amount of CdCO 3 catalyst, and reacted at 420 °C with initial 3. 0 MPa CO 2 pressure. Pure TPA was obtained by a separation step and the yield of pure TPA is 37. 16 % (based on CA). Furthermore, DOTP was synthesized by the refined TPA and <b>isooctanol.</b> The influence of mole ratio of TPA and <b>isooctanol,</b> amount of catalyst and reaction time on the final yield of DOTP were discussed. The purity of TPA was detected by HPLC and DOTP was detected by FT-IR, 1 H-NMR to get confirmatory results...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Twenty nine {{components}} {{were identified in}} the essential oils of the leaves and seeds of Callitris glauca by hydro distillation and were analysed by means of gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. (GC-MS). Twenty two {{components were}} found and identified in the leaf essential oil. The major components are aromandendrene (19. 45 %) α-limonene (i 5. 60 %), santolinatriene (11. 59 %) and Patchoulene (6. 09 %). The oil yield was (0. 18 %) v/w of wet sample of the leaf essential oil and (0. 38 %) v/w of the seed essential oil. Eleven components were identified in the seed essential oil with the main components being E- 9 -tetradecenyl-acetate (21. 70 %), Z- 10 -pentadecen- 1 -ol (21. 80 %), Hydrofol acid (18. 1 %), <b>isooctanol</b> (9. 80 %), trans-β-ocimene (5. 50 %), and IR-α-pinene (5. 00 %). The quantitative and qualitative compositions of the two essential oils were considerably different...|$|E
40|$|The ethanolic extract of {{the stem}} barks of Dacryodes edulis yielded yellow oil (2. 68 g). The oil was {{subjected}} to GC-MSstudies. Thirteen components were identified with ascorbic acid (21. 02 %) constituting {{the bulk of the}} oil, followed by 6 -Octadecenoic acid (Z) (20. 06 %) and Octadecanoic acid contained (13. 70 %) of the oil. Other monoterpenoids, oxygenatedcomponents and fatty acids identified include <b>isooctanol</b> (1. 60 %), 8 -methyl- 1 -decene (3. 18 %), 2 -Butenedioc acid (Z) monododecyl ester (6. 37 %), Hexadecanoic acid (6. 05 %), 9 -Tricosene (Z) (7 %), 2, 3 -Diazabicyclo [2. 2. 1] hept- 2 -ene(7. 96 %), 1 -Hexadecanol (6. 37 %) 1 -Isopropyl- 1 -methyl- 2 -nonylcyclopropane (4. 78 %) while 2 -(2 H- 1, 2, 3 -Benzotriazol- 2 -yl) - 4 -methylpheny- 3 -benzoate and 3 -methyl- 4 -heptanone constitutes (0. 96 %) respectively of the oil. The volatile oils displayedantibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. This result lend credence for the use of Dacryodes edulis stem bark extract in phytomedicine for the treatment of cough,ringworms, craw-craw and wounds in Nigeria...|$|E
