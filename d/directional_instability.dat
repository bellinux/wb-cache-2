25|$|The Tudor I {{suffered}} {{from a number of}} stability problems, which included longitudinal and <b>directional</b> <b>instability.</b> The problem was handed over to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at RAE Farnborough, where an extensive programme of testing was carried out, the test pilot being Eric Brown. Following the RAE's recommendations, a larger tailplane was fitted, and the original finely curved fin and rudder were replaced by larger vertical surfaces. BOAC added to the delays by requesting more than 340 modifications, and finally rejected the Tudor I on 11 April 1947, considering it incapable of North Atlantic operations. It had been intended that 12 Tudors would be built in Australia for military transport, but this plan was abandoned.|$|E

While in flight, the Goblin was stable, easy to fly, and recoverable from spins, although initial estimates of a 648mph (1,043km/h) top speed proved optimistic. The first test flights revealed that turbulence during {{approach to the}} B-29 was significant, leading to the addition of upper and lower fins at the extreme rear fuselage, {{as well as two}} wingtip fins to compensate for the increased <b>directional</b> <b>instability</b> in docking. All the initial flights had the hook secured in a fixed position, but when the hook was stowed and later raised, the resulting buffeting added to the difficulty in attempting a hookup.

[...] When testing resumed, on the 18 March 1948 test flight, Schoch continued to have difficulty in hooking up, striking and damaging the trapeze's nose-stabilizing section, before resorting to another emergency belly landing.

50|$|The {{summary of}} the {{investigation}} said the testing results for the VZ-5 were not favorable:The investigation showed that the airplane was unstable over the speed range {{and could not be}} trimmed about the actual center of gravity at 0.64 chord for the low speed. In order to provide a reasonable degree of longitudinal stability for the basic airplane configuration and a bare capability of trim over the flap deflection range, it would be necessary to ballast the airplane to move the center of gravity far ahead of its actual location. About 700 pounds of weight added to the cockpit area would be necessary to move the center of gravity the required amount. The airplane can develop a hovering lift of about 4,000 pounds which is approximately equal to its weight. The airplane had very high effective dihedral which, coupled with the certain <b>directional</b> <b>instabilities,</b> would be expected to produce highly undesirable flying qualities.”Since the VZ-5 was only ground and wind tunnel tested, exactly how those “undesirable flying qualities” would have become manifest in test fights never became known.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} theoretical study of transverse exciton-polariton patterns in semiconductor quantum-well microcavities. These patterns are initiated by <b>directional</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the uniform pump-generated polariton field and are measured as optical patterns in a transverse {{plane in the}} far field. Based on a microscopic many-particle theory, we investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of the formation, selection, and optical control of these patterns. An {{emphasis is placed on}} a previously proposed low-intensity, all-optical switching scheme designed to exploit these instability-driven patterns. Simulations and detailed analyses of simplified and more physically transparent models are used. Two aspects are studied in detail. First we study the dependencies of the stability behaviors of various patterns, as well as transition time scales, on parameters relevant to the switching action(the degree of built-in azimuthal anisotropy in the system and the switching beam intensity). It is found that if the parameters are varied, the pattern system undergoes abrupt transitions at threshold parameter values which are accompanied by multiple-stability and hysteresis behaviors. Moreover, during a real-time switching action, the transient dynamics of the system may depend significantly on the proximity of unstable patterns. The second aspect is a classification and detailed analysis of the polariton scattering processes contributing to the pattern dynamics, giving us an understanding of the selection and control of patterns as results of these processes' intricate interplay. The crucial role played by the relative phases of the polariton field in determining the gains or losses of polariton densities in various momentum modes is highlighted, and interpretation of the actions of the various processes in terms of concepts commonly used in classical pattern-forming systems is given.

40|$|Slender {{reinforced}} concrete prefabricated piles (relationship length/diameter> 30) {{are subject to}} imposed displacements when driven through thick layers of submerged soft clay.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} by Ludwig Prandtl in 1904 the boundary layer theory {{is an important}} part of aerodynamics and its research continues until the present day. In general the changes occuring within the range of flow boundary layers have a wide influence and affect the flow field far beyond. This property holds equally true for the transitional process as the shift of flow from a well ordered laminar state into full turbulence not only affects the boundary layer region itself but takes influence on the entire flow field. The transitional process is initiated by instabilities in the velocity and the pressure flow field. The occuring boundary layer instabilities then can be grouped by their way of <b>directional</b> propagation. Tollmien-Schlichting <b>instabilities</b> develop into the main flow direction while for cross flow boundary layer instabilities, propagation takes place rectangularly with respect to the main flow. The significant role of the boundary layer makes an impact on technical applications. For engineers the most important occurence of cross flow boundary instabilities can be found in the flow around aircraft wings. One characteristic aircraft design property for flight at transsonical flow is the utilisation of swept wings. For this appilication it is precisely the cross flow boundary layer instabilities which are responsibile for the initiation of transition. Typically the transition begins near the leading egde of the wing. As transition is directly related to the flow resistance the hope for future applications is to take influence on the instability development process in a way that a delay or even avoidance of flow transition could take place. If this can be achieved a significant reduction of the flow resistance could be attained and hence improve the fuel efficiency of modern aircraft. However, influence mechanisms regarding cross flow boundary layer instabilities are not well understood...|$|R

However, the consequent rearrangement of the cooling system made the cars vulnerable to overheating, and all three retired from the race. The Peter Whitehead-Ian Stewart and Tony Rolt/Duncan Hamilton cars blew head gaskets, and the Stirling Moss-Peter Walker car, the only one not overheating having had a full-sized radiator hurriedly fitted, lost oil pressure after a mechanical breakage. Testing by Norman Dewis at MIRA after the race proved that the overheating was caused more by the revisions to the cooling system than by the altered aerodynamics: the water pump pulley was undersized, so it was spinning too fast and causing cavitation; also the header tank was in front of the passenger-side bulkhead, far from the radiator, and the tubing diameter was too small at 7/8 inch. With the pump pulley enlarged, and the tubing increased to 1 1/4 inch, the problem was eliminated.

5000|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the two types was the use of [...] Eagle VIII engines (£1,622/10/- £1,622.50 each). Unlike the earlier version, this engine was not built in right-handed and left-handed versions, because production of engines of both types for engine type approval had been difficult; wind tunnel tests at the NPL established that the counter-rotating propellers were a cause of the <b>directional</b> <b>instability</b> of the O/100. It was realised that only one version was necessary, simplifying production and maintenance; the torque effect was overcome by offsetting the fin slightly. The O/400 had a strengthened fuselage, an increased bomb load, the nacelle tanks were removed and the fuel was carried in two 130 imp gal fuselage tanks, supplying a pair of 15 imp gal gravity tanks. The new nacelles were smaller and had simplified supporting struts; the reduction of drag producing an improvement in maximum speed and altitude. The revised nacelle was tested in 3188, which in 1917 was flown at Martlesham Heath with a variety of engine installations. An initial order for 100 of the revised design, with Sunbeam Maori or Eagle engines, was placed on 14 August but cancelled shortly afterwards. Twelve sets of Cricklewood-built components were transferred to the Royal Aircraft Factory, where they were assembled into the first production O/400s. More than 400 were supplied before the Armistice at a price of £6,000 each. Another 107 were licence-built in the USA by the Standard Aircraft Corporation (out of 1,500 ordered by the air corps). Forty-six out of an order for fifty were built by Clayton & Shuttleworth in Lincoln.|$|E
