40|$|Many epidemiologists {{conducting}} case-control studies {{choose to}} dichotomize their exposure data {{to make the}} analysis of the data easier and its presentation more straightforward. The choice of a specific rule for dichotomization can have a large effect on the outcome measure, the odds ratio, although this effect is rarely studied. The authors present a graphic approach for exploring this effect, the quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot. By examining a Q-Q plot, an investigator simultaneously gains information about the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> among cases, the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> among controls, and odds ratios at all possible cutpoints and their standard errors. In addition, by finding the slope at each point along the Q-Q curve, it is possible to estimate the rate ratios for each possible value of exposure. The authors view the use of the Q-Q plot as an exploratory tool. It enables the investigator to become more familiar with the data and check for irregularities such as outliers, nonlinearities, or nonmonotonic dose-response curves, and idiosyncratic variations of the odds ratio.

(2004) obtained exposure data from various industries where spraying was used, and found five measures characterizing peak exposure. In general, the profile <b>of</b> variation <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> con-centration is expressed using distribution and auto-correlation. <b>Distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> concentration is described as log-normal, which is expressed by two parameters: geometric mean (mg) and geometric stan-dard deviation (sg). mg and sg represent exposure intensity and magnitude <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> variability, respectively. Autocorrelation is expressed by the autocorrelation coefficient (r). r is the correlation coefficient between two exposure concentrations at different times, and relates to the speed <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> variability. It is helpful to consider the relationships between these three parameters and Preller et al. ’s four measures <b>of</b> peak <b>exposure.</b> My interpretation is as follows. It was demonstrated that the diurnal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> concentration with an average time of 7. 5 – 60 min is log-normal (Kumagai et al., 1995). Although it was not demonstrated that the within-task <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> concentration with an average time of 5 s to 1 min is log-normal, I assume log-normal distribution in the following discussion. For a log-normal distribution, mean (arithmetic mean, m) is related to mg and sg by the following equation: lnm lnmg þ 0 : 5 ln 2 sg ð 1 Þ Here, the maximum value <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> concentration {{is assumed to be}} the 99 th percentile <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> <b>distribution</b> (Cmax) : ln Cmax lnmg þ 2 : 327 ln sg ð 2 Þ Because no correlation between mg and sg was observed among various industries (Kumagai et al., 1999), the effects of variations of mg and sg on m and Cmax can be evaluated separately. According to equations (1) and (2), as mg increases, both m and Cmax increase. Similarly, as sg increases, both m and Cmax increase. Consequently, m and Cmax are positively correlated with each other. The average peak concentration is as follows...|$|R

Cosmogenic exposure dating is an elegant method for estimating the ages of moraines, but individual exposure dates are sometimes biased by geomorphic processes. Because exposure dates may be either "too young" or "too old," {{there are a variety}} of methods for estimating the ages <b>of</b> moraines from <b>exposure</b> dates. In this paper, we present Monte Carlo-based models of moraine degradation and inheritance of cosmogenic nuclides, and we use the models to examine the effectiveness of these methods. The models estimate the statistical <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> dates that we would expect to obtain from single moraines, given reasonable geomorphic assumptions. The model of moraine degradation is based on prior examples, but the inheritance model is novel. The statistical <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> dates from the moraine degradation model are skewed toward young values; in contrast, the statistical <b>distributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> dates from the inheritance model are skewed toward old values. Sensitivity analysis shows that this difference is robust for reasonable parameter choices. Thus, the skewness can help indicate whether a particular data set has problems with inheritance or moraine degradation. Given representative distributions from these two models, we can determine which methods of estimating moraine ages are most successful in recovering the correct age for test cases where this value is known. The mean is a poor estimator of moraine age for data sets drawn from skewed parent distributions, and excluding outliers before calculating the mean does not improve this mismatch. The extreme estimators (youngest date and oldest date) perform well under specific circumstances, but fail in other cases. We suggest a simple estimator that uses the skewnesses of individual data sets to determine whether the youngest date, mean, or oldest date will provide the best estimate of moraine age. Although this method is perhaps the most globally robust of the estimators we tested, it sometimes fails spectacularly. The failure of simple methods to provide accurate estimates of moraine age points toward a need for more sophisticated statistical treatments...|$|R

The approach can be implemented with experimentally-based data and estimation procedures that seek to isolate the effect of advertising and also permit the evaluation of advertising influences on purchase behavior patterns. For the purpose of model implementation, parameter estimation procedures are outlined and applied to empirically evaluate three alternative model versions that reflect different advertising exposure behavior assumptions.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers two of {{the most}} pressing concerns of the current time, income inequality and exposure to pollution, and provides evidence that these two concerns may in fact be causally linked. In order to do this, I assemble novel datasets on income inequality and pollution exposure, and propose an strategy for causally identifying the effect of the former on the latter. In the first substantive chapter, I develop a new dataset on income inequality measured at the US state and metropolitan area level. I compare the trends in income inequality measured using different income definitions. In general, pre-tax, pre-transfer income inequality has increased in most states since 1980, but post-fiscal income inequality has seen slow or no growth since about 2000. I conduct inference on how income inequality has changed using a semi-parametric bootstrap method, and consider potential correlates with state-level income inequality. I find that de-unionization is perhaps the most important factor driving rising inequality. In the second substantive chapter, I leverage satellite-derived remote sensing data on ground-level concentrations for two important pollutants (NOx and PM 2. 5) to measure the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> pollution <b>exposure.</b> I propose a dashboard approach to measuring environmental inequality and environmental justice, proposing and applying several candidate measures to the satellite datasets. I find that environmental inequality has largely decreased since 1998, as has average exposure. I consider potential correlations between neighborhood demographics and the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> but find inconclusive results. In the third substantive chapter, I attempt to resolve this ambiguity by considering whether rising income inequality within metropolitan areas (the subject of the first chapter) might causally affect the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> across people (the subject of the second). Using a simulated instrumental variables identification strategy designed to address potential endogeneity due to locational sorting, I find that income inequality decreases the average level <b>of</b> <b>exposure,</b> but increases environmental inequality.

Health disparities in cancer incidence and mortality may reflect differences in exposures to risk factors early in life. Understanding the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> to early life risk and protective factors for cancer across different populations can shed light on opportunities to promote health equity at earlier developmental stages. Disparities may differentially influence risk for cancer during early life and create opportunities to promote health equity. Potential risk and protective factors for cancer in early life reveal patterns of disparities in their exposure. These disparities in exposures can manifest in downstream disparities in risk for cancer. These risk and protective factors include adverse childhood experiences; maternal alcohol consumption in pregnancy; childhood obesity; high or low birth weight; benzene exposure; use of assisted reproductive technologies; pesticide and insecticide exposure; isolated cryptorchidism; early pubertal timing; exposure to radiation; exposure to tobacco in utero and in early life; allergies, asthma, and atopy; and early exposure to infection. Disparities on the basis of racial and ethnic minority status, economic disadvantage, disability status, sex, geography, and nation of origin can occur in these risk and protective factors. Vulnerable populations experience disproportionally greater exposure to risk factors in early life. Addressing disparities in risk factors in early life can advance opportunities for prevention, promote health equity, and possibly reduce risk for subsequent development of cancer.

To ensure high grating overlay accuracy, each grating level is aligned to the reference grating with various interferometric techniques. In addition, an image-reversal process with plasma etch trimming was developed to control the linewidth of each grating level to nanometer-repeatability. Extensive optical simulations using rigorous coupled-wave analysis were used to examine the intensity <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> over multilayer periodic structures. The immediate goal of this work is to extend the wavelength-limited resolution of interference lithography with high precision metrology and well-controlled fabrication processes. Using this multilevel process, we have successfully fabricated 50 nm-period gratings using light with 351. 1 nm wavelength. This process presents a general scheme for overlaying periodic nanostructures, and can be used to fabricate more complex 2 D and 3 D geometries. by Chih-Hao Chang. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{outlines}} briefly how {{the living}} environment can affect health. It explains {{the links between}} social and environmental determinants of health in urban settings. Interventions to improve health equity through the environment include actions and policies that deal with proximal risk factors in deprived urban areas, such as safe drinking water supply, reduced air pollution from household cooking and heating {{as well as from}} vehicles and industry, reduced traffic injury hazards and noise, improved working environment, and reduced heat stress because of global climate change. The urban environment involves health hazards with an inequitable <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposures</b> and vulnerabilities, but it also involves opportunities for implementing interventions for health equity. The high population density in many poor urban areas means that interventions at a small scale level can assist many people, and existing infrastructure can sometimes be upgraded to meet health demands. Interventions at higher policy levels that will create more sustainable and equitable living conditions and environments include improved city planning and policies that take health aspects into account in every sector. Health equity also implies policies and actions that improve the global living environment, for instance, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. In a global equity perspective, improving the living environment and health of the poor in developing country cities requires actions to be taken in the most affluent urban areas of the world. This includes making financial and technical resources available from high-income countries to be applied in low-income countries for urgent interventions for health equity.

40|$|While {{previous}} {{calculations of}} potassium ages assumed a constant cosmic ray flux {{and a single}} stage (no change in size) <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> iron meteorites, present calculations relaxed these constancy assumptions and the results reveal multistage irradiations for some 25 % of the meteorites studied, implying multiple breakup in space. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> ages suggests several major collisions (based on chemical composition and structure), although the calibration of age scales is not yet complete. It is concluded that shielding-corrected (corrections which depend on size and position of sample) production rates are consistent for the age bracket of 300 to 900 years. These production rates differ in a systematic way from those calculated for present day fluxes of cosmic rays (such as obtained {{for the last few}} million years) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purposes}} of impact assessment are {{to evaluate whether}} or not a stress has changed the environment, to determine which components are adversely affected, and to estimate the magnitude of the effects. Evaluating change in environmental conditions is often difficult, due to several factors. It is often not clear which environmental component will be affected by the stressor, what type of change will occur and what the exposure will be. Choices must be made about where and when the potential effect will occur (i. e. define the spatial and temporal extent), what organisms will be affected (fish, plants, etc.), what the exposure will be (magnitude, duration), what any mitigating factors could be (what affects <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure)</b> and how may these factors alte...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—As the definitional {{formula for}} {{population}} attributable fraction {{is not usually}} directly usable in applications, separate estimation formulas are required. However, most epidemiology textbooks limit their coverage to Levin's formula, based on the (dichotomous) <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> <b>of</b> interest in the population. Few present or explain Miettinen's formula, based on the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> in the cases; and even fewer present the corresponding formulas for situations with more than two levels <b>of</b> <b>exposure.</b> Thus, many health researchers and public health practitioners are unaware of, or are not confident in their use of, these formulas, particularly when they involve several exposure levels, or confounding factors.  METHODS/RESULTS—A heuristic approach, coupled with pictorial representations, is offered to help understand and interconnect the structures behind the Levin and Miettinen formulas. The pictorial representation shows how to deal correctly with several exposure levels, and why a commonly used approach is incorrect. Correct and incorrect approaches are also presented for situations where estimates must be aggregated over strata of a confounding factor.    Keywords: attributable risk epidemiology; regression; case-control study; aetiological fraction; statistics; confounding; matching stratified dat...|$|R
