30|$|The <b>germination</b> <b>condition</b> {{influenced}} by orientation of seed is {{also related to}} the effect it creates on physiological processes during germination. In seeds of some plant species with higher weight in which extra energy is required to elongate hypocotyls, positioning the micropyle upright reduces germination as explained earlier. In addition to the abovementioned reasons, physiological processes controlled by plant growth hormone have a role. In such situation, the flow of auxin produced in the root tip has limited flow to reach to part of the root with required extent to influence the growth positively (Bhat 2011). This abnormal chemical process results to poor morphological development and influence <b>germination</b> <b>condition,</b> among others. Therefore, poor metabolic integrity, additional energy demand, and hormone distribution lower the germination results in D. regia seed (Mahgoub 1995; Masilamani et al. 1999).|$|R

40|$|Background. Chemical {{composition}} changes drastically during seeds germination because biochemical activity produces essential {{compounds and}} energy, and some nutrients transform to bioactive components {{as a part}} of these changes. There are some reports about the effect of germination on nutrient contents of different seeds, but very little information is available on black cumin seed. Besides, most studies have been conducted using a single set of <b>germination</b> <b>conditions,</b> and reports on the effect of modifying the processing conditions are scarce. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of different <b>germination</b> <b>conditions</b> on the content of chemical composition, fatty acids and amino acids of two black cumin seeds originated from Ethiopia (Africa) and Syria (Asia). Methods. Germination process was carried out according to the Urbano method. Proximate chemical analy- sis were estimated using AOAC method. The fatty acid composition was determined by gas liquid chroma- tography and amino acid composition by procedures described by Mario. Statistical analysis was performed on all obtained values. Results. The content of moisture, oil, crude protein, ash and total carbohydrates of raw Ethiopian sample were slightly higher than the amounts of raw Syrian sample. Germination of the two samples increased both oil and protein contents while other constituents were decreased. Little change was observed in fatty acids after germination as saturated and total monounsaturated fatty acids were decreased, while the total of poly- unsaturated fatty acids was increased. The total amino acids increased during germination and it affected by <b>germination</b> <b>conditions.</b> Germinated seeds showed noticeable decreases in the contents of K, Na, Ca and Fe.

The results are statistically significant for D. regia with regard to most considered germination parameters.

This lack of information is surprising given that seeds have been found in the stomach contents of a majority of crocodilian species. Here we present the first experimental investigation of the seed-dispersal potential of a crocodilian. Using a comparative germination experiment, we tested the viability of Annona glabra (Pond-apple Tree) seeds recovered from the stomach of an Alligator mississippiensis (American Alligator [Alligator]) captured in the Florida Coastal Everglades.

40|$|Superdormant spores of Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus megaterium were {{isolated}} in 4 to 12 % yields following germination with high nutrient levels that activated {{one or two}} germinant receptors. These superdormant spores did not germinate with the initial nutrients or those that stimulated other germinant receptors, and the superdormant spores' defect was not genetic. The superdormant spores did, however, germinate with Ca 2 +-dipicolinic acid or dodecylamine. Although these superdormant spores did not germinate {{with high levels of}} nutrients that activated one or two nutrient germinant receptors, they germinated with nutrient mixtures that activated more receptors, and using high levels of nutrient mixtures activating more germinant receptors decreased superdormant spore yields. The use of moderate nutrient levels to isolate superdormant spores increased their yields; the resultant spores germinated poorly with the initial moderate nutrient concentrations, but they germinated well with high nutrient concentrations. These findings suggest that the levels of superdormant spores in populations depend on the <b>germination</b> <b>conditions</b> used, with fewer superdormant spores isolated when better <b>germination</b> <b>conditions</b> are used. These findings further suggest that superdormant spores require an increased signal for triggering spore germination compared to most spores in populations. One factor determining whether a spore is superdormant is its level of germinant receptors, since spore populations with higher levels of germinant receptors yielded lower levels of superdormant spores. A second important factor may be heat activation of spore populations, since yields of superdormant spores from non-heat-activated spore populations were higher than those from optimally activated spores...|$|E

Two wild-type ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, germinated either under white light or in darkness, were exposed to different red and blue light conditions and used to examine these relationships. 	Red light exposure preceding growth under solely blue light was shown to have an inhibitory effect on root lengths, regardless of ecotype or etiolation. Surprisingly, red light did not produce significant phototropistic curvature in roots of either ecotype. The remainder of the results illustrated the fact that different ecotypes exhibit different phototropistic responses to light treatments and etiolation. Seedlings did not uniformly respond to constant red and blue light in the same manner as they responded to pretreatment by red light. In different circumstances, simultaneous red and blue light led to results statistically identical to blue light’s results, red pretreatment’s results, or an intermediate between the two.
