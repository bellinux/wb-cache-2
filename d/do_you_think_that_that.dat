6000|$|... "Very good, Jeeves. We {{will now}} suppose {{that there has}} {{recently}} been some little coolness between this tiger cub and this tigress.

6000|$|Now, my dear friends, {{let me ask}} you as {{reasonable}} beings, <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> hearing me or any man preach, {{can save}} your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> sitting over a book for an hour a day, or all day long, will save your souls alive? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins are washed away in Christ's blood, when they are there still, and you are committing them? Would they be here, and <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> them, if they were put away? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> your sins can be put away out of God's sight, if they are not even put out of your own sight? If <b>you</b> are <b>doing</b> wrong, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> God will treat you as if <b>you</b> were <b>doing</b> right? Cannot God see in you what you see in yourselves? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be clothed in Christ's righteousness at the very same time that he is clothed in his own unrighteousness? Can he be good and bad at once? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> a man can be converted--that is turned round--when he is going on his old road the whole week? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man has repented--that is, changed his mind--when he is in just the same mind as ever as to how he shall behave to his family, his customers, and everybody with whom he has to <b>do?</b> <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a man is renewed by God's Spirit, when except for a few religious phrases, and a little more outside respectability, he is just the old man, the same character at heart he ever was? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> there is any use in a man's belonging to the number of believers, if he does not do what he believes; or any use in thinking that God has elected and chosen him, when he chooses not to do what God has chosen that every man must do, or die? ...|$|R

6000|$|The {{momentary}} {{charge at}} Balaclava, in obedience to a blundering command, proving what a perfect machine the soldier is, has, properly enough, been celebrated by a poet laureate; but the steady, {{and for the}} most part successful, charge of this man, for some years, against the legions of Slavery, in obedience to an infinitely higher command, is as much more memorable than that, as an intelligent and conscientious man is superior to a machine. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> will go unsung? ...|$|E
60|$|Chairman. Referring to the Crystal Palace, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> was an {{appropriate}} instance to put, considering the working man pays for his own, {{and is not}} ashamed to enjoy his own for his own money?--I have never examined {{the causes of the}} feeling; it did not appear {{to me to be a}} matter of great importance what was the state of feeling in foreign countries. I felt that it depended upon so many circumstances, that I thought it would be a waste of time to trace it.|$|E

"But I {{must look}} to it, my dear. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> woman, who sits there at Barchester in high places, disgracing herself and that puny ecclesiastical lord who is her husband,--do {{you think that}} she would not immure me if she could? She is a she-wolf,--only less {{reasonable}} than the dumb brute as she sharpens her teeth in malice coming from anger, and not in malice coming from hunger as do the outer wolves of the forest.

6000|$|... "Facilis descensus Averni!" [...] {{said the}} Duke, shaking his head. [...] "Noctes atque dies patet atri janua Ditis." [...] No doubt, he thought, that {{as his son}} was at Oxford, admonitions in Latin would serve him better than in his native tongue. But Gerald, {{when he heard the}} grand hexameter rolled out in his father's grandest tone, entertained a {{comfortable}} feeling that the worst of the interview was over.

60|$|WISE. Alas! {{men that}} are wicked themselves, yet greatly hate it in others, {{not simply because}} it is wickedness, but because it opposeth their interest. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> maid's master would have been troubled {{at the loss of}} her, if he had not lost, with her, his gain? No, I'll warrant you; she might have gone to the devil for him; but 'when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,' then, then he fell to persecuting Paul (Acts 16:17-20). But Mr. Badman's master did {{sometimes}} lose by Mr. Badman's sins, and then Badman and his master were at odds.|$|E

Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is enough to satisfy one? Of course it is very {{beautiful}} here, I know, and sometimes when the sun is shining and the birds singing and the sea comes up into the creeks, well, one almost feels content. But the sun doesn't always shine, Richard, and there are times when I am right down bored, and I feel as though I'd love to draw my allowance from uncle, pack my trunk, and go up to London, on my own!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well; {{would you}} have {{me tell you a}} lie? Did I not tell you the same when you first asked me to marry you?

I think it very essential that wherever the sculpture of a nation was, there its iron work should be--that wherever its iron work was, there its pottery should be, and so on.|$|E
