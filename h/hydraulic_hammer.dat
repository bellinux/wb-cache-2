50|$|A {{rockbreaker}} is {{a machine}} designed to manipulate large rocks, including reducing large rocks into smaller rocks. They are typically {{used in the}} mining industry to remove oversize rocks that are too large or too hard to be reduced in size by a crusher. Rockbreakers consist of two major components, a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammer</b> (used to break rocks) and a boom (the arm).

For tall concrete buildings, where neither explosive or high reach demolition with an excavator is safe or practical, the [...] "inside-out" [...] method is used, whereby remotely operated mini-excavators demolish the building from the inside, whilst maintaining the outer walls of the building as a scaffolding, as each floor is demolished.|$|R
40|$|Due to some {{drawbacks}} {{of conventional}} drilling methods and drilling tools, {{the application of}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> with a fluidic amplifier have been extensively popularized since its emergence in recent years. However, the performance life of a fluidic amplifier is still unsatisfactory in oil and gas wells drilling, especially the heavy wear or erosion of the fluidic amplifier leads to the reduction of service life time of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers,</b> which {{is derived from the}} incision of drilling muds with high speed and pressure. In order to investigate the influence of drilling muds, such as particle size, solid content and jet velocity, on the antierosion property of a fluidic amplifier, several groups of drilling muds with different performance parameters have been utilized to numerical simulation on basis of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Simulation results have shown that the jet nozzle of fluidic amplifiers is primarily abraded, afterwards are the lateral plates and the wedge of the fluidic amplifier, which shows extraordinary agreement with the actual cases of fluidic amplifier in drilling process. It can be concluded that particle size, solid content and jet velocity have a great influence on the anti-erosion property of a fluidic amplifier, and the erosion rate linearly varies with the particle size of drilling muds, nevertheless exponentially varies with solid content and jet velocity of drilling muds. As to improve the service life time of a fluidic amplifier, the mud purification system or low solid clay-free mud system is suggested in the operation of directional well drillin...|$|R

50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammer</b> is {{a modern}} type of piling hammer used in place of diesel and air hammers for driving steel pipe, precast concrete, and timber piles. Hydraulic hammers are more {{environmentally}} acceptable than the older, less efficient hammers as they generate less noise and pollutants. However, {{in many cases the}} dominant noise is caused by the impact of the hammer on the pile, or the impacts between components of the hammer, so that the resulting noise level can be very similar to diesel hammers.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} ways to place piles for a deep foundation. They can be driven, drilled, or {{installed}} {{by use of}} an auger. Driven piles are extended to their necessary depths with the application of external energy {{in the same way}} a nail is hammered. There are four typical hammers used to drive such piles: drop <b>hammers,</b> diesel <b>hammers,</b> <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers,</b> and air hammers. Drop hammers simply drop a heavy weight onto the pile to drive it, while diesel hammers use a single cylinder diesel engine to force piles through the Earth. Similarly, <b>hydraulic</b> and air <b>hammers</b> supply energy to piles through hydraulic and air forces. Energy imparted from a hammer head varies with type of hammer chosen, and can be as high as a million foot pounds for large scale diesel hammers, a very common hammer head used in practice. Piles are made of a variety of material including steel, timber, and concrete. Drilled piles are created by first drilling a hole to the appropriate depth, and filling it with concrete. Drilled piles can typically carry more load than driven piles, simply due to a larger diameter pile. The auger method of pile installation is similar to drilled pile installation, but concrete is pumped into the hole as the auger is being removed.|$|R

50|$|Direct push {{drilling}} rigs use hydraulic cylinders and a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammer</b> in advancing a hollow core sampler to gather soil and groundwater samples. The speed {{and depth of}} penetration is largely dependent on the soil type, {{the size of the}} sampler, and the weight and power of the rig. Direct push techniques are generally limited to shallow soil sample recovery in unconsolidated soil materials. The advantage of direct push technology is that in the right soil type it can produce a large number of high quality samples quickly and cheaply, generally from 50 to 75 meters per day. Rather than hammering, direct push can also be combined with sonic (vibratory) methods to increase drill efficiency.|$|E
50|$|The {{cable-stayed}} bridge has an overall length of 936 m between Azapkapı (Beyoğlu) and Unkapanı (Fatih), and {{a span of}} 460 m over water. The longest span between the two towers is 180 m. It is flanked by viaducts at both sides, which connect the bridge with the metro tunnels on the opposite banks of the Golden Horn. Nine cables are connected to {{each side of the}} two towers in harp-design starting at a height of 47 m.

40|$|The {{operation}} {{and in particular}} the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noise from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines.

40|$|The {{ability of}} <b>hydraulic</b> pile driving <b>hammers</b> to {{overcome}} energy losses during freefall enables {{a greater proportion}} of the impact energy to be transferred to the pile in comparison to diesel hammers. This percentage, termed the energy transfer ratio, is not routinely measured in practice however, and {{there is an element of}} uncertainty regarding appropriate energy transfer ratios to assume in driveability analyses. In light of such uncertainties, the energy transfer ratios of four- and five-tonne <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> were assessed during installation of driven cast-in-situ piles at several sites in the United Kingdom. The piling rigs were fitted with instrumentation which enabled measurement of the hammer velocity (and hence kinetic energy) at impact for each blow during installation, with the corresponding magnitude of energy transferred to the closed-ended steel installation tube ascertained using a Pile Driving Analyser. The results of the study showed that energy transfer ratios were strongly dependent on the hammer drop height, with transfer ratios of 95 % advocated by the pile hammer manufacturer only achievable when a drop height in excess of about 600 mm was used. As such, lower energy transfer ratios may need to be considered in driveability predictions for these pile types (i. e. steel or DCIS piles) if lower drop heights are used during driving. Further research is required to substantiate limited data suggesting that soil type may also be influential...|$|R

40|$|Modern <b>hydraulic</b> <b>hammers</b> {{are usually}} {{equipped}} with on-board energy measurement devices. Energy measurements {{in the field}} can therefore be taken continuously during entire pile driving processes. This paper outlines a method that directly uses energy measurements from the field for quantitative pile driving process monitoring. The kinetic energy delivered over one meter of pile penetration (KEMP) and the effective transferred energy delivered over one meter of pile penetration (EEMP) against soil resistance are calculated based on field measurements and are used as two indicators for pile driving process monitoring. The relationship between the EEMP and the pile capacity is confirmed by dynamic tests and static load tests on several well-monitored long steel H-piles. The EEMP values compare well with pile capacity predictions from a pile driving analyzer and from static analyses based on standard penetration tests, and with those measured from static load tests. The two energy indicators {{can also be used}} to effectively monitor the integrity of piles during construction. Potential pile damage caused by obstructions is illustrated by interpreting the KEMP and EEMP records of three abandoned long steel H-piles...|$|R
