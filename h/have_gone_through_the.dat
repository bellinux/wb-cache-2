Dan Stubbs of NME complimented the song's lyrics and deemed the chorus [...] "monumental". Christopher Hooton of Metro called the track [...] "catchy and anthemic". Jon Hornbuckle from So So Gay felt that [...] "Change Your Life" [...] was an obvious single choice and that its anthemic chorus is the {{definition}} of girl power in 2013. Adrian Thrills of the Daily Mail positively reviewed the song, [...] "The vocals are unexpectedly potent, with the harmony singing of Perrie, Jesy, Leigh-Anne and Jade blending impressively on the big ballad 'Change Your Life'".

The tone of the second montage was set with a cello. Stargate composer Joel Goldsmith later accompanied the hand movements of the hired cellist with different music during post-production. A third montage was filmed but not included in the final cut of the episode since the last table scene already supplied the needed sentiment. Each time period included the same shots to help the audience focus on the differences that characters <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through.</b> <b>The</b> last scene at Stargate Command was the last filmed Stargate SG-1 scene, shot at two o'clock in the morning, for which every member of the crew came back.|$|E

By the early 1990s this program was still {{one of only two}} programs (the other being the golden lion tamarin) to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> full wilderness-zoo-wilderness sequence. Nine oryx had been caught or donated for the breeding program.

The two delayed pairs arrived in 1964 to increase the herd to 11 individuals. The program was very successful, and the zoo celebrated its 225th Arabian oryx birth in 2002. The Arabian oryx became extinct in the wild in 1972, and reintroduction efforts were started in 1982 when oryx were released to the wild in the Omani Central Desert and Coastal Hills. Additional captive herds have been discovered and used as the basis for reintroductions, for instance in Saudi Arabia, but there has been some interbreeding even with these herds and most of the Arabian oryx in the wild today have ancestors from the Phoenix Zoo.|$|E
