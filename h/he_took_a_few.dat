After joining the Knicks in 2012, Lin slept on a couch in his brother's one-bedroom apartment on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City. The night before his breakout game, he slept on the couch of teammate Landry Fields. He relocated to a luxury condo in White Plains, New York, after his Knicks contract became guaranteed.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> {{years off}} then {{returned}} to directing with a lower budgeted film, Saint Jack (1979) which was a critical success, although not a large hit. The making of this saw {{the end of his}} romantic relationship with Cybill Shepherd.|$|E
25|$|He {{began his}} senior career in 1993, taking 5–65 {{in the first}} innings of his {{first-class}} debut, Scotland's annual game against Ireland. He also played a few times that year for Yorkshire's Second XI, making his first-team debut for the county in 1994. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> years to become established in the side, but by 1998 was an important team member: that summer he took 59 first-class wickets at 20.54 as well as scoring six fifties, and claimed 34 one-day scalps at 18.94.|$|E

25|$|In early 1045, Henry entered Lorraine {{with a local}} {{army and}} besieged and took Godfrey's castle of Bockelheim (near Kreuznach). <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other castles as well, but famine drove him out. Leaving behind enough men to guard the {{countryside}} against Godfrey's raids, he turned to Burgundy. Godfrey had done his best to foment rebellion there by creating conflicts between the imperialist faction, which supported union with the empire, and the nationalist faction, which supported an independent Burgundy. However, Louis, Count of Montbéliard, defeated Reginald I, Count of Burgundy (which was to become the Free County), and when Henry arrived, the latter was ready with Gerald, Count of Geneva, to do homage. Burgundy was thereafter united to Henry's crown.|$|E
25|$|In 1799 Smith {{produced}} the first large scale geologic {{map of the}} area around Bath, Somerset. Previously, he only knew how to draw the vertical extent of the rocks, but not how to display them horizontally. However, in the Somerset County Agricultural Society, he found a map showing the types of soils and vegetation around Bath and their geographical extent. Importantly, the differing types were coloured. Using this technique, Smith could draw a geological map from his observations showing the outcrops of the rocks. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> rock types, {{each with its own}} colour. Then he estimated the boundaries of each of the outcrops of rock, filled them in with colour and ended up with a crude geological map.|$|E
25|$|Early in 1877 {{he played}} for South Australia against a visiting East Melbourne team making 16 and 14, {{the highest score in}} each innings, but South Australian cricket was then much below the {{standard}} of the two eastern colonies. In November 1877 he made his first-class cricket debut against Tasmania. Giffen made 47runs and took 4wickets for16 runs in the Tasmanian first innings. Tasmania was forced to follow-on (bat twice in a row) and in the second innings Giffen managed to capture another 2 wickets. It was not until November 1880 that the first regular match between South Australia and Victoria took place at Melbourne. Giffen made 3 and 63 and took two wickets for 47 in the first innings. In the follow-up match in Adelaide later that season, Giffen took 5wickets for 59runs (5/59); Victoria won the match by 151runs. He became a regular member of the South Australian team and although <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> seasons to develop his full powers, if he failed as a bat he usually made up for it with a good bowling performance.|$|E

500|$|Parts of Giselle {{have been}} cut or changed since the ballet's first night. Giselle's Act I {{pantomime}} scene in which she tells Albrecht of her strange dream is cut and the peasant pas de deux is also slightly cut back. The Duke of Courland and his daughter Bathilde used to make their entrance on horseback, but today they walk on. In the original production they were present at Giselle's death, but now they leave the scene before she dies. The machines used to make Giselle fly and to make her disappear are no longer employed. A trapdoor is sometimes utilized to make Giselle rise from her grave and then sink into {{it at the end}} of Act II. At the end of Act II Bathilde formerly entered with the courtiers to search for Albrecht. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> unsteady steps toward them and then collapsed into their arms. This moment was an artistic parallel to the Act I finale when the peasants gathered about the dead Giselle. [...] Now, Bathilde and the courtiers are cut and Albrecht slowly leaves the stage alone.|$|E

The cover concept originated when Stipe showed cover artist Chris Bilheimer a balloon he wanted {{to serve as the}} album cover, and told him to [...] "play around with". Bilheimer changed the color of the balloon, which was originally green. He also had to re-photograph the bear head. When he was down to the last few frames on a roll of film, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> photos without bothering to focus the shots, which he and Stipe ended up liking the best.|$|E

50|$|In this lecture, {{some issues}} {{arise in the}} {{description}} of Wagner’s transformational skills. Again, Bernstein’s definition of deep structure is inconsistently applied, because example number 77 on page 236 is not a deep structure. This does not fulfill deep structure’s requirement of containing musical prose. Instead, these five or six notes could be more accurately described as the underlying elements composers chose before constructing deep structure. In addition, the transformative processes he demonstrates with this example are not entirely clear, because <b>he</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> liberties with note alterations which are not explained.|$|R

2500|$|So it proved. Gimblett {{retained}} {{his place}} for the next match, against Middlesex at Lord's, only because of another injury to a regular player, and though he top-scored with 53 in the second innings (still batting at No 8), he himself was injured and missed the next month. Returning to the side in mid-season, he played with little success, though <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> wickets with his medium-pace, including four wickets for just 10 runs against Gloucestershire at Bath, which would remain his best first-class bowling performance. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack summed up his first first-class season in its 1936 edition, noting that he [...] "failed to maintain his early form". It went on: [...] "Almost entirely a forward player, he appeared to pay little heed to defence, {{and in the end}} lack of experience contributed to his undoing. Still, shrewd observers maintain that he possesses distinct possibilities, and with further opportunities he may become more than a useful member of the side." ...|$|E

Science, then, may adopt mana as a general category ....". Mana is possessed and granted by animae, no doubt. In Melanesia, the animae are the souls of living men, the ghosts of deceased men, and spirits appearing either as those [...] "of ghost-like appearance" [...] or those imitating ordinary corporeal men. Spirits of ghosts can inhabit other objects, such as animals or stones.|$|R
