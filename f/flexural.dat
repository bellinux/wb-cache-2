5|$|It {{is usually}} {{possible}} for a mechanical part to vibrate {{in a number of}} different modes, however the design will be based on a particular vibrational mode and the designer will take steps to try to restrict the resonance to this mode. As well as the straightforward longitudinal mode some others which are used include <b>flexural</b> mode, torsional mode, radial mode and drumhead mode.|$|E
5|$|Psoriasis is {{classified}} as a papulosquamous disorder and is most commonly subdivided into different categories based on histological characteristics. Variants include plaque, pustular, guttate, and <b>flexural</b> psoriasis. Each form has a dedicated ICD-10 code. Psoriasis can also be classified into nonpustular and pustular types.|$|E
5|$|Inverse {{psoriasis}} (also {{known as}} <b>flexural</b> psoriasis) appears as smooth, inflamed patches of skin. The patches frequently affect skin folds, particularly around the genitals (between the thigh and groin), the armpits, {{in the skin}} folds of an overweight abdomen (known as panniculus), between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft, and under the breasts in the inframammary fold. Heat, trauma, and infection are thought {{to play a role}} in the development of this atypical form of psoriasis.|$|E
5|$|The {{resonator}} {{shown in}} figure 12 is around 120 μm in length. Experimental complete filters with an operating frequency of 30GHz have been produced using cantilever varactors as the resonator elements. The size of this filter is around 4×3.5mm. Cantilever resonators are typically applied at frequencies below 200MHz, but other structures, such as micro-machined cavities, {{can be used in}} the microwave bands. Extremely high Q resonators can be made with this technology; <b>flexural</b> mode resonators with a Q in excess of 80,000 at 8MHz are reported.|$|E
5|$|The {{various types}} of {{resonator}} are all particularly suited to different frequency bands. Overall, mechanical filters with lumped elements of all kinds can cover frequencies from about 5 to 700kHz although mechanical filters down as low as a few kilohertz (kHz) are rare. The lower part of this range, below 100kHz, is best covered with bar <b>flexural</b> resonators. The upper part is better done with torsional resonators. Drumhead disc resonators are in the middle, covering the range from around 100 to 300kHz.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was {{twice as high as}} that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the <b>flexural</b> strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{improves}} many {{physical properties}} when added as an alloying element to aluminium, copper (notably the alloy beryllium copper), iron and nickel. Beryllium does not form oxides {{until it reaches}} very high temperatures. Tools made of beryllium copper alloys are strong and hard and do not create sparks when they strike a steel surface. In structural applications, the combination of high <b>flexural</b> rigidity, thermal stability, thermal conductivity and low density (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium metal a desirable aerospace material for aircraft components, missiles, spacecraft, and satellites. Because of its low density and atomic mass, beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays {{and other forms of}} ionizing radiation; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and components of particle detectors. The high thermal conductivities of beryllium and beryllium oxide have led to their use in thermal management applications.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flexural</b> rigidities are EI, 2EI, EI respectively.|$|E
25|$|The <b>flexural</b> {{stiffness}} (EI/L) of {{a member}} is represented {{as the product of}} the modulus of elasticity (E) and the second moment of area (I) divided by the length (L) of the member. What is needed in the moment distribution method is not the exact value but the ratio of <b>flexural</b> stiffness of all members.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemispherical}} resonator gyroscope (HRG), {{also called}} wine-glass gyroscope or mushroom gyro, makes using a thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a <b>flexural</b> resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures {{that surround the}} shell. Gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the <b>flexural</b> standing waves.|$|E
25|$|G-11, {{woven glass}} and epoxy - high {{resistance}} to solvents, high <b>flexural</b> strength retention at high temperatures. Typically rated to 170°C.|$|E
25|$|To {{achieve a}} ductile {{behavior}} of masonry, {{it is necessary}} that the shear strength of the wall is greater than the <b>flexural</b> strength.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flexural</b> slip allows folding by {{creating}} layer-parallel slip between {{the layers of}} the folded strata, which, altogether, result in deformation. A good analogy is bending a phone book, where volume preservation is accommodated by slip between {{the pages of the}} book.|$|E
25|$|Starting in 1986, Infinia Corporation began {{developing}} both {{highly reliable}} pulsed free-piston Stirling engines, and thermoacoustic coolers using related technology. The published design uses <b>flexural</b> bearings and hermetically sealed Helium gas cycles, to achieve tested reliabilities exceeding 20 years. As of 2010, the corporation had amassed more than 30 patents, {{and developed a}} number of commercial products for both combined heat and power, and solar power.|$|E
25|$|The moment {{distribution}} method is a structural analysis method for statically indeterminate beams and frames developed by Hardy Cross. It was published in 1930 in an ASCE journal. The method only accounts for <b>flexural</b> effects and ignores axial and shear effects. From the 1930s until computers began to be widely used {{in the design and}} analysis of structures, the {{moment distribution}} method was the most widely practiced method.|$|E
25|$|If {{the folding}} {{deformation}} cannot be accommodated by <b>flexural</b> slip or volume-change shortening (buckling), the rocks are generally {{removed from the}} path of the stress. This is achieved by pressure dissolution, a form of metamorphic process, in which rocks shorten by dissolving constituents in areas of high strain and redepositing them in areas of lower strain. Folds created in this way include examples in migmatites, and areas with a strong axial planar cleavage.|$|E
25|$|PMMA is an {{economical}} {{alternative to}} polycarbonate (PC) when tensile strength, <b>flexural</b> strength, transparency, polishability, and UV tolerance {{are more important}} than impact strength, chemical resistance and heat resistance. Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful bisphenol-A subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an impact force, and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.|$|E
25|$|The {{choice of}} chain {{extender}} also determines <b>flexural,</b> heat, and chemical resistance properties. The most important chain extenders are ethylene glycol, 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO or BDO), 1,6-hexanediol, cyclohexane dimethanol and hydroquinone bis(2-hydroxyethyl) ether (HQEE). All of these glycols form polyurethanes that phase separate well and form well defined hard segment domains, and are melt processable. They {{are all suitable}} for thermoplastic polyurethanes {{with the exception of}} ethylene glycol, since its derived bis-phenyl urethane undergoes unfavorable degradation at high hard segment levels. Diethanolamine and triethanolamine are used in flex molded foams to build firmness and add catalytic activity. Diethyltoluenediamine is used extensively in RIM, and in polyurethane and polyurea elastomer formulations.|$|E
25|$|Recent radiologic appraisals of the {{mesenteric}} organ {{have been}} conducted {{in the context of}} the contemporary understanding of mesenteric organ anatomy. When this organ is divided into non-flexural and <b>flexural</b> regions, these can readily be differentiated in most patients on CT imaging. Clarification of the radiological appearance of the human mesentery resonates with the suggestions of Dodd and enables a clearer conceptualization of mesenteric derangements in disease states. This is of immediate relevance in the spread of cancer from colon cancer and perforated diverticular disease, and in pancreatitis where fluid collections in the lesser sac dissect the mesocolon from the retroperitoneum and thereby extend distally within the latter.|$|E
25|$|For {{reinforced}} concrete beam-column joints – various retrofit solutions {{have been proposed}} and tested in the past 20 years. Philosophically, the various seismic retrofit strategies discussed above can be implemented for {{reinforced concrete}} joints. Concrete or steel jacketing have been a popular retrofit technique until the advent of composite materials such as Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP). Composite materials such as carbon FRP and aramic FRP have been extensively tested for use in seismic retrofit with some success. One novel technique includes the use of selective weakening of the beam and added external post-tensioning to the joint {{in order to achieve}} <b>flexural</b> hinging in the beam, which is more desirable in terms of seismic design.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Bayer {{exhibited}} an all-plastic car in Düsseldorf, Germany. Parts of this car, {{such as the}} fascia {{and body}} panels, were manufactured using a new process called reaction injection molding (RIM), in which the reactants were mixed and then injected into a mold. The addition of fillers, such as milled glass, mica, and processed mineral fibres, gave rise to reinforced RIM (RRIM), which provided improvements in <b>flexural</b> modulus (stiffness), reduction in {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} and better thermal stability.This technology was used to make the first plastic-body automobile in the United States, the Pontiac Fiero, in 1983. Further increases in stiffness were obtained by incorporating pre-placed glass mats into the RIM mold cavity, also known broadly as resin injection molding, or structural RIM.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flexural</b> anatomy is {{frequently}} {{described as a}} difficult area. It is simplified when each flexure is considered as being centered on a mesenteric contiguity. The ileocaecal flexure arises {{at the point where}} the ileum is continuous with the caecum around the ileocaecal mesenteric flexure. Similarly, the hepatic flexure is formed between the right mesocolon and transverse mesocolon at the mesenteric confluence. The colonic component of the hepatic flexure is draped around this mesenteric confluence. Furthermore, the splenic flexure is formed by the mesenteric confluence between the transverse and left mesocolon. The colonic component of the splenic flexure occurs lateral to the mesenteric confluence. At every flexure, a continuous peritoneal fold lies outside the colonic/mesocolic complex tethering this to the posterior abdominal wall.|$|E
25|$|When a simply {{supported}} beam is loaded in flexure, the top side is in compression, and the bottom side is in tension. If the beam is not supported in the lateral direction (i.e., perpendicular to the plane of bending), and the <b>flexural</b> load increases to a critical limit, the beam will experience a lateral deflection of the compression flange. The lateral deflection of the compression flange is restrained by the beam web and tension flange, but for an open section the twisting mode is more flexible, hence the beam both twists and deflects laterally in a failure mode known as lateral-torsional buckling. In wide-flange sections (with high lateral bending stiffness), the deflection mode will be mostly twisting in torsion. In narrow-flange sections, the bending stiffness is lower and the column's deflection will be closer to that of lateral bucking deflection mode.|$|E

500|$|Euler is {{also well}} known in {{structural}} engineering for his formula giving the critical buckling load of an ideal strut, which depends only on its length and <b>flexural</b> stiffness: ...|$|E
500|$|An {{example of}} such a design is shown in figure 10a. The {{resonators}} are disc <b>flexural</b> resonators similar to those shown in figure 6, except that these are energised from an edge, leading to vibration in the fundamental <b>flexural</b> mode with a node in the centre, whereas the figure 6 design is energised in the centre leading to vibration in the second <b>flexural</b> mode at resonance. The resonators are mechanically attached to the housing by pivots at right angles to the coupling wires. The pivots are to ensure free turning of the resonator and minimise losses. The resonators are treated as lumped elements; however, the coupling wires are made exactly one half-wavelength (λ/2) long and are equivalent to a λ/2 open circuit stub in the electrical equivalent circuit. For a narrow-band filter, a stub of this sort has the approximate equivalent circuit of a parallel shunt tuned circuit as shown in figure 10b. Consequently, the connecting wires are being used in this design to add additional resonators into the circuit and will have a better response than one with just the lumped resonators and short couplings. [...] For even higher frequencies, microelectromechanical methods can be used as described below.|$|E
500|$|Modes are {{numbered}} {{according to the}} number of half-wavelengths in the vibration. [...] Some modes exhibit vibrations in more than one direction (such as drumhead mode which has two) and consequently the mode number consists of more than one number. [...] When the vibration is in one of the higher modes, there will be multiple nodes on the resonator where there is no motion. For some types of resonator, this can provide a convenient place to make a mechanical attachment for structural support. Wires attached at nodes will have no effect on the vibration of the resonator or the overall filter response. In figure 5, some possible anchor points are shown as wires attached at the nodes. The modes shown are (5a) the second longitudinal mode fixed at one end, (5b) the first torsional mode, (5c) the second torsional mode, (5d) the second <b>flexural</b> mode, (5e) first radial expansion mode and (5f) first radially symmetric drumhead mode.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{the heavily}} scaled {{skin of the}} Longnose gar, some of the {{mechanical}} properties differ from [...] model of describing how eel skin adds movement. The scale row resists longitudinal forces, which unlike eel skin, makes the skin stiffer in the longitudinal direction, providing myomeres with leverage and anchorage for pulling tendons. At low curvatures, {{it appears that the}} dermis is slack on both the concave and convex sides of the body. When the dermis is placed in tension, and resistance to bending is developed, which is referred to as <b>flexural</b> stiffness of the fish skin. The <b>flexural</b> stiffness {{is a result of the}} two dimensional stiffness of fish with heavily scaled skin, such as the longnose gar. This mechanical property of fish skin is important to the way a fish swims, because this mechanical property passively stiffens the body, which would otherwise would have been done muscularly. The <b>flexural</b> stiffness of fish skin act in a manner similar to the mechanism by which eel skin acts as an external tendon, however in the case of fish skin, the <b>flexural</b> stiffness acts as a mechanism to decelerate body movement rather than to generate a propulsive force.|$|E
2500|$|Strength of {{materials}} {{is defined as}} the maximum stress that can be endured before fracture occurs. Strength of biomaterials (bioceramics) is an important mechanical property because they are brittle. In brittle materials like bioceramics, cracks easily propagate when the material is subject to tensile loading, [...] unlike compressive loading. A number of methods are available for determining the tensile strength {{of materials}}, such as the bending <b>flexural</b> test, the biaxial <b>flexural</b> strength test and the weibull approach. In bioceramics, flaws influence the reliability and strength of the material during implantation and fabrication. There are a number of ways that flaws can be produced in bioceramics such as thermal sintering and heating. The importance is for bioceramics to have high reliability, [...] rather than high strength.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a simple}} beam of length [...] and <b>flexural</b> {{rigidity}} [...] is loaded {{at each end}} with clockwise moments [...] and , member end rotations occur in the same direction. These rotation angles can be calculated using the unit dummy force into the cal method or Darcy's Law.|$|E
2500|$|When a joint {{is being}} {{released}} {{and begins to}} rotate under the unbalanced moment, resisting forces develop at each member framed together at the joint. Although the total resistance {{is equal to the}} unbalanced moment, the magnitudes of resisting forces developed at each member differ by the members' <b>flexural</b> stiffness. Distribution factors can be defined as the proportions of the unbalanced moments carried by each of the members. In mathematical terms, distribution factor of member [...] framed at joint [...] is given as: ...|$|E
2500|$|C'b is a {{modification}} factor {{used in the}} equation for nominal <b>flexural</b> strength when determining lateral-torsional buckling. [...] The reason for this factor is to allow for non-uniform moment diagrams when the ends of a beam segment are braced. [...] The conservative value for C'b can be taken as 1, regardless of beam configuration or loading, {{but in some cases}} it may be excessively conservative. C'b is always equal to or greater than 1, never less. For cantilevers or overhangs where the free end is unbraced, Cb is equal to 1. Tables of values of C'b for simply supported beams exist.|$|E
2500|$|This {{force is}} {{regarded}} as a secondary force and {{is often referred to as}} [...] "ridge push". This is a misnomer as nothing is [...] "pushing" [...] horizontally and tensional features are dominant along ridges. It is more accurate to refer to this mechanism as gravitational sliding as variable topography across the totality of the plate can vary considerably and the topography of spreading ridges is only the most prominent feature. Other mechanisms generating this gravitational secondary force include <b>flexural</b> bulging of the lithosphere before it dives underneath an adjacent plate which produces a clear topographical feature that can offset, or at least affect, the influence of topographical ocean ridges, and mantle plumes and hot spots, which are postulated to impinge on the underside of tectonic plates.|$|E
2500|$|Linear {{arrangements}} of these papules is common (referred to as a Koebner phenomenon), {{especially on the}} forearms, but may occasionally be grouped, though not confluent, on <b>flexural</b> areas. [...] Generally, the initial lesions are localized, and remain so, to the chest, abdomen, glans penis, and flexor aspects of the upper extremities; however, less commonly, the disease process can (1) be strictly isolated to the palms and soles, presenting with many hyperkeratotic, yellow papules that may coalesce into plaques that fissure or “...sometimes a non-specific keratoderma resembling chronic eczema,” or (2) become more widespread, with papules widely distributed on the body—the extensor surfaces of the elbows, wrists, and hands, folds of the neck, submammary region in females, groin, thighs, ankles, and feet—and fusing into erythematous, minimally scaled plaques, with reddness that develops tints of violet, brown, and yellow.|$|E
