5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> using only the remote control of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5|$|Standard gear {{includes}} climate control, Blaupunkt sound, cruise control, full trip computer, rear park assist, {{traction control}} system, Electronic Stability Control, power mirrors and windows. The oil, voltage and temperature gauges are now digital. The interior offers {{a choice of}} light urban beige, white or black for the colours. The carpets remain dark as in the Holden Calais V-Series. The Senator Signature also offers a number of options such as a roof mounted <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> front park assist, rain sensing wipers and door entry lamps. Satellite navigation will become available as an option in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Windows Media Center was discontinued, and is uninstalled when {{upgrading}} from {{a previous}} version of Windows. Upgraded Windows installations with Media Center will receive the paid app Windows <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> free of charge for a limited, but unspecified, time. Microsoft had previously relegated Media Center and integrated DVD playback support to a paid add-on beginning on Windows 8 due {{to the cost of}} licensing the required DVD decoders, and the increasing number of PC devices that have no optical drives.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{high-end}} SpongeBob-themed electronics {{have been}} introduced by Imation Electronics Products under the Npower brand, including MP3 players, digital cameras, a <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> and a flatscreen television. Pictures of SpongeBob SquarePants also began {{to appear on the}} labels of 8 oz. cans of Green Giant cut green beans and frozen packages of Green Giant green beans and butter sauce, which featured free stickers in 2007 as part of an initiative to encourage kids to eat their vegetables. The Simmons Jewelry Co. released a $75,000 diamond pendant as part of a SpongeBob collection. In New Zealand, the UK-based Beechdean Group unveiled the SpongeBob SquarePants Vanilla Ice Cream character product as part of a licence deal with Nickelodeon. NZ Drinks launched the SpongeBob SquarePants bottled water.|$|E
5|$|Running {{throughout}} all the many paths his life could take or has taken, the adult Nemo recurringly awakens in a surrealistic world dominated by argyle patterns. This setting seems artificial, {{like a movie}} set, and often appears to bleed over into his other lives. Following clues that he finds scattered throughout this city, he ultimately arrives at a crumbling, abandoned wooden-framed house. He stumbles upon a <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> {{hooked up to a}} television screen. In the strangely interactive video, the 118-year-old Nemo converses with the 34-year-old one. He explains that the younger man does not exist. This is a universe where Nemo Nobody was never born, and his consciousness is stuck in some sort of limbo. He states that he is experiencing the story from the end and that he must stay alive until 5:50 AM on 12 February 2092.|$|E
5|$|Spirited Away {{was first}} {{released}} on VHS and DVD format in Japan by Buena Vista Home Entertainment on 19 July 2002. The Japanese DVD releases includes storyboards {{for the film}} and the special edition includes a Ghibli <b>DVD</b> <b>player.</b> Spirited Away currently holds the record for most home video copies sold of all-time in Japan with 2,403,000. In North America, the film was released on DVD and VHS formats by Walt Disney Home Entertainment on 15 April 2003. The attention brought by the Oscar win resulted in the film becoming a strong seller. The bonus features include Japanese trailers, a making-of documentary which originally aired on Nippon Television, interviews with the North American voice actors, a select storyboard-to-scene comparison and The Art of Spirited Away, a documentary narrated by actor Jason Marsden.|$|E
5|$|The HDMI {{standard}} {{was not designed}} to pass closed caption data (for example, subtitles) to the television for decoding. As such, any closed caption stream must be decoded and included as an image in the video stream(s) prior to transmission over an HDMI cable to be viewed on the DTV. This limits the caption style (even for digital captions) to only that decoded at the source prior to HDMI transmission. This also prevents closed captions when transmission over HDMI is required for upconversion. For example, a <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> that sends an upscaled 720p/1080i format via HDMI to an HDTV has no way to pass Closed Captioning data so that the HDTV can decode it, {{as there is no}} line 21 VBI in that format.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic Ride Control suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E
25|$|Hybrid SACDs claim {{a higher}} {{compatibility}} rate with conventional CD players than DualDisc, because hybrid SACDs conform to Red Book standards. However, a SACD or SACD-capable <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> {{is required to}} take advantage of the enhanced SACD layer. With a DualDisc, consumers could use their existing <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> to hear surround mixes. (DVD-Audio capable players are required for higher-resolution audio, if present.) In 2005, it was estimated that 75% of households in the United States have at least one <b>DVD</b> <b>player.</b>|$|E
25|$|While DVD {{playback}} initially had support, {{it required}} helper applications like Apple's <b>DVD</b> <b>Player.</b> DVD playback {{is no longer}} supported.|$|E
25|$|On February 23, 2008, the Xbox 360 HD <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> was {{discontinued}} by Microsoft. This decision {{came just}} days after Toshiba's announcement to discontinue all HD DVD players and effectively end the format war between Blu-ray and HD DVD. Two days later, {{the price of the}} HD <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> was reduced to a clearance price of $49.99. Peter Moore had stated that if HD DVD loses the format war, Microsoft may also release an external Blu-ray drive. This was later denied by Microsoft.|$|E
25|$|TAO Beach, {{located on}} top of TAO Nightclub, is the Venetian's day club and pool party. It offers seven cabanas, each with television, <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> Xbox 360, a stocked mini-fridge and a safe for valuables.|$|E
25|$|The LS, LTZ, & Royale {{all share}} the front bumper as the Holden WM Statesman while the LS lacks the Statesman's {{trademark}} foglights which are {{seen on the}} LTZ & Royale while the SS gains the Caprice's front bumper & foglamps minus the parking sensors. The LS also gains the VE Commodore Omega's interior & rims, while the LTZ gains the rims from the VE Commodore V based on the Commodore Omega, & the Statesman's interior minus the headrests with the LCD screens & <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> while the Royale gains the Statesman's rims, & the Statesman's interior with the LCD screens in the head rests & <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> from the Holden versions, the grille from the Daewoo Veritas, hood ornament {{similar to the one}} that the appears on the 4th & 5th generation models, and the SS gains the same rims as the WM Caprice, interior from the Caprice minus the headrests with the LCD screens & <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> color coded version of the grille's trim, and the optional lip spoiler from the WM Caprice.|$|E
25|$|On March 31, 2006, Toshiba {{released}} {{their first}} consumer-based HD <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> in Japan at Â¥110,000 (US$934). HDDVD {{was released in}} the United States on April 18, 2006, with players priced at $499 and $799.|$|E
25|$|The Xbox 360 HD <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> was an {{accessory}} for the Xbox 360 console {{that enables the}} playback of movies on HD DVD discs. Microsoft offered the drive for sale between November 2006 and February 2008. It was initially sold for $199.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, University Games {{released}} a Countdown DVD game, which contained recorded clips {{specifically for the}} game. Gameplay is achieved via a <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> and the remote control. The DVD was sold disk only, or as a bundle containing notepads and pencils.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{a screen}} {{recorder}} is featured which records whatever {{is on the}} screen. However, to prevent bootlegging the user is unable to record any video that is played on the <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> or purchased content from iTunes, thus being greyed out.|$|E
25|$|Following its discontinuation, the HD <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> {{was reduced}} to $49.99 in the US and Â£39.99 in the UK, and still {{included}} the $19.99/Â£19.99 (SRP) Universal Media Remote, essentially making the price just $30/Â£20. On May 1, 2008 Xtra-vision reduced the price to Â£6.99.|$|E
25|$|NTSC DVDs {{may carry}} closed {{captions}} in data packets of the MPEG-2 video streams {{inside of the}} Video-TS folder. Once played out of the analog outputs of a set top <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> the caption data is converted to the Line 21 format. They are output by the player to the composite video (or an available RF connector) for a connected TV's built-in decoder or a set-top decoder as usual. They can not be output on S-Video or component video outputs {{due to the lack}} of a colorburst signal on line 21. (Actually, regardless of this, if the <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> is in interlaced rather than progressive mode, closed captioning will be displayed on the TV over component video input if the TV captioning is turned on and set to CC1.) When viewed on a personal computer, caption data can be viewed by software that can read and decode the caption data packets in the MPEG-2 streams of the DVD-Video disc. Windows Media Player (before Windows 7) in Vista supported only closed caption channels 1 and 2 (not 3 or 4). Apple's <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> does not have the ability to read and decode Line 21 caption data which are recorded on a DVD made from an over-the-air broadcast. It can display some movie DVD captions.|$|E
25|$|In March 2009, Moss's {{foundation}} made {{a donation}} that enabled the Women and Children's Hospital of Charleston, West Virginia {{to purchase a}} Starlight Children's Foundation 'Fun Center' for their patients. The 'Fun Center' is a portable bedside entertainment system equipped with a TV, <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> and 22 Nintendo Wii games.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of hybrid formats which contain {{standard}} DVD-Video format video for playback in regular DVD players, and HD DVD video for playback in high definition on HD DVD players. The Combo disc is a dual sided disc with one side DVD and the other HD DVD, each of which can have up to two layers. The Twin disc is a single sided disc that can have up to three layers, with up to two layers dedicated to either DVD or HD DVD. These hybrid discs make retail marketing and shelf space management easier. Another advantage is hardware cross-compatibility. The average consumer does {{not have to worry about}} whether or not they can play a hybrid DVD: any standard home <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> can access the DVD-encoded content and any HD <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> can access both the DVD- and HD DVD-encoded content.|$|E

The vehicle went on sale in 2014-01-11.|$|E
25|$|Points of {{differentiation}} to the Statesman for the Caprice include sports suspension, larger 18inch alloy wheels, although 20inch wheels come as an option, and dual {{rear seat}} LCD screens (with <b>DVD</b> <b>player),</b> Bi-Xenon headlamps also come as standard {{as well as}} rear LED brake lights. Unlike the Commodore, the Caprice receives a full size spare alloy wheel as standard.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Jon Lech Johansen {{released}} an application called DeCSS, which allowed a CSS-encrypted DVD {{to play on}} a computer running the Linux operating system, {{at a time when}} no licensed <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> application for Linux had yet been created. The legality of DeCSS is questionable: one of the authors {{has been the subject of}} a lawsuit, and reproduction of the keys themselves is subject to restrictions as illegal numbers.|$|E
25|$|The all-new WK Grand Cherokee {{debuted in}} 2004 for the 2005 model year. It was first {{unveiled}} at the 2004 New York International Auto Show. Features {{available for the}} first time in a Jeep included Quadra-Drive II four-wheel drive, rear-seat <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> and optional 5.7L Hemi V8.

25|$|A hybrid {{version of}} the Nintendo GameCube with a {{commercial}} <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> called Q, was developed by Panasonic {{as part of the}} deal struck with Nintendo to develop the optical drive for the original GameCube hardware. Featuring a completely revised case, the Q overcomes the size limitation of the original GameCube's miniDVD tray by adding a commercial DVD-sized tray, among other hardware revisions. Released exclusively to Japan in December 2001, low sales resulted in the Q being discontinued in December 2003.|$|E
25|$|The current {{best selling}} karaoke in the Philippines is The Platinum, early {{produced}} and manufactured by HDT Corporation and currently a stand-alone product. The Platinum offers {{the same experience}} as MagicSing {{but it is a}} <b>DVD</b> <b>Player</b> and uses a CD with all of the karaoke songs instead of a song chips, later high-end models introduced HDD capabilities for users to just download the new update of songs on their website monthly, in some models the CD is updated every 3 or 6 months depending on the model.|$|E
25|$|Siminovsky {{testified at}} their trial. He {{said that after}} Salerno demanded $2,000 {{in order to have}} a Siminovsky case {{assigned}} to Garson, Siminovsky slipped the money into Salerno's pocket as they stood at adjacent urinals in a public courthouse restroom in Brooklyn. The court officer was also videotaped accepting a <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> and VCRs from the lawyer in front of the Joralemon Street courthouse on March 27, 2003. Salerno was convicted of two felonies, bribe-receiving and receiving a reward for official misconduct, and sentenced in August 2007 to 1â4Â½ years in prison.|$|E
25|$|The XU30 was previewed in January 2003 at the North American International Auto Show. Featuring a sleeker {{body style}} than its predecessor, the XU30 {{claimed to have}} a 0.35 C'd figure and new LED tailamps. From the inside, the RX 330 {{interior}} featured genuine Golden Bird's Eye Maple or Walnut wood trim, a sliding multi-level center storage console, dual-zone climate control, and power tilt/telescopic steering column. Available options included a 210-watt, 11-speaker Mark Levinson premium sound system, DVD-based navigation system with backup camera, rear seat <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> with wireless headphones, panoramic three panel moonroof, and heated seats.|$|E
25|$|The HD <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> {{connects to}} the Xbox 360 using a mini USB connection. All of the audio and video {{processing}} and output come from Xbox 360 itself. The unit can also function as a USB hub, with 2 ports on the rear. It also includes a clip for attaching the wireless network adapter to it, much like what Xbox 360 consoles of the time had. The device also has an integrated 256MB memory unit which is used for storage of HD DVD data and is accessible to the user for saving other data such as saved games.|$|E
25|$|The home {{distribution}} of anime releases were popularized in the 1980s with the VHS and LaserDisc formats. The VHS NTSC video format {{used in both}} Japan and the United States is credited as aiding the rising popularity of anime in the 1990s. The Laser Disc and VHS formats were transcended by the DVD format which offered the unique advantages; including multiple subtitling and dubbing tracks on the same disc. The DVD format also has its drawbacks in the its usage of region coding; adopted by the industry to solve licensing, piracy and export problems and restricted region indicated on the <b>DVD</b> <b>player.</b> The Video CD (VCD) format was popular in Hong Kong and Taiwan, but became only a minor format in the United States that was closely associated with bootleg copies.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, <b>DVD</b> <b>player,</b> or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E
25|$|Announced at CES 2006 {{and first}} {{publicly}} shown at E3 2006, an external HD DVD drive {{was released in}} North America on November 7, 2006 (for US$199.99) and in Japan on November 17, 2006 (for Â¥19,800). In the UK, France and Germany, the HD DVD drive was released for â¬199.99/Â£129.99. The HD DVD drive was bundled for a limited time with an Xbox 360 Universal Media Remote, {{as well as a}} HD DVD copy of Peter Jackson's King Kong. The drive plays HD DVD movies, although all Xbox 360 games will remain on the DVD format. Microsoft had no plans to include an internal HD <b>DVD</b> <b>player</b> in future Xbox 360 designs. The drive connects to the Xbox 360 via USB and contains two integrated USB ports on the rear. Games can not be played on the HD DVD drive.|$|E
