25|$|Much of the {{confusion}} concerning modularity exists in neuroscience because there is evidence for specific areas (e.g. V4 or V5/hMT+) and the concomitant behavioral deficits following brain insult (thus taken as evidence for modularity). In addition, evidence shows other areas are involved and that these areas subserve processing of multiple properties (e.g. V1) (thus taken as evidence against modularity). That these streams have the same implementation in early visual areas, like V1, is not inconsistent with a modular viewpoint: to adopt the canonical analogy in cognition, {{it is possible for}} different software to run on the same hardware. A consideration of psychophysics and neuropsychological data would suggest support for this. For example, psychophysics has shown that percepts for different properties are realized asynchronously. In addition, although achromats experience other cognitive defects they do not have motion deficits when their lesion is restricted to V4, or total loss of <b>form</b> <b>perception.</b> Relatedly, Zihl and colleagues' akinetopsia patient shows no deficit to color or object perception (although deriving depth and structure from motion is problematic, see above) and object agnostics do not have damaged motion or color perception, making the three disorders triply dissociable. Taken together this evidence suggests that even though distinct properties may employ the same early visual areas they are functionally independent. Furthermore, that the intensity of subjective perceptual experience (e.g. color) correlates with activity in these specific areas (e.g. V4), the recent evidence that synaesthetes show V4 activation during the perceptual experience of color, as well as the fact that damage to these areas results in concomitant behavioral deficits (the processing may be occurring but perceivers {{do not have access to}} the information) are all evidence for visual modularity.|$|E

5000|$|Whether or not visual form {{learning}} is retained in older humans is unknown. Studies prove that training causes improvement in <b>form</b> <b>perception</b> in both {{young and old}} adults. Learning to integrate local elements is negatively affected by age, however. [...] Advancing age hinders the ability to process stimuli efficiently to identify objects. More specifically, recognizing the most basic visual components of an object takes a lot longer. Since {{the time it takes}} to recognize the object-parts is expanded, the recognition of the object itself is also delayed. Recognition of partially blocked objects also slows down as we age In order to recognize an object that is partially obscured we need to make perceptual inferences based on the contours and borders that we can see. This is something that most young adults are able to do, but it slows down with age. In general, aging causes a decrease in the processing capabilities of the central nervous system, which delays the very complex process of <b>form</b> <b>perception.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Much of Gibson's work on {{perception}} {{derives from}} his {{time spent in}} the U.S Army Air Force. Here, he delved into thoughts on how imperative perception is on daily functions. His work may be the first to show a distinct difference between types of perception. <b>Form</b> <b>perception,</b> on one hand, is a display of two static displays, whereas object perception, involves one of the displays to be in motion. Gibson laid down the base for empirical perception research throughout his lifetime. He did work on adaptation and inspection of curved lines, which became a precursor for perceptual research later. His basic work rejected the perspective that perception in and of itself is meaningless, he instead argued meaning is independent of the perceiver. He claimed that the environment decides perception, and that meaning is in what the environment [...] "affords" [...] the observer.|$|E
50|$|Similarly, {{color vision}} {{and the ability to}} {{perceive}} shape and motion vary across the visual field; in humans color vision and <b>form</b> <b>perception</b> are concentrated {{in the center of the}} visual field, while motion perception is only slightly reduced in the periphery and thus has a relative advantage there. The physiological basis for that is the much higher concentration of color-sensitive cone cells and color-sensitive parvocellular retinal ganglion cells in the fovea - the central region of the retina, together with a larger representation in the visual cortex - in comparison to the higher concentration of color-insensitive rod cells and motion-sensitive magnocellular retinal ganglion cells in the visual periphery, and smaller cortical representation. Since cone cells require considerably brighter light sources to be activated, the result of this distribution is further that peripheral vision is much more sensitive at night relative to foveal vision (sensitivity is highest at around 20 deg eccentricity).|$|E
40|$|Consumers. use many cues in <b>forming</b> <b>perceptions</b> ofprice {{and quality}} of apparel. The {{environment}} in which a cue is presented {{has been shown to}} be influential in its interpretation. The concept of the minimum information environment (MIE) is introduced and investigated. The MIE for apparel includes legally required labeling information, vendor name, and brand name. Subjects (40 female junior and senior Retail and Textiles and Clothing majors, enrolled in an apparel course at a midwestern university) evaluated quality and estimated the price for four identical sweaters on which the MIE had been manipulated. A direct, positive relationship between price and quality (p <. 0001) was found with store type/prestige (p <. 0280) and fiber content (p <. 0001) appearing to influence predicted price primarily through effects on the perception of quality. No effects due to country of origin and care requirements could be detected on either predicted price or perception of quality. Both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are used by consumers in <b>forming</b> <b>perceptions</b> of product quality (Olson & Jacoby, 1972). Intrinsic cues, such as the physical composition and design of a product, should and usually do influence the perception of quality.

50|$|To {{determine}} which people qualify for special assistance {{because of their}} visual disabilities, various governments have specific definitions for legal blindness. In North America and most of Europe, legal blindness is defined as visual acuity (vision) of 20/200 (6/60) or less in the better eye with best correction possible. This means that a legally blind individual would have to stand 20 ft from an object to see it—with corrective lenses—with {{the same degree of}} clarity as a normally sighted person could from 200 ft. In many areas, people with average acuity who nonetheless have a visual field of less than 20 degrees (the norm being 180 degrees) are also classified as being legally blind.Approximately fifteen percent of those deemed legally blind, by any measure, have no light or <b>form</b> <b>perception.</b> The rest have some vision, from light perception alone to relatively good acuity. Low vision is sometimes used to describe visual acuities from 20/70 to 20/200.|$|E
50|$|<b>Form</b> <b>perception</b> is the {{recognition}} of objects in a particular form within a certain environment. An object is perceived by the retina as a two-dimensional image, but the image can vary for the same object {{in terms of the}} context with which it is viewed, the apparent size of the object, the angle from which it is viewed, how illuminated it is, as well as where it resides in the field of vision. Despite the fact that each instance of observing an object leads to a unique retinal response pattern, the visual processing in the brain is capable of recognizing these experiences as analogous, allowing invariant object recognition. Visual processing occurs in a hierarchy with the lowest levels recognizing lines and contours, and slightly higher levels performing tasks such as completing boundaries and recognizing contour combinations. The highest levels integrate the perceived information to recognize an entire object. Essentially object recognition is the ability to assign labels to objects in order to categorize and identify them, thus distinguishing one object from another. During visual processing information is not created, but rather reformatted in a way that draws out the most detailed information of the stimulus.|$|E
50|$|Wundt widens {{the term}} from Kant's usage to include {{conscious}} representation of some object or {{process of the}} external world. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of memory and imagination, but also perceptual processes, whereas other psychologists confine the term to the first two groups. One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by experiment and introspection. He regarded both of these as exact methods, interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other objectively valuable aids, specifically to those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom. Wundt designed the basic mental activity apperception—a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of assimilation and dissimilation (i.e. in color and <b>form</b> <b>perception</b> and his advocacy of objective methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends—that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.|$|E
