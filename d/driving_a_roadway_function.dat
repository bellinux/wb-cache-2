40|$|In {{the current}} study we {{examined}} age-related difference {{in the use of}} visual information in regulating braking. Younger and older drivers were presented with computer generated 3 -D scenes simulating <b>driving</b> on <b>a</b> <b>roadway</b> towards three red stop signs at a constant speed. The task of the drivers was to control braking and to stop {{as close as possible to}} the stop signs. The texture density on the ground, initial time to contact (TTC) and initial distance from the stop signs were manipulated. We found that older drivers had larger mean stop distance and lower crash rate than younger drivers. In addition, older drivers, as compared to younger drivers, tended to regulate more frequently at values larger than - 0. 5 and less frequently at values smaller than - 0. 5. These results, taken together, suggest that older drivers may use a more conservative strategy to control braking in order to avoid collisions...|$|R
40|$|Trailer-based search {{platforms}} for {{detection of}} radiological and nuclear threats are often based upon coded aperture gamma-ray imaging, because this method can be rendered insensitive to local variations in gamma background while still localizing the source well. Since gamma source emissions are rather easily shielded, {{in this work}} we consider the addition of fast neutron counting to a mobile platform for detection of sources containing Pu. A proof-of-concept system capable of combined gamma and neutron coded-aperture imaging was built inside of a trailer and used to detect a 252 Cf source while <b>driving</b> along <b>a</b> <b>roadway.</b> Neutron detector types employed included EJ- 309 in a detector plane and EJ- 299 - 33 in a front mask plane. While the 252 Cf gamma emissions were not readily detectable while driving by at 16. 9 [*]m standoff, the neutron emissions can be detected while moving. Mobile detection performance for this system and a scaled-up system design are presented, along with implications for threat sensing...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of cognitive load on the relationshipbetween confidence in detecting changes and actual change detectionperformance. Two experiments simulated glancing away from the roadway byperiodically blanking the driver’s view for one second.

Participants’sensitivity (d’) to vehicle changes was calculated and compared with subjectiveratings of confidence in detecting those changes. Results indicated a positiverelationship between d’ and confidence, suggesting that participants were aware ofthe factors that influenced their change-detection performance. However, thestrength of the relationship was situation-dependent. The strength of therelationship decreased when the detection task was more difficult and in thepresence of cognitive load...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a new method of detecting and tracking {{the boundaries of}} drivable regions in road without road-markings. As unmarked roads connect residential places to public roads, the capability of autonomously <b>driving</b> on such <b>a</b> <b>roadway</b> is important to truly realize self-driving cars in daily driving scenarios. To detect {{the left and right}} boundaries of drivable regions, our method first examines the image region at the front of ego-vehicle and then uses the appearance information of that region to identify the boundary of the drivable region from input images. Due to variation in the image acquisition condition, the image features necessary for boundary detection may not be present. When this happens, a boundary detection algorithm working frame-by-frame basis would fail to successfully detect the boundaries. To effectively handle these cases, our method tracks, using a Bayes filter, the detected boundaries over frames. Experiments using real-world videos show promising results. I...|$|R

After 269,995people were evacuated in advance of Lili, there were no deaths in the country. In nearby Florida, one person died after being swept into a drain during the storm's heavy rains. Moisture from Lili also fueled a storm that struck the northeastern United States, which contributed indirectly to a death when a man in Maine tried <b>driving</b> across <b>a</b> flooded <b>roadway.</b> Damage in the Bahamas was not severe, limited to some damaged roofs and downed trees. When the remnants of Lili struck Ireland and the United Kingdom, it produced strong winds and high seas that damaged hundreds of houses, causing $300million in damage (1996USD) and six deaths.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{increases}} in life expectancy, {{the aging of the}} baby boom generation, and a decline in birth rates, the US population is aging rapidly. In the future, older people will not only comprise a larger proportion of the general population, but also the driving population. This issue is characterized by <b>a</b> conflict between <b>roadway</b> safety for those who can no longer safely drive, and loss of independence when driving reduction and cessation become necessary. Previous research on driving decision making among older adults has largely focused on individual- and interpersonal-level factors. This study examined the influence of the physical transportation environment on driving reduction and cessation, after controlling for the effects of other predictors. Differences by gender and race were also assessed, as was the influence of the transportation environment on depressive symptoms. Longitudinal survival analysis techniques and generalized estimating equations were used to analyze seven waves of data spanning a 12 -year period from 1998 through 2010. Results showed that after controlling for the effects of demographics, health, and social support, there was a significant influence of the transportation environment on both driving reduction and <b>driving</b> cessation. <b>As</b> <b>roadway</b> density and congestion increased, the odds of driving reduction and cessation also increased. Men were more affected than women by the transportation environment, and Whites and Hispanics were more affected than African Americans and those of Other race. Driving reduction, driving cessation, and the transportation environment also significantly predicted the rate of depressive symptoms over time. Depressive symptoms were positively associated with <b>driving</b> limitations, while <b>a</b> more congested environment predicted fewer depressive symptoms. Other predictors of driving reduction and cessation included relationship status, household size, and having a friend who lives nearby. Results suggest that policy changes and modifications to the physical environment should be made to improve older drivers' ability to remain engaged in life. Creating mixed-use livable communities with goods and services in close proximity are warranted to mitigate some of the mobility challenges of older adulthood. Older individuals should also consider and plan for how their transportation environment will affect their desire to age in place...|$|R
40|$|Access {{management}} involves {{balancing the}} dual roles that roadways must play - through travel {{and access to}} property and economic activity. When these roles are not in proper balance, the result is <b>a</b> <b>roadway</b> system that <b>functions</b> sub-optimally. Arterial routes that have a too high driveway density and provide overly extensive access to property have high crash rates and begin to suffer in terms of traffic operations. Such routes become congested, delays increase, and mean travel speeds decline. The Iowa access management research and awareness project has had four distinct phases. Phase I involved a detailed review of the extensive national access management literature so lessons learned elsewhere could be applied in Iowa. In Phase II original case study research was conducted in Iowa. Phase III of the project concentrated on outreach and education about access management. Phase IV of the Iowa access management project extended the work conducted during Phases II and III. The main work products for Phase IV were as follows: 1) three additional before and after case studies, illustrating the impacts of various access management treatments on traffic safety, traffic operations, and business vitality; 2) an access management handbook aimed primarily at local governments in Iowa; 3) a modular access management toolkit with brief descriptions of various access management treatments and considerations; and 4) an extensive outreach plan aimed at getting the results of Phases I through IV of the project out to diverse audiences in Iowa and elsewhere...|$|R
