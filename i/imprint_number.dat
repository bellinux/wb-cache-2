40|$|In {{the field}} of {{forensics}} the recovery of serial numbers that have been removed or obliterated is a key analytical technique to investigations. Most serial <b>numbers</b> are <b>imprinted</b> by stamping the metal with force; this disrupts the metal crystalline structure beneath the <b>imprinted</b> <b>numbers.</b> This damaged crystalline layer beneath the <b>imprinted</b> <b>numbers</b> is called plastic deformation and {{is the key to}} recovering the numbers after obliteration. A number of methods are available for recovering such numbers. However, laser etching is becoming a more popular way to <b>imprint</b> <b>numbers</b> onto materials, and this makes recovery of the numbers much more difficult because laser etching does not leave any known plastic deformity. There is a need in forensic science for a method to recover obliterated, laser etched serial numbers. The hypothesis of this research is that laser etching will leave detectable changes arising from applying heat (the laser) in an oxidizing atmosphere (air). Reflectance FTIR and Raman spectroscopic methods are used to examine the surface for oxidative chemical changes. These are detectable as changes in vibrational modes with incorporation of oxygen into the perimeter of the imprinted area...|$|R

50|$|From the {{founding}} of the University Library into the twentieth century, rare materials were housed within the main stacks. Professor Harris F. Fletcher, a member of the English faculty from 1926 to 1962, advised the library on the purchase of books by and about John Milton, often assisting during his own visits to England. In 1937, the Library decided to designate a small space on the fourth floor ("The Seventeenth Century Room") to house Fletcher's collection of approximately 5,700 volumes. In 1966, the Rare Book & Manuscript library acquired the large personal collection of Professor and Shakespeare scholar Thomas W. Baldwin, with strong holdings in Renaissance pedagogy, literature, drama, history, and politics in an attempt to collect books that Shakespeare and his contemporaries might have read in their lifetimes. As a result of these and other acquisitions, the library is a significant repository of English imprints from the 16th to 19th centuries and incunabula, including numerous items from the New Haven firm of C. A. Stonehill. The library also began collecting incunabula; by 1950, its collection of pre-1501 <b>imprints</b> <b>numbered</b> nearly 400.|$|R
