40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a nonparametric <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> term {{structure}} model and investigate its implications on term structure dynamics and prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivative</b> securities. The nonparametric spot <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> process is estimated from the observed short-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> following a robust estimation procedure and the market price of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk is estimated as implied from the historical term structure data. That is, instead of imposing a priori restrictions on the model, data are allowed to speak for themselves, and at the same time the model retains a parsimonious structure and the computational tractability. The model is implemented using historical Canadian <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> term structure data. The parametric models with closed form solutions for bond and bond option prices, namely the Vasicek (1977) and CIR (1985) models, are also estimated for comparison purpose. The empirical results not only provide strong evidence that the traditional spot <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> models and market prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk are severely misspecified but also suggest that different model specifications have significant impact on term structure dynamics and prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivative</b> securities. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper surveys concepts, {{practices}} and analytical literature to assess benefits and risks for monetary stability of cross-border currency and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>derivative</b> operations in calm and turbulent periods, {{with a view}} of extracting implications for emerging economies. Monetary authorities must prevent one-sided positions in the currency, favor asset substitutability, and incorporate the enriched information set provided by derivative-based transactions into monetary policy design. In some circumstances, the use of derivatives by monetary authorities may help fulfill this role. By contrast, surcharges to compensate for a downward impact of derivatives on the cost of capital appear neither advisable nor necessary.
