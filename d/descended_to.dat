Offerings to the ancestors are made in homes and at puja mandaps (temporary shrines).|$|E

5|$|In late December 2014, NASA's MAVEN {{spacecraft}} detected {{evidence of}} widespread auroras in Mars's northern hemisphere and <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> approximately 20–30 degrees North latitude of Mars's equator.

Magnetic {{fields in the}} solar wind drape over Mars, into the atmosphere, and the charged particles follow the solar wind magnetic field lines into the atmosphere, causing auroras to occur outside the magnetic umbrellas.|$|E

5|$|The tiger {{catshark}} is {{a sluggish}} predator of a {{diverse array of}} benthic organisms. Its diet is dominated by bony fishes and crustaceans, and also includes cephalopods, polychaete worms, smaller sharks, and scavenged fish offal. It has been observed at the spawning grounds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), feeding on squid that have <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> the bottom to mate and deposit eggs. Documented predators of this species include the broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus) and the ragged tooth shark (Carcharias taurus).|$|E
5|$|These {{findings}} were later supported by chromatographic analysis of flavonoid compounds. Chromatograms of A.bradleyi showed {{a combination of}} all the compounds found in A.montanum and all those in A.platyneuron. A.×wherryi showed the same pattern, as it also contains chromosomes from both of those species. A specimen of A.stotleri was subsequently shown to form the same chromatograms as well. This showed that it was not <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> A.pinnatifidum, whose chromatograms contain compounds inherited from walking fern (A.rhizophyllum), and verified that A.stotleri was simply a form of A.bradleyi. Allozyme analysis in the 1980s also supported these hybrid origins of A.bradleyi.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{originated}} in a cold-core upper-level low that persisted {{for several days}} in early September in the Western Atlantic Ocean. The upper-level low was located within a large, persistent area of convection from the Gulf of Mexico through the central Atlantic, which resembled the Intertropical Convergence Zone but at a higher latitude. The convective feature was influenced by an anticyclone located over northern South America, which was opposite of the typical flow for September. The anticyclone also {{led to the formation}} of Hurricane Fern, Tropical Storm Heidi, and two tropical depressions. By September 5, the low had <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> the surface as its thermal structure warmed, and the next day it developed into a tropical depression about 235 mi (375 km) northeast of the Bahamas.|$|E
5|$|MOL Launches {{would have}} been {{conducted}} from Launch Complex 40 at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, and Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg Air Force Base. In 1966, a test flight was launched from LC-40, using a Titan IIIC. It consisted of the Gemini B spacecraft, built from the spacecraft used for the Gemini 2 test flight, atop OPS 0855, a boilerplate MOL space station. Gemini B was released on a suborbital trajectory, and <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> Earth to test modifications made to the heat shield, and ensure that the access hatch would not affect its performance. OPS 0855 continued on to orbit. Early MOL stations would have only been manned by a single crew, launched with the station. Later stations {{would have been}} designed to be resupplied, and support multiple crews, delivered by additional Gemini spacecraft, or derivatives.|$|E

5|$|Rivoli {{departed}} Venice on 21 February 1812 {{under the}} command of Commodore Jean-Baptiste Barré, accompanied by five smaller escort ships, the 16-gun brigs Mercure and Iéna, the 8-gun brig Mamelouck and two small gunboats, strung out in an improvised line of battle. Barré hoped to make use of a heavy sea fog that had <b>descended,</b> <b>to</b> break out from Venice and elude pursuit. Victorious had held off from the land during the fog and by the time Talbot was able to observe Venice harbour at 14:30, his opponent had escaped. Searching for Barré, who was sailing to Pula, Talbot spotted one of the French brigs at 15:00 and gave chase.|$|E
5|$|Shaw {{explored}} what {{he could}} of the western workings, before he {{and some of the}} survivors began tackling the fire. The water pipes from the surface in the Lancaster shaft were all fractured, and hand-extinguishers were used.

From 11:00am the specialist mines rescue teams began arriving at the colliery from the Rhymney and Rhondda Valleys, as did Red Cross workers and local ambulance services; a police detachment was sent from Cardiff in a special train. Members of the Inspectorate of Mines were quickly on the scene, and an inspector <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> view the mine the same morning.|$|E

5|$|The slow-swimming leopard {{catshark}} generally {{spends the}} day resting inside caves or crevices, either {{alone or in}} groups. At night, it moves towards the shore to actively forage for small bony fishes, cephalopods, crustaceans, and polychaete worms. In False Bay, fishes {{are the most important}} prey type, followed by cephalopods and then the Cape rock lobster (Jasus lalandii). This shark has been observed attacking octopus and cuttlefish by seizing and tearing off tentacles with a twisting motion. Like its close relative the pyjama shark, it will temporarily abandon its nocturnal habits {{to take advantage of the}} daytime mass spawnings of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudi), which occur unpredictably year-round with a peak from October to December. The sharks lie motionless amongst the squids' egg masses with their heads hidden, and make sudden lunges at female squid that have <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> the sea floor to attach their eggs.|$|E

As the Hellcats <b>descended</b> <b>to</b> release height, they were intercepted by 15–20 enemy fighters who had been hiding in the overcast to the east of the field. More enemy reinforcements arrived soon after, bringing the total number of Japanese planes to as high as 50.
