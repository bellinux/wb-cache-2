Before his arrest {{at the age of}} 18, Weigman had used this ability to become a well known phone phreaker, memorizing phone numbers by tone and performing uncanny imitations of various phone line operators to perform pranks such as swatting on his rivals.|$|E
25|$|Released in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US, {{the album}} was warmly received. In Australia it peaked at No.19, and {{appeared}} on the U.S. Billboard 200. A promotional tour started in April 1986, with concerts {{both at home and}} abroad. Unexpectedly, Willson-Piper suddenly quit mid-tour after rising <b>in-band</b> tensions and on 10 July, The Church performed as a three-piece in Hamburg, Germany. Willson-Piper returned within a week after Kilbey agreed that future releases would contain more group efforts.|$|E
500|$|In digital {{television}} broadcasting, {{there are three}} competing standards {{that are likely to}} be adopted worldwide. These are the ATSC, DVB and ISDB standards; the adoption of these standards thus far is presented in the captioned map. All three standards use MPEG-2 for video compression. ATSC uses Dolby Digital AC-3 for audio compression, ISDB uses Advanced Audio Coding (MPEG-2 Part 7) and DVB has no standard for audio compression but typically uses MPEG-1 Part 3 Layer 2. The choice of modulation also varies between the schemes. In digital audio broadcasting, standards are much more unified with practically all countries choosing to adopt the Digital Audio Broadcasting standard (also known as the Eureka 147 standard). The exception is the United States which has chosen to adopt HD Radio. HD Radio, unlike Eureka 147, is based upon a transmission method known as <b>in-band</b> on-channel transmission that allows digital information to [...] "piggyback" [...] on normal AM or FM analog transmissions.|$|E
500|$|One {{measure of}} cable {{manufacturing}} and installation quality is how closely the characteristic impedance adheres to the nominal impedance along its length. [...] Impedance {{changes can be}} caused by variations in geometry along the cable length. [...] In turn, these {{can be caused by}} a faulty manufacturing process or by faulty installation (such as not observing limits on bend radii). [...] Unfortunately, there is no easy, non-destructive method of directly measuring impedance along a cable's length. [...] It can, however, be indicated indirectly by measuring reflections, that is, return loss. [...] Return loss by itself does not reveal much, since the cable design will have some intrinsic return loss anyway due to not having a purely resistive characteristic impedance. [...] The technique used is to carefully adjust the cable termination to obtain as close a match as possible and then to measure the variation of return loss with frequency. [...] The minimum return loss so measured is called the structural return loss (SRL). [...] SRL is a measure of a cables' adherence to its nominal impedance {{but it is not a}} direct correspondence, errors further from the generator have less effect on SRL than those close to it. [...] The measurement must also be carried out at all <b>in-band</b> frequencies to be significant. [...] The reason for this is that equally spaced errors introduced by the manufacturing process will cancel and be invisible, or at least much reduced, at certain frequencies due to quarter wave impedance transformer action.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{revisions}} of the PCI specification add support for message-signaled interrupts. In this system, a device signals its need for service by performing a memory write, rather than by asserting a dedicated line. [...] This alleviates the problem of scarcity of interrupt lines. [...] Even if interrupt vectors are still shared, it does not suffer the sharing problems of level-triggered interrupts. [...] It also resolves the routing problem, because the memory write is not unpredictably modified between device and host. [...] Finally, because the message signaling is <b>in-band,</b> it resolves some synchronization problems that can occur with posted writes and out-of-band interrupt lines.|$|E
2500|$|For digital radio, the FCC chose {{proprietary}} HD Radio, which crowds {{the existing}} FM broadcast band and even AM broadcast band with <b>in-band</b> adjacent-channel sidebands, which create noise in other stations. [...] This {{is in contrast}} to worldwide DAB, which uses unused TV channels in the VHF band III range. [...] This too has patent fees, while DAB does not. [...] While there has been some effort by iBiquity to lower them, the fees for HD Radio are still an enormous expense when converting each station, and this fee structure presents a potentially high cost barrier to entry for community radio and other non-commercial educational stations when entering the HD Radio market.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the TV business, Wierson also led a complete overhaul of WNYE-FM 91.5FM, with new formats for morning and afternoon drive-time programming, re-branding itself as [...] "Radio New York" [...] and in partnership with live coast-to-coast music feeds from Seattle-based alternative rock station KEXP. The announcement {{was seen as an}} aggressive move by the New York City Indie music community, causing broadcaster WFUV to take public on-air swipes at Wierson for having encroached on their market. On March 5, 2009, [...] Wierson, along with NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg, announced that WNYE, after being in Brooklyn since 1938, was moving its radio broadcast operations to Manhattan, and was unveiling a new digital transmitter, capable of transmitting multiple <b>in-band</b> HD radio streams.|$|E
50|$|<b>In-band</b> {{control is}} a {{characteristic}} of network protocols with which data control is regulated. <b>In-band</b> control passes control data on the same connection as main data. Protocols that use <b>in-band</b> control include HTTP and SMTP. This is as opposed to Out-of-band control used by protocols such as FTP.|$|E
50|$|<b>In-band</b> {{binary data}} {{transfer}} is limited: Binary data must be first base64 encoded {{before it can}} be transmitted <b>in-band.</b> Therefore, any significant amount of binary data (e.g., file transfers) is best transmitted out-of-band, using <b>in-band</b> messages to coordinate. The best example of this is the Jingle XMPP Extension Protocol, XEP-0166.|$|E
50|$|Out-of-band, {{indicating}} that the control signals are sent separately from the data, {{is in contrast to}} <b>in-band</b> signalling where the control is sent as special forms of data communications. An example of <b>in-band</b> signalling would be Escape sequence coding.|$|E
50|$|Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) are an {{alternative}} <b>in-band</b> method of signaling an interrupt, using special <b>in-band</b> messages to replace traditional out-of-band assertion of dedicated interrupt lines.
