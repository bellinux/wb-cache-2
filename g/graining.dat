5|$|After {{discussions with}} Whiting during the Friday night drivers' briefing, {{the height of}} the apex at turn sixteen was {{increased}} and the wall around that area was moved back. A new apex kerb at turn eighteen was built to stop dirt and stones from accumulating on the circuit, and the track was extensively cleaned. Drivers were told they could drive into the pit lane from the racing line without incurring a penalty. Bridgestone had reported heavy tyre <b>graining</b> during the Friday practice sessions; their Motorsport Tyre Development director Hirohide Hamashima said drivers would face a challenge of looking after their tyres if track conditions had not changed before the race. Kubica was quickest in the final practice session; his late lap of 1:37.354 was 0.048 seconds quicker than Hamilton's in second. Alonso was third-quickest and Webber was fourth. Rosberg, who was fifth, slowed at turn fifteen during the session's closing stages; he narrowly avoided a collision with Alonso. The incident was subject to a stewards' investigation; the stewards decided not to penalise Rosberg. Massa, Button, Hülkenberg, Schumacher and Sutil completed the top ten ahead of qualifying. Vettel was sixteenth; the result of running onto the grass.|$|E
5|$|Some of Belton's many {{rooms have}} been altered {{over the last}} 300 years both in use and design. One of the {{principal}} rooms, the Marble Hall (1), {{the first of the}} large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a chequer board patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the great hall was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from William the Conqueror to William III, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain lime wood embellishments attributed to Grinling Gibbons. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by Jeffry Wyatville, who in addition to <b>graining</b> and painting the panelling to imitate oak installed new doors.|$|E

50|$|Migration {{recrystallization}} (grain-boundary migration) is {{the processes}} by which a <b>grain</b> grows {{at the expense of}} the neighboring <b>grain(s).</b> At low temperatures, the mobility of the <b>grain</b> boundary may be local, and the <b>grain</b> boundary may bulge into a neighboring <b>grain</b> with a high dislocation density and form new, smaller, independent crystals by a process called low-temperature <b>grain</b> boundary migration, or bulging recrystallization. The bulges produced can separate from the original <b>grain</b> to form new <b>grains</b> by the formation of subgrain (low-angle) boundaries, which can evolve into <b>grain</b> boundaries, or by migration of the <b>grain</b> boundary. Bulging recrystallization often occurs along boundaries of old <b>grains</b> at triple junctions. At high temperatures, the growing <b>grain</b> has a lower dislocation density than the <b>grain(s)</b> consumed, and the <b>grain</b> boundary sweeps through the neighboring <b>grains</b> to remove dislocations by high-temperature grain-boundary migration crystallization. <b>Grain</b> boundaries are lobate with a variable <b>grain</b> size, with new <b>grains</b> generally larger than existing subgrains. At very high temperatures, <b>grains</b> are highly lobate or ameboid, but can be nearly strain-free.|$|R
5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{momentum}} continued {{one week}} later in Korea, winning his third consecutive race and taking a six-point championship lead as Fernando Alonso finished third. Vettel overcame pole-sitter Mark Webber at the start, and was aided in building up a lead by first-lap contact between Jenson Button, Nico Rosberg and Kamui Kobayashi that saw Button and Rosberg retire with damage from the collision; Rosberg pulled over on the approach to the third turn, forcing a protracted yellow flag period as marshalls attempted to retrieve his car. With the sporting regulations banning overtaking while yellow flags were shown, the field was effectively thinned out in the opening laps as drivers were unable to pass one another. Tyre management {{became the focus of}} the race, as drivers reported heavy <b>graining,</b> particularly on the right-front tyre, which bore most of the load over a lap of the circuit. Vettel ignored six radio calls from his pit wall cautioning him that a tyre failure was imminent, only backing off just enough in the final few laps to secure victory over Webber by six seconds. The team later denied that there had ever been a problem with Vettel's tyres. Further down the order, Scuderia Toro Rosso's Jean-Éric Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo fought their way from sixteenth and twenty-first on the grid to finish eighth and ninth, while Romain Grosjean drove a conservative race to finish seventh, having been warned beforehand by the stewards that another first-lap altercation would likely result in his disqualification from the race. Lewis Hamilton's day went from bad to worse when an anti-roll bar on his McLaren failed, while the car handled its tyres so poorly that he was forced to make an unscheduled stop {{in order to make it}} to the finish, only to tear up a length of astroturf that wreaked havoc on his downforce and he slid down to tenth place, narrowly fending off an opportunistic charge from Sergio Pérez to take the final World Championship point on offer. Button's retirement and Hamilton's single point meant that McLaren lost second place in the World Constructors' Championship to Ferrari, and Hamilton admitted that his bid to be the 2012 World Drivers' Champion was over.|$|E

Furthermore, larger carpels, a faster <b>grain</b> filling rate, earlier and longer <b>grain</b> filling, more <b>grain</b> water, faster <b>grain</b> water absorption and loss rates, and larger <b>grain</b> dimensions were associated with higher <b>grain</b> weight.

For genes having similar effects on <b>grain</b> length and width with opposite directions, such as GL 7 /GW 7 (Song et al., 2015), the influence is usually exerted on <b>grain</b> shape rather than <b>grain</b> weight. One of the two QTL we identified, qGS 1 - 35.2, affected <b>grain</b> shape without influencing <b>grain</b> weight and other yield traits. The MY 46 allele decreased <b>grain</b> length but increased <b>grain</b> width, resulting in little effect on <b>grain</b> weight and enhanced effect on the ratio of <b>grain</b> length to width (Table 3). This type of QTL could be used to modify <b>grain</b> shape without yield penalty. For genes simultaneously controlling <b>grain</b> length and width with the same allelic direction, and those contributing to either <b>grain</b> length or width, such as most of the cloned genes conditioning these traits (Li and Li, 2016; Yu et al., 2017), the same direction of QTL effect is always simultaneously detected on <b>grain</b> size and <b>grain</b> weight. Another QTL we identified, qGW 1 - 35.5, falls into this category (Table 3). The MY 46 allele significantly increased both the <b>grain</b> length and width, and in the meantime enhanced <b>grain</b> weight. This type of QTL could be used for yield improvement.
