40|$|To prevent {{unauthorized}} access to protected {{trusted platform module}} (TPM) objects, authorization protocols, such as the object-specific authorization protocol (OSAP), have been introduced by the trusted computing group (TCG). By using OSAP, processes trying {{to gain access to}} the protected TPM objects need to prove their knowledge of relevant <b>authorization</b> <b>data</b> before access to the objects can be granted. Chen and Ryan’s 2009 analysis has demonstrated OSAP’s authentication vulnerability in sessions with shared <b>authorization</b> <b>data.</b> They also proposed the Session Key Authorization Protocol (SKAP) with fewer stages as an alternative to OSAP. Chen and Ryan’s analysis of SKAP using ProVerif proves the authentication property. The purpose of this paper was to examine the usefulness of Colored Petri Nets (CPN) and CPN Tools for security analysis. Using OSAP and SKAP as case studies, we construct intruder and authentication property models in CPN. CPN Tools is used to verify the authentication property using a Dolev–Yao-based model. Verification of the authentication property in both models using the state space tool produces results consistent with those of Chen and Ryan...|$|R

For example, Enterprise-A could be financial services company offering retirement fund (e.g. U.S. 401 K) management for employees of Enterprise-B. Here Enterprise-A has customer-facing applications that are operating in the Cloud (e.g. SaaS application). A key aspect of this scenario is that Enterprise-B is the authoritative source of identity for its employees, all of whom are accessing the cloud-based application belonging to Enterprise-A. Thus, authentication and <b>authorization</b> <b>data</b> must be conveyed from Enterprise-B into the cloud-based application within the domain or realm of Enterprise-A.|$|R

Critical features of the system architecture and its handling of the authorization process differentiate the system from existing authorization components by addressing common needs not adequately addressed by existing systems.

40|$|As {{the health}} care {{industry}} enters the era of knowledge management it must place security at the foundation of the transition. Risks are pervasive to every aspect of information and knowledge management. Without secure practices that seek to avoid or mitigate the effects of these risks, how can health care organisations ensure that knowledge is captured, stored, distributed, used, destroyed and restored securely? In an age where risks and security threats are ever-increasing, secure knowledge management is an essential business practice. The cost of security breaches in a health care context can range from the unauthorized access of confidential information to the potential loss or unauthorized modification of patient information leading to patient injury. In this chapter the authors highlight different approaches to minimising these risks, based on the concepts of authentication, <b>authorization,</b> <b>data</b> integrity, availability and confidentiality...|$|R
