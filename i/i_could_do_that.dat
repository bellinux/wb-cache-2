But it’s hard to {{anticipate}} {{that sort of thing}} when you’re just writing silly songs and recording them in your living room over a weekend.". While musicianship is not the strength of the band, Paul says that the fans [...] "know we're not the best singers and keyboard players, but we're okay. And they think, well, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> too. I think that’s really encouraging to people..." [...] Paul sees the brothers as a [...] "bridge between this mainstream phenomena of Harry Potter and the indie rock underground. Plus, we’re also pretty strong adherents to the DIY ideal." [...] The two brothers promote this ideal of making music independently and have fused the legions of fans on to the DIY free-for-all of indie rock and punk music, albeit of the silly kind.|$|E

2500|$|The rest of Dammeier's {{argument}} {{was devoted to}} the issue of the other respondents' privacy expectations in communicating with Quon, after Sotomayor asked him if they could prevail even if Quon did not. Dammeier likened the department's actions to going to the post office to get letters sent to Quon instead of his house. Scalia pointed out that Quon could have obtained hard copies of the messages and circulated them himself. [...] "hen I get a piece of mail from somebody, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> as well", the lawyer replied, [...] "but that doesn't mean that the government gets to go to the post office and get my mail before I get it". Richland replied in his rebuttal argument that [...] "the truth is that all of these plaintiffs admitted that they knew that this was a department-issued pager, and this wasn't a post office".|$|E

2500|$|... 2Pacalypse Now {{generated}} significant controversy {{for numerous}} reasons. The songs [...] "Trapped" [...] and [...] "Brenda's Got a Baby" [...] were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney {{claimed he was}} influenced by 2Pacalypse Now and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, [...] "There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It {{has no place in}} our society." [...] Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, [...] "I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang," [...] Shakur said. [...] "I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I could rap about that." [...] The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, 2Pacalypse Now was listed as one of Shakur's [...] "certified classic" [...] albums, along with Me Against the World, All Eyez on Me and [...] 2Pacalypse Now went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA.
