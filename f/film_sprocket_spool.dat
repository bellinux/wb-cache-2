5000|$|In use, the Retina Reflex {{frame counter}} works down from 35 (or 20) to 0, {{at which point}} the film advance locks. While this is {{convenient}} for the user and does prevent torn <b>film</b> <b>sprockets</b> {{at the end of a}} roll, setting the counter up properly at the beginning of a roll is complex, awkward, and time-consuming. This is a typical example of much of Retina engineering - complex and ingenious, but perhaps over-engineered.|$|R
50|$|The {{intermittent}} mechanism can {{be constructed}} in different ways. For smaller gauge projectors (8 mm and 16 mm), a pawl mechanism engages the <b>film's</b> <b>sprocket</b> hole one side, or holes on each side. This pawl advances only when the film is to be moved to the next image. As the pawl retreats for the next cycle it is drawn back and does not engage the film. This {{is similar to the}} claw mechanism in a motion picture camera.|$|R
50|$|The digital {{information}} was {{printed on the}} film, similar to Dolby Digital and SDDS. However, unlike those formats, there was no analog optical backup in 35mm and no magnetic backup in 70mm, meaning that if the {{digital information}} were damaged in some way, {{there would be no}} sound at all. This was one of the factors that contributed to its inevitable demise; the then-new Dolby Digital format moved its information to another area (in between the <b>film</b> <b>sprocket</b> holes), preserving the optical tracks.|$|R

50|$|Completed artwork was copied under top {{lights on}} a pin-registered camera {{on a high}} {{contrast}} film such as Kodaline or Kodalith to create 35mm mattes used in the optical slide printing process. When needed, pin-registered positive mattes known as countermattes were made by contact printing from the mattes. When a set of mattes and countermates were completed, the optical slide camera was used to assemble the separate images onto a single frame of film by making multiple exposures through the mattes. Accuracy in positioning the separate elements of the slide is {{made possible by the}} <b>film</b> <b>sprockets,</b> which were also used to position the finished color slides and masks in the slide mounts.|$|R
50|$|Sprockets {{are used}} in the film {{transport}} mechanisms of movie projectors and movie cameras. In this case, the <b>sprocket</b> wheels engage <b>film</b> perforations in the <b>film</b> stock. <b>Sprocket</b> feed was also used for punched tape and is used for paper feed to some computer printers.|$|R

50|$|In film movies these timing {{errors are}} most {{commonly}} caused by worn films skipping over the movie projector <b>sprockets</b> because the <b>film</b> has torn <b>sprocket</b> holes.|$|R
5000|$|The rotary prism camera allowed higher frame rates without placing as {{much stress}} on the film or {{transport}} mechanism. The film moves continuously past a rotating prism which is synchronized to the main <b>film</b> <b>sprocket</b> such that {{the speed of the}} film and the speed of the prism are always running at the same proportional speed. The prism is located between the objective lens and the film, such that the revolution of the prism [...] "paints" [...] a frame onto the film for each face of the prism. Prisms are typically cubic, or four sided, for full frame exposure. Since exposure occurs as the prism rotates, images near the top or bottom of the frame, where the prism is substantially off axis, suffer from significant aberration. A shutter can improve the results by gating the exposure more tightly around the point where the prism faces are nearly parallel.|$|R
50|$|All <b>film</b> {{projectors}} use <b>sprocket</b> rollers to {{move the}} film and a pull-down claws to move and stop the film in the gate. The film is moved in the gate while the shutter blocks the light.|$|R
50|$|The Semetex {{prototype}} design {{actually had}} the eight channels of uncompressed data placed into three locations: data bordering {{both sides of}} the analog sound track and additional data tracks bordering the opposite edge of the picture frame. These locations were chosen to ensure the data were not placed into the sprocket perforation area of the film to prevent the known wear and degradation that occurs in the perforation area (due to the mechanical <b>film</b> <b>sprockets)</b> from degrading the data. Clocking and guide tracks were placed {{on each side of the}} <b>film</b> near the <b>sprockets.</b> The prototype sound camera imprinted the Digital audio and Analog audio 'at speed'. A companion digital reader was designed to form a complete system. After Sony received the prototype they enlarged the data bits from the original 8 micron (micrometer) size and moved the data locations; the eight digital audio channels are now recorded on (and recovered from) the edges of the film. As Sony engineers became more actively involved in the project, the design of the SDDS format evolved toward a more robust implementation, including the use of 5:1 ATRAC data compression, extensive error detection and correction, and most critically redundancy. The redundancy allows data to be recovered substantially intact even in the presence of a film splice (common for repairing damaged film). The data bit size on film was enlarged from 8 micron (micrometer) to 24 micrometers square, and Semetex's green laser system for the sound camera was replaced with simpler LED/fiber optic assemblies, which along with data compression, then allowed 24 micrometers square data.|$|R
50|$|Long {{used for}} home movies before the video camera, this uses double <b>sprocketed</b> 16 mm <b>film,</b> which is {{run through the}} camera, exposing one side, then removed from the camera, the takeup and feed reels are switched, and the film run through a second time. exposing the other side. The 16 mm film is then split {{lengthwise}} into two 8 mm pieces that are spliced to make a single projectable <b>film</b> with <b>sprockets</b> holes on one side.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, compact {{imported}} European stereo cameras that used 35 mm slide film began {{appearing in the}} US market. The most notable example was the Verascope F40. These cameras featured a [...] "7P" [...] format, meaning that each image was 7 <b>film</b> perforations (<b>sprocket</b> holes) wide, yielding 11 stereo pairs on a 20-exposure roll of 35 mm film. Because these cameras (and some later models) came from Europe, this {{became known as the}} [...] "European format".|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} photography, Brodovitch had a {{distinct}} {{feel for what}} the magazine needed. He favored on-location fashion photography {{as opposed to the}} studio shots normally used in other fashion publications. He urged his photographers to look for jarring juxtapositions in their images. One such spread features a woman in a full-length Dior gown posed between two circus elephants. The cinematic effect, a trademark characteristic of his layouts, involved using photographs as if they were stills from a film. He would repeat a pose or a dress several times across a spread to give a narrative, temporal feeling. At times, Brodovitch would arbitrarily take a series of photographs and adopt a story line to go with them, as though recapping a movie. He was known to push this idea even further by adding <b>film</b> <b>sprocket</b> borders to photographs at times. Brodovitch also often emphasized spatial illusions, using type and photographs to create multiple perspectives within a space. The notion of mirroring and doubling also interested him, {{as can be seen in}} how he paired similar pictures on a spread or dividing halves of one image across the gutter of the page.|$|R
50|$|TIFF has grown, {{steadily}} adding initiatives {{throughout the}} years. TIFF Cinematheque (formerly Cinematheque Ontario) and the Film Reference Library (FRL) opened in 1990. The TIFF Kids International <b>Film</b> Festival (formerly <b>Sprockets)</b> launched in 1998. Film Circuit began exhibiting independent and Canadian films in under-serviced cities across Canada in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Those {{wishing to}} {{photograph}} with an 828-format camera have few options. As of 2005, 828 film {{is available for}} purchase on the Internet; this film is probably respooled from bulk unperforated 35mm film. Another option is to use standard 135 <b>film,</b> with <b>sprocket</b> holes, and respool it with used 828 backing paper onto old spools. The effective image size will be reduced with this method as the perforations will intrude on the image area. Finally, as with other obsolete film types, 120 film can be cut (with backing paper) and respooled onto 828 spools.|$|R
50|$|DX (Digital indeX) {{encoding}} is an ANSI and I3A standard, originally {{introduced by}} Kodak in March 1983, for marking 135 and APS photographic film and film cartridges. It has several parts, a latent image DX film edge barcode on the <b>film</b> below the <b>sprocket</b> holes, a code on the cartridge used by automatic cameras, and a barcode on the cartridge read by photo-finishing machines.|$|R
50|$|Throat Sprockets is {{an erotic}} horror novel by Tim Lucas, {{published}} in 1994. It concerns an unnamed protagonist's obsessive quest {{to learn all}} he can about a mysterious <b>film</b> called Throat <b>Sprockets.</b> As fixation on the film consumes his personal life, he develops a sexual fetish for women's throats, an affinity which begins spreading to global and apocalyptic proportions, as the film's cult status and legend grows.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the film}} {{cassette}} engages the rewind fork at the top, {{and it is}} {{held in place by}} a hinged retaining ring at the bottom. The film lead passes under the fixed black film-pressure plate {{on its way to the}} slotted large diameter take-up spool. The spool always rotates the same angular amount to advance the <b>film</b> without a <b>sprocket</b> wheel drive. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter take-up spool that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|R
5000|$|Striped {{magnetic}} film is motion picture film in which 'stripes' of magnetic oxide {{are placed on}} the <b>film</b> between the <b>sprocket</b> holes and {{the edge of the}} film, and sometimes also between the sprocket holes and the image. Each of these stripes has one channel of the audio recorded on it. This technique was first introduced in September, 1953 by Hazard E. Reeves for Cinemascope. Four tracks are present on the film: Left, Center, Right and Surround. This 35mm four-track magnetic sound format was used from 1954 through 1982 for [...] "roadshow" [...] screenings of big-budget feature films.|$|R
50|$|William Kennedy Laurie Dickson, a Scottish {{inventor}} {{and employee}} of Thomas Edison, designed the Kinetographic Camera in 1891. The camera was powered by {{an electric motor}} and was capable of shooting with the new <b>sprocketed</b> <b>film.</b> To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement {{that would be the}} foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|R
5000|$|The {{control track}} {{consisted}} of a clear line on a dark background in the spaces between the sprocket holes on the soundtrack side of the film (i.e. in the spaces now used for the data packets on Dolby SR-D prints). It was scanned by an additional optical track reader that scanned a portion of film 0.09" [...] (2.3mm) wide {{along the line of}} the sprocket holes. The alternating sprocket holes and dark film produced a 96 Hz signal from the track reader, the amplitude of which depended on the average density of the <b>film</b> between the <b>sprocket</b> holes and thus on the control track width.|$|R
50|$|Rewinding {{the film}} into its {{cassette}} {{is accomplished by}} first pulling the wind-on knob to its raised position followed by turning the left-hand top mounted rewind-knob clock-wise; this {{is accompanied by a}} rattling noise. It is not possible to raise the wind-on knob if it is not free to rotate, it is freed by turning the knob clock-wise while depressing the double exposure prevention button. The frame counter dial rotates during rewind as long as the <b>film</b> passes the <b>sprocket</b> wheel drum. The wind gears, which is visible inside the machined steel film chamber. All internal metal parts are either plated steel or brass. The film pressure-plate is chrome-plated polished steel, while the other parts are nickel-plated.|$|R
50|$|However, {{in a movie}} camera, it is {{done through}} a process by which a shutter opens exposing the film {{negative}} to light {{for a split second}} (the standard for regular motion in North America is 1/48 of a second, which corresponds to 180 degrees, but shutters with 200 degrees were popular back when the then-available color negative film had an ASA of 50; today's color negative film is available with an ASA of 500), then the shutter closes blocking light from reaching the negative. Once the shutter is completely closed, a claw pulls down the next frame of negative <b>film</b> by the <b>sprocket</b> holes into the film gate and the process begins again. A movie projector works in a similar way.|$|R
50|$|Triptography is an {{automatic}} photographic technique whereby {{a roll of}} film is used three times (either by the same photographer or, {{in the spirit of}} Exquisite Corpse, three different photographers), causing it to be triple-exposed {{in such a way that}} the chances of any single photograph having a clear and definite subject is nearly impossible. Indeed, finding any edges on the negative itself during the developing process is a nearly impossible task. Typically the developing of such a roll of film is an exercise in automatic technique in and of itself, cutting the <b>film</b> by counting <b>sprocket</b> holes alone, with no regard for the images present on the negative. The results have a quality reminiscent of the transitory period in sleep when one dream suddenly becomes another.|$|R
5000|$|All {{magazines}} {{are composed of}} a [...] "feed" [...] or [...] "pay-out" [...] side, in which the film is held before exposure (when it is [...] "fed" [...] into the camera) and a [...] "take-up" [...] side where the film is held after exposure. Furthermore, in between these two sides there are always two separate slots or throats where the film exits and then re-enters the magazine. These must also be designed to be light-tight enough to allow the film to exit the magazine without letting any light into the magazine itself, where it might fog {{the rest of the}} film inside. Various types of magazines handle the film in between the two sides differently. Aaton and Arri 16 mm cameras, as well as most 35 mm Arri models, require a fixed length [...] "loop" [...] which must be a certain number of perforations long and which moves the <b>film</b> with <b>sprockets</b> inside the magazine. Some more recent 35 mm cameras from Arri and all Moviecam and Panavision cameras, however, do not have any required loop size, and the film is not controlled with any sprockets in the magazine at all. Instead, the film is pulled through the camera solely through the power of camera sprockets until the end, at which point springs or belts in the camera magazine pull the film back to the take-up side.|$|R
5000|$|The 828 format {{uses the}} same basic film stock as 135 film ({{standard}} 35mm film), but the <b>film</b> lacks the <b>sprocket</b> holes of 135. The standard image format is 40 &times; 28 mm. This provides a 30% larger image compared to 135's standard 24 &times; 36 mm, yet on the same film stock. Because Kodak targeted 828 at a lower-end consumer market, the film was much shorter, at a standard 8 exposures per roll. 828 film originally had one perforation per frame, much like 126 film. Unlike 135 (a single-spool cartridge film) or 126 (a dual-spool cartridge film), 828 is a roll film format, like 120 film. Like 120, it has a backing paper and frames are registered through a colored window {{on the back of}} the camera (except on the original folding Bantams, where images were registered with an index hole).|$|R
50|$|In 1910 Arthur Roussel {{was hired}} to build a machine that would enable the public to view a film inside their home. Pathé Frères {{introduced}} a 28 mm film size for home use. 28 mm film was preferable because it wasn’t as flammable as the nitrate based 35 mm film, usage of the 28 mm film also gave Pathé Frères exclusivity, by way of patents. The 28 mm wide <b>film</b> had one <b>sprocket</b> hole per frame on one edge of the film, 3 on the other; the large image size of 19 mm x 14 mm allowed the projected picture to be of a very high quality.The 28 mm Pathéscope K.O.K. cine-projector was patented in 1911. This projector featured dynamo lighting which was “powered by a belt from a large flywheel connected to the main shaft. The handle had to be manually turned in order to project a 30 inch picture. The projector “sold for 30 dollars which included two printed films, a screen, metal carrying case and cleaning outfit.|$|R
50|$|The Robot I {{was quite}} small, the body {{measuring}} 4¼ inches long, 2½ inches high, and 1¼ inches deep. A very sharp zone-focusing f/2.8, 3.25 cm Zeiss Tessar lens added 1/2 inch {{to the camera}} depth. It was {{about the size of}} the much later Olympus Stylus although it weighed about 20 ounces, approximately the weight of a modern SLR. The die-cast zinc and stamped stainless steel body was crammed with clockwork. A spring motor on the top plate provided the driving force for a rotary behind-the-lens shutter and a <b>sprocket</b> <b>film</b> drive. The film was loaded into cassettes in a darkroom or changing bag. The cassettes appear to be based on the Agfa Memo cassette design, the now-standard Kodak 35 mm cassette not yet being popular in Germany. In place of the velvet light trap on modern cassettes, the Robot cassette used spring pressure and felt pads to close the film passage. When the camera back was shut, the compression opened the passage and the film could travel freely from one cassette to another.|$|R
5000|$|The Buddyrevelles {{formed in}} 1997 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, where they {{recorded}} their first album, September, November, which {{was released by}} Motorcoat Records. The album received a very strong review from Pitchfork Media, including a 9.1 rating. [...] The review said that [...] "the band sounds {{like a cross between}} Chicago post-rock, the best Galaxie 500 material, and the hope of a better future." [...] They subsequently relocated to Chicago, where they recorded their second album, American Matador, released in 2000 also on the Motorcoat label. Pitchfork again reviewed the album positively, giving it an 8.0 rating and calling it [...] "a true step forward for an already excellent band." [...] It also received a glowing review from Rolling Stone. [...] After an extended hiatus, the band resurfaced in 2007 with a new album, Don't Quit on Solitaire Records. They produced a video for the song [...] "I Dream of Rodney" [...] from the album, which won the [...] "best video" [...] award at the 5th annual <b>Sprockets</b> <b>Film</b> Festival in Athens, Georgia.|$|R
5000|$|It {{turned out}} that this film was a 1920s re-release and was an edited version that {{included}} extra scenes from other Selig films. The re-release distributor in the 1920s used their company name in the opening credits and title. It read; Tom Mix, [...] "The Man From Texas" [...] Awon Film Corporation. It seems this silent film was elongated to appeal to film distributors in the 1920s. The cast of the Tom Mix William Selig films were almost always Tom Mix, Sid Jordan, and Old Blue (Tom's on screen horse until 1919) along with the Selig contracted players. William Salas completed the initial <b>film</b> cleaning and <b>sprocket</b> hole reparation. Then he transferred the nitrate film to video at a local studio using a flatbed Telecine. The film was then shipped to Hollywood, California. There further restoration was done by Morecraft / Thunderbird Films. The Salas family hired a silent film organist named Robert Israel to record an original pipe organ score for the film. The pipe organ score was recorded in an old silent film theater in Hollywood, California that had a permanent pipe organ built into the building.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{flexible}} film, Thomas Alva Edison quickly set out on his invention, the Kinetoscope, which was first shown at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on 9 May 1893. The Kinetoscope was a film loop system intended for one-person viewing. Edison, along with assistant W. K. L. Dickson, followed that up with the Kinetophone, which combined the Kinetoscope with Edison's cylinder phonograph. Beginning in March 1892, Eastman and then, from April 1893 into 1896, New York's Blair Camera Co. supplied Edison with film stock. At first Blair would supply only 40 mm (1-9/16 in) film stock that would be trimmed and perforated at the Edison lab to create 1-⅜ inch (34.925 mm) gauge filmstrips, then {{at some point in}} 1894 or 1895, Blair began sending stock to Edison that was cut exactly to specification. Edison's aperture defined a single frame of film at 4 perforations high. Edison claimed exclusive patent rights to his design of 35 mm motion picture <b>film,</b> with four <b>sprocket</b> holes per frame, forcing his only major filmmaking competitor, American Mutoscope & Biograph, to use a 68 mm film that used friction feed, not sprocket holes, to move the film through the camera. A court judgment in March 1902 invalidated Edison's claim, allowing any producer or distributor to use the Edison 35 mm film design without license. Filmmakers were already doing so in Britain and Europe, where Edison had failed to file patents.|$|R
500|$|Only {{sporadic}} {{work was}} done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, William Heise, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19mm (3/4inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter [...] "permitted {{a flash of light}} so brief that [...] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." [...] The lab also developed a motor-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new <b>sprocketed</b> <b>film.</b> To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an escapement disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of cinematography.|$|R
