The planned project includes a new subway station, track connections and a common downtown airport check-in facility for train service to both O'Hare and Midway airports. Since the purchase in April 2007 the project <b>has</b> <b>stalled.</b> The CTA has {{pulled out of the}} project and the current economic climate <b>has</b> <b>stalled</b> the project.

However, due to border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the integration process in Tajikistan <b>has</b> <b>stalled.</b> Both countries exchanged fire in December 2013 and August 2014, which resulted in casualties. Both countries have since announced they would resolve conflicts and improve border cooperation. Officials hope to make significant progress {{by the end of}} 2015.|$|E

After a failed attempt at portraying a serious role in Simple Jack, in which he plays a mentally-challenged farm boy, he takes the role of Four Leaf Tayback in an attempt to save his career. The first faux trailer at the film's start is a preview for Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown, the latest in his series.|$|E

25|$|Many {{developing}} countries are highly dependent on agriculture. The FAO finds that agriculture provides for the livelihood of 70% of the world's poorest people.

The WTO Doha Development Round, which intended to increase global development, <b>has</b> <b>stalled</b> due to the developed countries' refusal to remove agricultural subsidies.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s India stopped its {{research}} in cold fusion at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre {{because of the}} lack of consensus among mainstream scientists and the US denunciation of the research. Yet, in 2008, the National Institute of Advanced Studies recommended that the Indian government revive this research. Projects were commenced at the Chennai's Indian Institute of Technology, the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre and the Indira Gandhi Centre for Atomic Research. However, there is still skepticism among scientists and, for all practical purposes, research <b>has</b> <b>stalled</b> since the 1990s. A special section in the Indian multidisciplinary journal Current Science published 33 cold fusion papers in 2015 by major cold fusion researchers including several Indian researchers.|$|E

However, on March 3, 2006, Zinni joined fellow former United States Marines General Joseph P. Hoar, Lt. General Greg Newbold, Lt. General Frank Petersen, and Congressman Jack Murtha in endorsing fellow former U.S. Marine and Secretary of the Navy Jim Webb for U.S. Senate in Virginia. Zinni had been floated as a possible Vice Presidential running mate of Barack Obama, the 2008 Presidential nominee of the Democratic Party.|$|E
25|$|Father Peter Gumpel stated, on a 12 January 2016 {{documentary}} on the late pope, that there was consultation of the Vatican Secret Archives which were carried out in secret; in short it means {{that there are no}} controversies surrounding the late pontiff that could impede the potential beatification. In that same documentary, the cause's vice-postulator Marc Lindeijer stated that several miracles attributed to the late pope are reported to the postulation every year but the individuals' related to the healings do not come forward to enact diocesan proceedings of investigation. Lindeijer explained that this was the reason that the cause <b>has</b> <b>stalled</b> in the past as none have come forward to assist the postulation in their investigations.|$|E

25|$|The {{addition}} of {{women into the}} workforce {{was one of the}} key factors that has increased social mobility over the last 50 years, although this <b>has</b> <b>stalled</b> in recent decades for both genders. Female children of the middle and upper classes had increased access to higher education, and thanks to job equality, were able to attain higher-paying and higher-prestige jobs than ever before. Due to the dramatic increase in availability of birth control, these high status women were able to delay marriage and child-bearing until they had completed their education and advanced their careers to their desired positions. In 2001, the survey on sexual harassment at workplace conducted by women's nonprofit organisation Sakshi among 2,410 respondents in government and non-government sectors, in five States recorded 53 per cent saying that both sexes don't get equal opportunities, 50 per cent women are treated unfairly by employers and co-workers, 59 per cent have heard sexist remarks or jokes, 32 per cent have been exposed to pornography or literature degrading women.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{unmatched}} {{advantage in}} speed, the maglev has not gained widespread use in China's high-speed rail network {{due to high}} cost, German refusal to share technology and concerns about safety. The price tag of the Shanghai Maglev {{was believed to be}} $1.3billion and was partially financed by the German government. The refusal of the Transrapid Consortium to share technology and source production in China made large-scale maglev production much more costly than high-speed train technology for conventional lines. Finally, residents living along the proposed maglev route have raised health concerns about noise and electromagnetic radiation emitted by the trains, despite an environmental assessment by the Shanghai Academy of Environmental Sciences saying the line was safe. These concerns have prevented the construction of the proposed extension of the maglev to Hangzhou. Even the more modest plan to extend the maglev to Shanghai's other airport, Hongqiao, <b>has</b> <b>stalled.</b> Instead, a conventional subway line was built to connect the two airports, and a conventional high-speed rail line was built between Shanghai and Hangzhou.|$|E
