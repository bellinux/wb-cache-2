25|$|The weak {{parts of}} this story have been {{identified}} as: the sudden and unexplained departure of the Simons; the subsequent cruel treatment of the child – keeping him {{in a dark room}} practically out of sight (unless any <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> his identity was possible), while his sister Marie-Thérèse was in comparative comfort; the cause of death, declared to be of long standing, but in fact developing rapidly, {{and the fact that the}} disease is usually not fatal and is self-limiting; the insufficient excuse provided for the child's muteness under Gomin's regime (he had answered Barras) and the irregularities in the formalities in attending the death and the funeral, when a simple identification of the body by Marie Thérèse would have prevented any <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> his death.|$|E
25|$|Wrestling's {{popularity}} {{experienced a}} dramatic tailspin in 1915 to 1920, becoming distanced from the American public because of widespread <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> its legitimacy and {{status as a}} competitive sport.

Bahnarin Ampatuan, who is also implicated in the Maguindanao massacre case, is the brother of Mamasapano mayor Benzar Ampatuan. Bahnarin and Benzar Amputuan were rivals at the 2010 Mayoral elections. Benzar expressed <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> his brother's participation and believes that Bahnarin would not associate himself with such groups like the BIFF nor to people like Abdul Basit Usman who made an attempt to kill Benzar's grandfather.|$|E
25|$|Pfizer was of {{the view}} that it {{deserved}} {{the right to a}} patent on tetracycline and filed its Conover application in October 1952. Cyanamid filed its Boothe-Morton application for similar rights in March 1953, while Heyden Chemicals filed its Minieri application in September 1953, named after scientist P. Paul Minieri, to obtain a patent on tetracycline and its fermentation process. This resulted in tetracycline litigation in which the winner would have to prove beyond reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> priority invention and tetracycline’s natural state.|$|E

The headdress has the mural crown in front and behind, but interposes between these two detached fragments a crescent and a circle, emblems, no <b>doubt,</b> <b>of</b> the sun and moon gods. The reverse shows the usual fire-altar, with guards, or attendants, watching it. The king's head appears in the flame upon the altar.|$|E

25|$|David Goldstein, a Duke University {{geneticist}} {{and director}} of the Duke Center for Human Genome Variation, has said that the work of the Technion and Ramban team served only to confirm that genetic drift {{played a major role in}} shaping Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is inherited in a matrilineal manner. Goldstein argues that the Technion and Ramban mtDNA studies fail to actually establish a statistically significant link between modern Jews and historic Middle Eastern populations. This differs from the patrilineal case, where Goldstein said there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> a Middle Eastern origin.|$|E
25|$|In recent years, MTV had {{struggled}} with the secular decline of music-related cable media. Its ratings had been said to be failing systematically, as younger viewers increasingly shift towards digital media, with yearly ratings drops as high as 29%; thus there was <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> the lasting relevance of MTV towards young audiences. In April 2016, MTV announced it would start to return to its original music roots with the reintroduction of the classic MTV series MTV Unplugged. After nine years off air, TRL returned on October 2, 2017.|$|E

25|$|It {{seemed to}} strike an {{extraordinary}} {{balance between the}} psychological and the supernatural {{in such a way}} as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.'

25|$|Under the {{conditions}} supposed, {{there is no}} <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> the result, if {{the work of the}} colonists be carried out energetically and with intelligent combination of all their forces. On the other hand, if they are slothful, stupid, and careless; or if they waste their energies in contests with one another, the chances are that the old state of nature will have the best of it. The native savage will destroy the immigrant civilized man; of the English animals and plants some will be extirpated by their indigenous rivals, others will pass into the feral state and themselves become components of the state of nature. In a few decades, all other traces of the settlement will have vanished.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps naturally, Lever {{felt that}} {{the failure of the}} Soap Combine was the result of {{animosity}} and resentment directed at him personally, rather than as a consequence of its members’ dishonesty. Having sought several opinions on the authority of his suit, he retained Sir Edward Carson and two juniors, one of whom was Frederick Edwin Smith, later Lord Birkenhead. For the defendants, Rufus Isaacs, later Marquess of Reading and Viceroy of India, assisted by another K.C. and two juniors, acted for Associated Newspapers Ltd. Lever’s legal team were in no <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> the outcome; as F.E. Smith reportedly observed 'There is no answer to this action for libel and the damages must be enormous.' On 15 July 1907 the case came up at Liverpool before Mr Justice Lawrence.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, the {{franchise}} signed up Indian all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja for $2 {{million at the}} players' auction. They {{got off to a}} rather slow start in the regular season, winning only five of their first 12 games which put them in <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> qualifying for the Playoffs. Then they won three of their last four matches and qualified for the Playoffs with a better net run rate than the Royal Challengers who also finished with the same number of points. In the Eliminator, they beat the Mumbai Indians by 38 runs before comprehensively beating the table-toppers Delhi Daredevils in the Qualifying final by 86 runs. Murali Vijay, who struck his second IPL hundred (113 off 58 balls), won the Man of the Match. At the final, the Super Kings were defeated by 5 wickets by the Kolkata Knight Riders who chased down the target of 191 with two balls to spare, thus denying the Super Kings a hat-trick of titles in the IPL. At the Champions League, once again they could not progress past the group stage with two wins and two defeats.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, {{prosecutors}} in the trial against Stanislav Galić, a Bosnian Serb general, Sarajevo-Romanija Corps commander in the siege of Sarajevo, introduced into evidence a report including the testimony of ammunition expert Berko Zečević. Working with two colleagues, Zečević's investigation revealed {{a total of six}} possible locations from which the shell in the first Markale massacre could have been fired, of which five were under VRS and one under ARBiH control. The ARBiH site in question was visible to UNPROFOR observers at the time, who reported that no shell was fired from that position. Zečević further reported that certain components of the projectile could only have been fired from one of two places, both of which were {{under the control of the}} Army of Republika Srpska. The court would eventually find Galić guilty beyond reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> all five shellings prosecutors had charged him with, including Markale. Although widely reported by the international media, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights noted that the verdict was ignored in Serbia itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{second stage}} of Meyer's cricket career began after his return to England to set up Millfield School in Somerset. From the 1936 season, he {{appeared}} in Somerset matches, almost always those {{in the second half}} of the season when the school term had ended and, with rare exceptions, those played at home. In these games, he played as an all-rounder, his batting having improved significantly since his Cambridge days. Against Lancashire at Taunton in the last match of the 1936 season, he rescued Somerset from likely defeat with his maiden century, an undefeated 202, scored in 225 minutes. There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>of</b> the innings' merit– Somerset were still 48 behind with half their second innings wickets gone– but there is an oft-repeated story that the double century was obtained by an offer to contribute to the Lancashire beneficiary's fund. And he got a second century the following year against Sussex. As a bowler, he managed at least one five-wicket innings haul in each of the four seasons running up to the Second World War, though his bowling was an increasingly idiosyncratic mixture of spin and swing. In the war, he served in the Royal Air Force.|$|E
