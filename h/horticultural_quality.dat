40|$|Recent {{trials of}} Antirrhinum majus cultivars have {{revealed}} {{a wide range}} of susceptibility to rust (Puccinia antirrhini). The best plants were used as parents in a breeding programme to produce a useful level of durable field resistance. The F 1 generation was self-pollinated but the F 2 to F 4 were selectively cross-pollinated within lines. The segregating generations were grown outdoors at two sites in Surrey, where they were subject to natural rust epidemics encouraged by the use of spreader rows. Individual plants were selected for rust-resistance and <b>horticultural</b> <b>quality.</b> By the F 4 generation, lines showed greater resistance to rust than existing varieties and were becoming uniform in flower colour, growth habit and <b>horticultural</b> <b>quality.</b> Many floral abnormalities arose, especially in the F 3. Their expression was usually highly variable and was enhanced by environmental stress. Tests of rust isolates against individual antirrhinum plants showed that there is considerable genetic variation within the rust population. Some monitoring of resistant varieties is desirable to identify future changes in the rust population. The spread of spores between widely spaced patches of susceptible host was simulated using a computer, which indicated that small, isolated patches may escape infection. The effect of rate-reducing resistance is increased when plants are widely separated. This is in agreement with practical experience. The urediniospores of Puccinia antirrhini cannot survive the winter in Britain and, though teliospores are regularly produced, no alternate host is known. However, overwintered antirrhinum plants produce viable urediniospores which start epidemics in early summer: {{there is no need to}} postulate an alternate host in the British Isles. Treating antirrhinum as a summer annual might be an important hygienic measure, reducing the local build up of inoculum early in the season. Acceptable control of rust should be possible, provided only the more resistant varieties are grown. <p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. One hundred S. l. var. cerasiforme (Dunal) accessions {{from the}} ‘Tanksley’ {{designated}} core collection were evaluated for <b>horticultural</b> <b>quality</b> under greenhouse conditions. Fourteen selected accessions were grown {{under field conditions}} in a replicated trial to evaluate the fruit for phenolic content. Total fruit phenolics ranged from 44 to 82 mg/ 100 g gallic acid equivalents (GAE) fresh weight (FW) as measured by Folin-Ciocalteau assay (F-C), and 12 to 108 mg/ 100 g FW as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Five accessions (LA 1712, LA 1455, LA 2633, LA 1668, and LA 2632) had significantly higher total phenolics (F-C) than cultivars (P # 0. 05). These five accessions also possessed interesting phenolics profiles, including high levels of caffeoylquinic acids (LA 1620, LA 1455, and LA 2633) and rutin (LA 2633). Tomatoes are an important food crop and a significant constituent in the human diet, being the second most consumed vegetable in the United States after potatoes (Economic Research Service, USDA, 2008).

40|$|Graduation date: 2009 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop tools and germplasm for the production of tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L.) with high fruit phenolics without the use of genetic engineering. A candidate gene analysis was undertaken to identify genes regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis in tomato fruit (Aft, Abg, atv, and Purple Smudge). The genes Aft and Purple Smudge were associated with a DNA polymorphism in a tomato MYB transcription factor (SlAn 2) similar to Petunia An 2. The SlAn 2 DNA polymorphism co-segregated with the Aft trait in 183 F 2 individuals from an Aft x ‘Legend’ population. Expression analysis of the SlAn 2 gene using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed a close correlation between transcript levels of SlAn 2, anthocyanin expression, and the anthocyanin biosynthetic gene dihydroflavonol 4 -reductase (DFR). Expression analysis of the related MYB transcription factor SlAnt 1 showed poor correlation with anthocyanin expression in the fruit. The SlAn 2 gene was sequenced in several genotypes. Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of tomato SlAnt 1 and SlAn 2 indicated that they are orthologous to potato StAn 1 and StAn 2, respectively. To create a high flavonol tomato line, an elite high anthocyanin line with the genes Aft and atv was crossed to a tomato line with the aw gene, which encodes a non-functional DFR. AftAft/atvatv/awaw F 3 segregants had fruit with levels of rutin and chlorogenic acid that were significantly higher than the cultivar ‘Legend’ fruit under greenhouse conditions. Total phenolics levels in fruit of AftAft/atvatv/awaw F 3 segregants were not significantly different from an elite AftAft/atvatv line under field conditions. However, small amounts of anthocyanin were unexpectedly found in fruit. In order to identify and introgress additional genes that would increase total phenolics or result in novel phenolic compounds in tomato fruit, we screened a core collection of Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme, and identified several accessions with good <b>horticultural</b> <b>quality</b> and fruit with significantly higher levels of total phenolics and polyphenolic compounds not found in cultivated tomatoes...|$|E

40|$|Horticulture {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{therapeutic}} medium that benefits special populations. More recently the connection has been made between using landscape quality as a means of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of horticultural therapy programming. Both plants and landscape quality may be analysed from two different perspectives, objective quality and perceived quality. Objective quality refers to the technical and measurable nature applicable to landscape plants, products, processes and service procedures; and subjective or perceived quality refers to the nominative or psycho-physical value judgement and/or perceptions associated with landscape quality. Both perspectives, when discussed cooperatively with the horticultural therapist and health care professional could lead to a <b>quality</b> <b>horticultural</b> therapy experience.

40|$|This book aims {{to provide}} {{practical}} advice and strategies to help Samoan smallholder farmers, transporters and vendors to improve postharvest <b>horticultural</b> <b>quality,</b> reduce postharvest loss, and ensure food safety. Samoan horticultural value chains incur moderate levels of postharvest loss. In {{a recent survey}} of commercial-scale and smallholder farmer postharvest horticultural losses in Samoa, postharvest loss was shown to be between 10 to 15 % (Underhill, et al., 2016). While these figures may not sound dramatic, there is considerable variability in the levels of postharvest losses. For example, the central municipal market in Apia and the Salelologa market on Savaii have higher losses compared to the smaller privately-owned roadside markets. Farmers in the more rural parts of Upolu and Savaii experience higher and more unpredictable levels of postharvest losses, whereas farmers involved in direct selling and contractual farming often have negligible losses. Postharvest losses are higher in fruits than vegetables. Some crops, such as soursop, Tahitian limes, papaya, mustard cabbage, bok choy, choko and avocado, are particularly vulnerable to high levels of loss. Additionally, postharvest handling is more than simply reducing direct losses. Compromised food safety is another significant cause for concern. Unsafe horticultural product is food that cannot be consumed due to microbial or chemical contamination, and which should be removed from the food chain. Ensuring freshness is an issue in Samoa. While horticultural products are generally sold within a few days, it is still quite common for products to be stored and displayed for four to five days, potentially reducing food safety and nutritional value. Nationally, Samoa has unclear horticultural food safety compliance standards. Most horticultural harvesting, transport and handling practices carry a level of food safety risk. In 2015, a preliminary food safety survey by the Scientific Research Organisation in Samoa gave grounds for concern, with around half of the assessed horticultural value chains found to have detectable microbial food safety contamination. Hence, this book also aims to provide strategies to improve horticultural food safety compliance. Throughout this book, the focus is on nil or low-cost postharvest remediation strategies compatible and applicable to Samoa's horticultural production systems. Information is based on numerous postharvest studies by the book's Author of smallholder and community-based horticultural production systems in Samoa and across the South Pacific. Importantly, this book presents a range of simple and practical ideas developed by Pacific smallholder farmers. Maintaining quality and reducing losses is a universal challenge. Many farmers and vendors across the South Pacific have come up with their own solutions, some of the best of which are presented in this book. It {{should be noted that the}} author has deliberately avoided recommending or promoting the use of postharvest chemicals. This is for several reasons. Although the responsible and appropriate use of postharvest chemicals is central to most horticultural value chains in Australian and New Zealand, this is coupled with extensive chemical legislation, work health and safety compliance auditing and independent residue testing. In the South Pacific, where it is difficult to identify and enforce safety and compliance, to advocate wider use of chemicals within the food chain may create more problems than resolutions...|$|E

The experiment was carried out in a greenhouse at Çukurova University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Soil Science, Adana, Turkey. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design in three replications. Ground (< 1 mm) basaltic tuff (18 %), andesitic tuff (10 %) and rock phosphate (2 %) were added to compost (70 %) used as organic fertilizer. Two growth media (organic fertilizer:soil:sand at 1 : 1 : 1 V/V and andesitic tuff:soil:organic fertilizer at 6 : 3 : 1 V/V) were used for seedling production. Plants were inoculated with G. caledonium; a level of 1000 -spores per pot was placed 3 cm below the seeds. Non-mycorrhizal plants also received the same amount of mycorrhizal spore free medium. The result showed that compost materials contained different amounts of nutrients. Tomato and pepper seedlings showed different responses to each compost material. The results also showed that the mycorrhizal inoculation significantly increased plant length and diameter. Plants had better growth and responded to the mycorrhizal inoculation in 6 : 3 : 1 (v/v) more than in 1 : 1 : 1 (v/v) growth media. Mycorrhizal inoculation also increased root colonization depending on compost materials.

Unfortunately, horticultural peat is only very slowly renewable, and good <b>quality</b> <b>horticultural</b> peat is not common even in peatland-rich countries. Therefore, good-quality and simultaneously renewable alternative growing media are needed. A new growing medium based on Sphagnum moss biomass is introduced in this study.

Therefore, the average harvesting depth will be 30 cm. Only half of the mire surface on each harvesting area will be utilised, the other half being kept intact for transportation routes. This will also secure a reserve of Sphagnum mosses for reseeding and recovery. The end product - Sphagnum biomass based growing medium - will be truly renewable, and environmental effects will be negligible compared with conventional extraction of white horticultural peat.

40|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} reflectance increases dramatically around 700 nm for vegetation. This {{increase in}} reflectance {{is known as}} the vegetation red edge. The NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation index) is an imaging technique for quantifying red edge contrast for the identification of vegetation. This imaging technique relies on reflectance values for radiation with wavelength equal to 680 nm and 830 nm. The imaging systems required to obtain this precise reflectance data are commonly space-based; limiting the use of this technique due to satellite availability and cost. This thesis presents a robust and inexpensive new terrestrial-based method for identifying the vegetation red edge. This new technique does not rely on precise wavelengths or narrow wavelength bands and instead applies the NDVI to the visible and NIR (near infrared) spectrums in toto. The measurement of vegetation fluorescence has also been explored, as it is indirectly related to the efficiency of photochemistry and heat dissipation and provides a relative method for determining vegetation health.

40|$|Nowadays, {{the main}} goal for modern horticultural {{production}} is the increase of quality. Furthermore, in consideration of the new consumer demand, always more attracted by a diet based on a larger consumption of fruit and vegetables without risks of pesticides residues and with increased nutritional value, new important features {{in addition to the}} traditional quality attributes are now requested.

Na širem području grada, površine 3, 48 km 2, zabilježeno je ukupno 239 svojti u sastavu 156 rodova i 72 porodice. Brojem svojti dominiraju kritosjemenjače (219 svojti; 91, 63 %) i to dvosupnice (205 svojti). Od porodica najzastupljenije su Rosaceae (33; 13, 81 %), a od rodova rod Prunus (11 svojti; 4, 60 %). Prema tipu habitusa prevladavaju grmovi (132; 55, 23 %), zatim slijede stabla (83; 34, 73 %), a najmanje su zastupljene drvenaste penjačice (24; 10, 04 %). Listopadne svojte zastupljenije su (128; 53, 56 %) od vazdazelenih (107; 44, 77 %). Četiri (1, 67 %) svojte su zimzelene. Alohtone svojte (150; 62, 8 %) znatno su zastupljenije od autohtonih (89; 37, 20 %) što je sukladno rezultatima istraživanja dendroflore u drugim područjima Hrvatske. Prema stupnju udomaćenosti, najbrojnije su svojte koje dolaze isključivo u kulturi (121 svojta, 80, 67 %), zatim slijede svojte koje samo privremeno preživljavaju izvan kulture (21; 14, 00 %). Zastupljenost udomaćenih svojti je razmjerno malena (8; 5, 33 %), a među njima je 5 invazivnih svojti. Iako je invazivna sposobnost alohtone dendroflore Omiša razmjerno niska, unošenje stranih svojti u hortikulturu treba ograničiti i kontrolirati, jer neke svojte mogu invazivnim širenjem izazvati teške poremećaje u prirodnim ekosustavima (primjer Amorpha fruticosa koja se širi duž obala Cetine).

Rezultati istraživanja dendroflore Omiša, kao i drugih područja Hrvatske, ukazuju na neopravdanu praksu dugo­godišnjeg zanemarivanja domaćih vrsta u uzgoju, iako su one u pravilu lakše za održavanje, a po dekorativnim osobinama ne zaostaju za stranim svojtama. This paper {{presents}} {{a list of}} woody plant taxa and their dendrological and <b>horticultural</b> <b>qualities.</b> Taxonomical, ecological and phytogeographical analysis cover 239 of taxa. The results are given in Tables 1 – 2. There are 72 families, 156 genera and 239 of taxa in total (Table 1), twenty of them belonging to gymnosperms and 219 to angiosperms. The angiosperms group is largely dominated by the dicotyledones (205 taxa; 85. 87 %). Out of 72 families, four of them have more than 10 species and subspecies. The largest number of species belongs to the Rosaceae (33 taxa; 13. 80 %), Fabaceae (14 taxa; 5. 86 %), Oleaceae (13 taxa; 5. 44 %) and Lamiaceae (11 taxa; 4. 60 %) families. Species from the above mentioned four families make 29. 71 % of the total woody plants of the Omis. The composition of woody plants of the Omis is quite heterogeneous which is obvious from {{a large number of}} families (72) and genera (156). There is only 1. 53 species per genus and 3. 32 species per family. The most frequent genera are Prunus (11 taxa), Tamarix (5 taxa) whereas Acer, Lonicera, Populus, Rosa and Ulmus are present with 4 taxa. Analysis of dendroflora due to habitat type (acc. to Erhardt et al. 2002) indicates the dominance of shrubby forms (132 of taxa; 55. 23 %), following by the trees (83; 34. 73 %), while the group of woody climbing plants is the least represented (24; 10. 04 %). Within the dendroflora of Omis, there are 89 (37. 20 %) autochthonous and 150 (62. 80 %) allochthonous species. Of the total number of taxa of autochthonous dendroflora, 43 of taxa (48. 31 %) occur in the wild, 24 (26. 97 %) grow only in culture, while 22 of taxa (24. 72 %) occur in culture {{as well as in the}} natural and seminatural vegetation. The allochthonous ones are dominated by species in culture (121 species; 80. 67 %), casual (21; 14. 00 %) and 8 naturalised. These results are consistent with those relating to other parts of Croatia. An increased presence of allochthonous plants, especially neophytes, is a reliable indicator of the intensity of the anthropogenic impact to the flora. The majority of all the allochthonous species that appear on different areas never manage to get naturalised so their existance depends on the re-appearance of the diaspora. A small number of the naturalised species has the ability of invasively spreading beyond the place of their original appearance. In woody plants of the Omis, naturalised species are represented by 3 species (Agava americana, Morus alba and Prunus cerasifera) and the invasive ones by 5 species (Acer negundo, Ailanthus altissima, Amorpha fruticosa, Broussonetia papyrifera and Robinia pseudoacacia). Although only a small number of species brought into the culture has the ability to domesticate and spread invasively into the surrounding habitats, some of them can cause serious eco-system irregularities. In the region of Omis especially dangerous could become Amorpha fruticosa covering more and more areas along the Cetina river thus suppressing native species. Knowing that invasive species mainly domesticate and spread through horticulture it is advisable to avoid them in horticulture. Regarding geographical origins (Table 2), the allochthonous dendroflora of Omis is dominated by species from Asia (65 taxa; 43. 33 %), America (23. 33 %) and Europe (12. 80 %). The most frequent Asian species in the horticulture are those coming from China (Buddleja davidii, Kerria japonica, Rosa banksiae etc). Quite a significant number of woody species, autochthonous as well as allochthonous, and their high diversity attribute to an exceptional value of the dendroflora of Omis. The research results relating to woody plants of the Omis and other Croatian regions indicate an unjustified long-term neglect of autochthonous species in culture in comparison with the allochthonous ones even though they have adjusted themselves to the existing climate conditions which makes the maintenance of horticultural objects easier, not to mention that their decorative qualities match those of the allochthonous species...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] <b>horticultural</b> {{and fruit}} <b>quality</b> traits were {{evaluated}} {{for two years}} at Fowler, CA and one year at College Station, TX to estimate heritability and phenotypic correlations. Seedlings from nine F 1 families along with parents used in crosses, were budded onto ?Nemaguard? rootstocks for evaluation. An all random effects model (REML) was used to estimate variance components and a multivariate model was used to estimate phenotypic correlations between traits. High and moderate to high heritability was estimated for bloom date (h^(2) = 0. 62) and fruit ground color (h^(2) = 0. 50), while ripe date, fruit development period (FDP), fruit weight, red in the flesh, firmness, soluble solids, titratable acidity (TA), and pit weight showed low narrow sense heritability (h^(2) = 0. 05 - 0. 24). These traits with low narrow sense heritability had moderate to high broad sense (H^(2)) heritability, indicating an important non-additive genetic component. Intermediate values of heritability (h^(2) = 0. 38 ? 0. 46) were found for pubescence, blush, fruit diameter, fruit tip, and fruit shape. Two major genes had effects on additive heritability. Nectarine had a direct effect on heritability of fruit pubescence, while pantao shape and nectarine had pleiotropic effects on fruit diameter, resulting in higher estimates for both of these traits. Several traits (fruit red blush, fruit weight, fruit diameter, fruit tip, fruit shape, and fruit ground color, red in the flesh, fruit firmness, and soluble solids) were strongly affected by genotype by environmental interaction. Most traits exhibited substantial variability, which should allow for genetic improvement. Ripening date was strongly correlated (r = 0. 94) with FDP, while bloom date was negatively correlated with FDP (r = - 0. 45) and fruit tip (r = - 0. 40). Ripening date and FDP were moderately correlated with fruit weight (r = 0. 54, r = 0. 50) and fruit diameter (r = 0. 46, r = 0. 45). Both measures of fruit size were strongly correlated (r = 0. 77). Soluble solids was somewhat weakly correlated with ripening date and FDP (r = 0. 32, r = 0. 33). Pit weight was moderately correlated with FDP, fruit weight, and fruit diameter (r = 0. 33, r = 0. 51, r = 0. 31, respectively) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{previous}} environmental work conducted at Patrick Air Force Base (PAFB) indicated that several threatened, endangered, or species of special concern occurred or {{had the potential}} to occur there. This study was implemented to collect more information on protected species at PAFB. A map of landcover types was prepared for PAFB using aerial photography, groundtruthing, and a geographic information system (GIS). Herbaceous vegetation was the most common vegetation type. The second most abundant vegetation type was disturbed shrubs/exotics. The beach and associated dune vegetation comprised 3. 2 % of the land area, but was the most extensive natural community within PAFB. A few isolated mangrove communities exist along the Banana River. Seventy-seven species of vascular plants occurred on the dunes, including four species listed by state agencies: spider lily (Hymenocallis latifolia), prickly pear cactus (Opuntia stricta), beach star (Remirea maritima), and inkberry (Scaevola plumien). Surveys of other habitats revealed eighty-four species of vascular plants including two state-listed species: spider lily and prickly pear cactus. Many of these areas are dominated by invasive, exotic species, particularly Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius) and Australian pine (Casuarina equisetifolia), and native species of open or disturbed sites such as camphorweed (Heterotheca subaxillaris) and beardgrass (Andropogon spp.). Due to the isolation of PAFB from other natural areas, most exotic plant populations on the base are not an immediate threat to intact native plant communities. Dune habitat was surveyed for the southeastem beach mouse (Peromyscus polionotus niveiventris) by quarterly trapping along eight 100 m transects. No beach mice were found. The limited extent of dune habitat, its fragmented condition, and the isolation of PAFB from extant populations of the beach mouse probably accounts for its absence. Surveys of birds on PAFB found an avifauna characteristic of species that occur in the Indian River Lagoon system. Twenty-five species of waterbirds were observed during quarterly surveys on PAFB, including five species listed as species of special concern by the state of Florida: Snowy Egret (Egretta thula), Little Blue Heron (Egretta caerulea), Tricolored Heron (Egretta tricolo 4, White Ibis (Eudocimus albus), and Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis). The Golf Course was used extensively by almost all species of waterbirds on PAFB. Twenty-two species of shorebirds were observed on PAFB. Although no listed species were observed, the potential exists for several protected species of shorebirds to use the beach at PAFB during some parts of the year. The Airfield runways and associated grass areas were important sites at PAFB for loafing and feeding for some shorebirds. Surveys of rooftop nesting by Least Terns (Stema antillarum) on PAFB found a large colony on a rooftop in the PAFB Industrial Area. This colony produced some independent young. Two rooftop Least Tern colonies reported from previous years were inactive during 1996. A small number of Black Skimmers (Rhynchops nigee attempted to nest at the Least Ten colony but were unsuccessful. Surveys for the gopher tortoise (Gopherus polyphemus) revealed burrows and tortoises only at the Waste Study Site; five burrows and three tortoises were observed. No Florida scrub lizards (Sceloporus woodi), eastern indigo snakes (Drymarchon corais couperl), or diamondback terrapins (Malademys terrapin terrapin) were observed. American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) were observed on the Golf Course and using ditches, ponds, and areas along the Banana River. The amount of dune habitat could be expanded by not mowing areas adjacent to the dunes to allow dune species to colonize and expand. Planting dune species as part of the beach renourishment project will also increase this habitat. Exotic plants dominate several areas on the base and are used by threatened, endangered, and species of special concern. However, the use of native vegetation in landscaping projects throughout the base would improve habitat for wildlife, and invasive, exotic plants should not be used in any <b>horticultural</b> plantings. Water <b>quality</b> of ponds, ditches, and canals is important for waterbirds; it should be maintained and protected from contamination. Nesting Least Terns are sensitive to disturbance; rooftops used for nesting should be protected from disturbance. Monitoring of Least Tern and Black Skimmer nesting should be continued to determine what roofs are being used and whether nesting is successful. Furthermore, based on the large numbers of waterbirds observed on PAFB, continued monitoring of them is recommended...|$|R
