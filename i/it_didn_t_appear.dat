The research was done inside on a glass green house at the UNESP - College of Agronomical Science, Rural Engineering Department (Botucatu - SP - Brazil). Two trials were done to evaluate biomass, seedling height and diameter development. The first trial, using underground water on 17 cm, 31 cm and 45 cm depth, with or without coverage fertilization with N-P-K. The second trial was done with 28 flowerpots (12 liters each) and 3 seedlings per unit. The experimental design, {{used to evaluate the}} height and diameter growth and hydric potential and relative plant water content, was: 1 - without water deficit and without coverage fertilization; 2 - with water deficit and without coverage fertilization; 3 - without water deficit and with coverage fertilization; 4 - with water deficit and coverage fertilization. The underground water result showed that 31 cm and fertilization was better for seedling growing rather that 17 cm and without fertilization. The fertilized treatments showed higher plant high and diameter comparing to non fertilized samples, using Tukey test at 5 %. For dry plant matter, the best results were obtained with 31 and 45 cm underground water level. The seedling root system dry mass was decrement along the soil profile. The treatment with underground water of 31 cm and fertilization was superior according to Tukey test at 5 % of probability and the treatment with underground water of 17 cm and without fertilization was inferior for root dry mass (g).

40|$|When the European Union {{decided in}} 2000 to allow {{chocolate}} to contain up to 5 % vegetal fats other than cocoa butter, shea butter was proclaimed as a promising substitute. Two years later, {{this has not}} happened. Palm oil, though of lesser quality, is taking over shea s promised place as a cocoa butter equivalent (CBE). What went wrong with shea rightly called women s white gold ? Shea butter is extracted from {{the fruits of the}} shea tree (Vitellaria paradoxa, also known as Butryospermum paradoxum) which grows in the southern Sahelian zone, from Senegal in the west to Uganda and Sudan in eastern Africa. On average, one tree produces 15 to 20 kg of fruits, yielding 1. 5 kg of butter. Processed nuts fetch in general one and a half times more 200 /t) than the raw ones. Harvesting from the wild and processing the butter is done mainly by women. The butter is processed into cooking oil and consumed locally or exported as the basis for cosmetics or fat in foodstuffs. The downside is that the shea tree is hard to domesticate, starts bearing fruit only after 15 to 20 years and has a fluctuating yield. The combination of unreliable and small supply with low purchasing prices on intermediate trade markets has meant that shea has not become a strong CBE. Of the estimated total production of 1. 7 million t, only 65, 000 t is exported as a CBE and 3, 000 t for cosmetics. There is room for improvement if producers can organise themselves to guarantee a stable supply and establish direct links with such markets as the cocoa and cosmetics industries. In Burkina Faso, the UN fund for women (UNIFEM) has mediated a deal between producers and L Occitane, a French firm, which now buys directly from the Union des Groupements Kiswendsida (UGK). In 2001, L Occitane bought 60 t of butter directly from UGK, an umbrella organisation for 100 shea-producing women s groups.

A government organization - the Barindra Multipurpose Development Authority (BMDA) - established a piped water network to provide these rural households with improved water as they have poor access to potable water. Using propensity score matching, the study compares a treatment and a control group of households to identify gains in water-sanitation, hygiene and health outcomes. We found that the BMDA piped water infrastructure had {{a positive impact on}} access to improved water and significantly reduced the distance traveled for and time spent on collecting drinking water. However, we found no improvement in the drinking water quality, which was measured by the extent of fecal contamination (E. coli count per 100 ml of water) at the point of use. The hygiene status of food utensils also did not show any improvement; food utensils were tested positive for E. coli in both the control and treatment group.

Que pode ser evitado com a aplicação de reguladores de crescimento. Nesse sentido, realizou-se um experimento de campo, no município de Castro, PR, visando avaliar os efeitos de doses de nitrogênio nas cultivares de trigo AVANTE e BRS 177. O delineamento {{experimental}} foi blocos ao acaso em esquema fatorial 4 X 4, com quatro repetições para cada cultivar. Os tratamentos constaram da combinação de 100 g i. a ha- 1 de trinexapac-ethyl aplicado entre o 1 e o 2 nó visível e metade entre o 2 e o 3 nó visível, além da testemunha sem aplicação. As doses de nitrogênio em cobertura foram de 90, 135, 180 e 225 kg. ha- 1 para a cultivar AVANTE e 60, 90, 120 e 150 kg. ha- 1 para a cultivar BRS 177. Foram avaliados o stand, números de perfilhos por planta, estatura de plantas, diâmetro de colmo, comprimento dos entre-nós, comprimento do caule do último nó e a inserção da espiga, acamamento no florescimento e na pré-colheita, teor de nitrogênio nas folhas, componentes da produção, produtividade e qualidade industrial do trigo. O Trinexapac-ethyl foi eficiente em reduzir o comprimento dos entre-nós, diminuindo a estatura das plantas e a porcentagem de acamamento, sendo o momento da aplicação do trinexapac-ethyl que promove maiores efeitos na estatura de plantas é entre o 2 e 3 nó visível. A aplicação do trinexapac-ethyl principalmente na fase de 1 e 2 nó visível ou 2 e 3 nó visível promoveu aumento significativo do número de espiguetas e na produtividade de grãos quando comparado ao tratamento sem aplicação do regulador de crescimento na cultivar AVANTE, o que não ocorreu para a cultivar BRS 177. O aumento da dose de nitrogênio aumenta o teor do elemento da planta e promove maior acamamento, fator que pode ser minimizado pela aplicação do redutor de crescimento. Não ocorreu ganho sobre os componentes de produção e produtividade pelo aumento das doses de nitrogênio, mostrando que as doses recomendadas atendem as exigências das cultivares. A qualidade industrial do trigo não foi influenciada pela aplicação de trinexapac-ethyl, com exceção da cultivar BRS 177 que apresentou aumento do peso hectolitrico nos tratamentos com trinexapac-ethyl. O aumento da dose de nitrogênio aumentou a quantidade de glúten úmido, seco e da Força de Glúten (W) e diminuiu o peso hectolitrico (PH) e Falling Number (FN) para cultivar BRS 117, na cultivar AVANTE as doses de N não influenciaram os parâmetros referentes à qualidade industrial. The use {{of nitrogen}} {{in the culture}} of the wheat seeks the increase of the productivity. However, it also increases the probability of occurrence of the lodgnign. That can be avoided with the application of growth regulators. In that sense, he took place a field experiment, in the city of Castro, PR, seeking to evaluate the effects of the application of the trinexapac-ethyil in different times and of doses of nitrogen on wheat, cultivars (VANTE and BRS 77). The experimental field was blocks at random in factorial outline 4 x 4 with four repetitions. The treatments consisted of the combination of 100 g i. a ha - 1 of applied trinexapac-ethyl among the 1 and 2 visible knot of the wheat, 2 and 3 visible knot, sequential application on half of the dose between the 1 and the 2 visible knot and half between the 2 and 3 visibleknot, besides the witness without trinexapac-ethyl apllication. The doses of nitrogen were of 90, 135, 180 and 225 kg. ha - 1 fot to AVANTE and 60, 90, 120 and 150 kg. ha - 1 for to BRS 177. They were certain the stand, tillers numbers for plant, height of plants, diameter of the stem, lengthof the stem, length of thes stem among the leaf flag unitl the insert of the erar, lodging in the antesis and in the pre-cropo haverst, tenor of nitrogen in the leaves, yield and yield componentes and industrial quality of thewheat. The trinexapac-ethyl was efficient in reducing the length of the he/she enters us, reducidng the height of the plants and lodging percentage, being the moment of application of hte trinexapac-ethyl that promotes larger effects in the height of plants in between the 2 and 3 visible knot. The application of hte trinexapac - ethyl mainly in the phase of 1 and 2 visivle knot or 2 and 3 visible knot promoted significant increase of the ears number and in the productivity of grains when compared to the treatment without application of the growth regulator in cultivar AVANTE, what <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> happen for to cultivar BRS 177. The increase of the dose of nitrogen increases the tenor of the element in the plant and it promotes larger lodging factor that can be mininmized by the application of the growth reducer. <b>It</b> <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> happen earnings about the production components and productivity for the increase of the doses of nitrogen, showing that the recommended doses assistg the demands of the cultivars.

O experimento foi realizado na Vinícola Villa Francioni, na safra de 2005 com 800 plantas marcadas previamente de um vinhedo de cabernet - sauvignon formado em 2001 sobre um porta enxerto Paulsen 1103. O vinhedo foi conduzido no sistema no tipo trellis de Y e o espaçamento entre as plantas estavam de 1. 2 m e entre fileiras de 3. 0 m. O acompanhamento da maturação foi feito com cinco coletas realizadas nas datas de 28 / 02 / 05, de 07 / 03 / 05, de 14 / 03 / 05, de 21 / 03 / 05 e de 28 / 03 / 05. O experimento consiste no raleio de cachos ao nível de 6, 9, 12, 15 cachos por planta e mais a testemunha sem raleio com os grupos ± 18 cachos por planta, dando uma produção aproximadamente de 2360, 3530, 4700, 5880, e 7060 kg ha- 1 respectivamente. Para SST, os tratamentos 6, 9, 12, e 15 cachos /planta tiveram uns valores maiores o tratamento testemunha, e para Fenóis totais e Acidez total não teve a diferença entre os tratamentos. Para o pH do mosto, os valores observados acima de 3. 7 para todos os tratamentos, o que não é desejável, indicou a possibilidade para antecipar a colheita em uma semana. Para o peso das bagas, o tratamento com 15 cachos/planta teve uma correlação linear crescente; nos outros tratamentos uma diminuição do peso das bagas é observada a partir da data da 4 °coleta, indicada pela equação polinomial do grau 2 °. Um comportamento similar foi observado para os índices da antocianina, onde apenas o tratamento com 9 grupos propiciou um aumento nos índices da antocianinas que a partir da 4 ° coleta.

40|$|Plato and Aristotle {{justified}} {{their political}} theories by defining justice as to allocate to each his or hers own {{in accordance with}} that person s nature. It is just, then, Plato argues, to set {{a person who is}} by nature fitted to be a cobbler to cobble, a guardian to guard and so on. One s nature determines one s place in a just society. Interestingly, Aristotle argues that the virtues are different for men and women while Plato argues that the virtues of men and women are the same. By insisting that courage, as virtue, for a man is commanding while it is obeying for a woman, Aristotle justifies his claim that men ought to rule while women ought to be ruled. If we project Aristotle s argument on Plato, we get the interesting result that sex does not serve as a measure of who gets to rule whom since the virtues of men and women are the same. In the essay The Legal Status and Political Role of Women in Plato s Laws. David Cohen indicates that scholars have Shrugged off Plato s legislation in regard to women because <b>it</b> simply <b>didn</b> <b>t</b> seem particularly important what Plato thought about women and politics one way or the other. If Cohen s assessment is correct, scholars neglect of Plato s women is simultaneously a neglect of part of Plato s political justice. Plato s notion of justice in reference to the male nature is but half the story. The story will not be complete until the female nature is, as thoroughly as the male nature, connected with Plato s notion of justice. The Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy states that feminism is grounded on the belief that women are oppressed or disadvantaged by comparison with men, and that their oppression is in some way illegitimate or unjustified. In this essay we will use the general characterisation of feminism as an approach to examine whether the tasks in the public and the private sphere allocated to women by Plato are warranted by his notion of justice. That is, does Plato oppress women by assigning them tasks and functions, which, in reference to his views on female nature, are illegitimate? For a discriminatory treatment of individuals can only be justified by the notion of justice if a relevant difference is found. If thus women are not allocated their own in accordance with their nature, then Plato commits a fallacy, which could have unfortunate effects on the whole notion of justice. In this essay we shall focus on the Republic, the Timaeus and the Laws while leaving out the passing comments of the other dialogues. We shall treat these three dialogues one at a time in an effort to interpret them by their separate arguments. We will follow the arguments in detail and use every mean at our disposal to unveil the argument s implications relevant to our study of Plato s political justice in reference to women. Enjo...|$|R

The results of the survey are as follows. 1 ．The evaluation of the enterprise, there were insufficient contents of the lecture regarding Lecture of counseling-practice, Follow up seminar. 2 ．About the changes of the people attending the lecture, we recognize the difference concerning the consultation about contraception and the ways of thinking of execution before and after the lecture. 3 ．The comparison between the people attended the lecture and the people who <b>didn</b> <b>t,</b> we recognize the difference of the ways of thinking about sexual intercourse. And the percentage of the correct answer about sexual information of the people who attended the lecture was higher. For the above mentioned reasons, the efficiency and problems concerning training course were suggested. ピアカウンセリング事業の評価と養成講座受講者自身の変化、受講者と未受講者で性に関する考え方など違いがあるか知る目的でアンケート調査をおこなった。その結果、(1) 事業の評価では、「カウンセリングの講義・演習」「ファローアップセミナー」の講座内容が不足していた。(2) 受講者自身の変化では、避妊の相談と実施の考え方に受講前後で変化がみられた。(3) 受講者と未受講者の比較では、性交に関する考え方に違いがみられた。また性知識は、受講者の方に正解率が高かった。以上より、養成講座の効果と課題が示唆された...|$|R

Lawyers, familiar with case digests, know better than to expect anything very stimulating to develop from an evening spent in random reading of, say, volume 22 (Mayhem to Motions) of the Third Decennial Digest.

This relation is considered as the Fractal of the earthquake scaleat present. The Fractal is seen in the general fracture phenomenon including an earthquake. But, the relation between the Fractal and the mechanism of the fracture is not made clear. In this study, the AE in the fracture process of the various rocks was measured and thefrequency distribution ofAE amplitude was examined about the Fractal.

According to above explanation, there was research to find out the amount of asked explanation (in this, each sector workforce absorption) to the determinant (PDRB) with formulation of how large elasticity level of workforce absorption in each economic sector in each cities in East Java province. The method used was by calculating PDRB growth percentage in each sectors and percentage of workforce absorption development in each sectors in each cities in East Java. From the percentage equation of the PDRB change and workforce absorption change, there could be concluded that elasticity level from 9 economic sector in each city was inelastic.
