The laboratory itself was a see-through (lattice-walled) fenced off gallery measuring 36 feet long by 6 feet long. To collect data efficiently, Galton {{had to make the}} process as simple as possible <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand.</b> As a result, subjects were taken through {{the laboratory}} in pairs so that explanations could be given to two at a time, also in the hope that one of the two would confidently take the initiative to go through all the tests first, encouraging the other. With this design, the total time spent in the exhibit was fourteen minutes for each pair.|$|E

[...] Moon later said in a talk to church members: [...] "Why did we put so much effort into the movie Inchon? No matter what the result the motivation was <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> about MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people. He also loved God very much and fought with great strength against tyranny and communism. That is what I want the people to understand." ...|$|E

Though it is often hard <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> why she acts wayward, she also has the vulnerability factor. Halfpenny said she likes Amy's mischievous side and hoped she would not learn to be sensible. Halfpenny also {{felt it was important}} that Amy remained youthful because she disliked portrayals of teenagers growing up too quickly. She found it easy to portray a character younger than herself as she could base aspects of Amy's story on her own teenage experience. At times she is scared she puts on a [...] "hard exterior". Amy has a distinct style, Halfpenny described it as being quite [...] "out there" [...] in her choice of clothing and make-up. Halfpenny said that viewers would not be getting used to Amy's [...] "nice side" [...] and reminded them that she is good at [...] "lying and scheming". She concluded that Amy's bad side was due to resurface.|$|E

2500|$|On December 2, it was {{announced}} that Harper's plan was to ask the Governor General to prorogue parliament, delaying a confidence vote until the new year.

[...] Harper visited the Governor General at Rideau Hall, at approximately 9:30 am ET, on December 4. After consulting with the Prime Minister and other advisors for more than two hours, Jean granted Harper's request and parliament was prorogued until January 26, 2009, with the Conservatives scheduled to announce the budget the following day. Near the end of her tenure as vicereine, Jean revealed to the Canadian Press that the two-hour delay in giving her decision was partly to [...] "send a message—and <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> that this warranted reflection." [...] She later stated in an interview on The Hour that [...] "I was in a position where I could have said no...

6000|$|The {{relative}} {{amount of}} the United States public debt may be seen, [...] by Chart No. XXII, from an early date down to 1880. Since the war, [...] the surplus revenue of the United States has been constantly [...] appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during [...] the late war, until, what with the reduction of debt and the fall [...] in the interest charge, our income is now so much greater than [...] expenditure that we are (1884) actually in difficulties owing to [...] the surplus. To the present time the Treasury {{has been able to}} use [...] its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt; but the rapidity [...] of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured [...] debt will exist to be redeemed: $250,000,000 of 4-½ per cent bonds [...] remain, but they do not fall due until 1891; and the 4 per cent [...] bonds to the amount of $737,620,700 do not mature until 1907. [...] Having once raised a large revenue under war pressure, it seems [...] very difficult <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> now why heavy duties were [...] originally levied, and the extraordinary suggestion is often made [...] that the surplus should remain, and new channels of expenditure [...] should be made (such as enormous pensions), simply in order to [...] keep up the heavy taxation. The difficulty is, however, that the [...] unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for [...] war purposes. But the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be [...] continued, adding to the cost of production in all industries, [...] without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the [...] passing—and only possible—trouble of a redistribution of capital [...] in a few cases; especially since that distribution of capital will [...] be one from less productive to more productive industries; [...] otherwise, no change would be made.|$|E
