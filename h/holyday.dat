60|$|And {{if we are}} not {{altogether}} so faithful to our author as our predecessors <b>Holyday</b> and Stapleton, yet we may challenge to ourselves this praise--that we shall be far more pleasing to our readers. We have followed our authors at greater distance, though not step by step as they have done; for oftentimes they have gone so close that they have trod on the heels of Juvenal and Persius, and hurt them by their too near approach. A noble author would not be pursued too close by a translator. We lose his spirit when we think to take his body. The grosser part remains with us, but the soul is flown away in some noble expression, or some delicate turn of words or thought. Thus <b>Holyday,</b> who made this way his choice, seized the meaning of Juvenal, but the poetry has always escaped him.|$|E
6000|$|So {{that they}} thought the {{imitation}} of Lucilius was more proper to their purpose than that of Horace. [...] "They changed satire," [...] says <b>Holyday,</b> [...] "but they changed it for the better; for the business being to reform great vices, chastisement goes farther than admonition; whereas a perpetual grin, like that of Horace, does rather anger than amend a man." ...|$|E
60|$|Here is the {{difference}} of no less than seven syllables in a line betwixt the English and the Latin. Now the medium of these is about fourteen syllables, because the dactyl is a more frequent foot in hexameters than the spondee. But <b>Holyday</b> (without considering that he writ with the disadvantage of four syllables less in every verse) endeavours to make one of his lines to comprehend the sense of one of Juvenal's. According to the falsity of the proposition was the success. He was forced to crowd his verse with ill-sounding monosyllables (of which our barbarous language affords him a wild plenty), and by that means he arrived at his pedantic end, which {{was to make a}} literal translation. His verses have nothing of verse in them, but only the worst part of it--the rhyme; and that, into the bargain, is far from good. But, which is more intolerable, by cramming his ill-chosen and worse-sounding monosyllables so close together, the very sense which he endeavours to explain is become more obscure than that of his author; so that <b>Holyday</b> himself cannot be understood without as large a commentary as that which he makes on his two authors. For my own part, I can make a shift to find the meaning of Juvenal without his notes, but his translation is more difficult than his author. And I find beauties in the Latin to recompense my pains; but in <b>Holyday</b> and Stapleton my ears, in the first place, are mortally offended, and then their sense is so perplexed that I return to the original as the more pleasing task as well as the more easy.|$|E
