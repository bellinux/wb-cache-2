25|$|What {{was unique}} about the Zisapels' {{business}} philosophy was that each company would operate independently, without a holding company, {{but all of}} the companies would be guided by them under a collective strategic umbrella. Companies may cooperate in the development of their solutions, engage in <b>joint</b> <b>marketing</b> activities and benefit from a common management structure. This decentralized business philosophy was designed to maximize the advantages inherent in smaller business units, such as flexibility, entrepreneurial spirit and management focus. As a result, since 1984, when the RAD Group came into being, it has spawned more than 185 companies, 8 IPOs and 19 mergers and acquisitions.|$|E
25|$|The main {{responsibility}} for designing the ships {{was given to}} Carl-Bertel Engström, following objectives set by marketing executives Gösta Ryning and Kalevi Etelä. On 3 January 1971 Siljavarustamo placed an order for the new ships with the Dubigeon Normandie shipyard in Nantes, France. At {{the same time as}} the ships were ordered, the owners of Siljavarustamo were drawing up plans to reorganise their opeations. The decision was made to turn Siljavarustamo into a <b>joint</b> <b>marketing</b> company for FÅA, Svea and Bore under the new name Silja Line, while the ships owned by Siljavatustamo would be transferred to the fleets of Siljavarustamo's owners. Just five days after the new ships were ordered, and attendum was signed, allowing for the building contract to be transferred to FÅA, Svea or Bore. In February 1970 the contract of the first ship was transferred to FÅA, eventually becoming their , while the contract of the second ship was transferred to Svea on 9 November 1970.|$|E

30|$|José Holquin-Veras {{presents}} an approximation model {{to estimate the}} joint carrier-receiver response to off-hour delivery policies. The model’s main intent is to bypass the need to use more complex approaches that require expensive data for model calibration. Having access to such approximation models {{would make it easier}} for transportation agencies and metropolitan planning organisations to analyse and design off-hour delivery programs and policies. The proposed model estimates the <b>joint</b> <b>market</b> share in off-hour deliveries by computing the joint probability that all receivers in a typical tour agree to off-hour deliveries, the probability that the carrier operation is profitable and finally the <b>joint</b> <b>market</b> share. The model’s inputs are the probability that a typical receiver would participate in off-hour deliveries, the statistical distribution of tour lengths, and the probability that the carrier operation is profitable for a given number of receivers. The results indicate that the model provides the same results than other more complex methodologies for the practical range of values of receiver participation.|$|R
25|$|To promote {{travel by}} the {{underground}} railways in London a <b>joint</b> <b>marketing</b> arrangement was agreed that included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. UNDERGROUND signs were used outside stations in Central London. The UERL acquired London bus and tram companies in 1912 {{and the following}} year the City & South London and Central London Railway joined the company. That year the Great Northern & City {{was taken over by}} the Met. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by the Metropolitan, a press release of November 1912 noting its interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main line railways and its freight business. Further coordination {{in the form of a}} General Managers' Conference faltered after the Metropolitan withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. The UERL introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar and the Met responded with station boards showing a blue bar on a red diamond.|$|E
25|$|Under a <b>joint</b> <b>marketing</b> {{agreement}} between {{most of the}} companies {{in the early years}} of the 20th century, UNDERGROUND signs appeared outside stations in central London. World War I delayed extensions of the Bakerloo and Central London Railways, and people used the tube stations as shelters during air raids in 1915. After the war, government-backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network, and the tunnels of the City and South London and Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railways were linked at Euston and Kennington, although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later. The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow. In 1933, the underground railways and all London area tram and bus operators were merged into the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The outlying branches of the Metropolitan were closed; various upgrades were planned. The Bakerloo line's extension to take over the Metropolitan's Stanmore branch, and extensions of the Central and Northern lines, formed part of the 1930s New Works Programme. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 halted or interrupted some of this work, and many tube stations were used as air-raid shelters.|$|E

40|$|This report {{documents}} the model development {{carried out in}} work package 3 in the SUPWIND project.

Reserve power is needed to cover deviations from the day-ahead forecasts of electricity load and wind power production, and to cover forced outages of power plants and transmission lines. Work has been carried out to include load uncertainty and forced outages in the two main components of the Wilmar Planning tool namely the Scenario Tree Tool and the <b>Joint</b> <b>Market</b> Model.

2500|$|In 1967 {{three of}} Silja's rival {{companies}} {{had formed a}} <b>joint</b> <b>marketing</b> and coordination company, Viking Line, which was to become Silja Line's main rival {{for the next two}} decades. FÅA, Bore and Svea soon realised that a similar arrangement would be preferable to their current fragmented image, and in 1970 a big change was carried out within the organisations: Silja Line was established as a <b>joint</b> <b>marketing</b> and coordination company between FÅA, Bore and Svea, and the ships of Siljavarustamo were divided between these three. All Silja Line's ships were painted in the same colour scheme, with a white hull and superstructure, with the dark blue [...] "Silja Line" [...] text on the side, alongside the now-famous seal's head logo. Each company retained their own funnel colours, so it was easy to distinguish which ship belonged to which company even from a distance: Svea's funnels where white with a large black S on them, FÅA's were black with two white brands around the funnel, and Bore's were yellow with a blue/white cross.|$|E

2500|$|By 1970, {{the state}} had five bonded wineries, with [...] in production.

In 1973, Oregon passed its landmark land-use law, which imposed strict separation between agricultural and urban uses of land via such mechanism as the Urban Growth Boundary and Exclusive Farm Use Zones. This prevented many hillsides, deemed inappropriate for other crops which are easier to grow on flat fields, from being converted to housing. Also in the 1970s, the winemakers of the region began to organize to promote their vintages.
