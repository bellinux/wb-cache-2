The following year, he was accepted into a graduate physics program at the University of California at Berkeley where he remained for a year. In the summer of 1953, Meselson was at a swimming pool party at the Pauling home in Sierra Madre (he was friends with Pauling's son Peter and with his daughter Linda), and Pauling asked him what he intended to do the following year. Upon hearing Meselson respond that he intended to return to the University of Chicago, Pauling immediately asked him to come to Caltech to begin graduate studies with him, to which Meselson agreed. As a graduate student of Linus Pauling in chemistry at the California Institute of Technology (1953-1957), Meselson's doctoral dissertation was on <b>equilibrium</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> and on x-ray crystallography. He was Assistant Professor of Physical Chemistry and then Senior Research Fellow at Caltech until he joined the Harvard faculty in 1960 where he conducts research and has taught undergraduate genetics for many years.|$|E
5000|$|In 1957, Meselson and Franklin Stahl (as {{part of the}} Phage group) {{showed that}} DNA {{replicates}} semi-conservatively. In order to test hypotheses for how DNA replicates, Meselson and Stahl, together with Jerome Vinograd, invented a method that separates macromolecules according to their buoyant density. The method, <b>equilibrium</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation,</b> was sufficiently sensitive that Meselson and Stahl were able to separate DNA containing the heavy isotope of nitrogen, 15N, from DNA made of the lighter isotope, 14N. In their classic experiment, described and analyzed in a book by science historian Frederic L. Holmes, they grew the bacterium Escherichia coli for many generations in medium containing 15N as the only nitrogen source and then switched the bacteria to growth medium containing 14N instead. They extracted DNA from bacteria prior to switching and, at intervals, for several generations thereafter. After one generation of growth, all the DNA was seen to have a density half way between that of 15N DNA and 14N DNA. In successive generations, the fraction of DNA that was “half-heavy” fell {{by a factor of}} ½, as the total amount of DNA increased two-fold. When the half-heavy DNA was made single stranded by heating, it separated into two density species, one heavy (containing only 15N) and one light (containing only 14N). The experiment implied that, upon replication, the two complementary strands of the bacterial DNA separate, and that each of the single strands directs the synthesis of a new, complementary strand, a result that verified the suggestion for DNA replication put forward five years earlier by James Watson and Francis Crick [...] and lent important early support for the Watson-Crick model of the DNA molecule.|$|E

Only a minor fraction of RNA b molecules were bound in the complex; the majority of RNA b sedimented as naked RNA molecules. Complexes synthesizing other, less abundant, maize RNA plasmids were not identified.

Three different sizes of molecule, with approximate lengths of 1. 2, 0. 55, and 0. 25 micron, were observed. The ratios of the large molecules to the small molecules were similar in all the particles prepared under different conditions. <b>Equilibrium</b> CsCl <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> showed that ADV nucleic acid had a buoyant density of 1. 733 g/cm 3. In Cs 2 SO 4, ADV had a lower buoyant density than that of double-stranded RNA. These properties and its sensitivity to DNase suggested that ADV contains DNA. Thermal denaturation curves revealed that the DNA of ADV had a single-stranded configuration. Polypeptide analysis of ADV by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed the presence of four polypepties, with molecular weights of 30, 000, 27, 000, 20, 500, and 14, 000.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} the biological functions of transmembrane CEACAM 1 isoforms expressed in cultured rat brain endothelial cells. The main focus of the presented data was the analysis of functional and biochemical impact of CEACAM 1 -mediated signaling during dynamic processes like cell adhesion, cell migration and contact formation of endothelial cells. During in vitro angiogenesis assays, expression of CEACAM 1 -L promotes network formation of endothelial cells and increased cell motility. During cell-matrix adhesion, CEACAM 1 -L translocated into the Triton X- 100 -insoluble cytoskeletal fraction and affected cell spreading and cell morphology on Matrigel and laminin- 1 but not on fibronectin. On laminin- 1, CEACAM 1 expressing cells developed protrusions with lamellipodia and showed less stress fiber formation. CEACAM 1 -mediated morphological alterations were sensitive to RhoA activation and depended on Rac 1 activation. Analyses of integrin-mediated signaling pathways revealed a functional cross talk of CEACAM 1 and integrins, which led to reduced FAK tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased the formation of mature focal adhesios on laminin- 1. Furthermore, a matrix protein-dependent association of CEACAM 1 and talin, an important regulator of integrin function, was detected. Solubilization experiments with endothelial cells overexpressing CEACAM 1 -isoforms showed a partial insolubility of CEACAM 1 -L in Triton X- 100 lysis buffer, revealing a strong anchorage to the actin cytoskeleton of this isoform. Using CHAPS, CEACAM 1 localized in detergent-insoluble complexes. Moreover, CHAPS-insolubility of CEACAM 1 was abrogated after cholesterol depletion. An association of CEACAM 1 with lipid raft-like membrane microdomains was analysed by <b>equilibrium</b> sucrose <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation.</b> CEACAM 1 is located at intercellular contact areas of transfected endothelial cells when the cells reached confluence. CEACAM 1 - 4 L undergoes a transient, cell density dependent phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and tyrosine phosphphorylation was strongly reduced by inhibiting src-family tyrosine kinases. Furthermore, cholesterol depletion of cellular membranes impeded tyrosine phosporylation of CEACAM 1 -L. Finally, immunoprecipitations of tyrosine phosphorylated CEACAM 1 -L from recently confluent RBE cells brought down a significant amount of PTP- 1 D/SHP- 2 revealing an association of CEACAM 1 -L and SHP- 2 at cell-cell contact areas that was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Proliferation studies with CEACAM 1 -posive and -negative cells indicated a differential response upon TGF-beta stimulation. While CEACAM 1 -negative cells displayed only marginal TGF-beta-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation, CEACAM 1 -expressing cells were strongly inhibited. This inhibitory effect was independent from the existence of the CEACAM 1 cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylation studies upon TGF-beta-stimulation revealed a transient reduction of the phosphorylation level of Tyr 488 within the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM 1 -L.

Techniques for synchronizing, by cyanide and starvation, {{the development of}} [phi]X- 174 {{in all of the}} infected cells of a culture of E. coli C were developed. The infection of starved cells in buffer, followed by the addition of broth, was found most satisfactory. One-step growth curves of [phi]X and [ [...] . ] (a plaque morphology mutant of [phi]X that has a longer mean latent period and will not lyse cells in concentrated cultures) were determined. The rate of phage maturation is constant. A probit plot of the percentage of phage released vs. the logarithm of the time after infection is linear. The replication of [phi]X DNA was investigated using E. coli CR (a thymine requiring strain), 5 -bromodeoxyuridine, the technique of <b>equilibrium</b> CsCl <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation,</b> and the protoplast assay technique for [phi]X DNA. The DNA combining with the infecting single strand to form the first replicative form (RF) is synthesized after infection from low molecular weigh precursors from the medium. The rate of increase in the amount of infective RF in the culture during the eclipse period is constant, and the RF molecule containing the parental single strand replicates semiconservatively. The conserved subunit is a single strand of DNA. The material constituting the progeny single strands is derived directly from the medium, not from RF. [phi]X carrying 2 - 4 P(32) atoms per particle were used to infect cells in cold medium. The phage and early complexes were killed with an efficiency of 1; mature complexes were inactivated with an efficiency of about 0. 2, even though unlabeled and infective RF had been synthesized in them. At {{about the same time as}} progeny single strands were synthesized the complexes became completely refractory to suicide. Chloramphenicol did not prevent the P 32 suicide efficiency of the complexes from decreasing to about 0. 2; complexes formed in chloramphenicol from cells which had not been starved became fully resistant to inactivation, whereas complexes formed from starved cells did not. The ultraviolet radiation sensitivity of [phi]X complexes formed with E. coli C, E. coli Cs (a non host cell reactivating strain), and E. coli CR were determined at various wavelengths, at various stages of development, and under various conditions. Free [phi]X is not host cell reactivable; the target that is observed in the Luria-Latarjet curves of the complex is host cell reactivable. The most uv sensitive structure in the complex is the single strand of DNA synthesized after infection and associated with the infecting single strand. Budr present in this newly synthesized strand will sensitize the complex to uv. Experiments entailing a switch between Budr and thymidine media indicated that the uv sensitive target in the complex could be identified with the single strand of DNA associated with the infecting parental strand. The DNA constituting this strand "turns over" each time the parental RF replicates. The uv sensitivity of the bacterial capacity to support [phi]X growth was also studied. Although the colony forming ability of Cs is more sensitive to uv than C, the capacity is not. There was evidence that a single nucleic acid like structure and a large number of protein like structures had to be inactivated in order to destroy the capacity. Starvation of CR for thymine, or growth in Budr, increased the uv sensitivity of the capacity; as the cells in a thymine starved culture underwent thymineless death, they also lost their capacity to support [phi]X growth. Action spectra for the complexes and for capacity are presented. The uv sensitivities of MS- 2, Bu-[phi]X, and [ [...] . ] (in the presence and absence of cysteamine) are described...|$|R

Dextran- 40 <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> resulted in a better separation of mitochondrial populations than did sucrose <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation.</b> Separation by sucrose <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> may not be according to the true densities of the particles. On the other hand, the use of gradients of Dextran- 40, a solute of low osmotic potential, facilitated separation of particles acording to their true densities. Such mitochondria showed better respiratory control ratio and ADP: 0 values, than those isolated by sucrose <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation...</b>|$|R

40|$|Plasma was {{collected}} from Atlantic salmon Salmo salar with acute {{infectious salmon anaemia}} (ISA) and used to challenge Atlantic salmon parr by intraperitoneal injection. Treatment of plasma with the lipid solvent, chloroform, showed that the etiological agent of ISA contained essential lipids, probably as a viral envelope. Some infectivity remained following treatment with freon. Injection challenges using fractions from <b>equilibrium</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> of plasma from fish with acute ISA revealed a band of infectivity in the range 1. 184 to 1. 262 g cm- 3. The band was believed to contain both complete ISA-virus particles and infectious particles lacking a complete envelope, nucleocapsid or genome. Density gradient centrifugation of infectious plasma for enrichment of the putative ISA virus appeared to offer a suitable method for obtaining virus-specific nucleic acid {{for use in the}} construction of cDNA libraries...|$|E
40|$|Although dihydropyrimidine {{dehydrogenase}} (DPD) {{has been}} purified and characterized from liver tissues of various mammals conflicting data exist on its subcellular localization. To determine the localization of DPD we prepared crude subcellular fractions of a rat liver homogenate {{by means of}} differential centrifugation. In the fractions obtained (heavy mitochondrial, light mitochondrial, microsomal and cytosolic) the activities of different marker enzymes were measured {{as well as the}} activity of DPD. These results showed that almost all of the activity of DPD was located in the cytosolic fraction. To exclude any particulate-associated DPD, a light mitochondrial fraction was subsequently subjected to <b>equilibrium</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation.</b> The distribution profile of the activity of DPD and the various marker enzymes indicated that DPD from rat liver was exclusively located in the cytosol since no significant activity of DPD could be detected in any subcellular organell...|$|E
40|$|The {{simian virus}} 40 (SV 40) -yielding {{variants}} of the adenovirus type 2 (Ad. 2) -SV 40 hybrid (Ad. 2 ++) population were studied {{by means of}} fixed-angle <b>equilibrium</b> <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugation</b> in cesium chloride. The hybrid virions of the Ad. 2 ++ high-efficiency yielder population banded at densities of 0. 004 g/cm 3 lighter than the nonhybrid Ad. 2 virions. The degree of separation of the hybrid particles was sufficient to permit greater than 100 -fold relative purification by two cycles of centrifugation. Hybrid particles that produce adenovirus plaques in African green monkey kidney cells by two-hit kinetics (one-hit kinetics when assayed on lawns of nonhybrid adenovirus) were not separable from the particles that yield SV 40 virus. The hybrid particle in the Ad. 2 ++ low-efficiency yielder population was not separable from the nonhybrid Ad. 2 virions...|$|E
