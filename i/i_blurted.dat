5000|$|Years later, while I {{was giving}} a speech to a college class, I was asked why I went into journalism. <b>I</b> {{suddenly}} <b>blurted</b> out, “I think it all started when I {{went out to the}} state hospital." [...] Although this had never occurred to me before, it instantly seemed right. I realized that what I loved about my visits was that I got the chance to study people who went right up to the line of normal behavior—and then, inexplicably, stepped over it.

And {{there were moments}} as we went in {{imagination}} about that house together, when my whole being cried out to take her in my arms--now. But I refrained. On that aspect of life I touched very lightly in that talk, very lightly because I had had my lessons. She promised to marry me within two months' time. Shyly, reluctantly, she named a day, and next afternoon, in heat and wrath, we [...] "broke it off" [...] again for the last time. We split upon procedure. I refused flatly to have a normal wedding with wedding cake, in white favours, carriages {{and the rest of}} it. It dawned upon me suddenly in conversation with her and her mother, that this was implied. <b>I</b> <b>blurted</b> out my objection forthwith, and this time it wasn't any ordinary difference of opinion; it was a [...] "row." [...] I don't remember a quarter of the things we flung out in that dispute. I remember her mother reiterating in tones of gentle remonstrance: [...] "But, George dear, you must have a cake--to send home." [...] I think we all reiterated things. I seem to remember a refrain of my own: [...] "A marriage is too sacred a thing, too private a thing, for this display. Her father came in and stood behind me against the wall, and her aunt appeared beside the sideboard and stood with arms, looking from speaker to speaker, a sternly gratified prophetess.

The train started as I made the platform, and I headed for the aforesaid millionnaire with the porter one jump behind and reaching for me. It was a dead heat, for I reached the millionnaire at the same instant that the porter reached me. I had no time for formalities. [...] "Gimme a quarter to eat on," [...] <b>I</b> <b>blurted</b> out.

It is my conviction that he was so flabbergasted that he obeyed automatically, and it has been a matter of keen regret ever since, on my part, that I didn't ask him for a dollar. I know that I'd have got it. I swung off the platform of that private car with the porter manoeuvring to kick me in the face. He missed me. One is at a terrible disadvantage when trying to swing off the lowest step of a car and not break his neck on the right of way, with, at the same time, an irate Ethiopian on the platform above trying to land him in the face with a number eleven.

6000|$|It was, all felt, a {{good thing}} to have a Mr. Abel in Georgetown. That it was indeed good for me I quickly discovered. I had {{certainly}} not expected to meet in such a place with any person to share my tastes--that love of poetry which has been the chief passion and delight of my life; but such a one I had found in Mr. Abel. It surprised me that he, suckled on the literature of Spain, and a reader of only ten or twelve years of English literature, possessed a knowledge of our modern poetry as intimate as my own, and a love of it equally great. This feeling brought us together and made us two--the nervous olive-skinned Hispano-American of the tropics and the phlegmatic blue-eyed Saxon of the cold north--one in spirit and more than brothers. Many were the daylight hours we spent together and [...] "tired the sun with talking"; many, past counting, the precious evenings in that restful house of his where I was an almost daily guest. I had not looked for such happiness; nor, he often said, had he. A result of this intimacy was that the vague idea concerning his hidden past, that some unusual experience had profoundly affected him and perhaps changed the whole course of his life, did not diminish, but, on the contrary, became accentuated, and was often in my mind. The change in him was almost painful to witness whenever our wandering talk touched {{on the subject of the}} aborigines, and of the knowledge he had acquired of their character and languages when living or travelling among them; all that made his conversation most engaging--the lively, curious mind, the wit, the gaiety of spirit tinged with a tender melancholy--appeared to fade out of it; even the expression of his face would change, becoming hard and set, and he would deal you out facts in a dry mechanical way as if reading them in a book. It grieved me to note this, but I dropped no hint of such a feeling, and would never have spoken about it but for a quarrel which came at last to make the one brief solitary break in that close friendship of years. I got into a bad state of health, and Abel was not only much concerned about it, but annoyed, as if I had not treated him well by being ill, and he would even say that I could get well if I wished to. I did not take this seriously, but one morning, when calling to see me at the office, he attacked me in a way that made me downright angry with him. He told me that indolence and the use of stimulants was the cause of my bad health. He spoke in a mocking way, with a presence of not quite meaning it, but the feeling could not be wholly disguised. Stung by his reproaches, <b>I</b> <b>blurted</b> out that he had no right to talk to me, even in fun, in such a way. Yes, he said, getting serious, he had the best right--that of our friendship. He would be no true friend if he kept his peace about such a matter. Then, in my haste, I retorted that to me the friendship between us did not seem so perfect and complete as it did to him. One condition of friendship is that the partners in it should be known to each other. He had had my whole life and mind open to him, to read it as in a book. HIS life was a closed and clasped volume to me.|$|E

It was time for me to leave for Delhi, to catch the plane back to the States. He was looking at me and laughing.

Shearer describes his experience on the show as a [...] "living hell" [...] and [...] "not a real pleasant place to work." [...] He did not get along well with the other writers and cast members and states that he was not included with the cast in the opening montage (although he was added to the montage for latter episodes of the 1979-80 season) and that Lorne Michaels had told the rest of the cast that he was just a writer. Michaels left Saturday Night Live {{at the end of the}} fifth season, taking the entire cast with him. Shearer told new executive producer Jean Doumanian that he was [...] "not a fan of Lorne's" [...] and offered to stay with the show if he was given the chance to overhaul the program and bring in experienced comedians, like Christopher Guest. However, Doumanian turned him down, so he decided to leave with the rest of the cast. When I left, Dick Ebersolissued a press release, saying [...] "creative differences."

[...] Guest also accepted the offer while McKean rejected it, although he would join the cast in 1994. Dick Ebersol, who replaced Lorne Michaels as the show's producer, said that Shearer was [...] "a gifted performer but a pain in the butt.

40|$|In this {{extract from}} her new book KATHLEEN MALTZAHN {{describes}} how the federal government’s attitude to the trafficking of women for prostitution began to change just six years ago, {{through the efforts of}} community activists and two journalists from the Australian. IN LATE 2002, I {{received a phone call from}} Charandev Singh, a human rights advocate at the Brimbank Community Legal Centre in Melbourne’s outer west. We had never met, but Singh had heard that Project Respect, where I worked, had been following the case of a young woman who had died in the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre in Sydney. Puongtong Simaplee died on 27 September 2001, and the manner of her death was noticed by Senator Brian Harradine. In parliament Harradine asked Senator Ellison, the minister representing the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, whether he was “aware that the death of the young girl occurred after she had been in a distressed state and crying for over a period of three or four days and was obviously in need of special care. ” Senator Ellison replied that the “detainee had been in detention since 23 September as a result of a major compliance operation in Sydney targeting several premises associated with the sex industry and people smuggling within that industry. ” We were concerned. In 2001, we had received funding from the Myer Foundation to research trafficking, and we had uncovered a pattern of the detention and deportation of trafficked women. Victims of crime, it seemed, were being treated like criminals - held in immigration detention and deported without recourse to justice. We did not know anything about the young woman who had died, but her death raised significant questions. But while the news was disturbing, we weren’t sure what to do about it. A few months before, I had sat in on the coronial inquiry into the death of another woman who had died having been at Villawood. Vietnamese woman Thi Hang Le had come to Australia in 1997 on a student visa. In 2000 her request for a new student visa was rejected; she was detained on 4 July 2001 and taken to Villawood. By 13 January 2002 she was dead. At the time, the coronial inquiry made me think she couldn’t have been trafficked - none of the cases of trafficking our research had uncovered had involved student visas. Now, having seen student visas regularly used as a way to get trafficked women into Australia, I am not as confident that Thi Hang Le wasn’t a victim of trafficking. Such questions, though, were not within the purview of the inquiry, even if there had been official concern about trafficking at that time. Thi Hang Le was transferred to a psychiatric unit at Bankstown Hospital, seemingly having attempted to jump off a balcony. She tried to escape at least twice, and finally succeeded. On 12 December, after some six months outside Villawood, she was captured after a storekeeper found her stealing food in his shop. He didn’t want her charged, he said, but as a detention centre escapee she was taken straight back to Villawood. She weighed 42 kilos, down from 56 kilos when she had been detained in July. In Villawood, she again tried to jump off a balcony, and was again transferred to the psychiatric unit. Villawood staff said she was now terrified of men. She refused food and medication, and staff held her down to administer drugs. By 8 January she was on fifteen-minute watches. She was clearly not well. Immigration, however, had a job to do - they had set 13 January as Thi Hang Le’s deportation date and nothing, it seemed, was going to change that date. Remarkably, after a short consultation, medical staff agreed that she was well enough to travel. She was transferred back to Villawood in preparation for leaving the country. On 13 January, the day she was due to be deported, Le jumped again, from the first storey of a building. This time the impact was fatal. Sitting in on the coronial inquiry, it was evident to me that many of the facts in Thi Hang Le’s case were unclear, witnesses had been deported, records were contradictory, and the actions of Australasian Correctional Management, the organisation contracted to run Villawood, were deeply problematic. Despite this, the coroner took little more than the morning to hear the case. We were concerned that the same thing would happen with Puongtong Simaplee’s inquiry, but we had no idea that we could do anything about it. Charandev Singh’s phone call solved the problem. Singh is a prison activist with a profound understanding of the coronial process, particularly in relation to deaths in custody. When he rang, he had been involved in eleven coronial inquiries into deaths in prisons and immigration detention. He also has one of the finest minds I have ever encountered. He suggested that Project Respect seek legal standing at the coronial inquiry. With little idea about what this meant, and even less about what it would entail, we agreed. We had no funding for such a venture, had little support and were already overworked, but the more we found out about trafficking in Australia, the clearer it became that immigration detention of trafficked women had to be addressed. In the year leading up to Singh’s call, Project Respect had had more and more contact with trafficked women. A clear pattern had emerged. Women - at that time often Thai women - were coming to Australia on the promise of decent conditions and good pay. Many knew they might be doing prostitution, or at least would be connected to the sex industry through karaoke bars or strip clubs. Some, a small minority, had no inkling that they would have anything to do with prostitution. Either way, their experience was similar. Women told us of being lied to, raped, beaten and locked up, of having no control over how or if they had sex with customers, having to have sex when they were sick or menstruating, being deprived of their passports and threatened with violence and deportation. Some women were sold on from one trafficker to the next. All were paying off “debts” of at least $ 35, 000. Some escaped and, if found, were beaten and fined. They saw all the same things happening to other women. Many said they believed that women had been killed for running away, and I was shown a gruesome photo of a tortured Thai woman slumped in a rice field. Women I’d met in brothels and other people connected with the sex industry said they knew the runaway contract girl in the picture. Whether the photo was staged or real, its impact was the same - women believed they were expendable. The violence they had seen and experienced had taught them that their life under contract in Australia was worth little and crimes could be committed against them with impunity. Life was hard and frightening. As one woman told us, “I thought easy, but very hard. ” Another woman told us that she would “never do contract again. ” “Something stuck in here,” she said, touching her chest, “never happy, can’t sleep, bad dream every sleep, very bad feeling. ” Many of the women had experienced poverty in their homeland and wanted to help their parents, educate their siblings or feed their children. Some were leaving behind violence - abusive husbands, bosses who harassed them. Others were simply in search of a new life, adventure, a good job - all the things Australians in their twenties are looking for when they set off on backpacker holidays. Some had done prostitution before, either in their home country or abroad, and they consistently said that where the experience in another country had been difficult - “Macau was too hard,” one woman said, “it feels like in jail” - they expected that prostitution in Australia would be easier. At that time, despite the many crimes committed against the women, if they were found by the Department of Immigration to be in breach of their visa conditions they were put in detention and deported. No charges were laid: even leaving aside the federal sexual slavery legislation, crimes under state law - rape, battery and imprisonment - were going undetected by the authorities. Compounding the women’s fear of deportation, traffickers themselves threatened to and in fact at times did report women to immigration authorities. It was difficult to know how many women were being trafficked. The authorities weren’t counting - they didn’t believe trafficking existed - and it was hard for a small organisation like ours to come up with national estimates. There were three significant barriers to documenting trafficking cases. First, victims were fearful of both immigration authorities and traffickers, and so were often reluctant to tell their stories. Second, there was little official documentation of trafficking, and no prosecutions to establish how it worked. Third, and obviously, the very nature of trafficking makes it difficult to reach victims, and even when we found women (for example, during outreach to brothels) it was often not safe to talk openly to them about their experiences. In the face of inaction by other bodies, however, we tried to do the sums ourselves. In March 2004, a year after the 2003 coronial inquiry into Puongtong Simaplee’s death, Project Respect compiled a case-by-case list of trafficking victims. In only six weeks of research in early 2004 we documented 300 cases in Australia, the great bulk trafficking for prostitution. This research was clearly partial. We weren’t able, for example, to travel to Perth or Adelaide to investigate in more detail stories we had heard of trafficking there. The work was done quickly with few resources, based on interviews with trafficked women themselves, with other people connected to the sex industry, and with NGOs and unions. What it showed, however, was that even a fairly cursory exploration found far too many victims. It reinforced our belief that the estimate we had come up with a year earlier, around the time of the 2003 coronial inquiry, was reasonable - we believed that up to 1000 women could be being trafficked to Australia yearly. International estimates were high. The 2004 Trafficking in Persons Report, from the US Department of State, said that each year “an estimated 600, 000 - 800, 000 men, women, and children are trafficked across international borders (some international and non-governmental organizations place the number far higher), and the trade is growing. ” Millions more, it found, were trafficked within borders. “The US government,” it added, “estimates that over half of all victims trafficked internationally are trafficked for sexual exploitation. ” The United Nations and the US government both estimated that criminal networks made seven billion dollars every year from trafficking people. Numbers are clearly important - they help governments determine the scale of their response, and are a benchmark for charting success or failure in addressing the problem. But knowing the numbers is not enough. In the words of Professor Liz Kelly from the London Metropolitan University’s Child and Woman Abuse Studies Unit, a highly respected researcher in this area, “having a sense of the scale of trafficking tells us only part of the picture Equally as important is understanding trafficking methods; where women are trafficked from, [and] their experiences of procurement, migration and treatment after arrival” in the destination country. What the coronial inquiry into the death of Puongtong Simaplee did was start people asking these sorts of questions - what sort of crimes were foreign women in Australia experiencing, how were traffickers able to exploit women in this way, why were authorities missing the problem, and what were trafficked women doing to survive in the absence of a humane government response? Arriving at the point where trafficking was being discussed at all was testament to Charandev Singh’s skill and inordinate hard work. Months before the case, when we had little reason to expect that we would get legal standing, let alone anything more than that, he was clear. We needed a legal strategy, he said, and a media strategy, and he proceeded to pull them together. He was formally employed three days a week by Brimbank Community Legal Centre to work on issues like ours, but he worked day and night on our case, far beyond the hours he was paid for. We had little information to go on at that stage. Our cause received a boost, however - albeit a saddening one - when the coroner’s office told Singh that Puongtong Simaplee had indeed been trafficked, and that this had happened when she was a child. The first step in the legal strategy was to gain legal standing, to argue that Project Respect should be represented at the coronial inquiry as “a person of sufficient interest in the subject matter” of the inquest. Singh argued that, in a long line of such parties at coronial inquiries, Project Respect could bring expertise and unique knowledge about trafficking that would help the court. The areas that concerned us, we stated in our application, were the medical and welfare services and assessments provided to Simaplee, the decision to send her to Villawood rather than to a health facility, and the fact that the Department of Immigration and Australasian Correctional Management were aware that Simaplee had probably been trafficked and yet acted as they did. Among a number of statements, not all true, Puongtong Simaplee had told Department of Immigration official Daniel Bell that she was from a hill tribe in Thailand, had come to Australia fifteen years before, and had been sold by her parents. The case was scheduled for 12 March. Much to my surprise, the coroner gave us standing. But my sense that the coroner was not entirely open to our participation was soon confirmed. As the inquiry began, he set the parameters. “This is not an enquiry into the sex industry,” he told the court. “This is not an enquiry into immigration detention. ” This position impacted immediately on what we were allowed to ask. When we asked questions relating to the sex industry or trafficking, our lawyer was told she was out of line. Having been given legal standing solely on the basis of our expertise on trafficking, we were told we could not ask questions on that issue. So we didn’t. At least not immediately. Having read through the brief again and again, it was devastatingly clear that Puongtong Simaplee had died without reason. There was no doubt she was vulnerable. Court documents show that before her detention she had a heroin addiction, was homeless and, in the words of an older friend, was “not in a positive state of mind. ” She was so physically underdeveloped that detention officials ordered a medical examination to establish if she was male or female. Her arms were marked by scars. (Her boyfriend told police that she marked herself when she did something wrong so she could remember why she did it.) A title search of the brothel she had been picked up in showed that at the time of her detention it was owned by Kean Chang. Puongtong Simaplee also told immigration officials that she had been trafficked as a child. But these things shouldn’t have killed her. She had survived 27 years, many of them hard, but it wasn’t until she entered an Australian government institution that she died. Dr Allan Carla, a pathologist at the Institute of Forensic Medicine at Glebe, told the court that her life could have been saved with “simple measures,” such as placing her on a drip. She had given Villawood officials precise information about the medication she needed to withdraw from the heroin in her system, but was ignored. She was left in a room with a bucket of faeces and urine because the staff thought cleaning it up might motivate her. Handover processes were so poor that staff coming onto new shifts didn’t know that Simaplee had been vomiting since she had arrived. When she had arrived at Villawood, Puongtong’s weight was noted as 37 kilos. When she died less than 72 hours later, she weighed 31 kilos. For the two days of witnesses, we asked questions about Simaplee’s medical treatment, welfare measures and the processes in place at Villawood to protect vulnerable detainees. The coroner made it clear, however, that his court was not the place for further conversations about what role trafficking had played in getting this woman into Australia and ultimately immigration detention. “This is not a human rights court,” he said succinctly. It was here that Charandev Singh’s second strategy kicked in. We took the questions we weren’t allowed to ask within the coronial inquiry and asked them outside. It’s a well-worn approach of course, but in this case the strategy of using the legal process as much as we could and then working with the media to raise questions that weren’t allowed in the hearing was crucial. Crucial, but not without risk. It didn’t take a lot of imagination to work out what some members of the media could do with the story of a heroin-addicted Asian prostitute. The Department of Immigration had already set the tone in its 2001 media release on Simaplee’s death. A Thai drug addict, the release said, had died from overdose in Villawood in a pool of her own vomit. The text seems since to have been removed from the department’s website. We were fortunate though. Singh had previously dealt with Australian journalist Elisabeth Wynhausen on stories about immigration detention, and he knew we could trust her to tell the story fairly. I know now that Wynhausen is an award-winning journalist and book author who worked for twelve years in New York as correspondent for the Age and the National Times and had also worked for the Bulletin, but at that time all I really knew was that Singh trusted her. I first met her in November 2002 when I walked, dazed, out of a long night in a brothel, having heard story after story from women who had been trafficked to Australia. A train ride later, unwashed and sleep-deprived, in a cafe over the road from the Australian’s shiny headquarters, <b>I</b> <b>blurted</b> out what I had spent the last months listening to. Wynhausen listened for a bit, cut me off, fired questions at me, interrupted a bit more, and told the waiter off for wishing her Merry Christmas. For a community worker schooled in letting people speak, it was a surprise, but I was sold. I could tell she understood the issues. By the time the coronial inquiry began in early 2003, Wynhausen was ready to go, and the Australian soon teamed her up with its new investigative editor, Natalie O’Brien, who a couple of years before had uncovered the truth about the “children overboard” story. The Australian’s stories began with Puongtong Simaplee’s death and the fact that despite her claims that she had been trafficked into Australia as a child, and despite her vulnerability, neither the Villawood Immigration Detention Centre nor the Department of Immigration took the steps needed to address these issues and keep the young woman alive. Many news agencies jumped on the story that Puongtong Simaplee had been trafficked to Australia as a child - a statement that was not investigated in the coronial inquiry and was later shown to be untrue - but Wynhausen and O’Brien saw the broader story. The child-trafficking claim pulled in media outlets that might not ordinarily have bothered with a death-in-custody story. In Sydney in particular, the coverage seemed intense, as newspapers such as the Daily Telegraph and usually conservative talkback radio programs expressed outrage at her death. Undeterred by the fact that its own back pages included numerous advertisements for dubious brothels, the Daily Telegraph’s editorial proclaimed that trafficking was a “loathsome practice” and Simaplee’s death a tragic cruelty. In time, it became clear that Puongtong Simaplee had not been trafficked to Australia when she was a child. While the deputy coroner said that it was not the role of the coronial process to investigate if Simaplee’s claim was true, other people thought it was a question that should be addressed, and a Bangkok-based journalist went looking for her parents. I had been unconvinced by the claim that Puongtong Simaplee had been sold by her parents. Although the coroner’s office had told Singh that Simaplee had been trafficked as a child, the suggestion that she had been sold was, in my view, a whole different charge, and one that needed as much investigation as the question of the trafficking. Although stories of Asian parents selling their children into prostitution have become part of our folklore, it is hard to find evidence that the practice is in any way widespread. It’s not that it has never happened, it is just that it happens far less frequently than popular imagination would have us believe. Chris Payne’s 2005 documentary, Trafficked, about “Ning,” a young teenaged girl found in a Sydney brothel in 1995 after Papertiger was disbanded - the girl who Senator Ian Macdonald referred to in his second reading speech on the 1999 Slavery and Sexual Servitude Bill - suggests it is very likely that Ning’s father accepted payment for her, and may have suspected she would be prostituted. At the very least, it is clear that he did little to ensure his daughter would be going to a safe job and,...|$|E

That inspired the choir like theme throughout the song. It's actually one hundred twenty-five tracks of my voice layered to sound like a choir. My friend at the same time was dating this model from New York City who was always messing with his head. After they broke up he would always see her face on billboards. It really upset him. One night we were at a 7-Eleven in New Jersey talking about the situation in the car, and <b>I</b> just <b>blurted</b> out, [...] "Man, these Instagram models are nothing but trouble". I went home that same night and recorded the chorus over that choir beat I made. Then Wayne took it and put a brilliant spin on it and drew inspiration from his own experience I'm sure. Wayne is such a genius with his wordplay. I still can't believe I collaborated on a song with him with an idea that started at 7-Eleven." ...|$|R

He refused to be envious, or at least to betray envy; yet he was curious, asking many questions, and I had reason to think before we parted that his admiration for me was increased. Was it possible that he, too, didn't love Nancy? No, it was funny, but he didn't. He failed to see much in girls: his tone remained commiserating, yet he began to take an interest in the progress of my suit.|$|R
