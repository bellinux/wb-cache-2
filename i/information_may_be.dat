5|$|Vocalizations made {{by right}} whales are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. The whales make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may {{be a form of}} communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this <b>information</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> useful in attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage the whales to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E

25|$|An OSPF {{network is}} divided into areas that are logical groupings of hosts and networks. An area {{includes}} its connecting router having interfaces connected to the network. Each area maintains a separate link state database whose <b>information</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> summarized towards {{the rest of the}} network by the connecting router. Thus, the topology of an area is unknown outside the area. This reduces the routing traffic between parts of an autonomous system.|$|E

While the New RTTY Handbook gives ARRL no credit, it was published by CQ Magazine and its author was a CQ columnist (CQ generally opposed ARRL at that time).|$|E
25|$|Multiplex-PCR: {{consists}} of multiple primer sets {{within a single}} PCR mixture to produce amplicons of varying sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences.

Annealing temperatures {{for each of the}} primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes.

25|$|Various {{experiments}} {{document that}} changes in {{the conditions under which}} the dance is performed lead to characteristic changes in recruitment to external resources, {{in a manner consistent with}} von Frisch's original conclusions. Experiments with robotic dummies were indeed to induce some recruitment, which should not have been possible if the dance contains no information. Various experimental results demonstrate that the dance does convey information, but the use of this <b>information</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> context-dependent, and this may explain why the results of earlier studies were inconsistent. Researchers have also discovered other forms of honeybee dance communication, such as the tremble dance.|$|E

25|$|While in Germany Carathéodory {{retained}} numerous {{links with}} the Greek academic world about which detailed <b>information</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> found in Georgiadou's book. He was directly involved with the reorganization of Greek universities. An especially close friend and colleague in Athens was Nicolaos Kritikos who had attended his lectures at Gŏttingen, later going with him to Smyrna, then becoming professor at Athens Polytechnic. Kritikos and Carathéodory helped the Greek topologist Christos Papakyriakopoulos take a doctorate in topology at Athens University in 1943 under very difficult circumstances. While teaching in Athens University Carathéodory had as undergraduate student Evangelos Stamatis who subsequently achieved considerable distinction as a scholar of ancient Greek mathematical classics.|$|E
25|$|The Meeting {{then moves}} to Public Business, where an invited guest, usually someone of {{expertise}} or {{involvement in the}} matter being debated, chairs the debate in which both student and guest speakers from the Proposition or Opposition bench take the floor. During speeches, Points of <b>Information</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> offered from the floor or opposing bench. Shorter, impromptu Floor Speeches may also be given if there is interest from the student audience. At the debate's conclusion, the motion is put to the House followed by a speech from the occupant of the Chair who usually offers his thoughts on how the debate proceeded. Students and guests then proceed to a reception where discussion {{of the matter is}} usually continued.|$|E
25|$|A digital {{watermark}} is called robust {{with respect to}} transformations if the embedded <b>information</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> detected reliably from the marked signal, even if degraded by any number of transformations. Typical image degradations are JPEG compression, rotation, cropping, additive noise, and quantization. For video content, temporal modifications and MPEG compression often are added to this list. A {{digital watermark}} is called imperceptible if the watermarked content is perceptually equivalent to the original, unwatermarked content. In general, {{it is easy to}} create either robust watermarks—or—imperceptible watermarks, but the creation of both robust—and—imperceptible watermarks has proven to be quite challenging. Robust imperceptible watermarks have been proposed as a tool for the protection of digital content, for example as an embedded no-copy-allowed flag in professional video content.|$|E
