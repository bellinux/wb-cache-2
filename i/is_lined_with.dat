These sculptures include children, women, national figures, freedom fighters, and warriors of India, including notable figures such as Mahatma Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Supertunica – {{the second}} robe {{with which the}} {{sovereign}} is invested. It is a long coat of gold silk which reaches to the ankles and has wide-flowing sleeves. It <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> rose-coloured silk, trimmed with gold lace, woven with national symbols and fastened by a sword belt. It derives from the full dress uniform of a consul of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is a green robe worn {{over their}} suits or {{military}} uniforms. The mantle <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> white taffeta; it is tied with {{green and gold}} tassels. On the left shoulder of the mantle, {{the star of the}} Order (see below) is depicted.|$|E
50|$|The hoods of Professional Doctorates {{are made}} of red fabric lined in royal blue faille. All other {{doctorate}} hoods are in royal blue fabric distinguished by their linings. Doctorates of Philosophy <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> red faille, Honorary Doctorates <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> blue satin, Honorary Doctorates honoris causa <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> blue satin with an edging strip in gold, and Honorary Doctors of the University have hoods <b>lined</b> entirely <b>with</b> gold satin.|$|R
50|$|Internally the {{building}} comprises several office spaces. Walls and ceilings <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibrous cement sheeting joined with cover strips and floors <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> carpet. Internal doors are panelled timber. Cornices and picture rails are simply detailed and formed from timber.|$|R
50|$|The {{internal}} walls and ceilings of the observatory building <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibre-cement sheeting with timber cover strips. Internal doors are timber joinery {{and the floor}} has <b>been</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> linoleum. Some half-height walls and counters open on to the enclosed verandahs.|$|R
5|$|The most {{remarkable}} {{room in the}} suite is the Mazarin Room. This drawing room <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> Italian gilded and painted polychrome boiseries by craftsmen brought to France by Cardinal Mazarin, who was related by marriage to the Grimaldi. Cardinal Mazarin's portrait hangs above the fireplace.|$|E
5|$|Art historians {{disagree}} on when and why onion domes became a typical feature of Russian architecture. Byzantine churches and {{the architecture of}} Kievan Rus were characterized by broader, flatter domes without a special framework erected above the drum. In contrast to this ancient form, each drum of a Russian church is surmounted by a special structure of metal or timber, which <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> sheet iron or tiles.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods, as with molluscs, have an {{epithelial}} mantle that secretes {{and lines}} the shell, and encloses the internal organs. The brachiopod body occupies only {{about one-third of}} the internal space inside the shell, nearest the hinge. The rest of the space <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> the mantle lobes, extensions that enclose a water-filled space in which sits the lophophore. The coelom extends into each lobe as a network of canals, which carry nutrients to the edges of the mantle.|$|E
5000|$|Sections of {{the inner}} German border <b>were</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a 3 m (10 ft) high {{electric}} fence to deter potential defectors from East Germany. Similarly, the Czechoslovak border <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> high electric fence during Cold War to prevent emigration from Czechoslovakia.|$|R

50|$|Brush Lake {{originally}} <b>was</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> brush, {{hence the}} name.|$|R
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm to enter and fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence {{is seen in the}} ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|Most platyhelminths have no anus and regurgitate undigested {{material}} {{through the}} mouth. However, some long species have an anus and some with complex, branched guts {{have more than}} one anus, since excretion only through the mouth would be difficult for them. The gut <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a single layer of endodermal cells that absorb and digest food. Some species break up and soften food first by secreting enzymes in the gut or pharynx (throat).|$|E

5|$|Past the Atlantic City Expressway, the two-lane {{undivided}} road {{comes to an}} intersection with CR 559. From this point, Route 54 <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> residences and businesses as it comes into downtown Hammonton. The road crosses New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line immediately before a junction with CR 561. After CR 561, the route becomes Bellevue Avenue and encounters the western terminus of CR 542. As the road leaves the downtown area, the surroundings become more residential. Route 54 ends at an intersection with US 30 and US 206, where the road continues north as US 206.|$|E
5|$|Production {{designer}} Anthony D. G. Pratt {{was influenced}} by French architect Charles Garnier, designer of the original Paris opera house, as well as Edgar Degas, John Singer Sargent, Gustave Caillebotte, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. Schumacher was inspired by Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast (1946), where a hallway <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> arms holding candelabra. The cemetery {{was based on the}} Père Lachaise and Montparnasse. Costume designer Alexandra Byrne utilised a limited black, white, gold and silver colour palette for the Masquerade ball.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the buccal cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E

5|$|The {{mouth is}} at the {{anterior}} end, and opens into an elongated muscular pharynx with a triangular or Y-shaped lumen, lined by myoepithelial cells. The pharynx opens into a cylindrical intestine, which <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> glandular and digestive cells. The anus {{is located on the}} ventral surface close to the posterior of the body. In some species, there are pores in the pharynx opening to the ventral surface; these contain valves and may allow egestion of any excess water swallowed while feeding.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the lower}} {{respiratory}} tract including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> respiratory epithelium. This is a ciliated epithelium interspersed with goblet cells which produce mucus, and club cells with actions similar to macrophages. Incomplete rings of cartilage in the trachea and smaller plates of cartilage in the bronchi, keep these airways open. Bronchioles are too narrow to support cartilage and their walls are of smooth muscle, and this is largely absent in the narrower respiratory bronchioles which are mainly just of epithelium. The respiratory tract ends in lobules. Each lobule consists of a respiratory bronchiole, which branches into alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs, which in turn divide into alveoli.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} {{continues}} farther north, {{and closer to}} Grand Rapids, it <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> more commercial and light industrial properties. The unincorporated suburb of Cutlerville lies to the east as US131 approaches M-6, the South Beltline Freeway, and meets in the largest freeway interchange in West Michigan. Gaining a third lane in each direction, the interchange stretches over a half mile (0.8km) in width and over a mile (1.6km) in length and encompasses 27bridges and 18retaining walls. US131 continues north through the city of Wyoming to the more suburban residential areas near the southern city limits of Grand Rapids north of M-11 (28th Street).|$|E

50|$|The {{secretory}} endpieces {{of these}} glands <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> simple columnar epithelium; the main ducts <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> stratified columnar epithelium. These glands {{do not occur}} in carnivores, but are present in some form in horses, ruminants and swine. Seminal fluid, the product of this gland, serves {{as a vehicle for}} the transport of spermatozoa.|$|R
50|$|The plan works off {{the central}} living area which flows {{through to the}} {{southern}} extensions which accommodate dining, kitchen, laundry and bathroom. The north part of the living space opens through two sets of french doors onto an enclosed east verandah and through four-panelled timber doors to each of two bedrooms to the west. The walls and partitions to the north part of the living area and partitions to the bedrooms are of single skin post and rail construction with vertical tongue and groove timber boards. The west wall of bedroom two and part of bedroom one <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> horizontal boards. A notch in the rail {{on the east side}} of bedroom one and the horizontal lining to the west may indicate the location of a previous partition. The ceilings of the bedrooms and living room <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> narrow timber boards and have timber-framed sash windows with obscure patterned glazing. The partitions to the dining room and the kitchen and the east side of the south end of the living room <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> vertical timber boards. The other partitions <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> fibrous cement sheeting. The ceilings to these areas <b>are</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> timber boards.|$|R
5|$|Both {{the male}} and female are {{involved}} in the nest building. The male does most of the work, while the female perches on the shrub or tree where the nest is being built to watch for predators. The nest is built approximately three to ten feet above the ground. The outer part of the nest is composed of twigs, while the inner part <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> grasses, dead leaves, moss, or artificial fibers. The eggs are a light blue or greenish color and speckled with dots. The female lays three to five eggs, and she incubates them for nearly two weeks. Once the eggs are hatched, both {{the male and}} female will feed the chicks.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{crosses the}} marshy Little River {{and enters the}} town of Little Creek, where it becomes Main Street and <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> residences. The route comes to an {{intersection}} with the eastern terminus of DE 8 as it leaves Little Creek and becomes Bayside Drive again. The road continues northwest through farmland with some trees and homes, passing to the southwest of Octagonal Schoolhouse before heading through the community of Cowgills Corner. Past this intersection, the route runs southwest of Chandelle Estates Airport. DE 9 curves {{to the north and}} enters the town of Leipsic. At this point, the route turns northwest onto Denny Street and runs past homes and businesses, curving north to intersect the eastern terminus of DE 42.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 runs between {{farmland}} to {{the north}} and housing developments to the south prior to turning north onto Silver Run Road. The road curves northeast through agricultural areas before entering marshland and crossing the Appoquinimink River. After this, the route turns north to remain on Silver Run Road and passes through areas of farms, woods, and wetlands in the Augustine Wildlife Area a short distance {{to the west of the}} Delaware River. DE 9 turns east onto Bayview Road before turning north onto St. Augustine Road and following the west bank of the Delaware River. The road reaches the community of Port Penn, where it <b>is</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> homes. In Port Penn, the route turns west onto Market Street before turning north onto Delaware City Port Penn Road near the Port Penn Interpretive Center.|$|E
50|$|The upper {{levels of}} both rear {{sections}} now {{function as a}} single large open space. Walls in this space are exposed brick with a painted finish and floors have <b>been</b> <b>lined</b> <b>with</b> later sheeting.
