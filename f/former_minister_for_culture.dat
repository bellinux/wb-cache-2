2500|$|The 6th World Social Forum (WSF), an alter-globalization movement, {{took place}} in Bamako from January 19 to January 23, 2006. The debt problem {{was at the heart}} of the agenda for the meeting. For Barry Aminata Touré, {{president}} of the Coalition of African Alternatives to Debt and Development, [...] "the simple cancellation of debt of Third World nations is finally putting poor countries on the developing track". Agriculture, and in particular genetically modified organisms, access to water, and immigration were some of the other topics brought up by participants. According to Diadié Yacouba Dagnoko, <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Culture</b> and one of the coordinators of the WSF, the forum, which accommodated between 15,000 and 20,000 participants, cost 700 million CFA francs. Falling under the framework for this WSF, the Collectif citoyen pour la restitution et le développement intégré du rail (Cocidirail) requested for the renationalisation of the rail network, and for the reopening of shut down stations. It promised to beat incumbent president of Mali Amadou Toumani Touré if he recontested in the 2007 elections to protest against his false election promises.|$|E

50|$|The 1960s heralded the {{explosive}} growth of the mass commercial aviation, facilitating the in-flow of tourists across the world. This helped the State to identify the tourist market as having a massive growth potential - boost income, job and trade opportunities, and in 1963, the <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Culture</b> S. Rajaratnam, announced plans to develop tourism as a major industry in Singapore. Thus, the newly-formed STPB was appointed {{to carry out this}} massive plan. However, the private sector faced the challenge of limited resources to promote Singapore abroad as a tourist destination. This led to the State's effort to increase its funding {{for the development of the}} tourism industry in Singapore. One of the first places to be developed was the area of Orchard Road, where many hotels were erected. Therefore, beginning in the 1960s, Orchard Road began to undergo massive transformation, and the area was zoned for retail. By the early 1970s, Orchard Road had already attained its status as the 'IN' shopping area and gained an international recognition as a shopping paradise in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|Arthur Jayne succeeded {{with his}} plan. From 1920, with the {{exception}} of (for unknown reasons) the years 1926-27, and of course the war years 1940-44, Norwegian students were awarded the Norway Scholarship for studies of the most varied description. However, as the basic funding of the scholarship proved inadequate, the scholars soon became dependent on supplementary grants from other university funds, but from the late 1970s even this arrangement proved inadequate to meet rising costs. For some years no scholars were appointed at all. The basic foundation capital had by then shrunk to only NOK. 130 000.- (about GBP 6500.- at the current rate of exchange) - a quite inadequate sum. In the late 1970s Alf Bøe (Wadham 1952), head of the Committee, called on Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation’s Andor Birkeland (Wadham 1946), former Accountant Sven Guldberg (Wadham 1937) and <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Culture</b> Helge Sivertsen (Wadham 1938). With the help of the College and of the British Ambassador to Norway, William Bentley - later Sir William Bentley (a Wadham man) they were able to raise NOK 1 170 000 (around GBP 117 000). In the 1990s Bøe formed a new committee consisting of Michael Benskin (St. Peter’s 1965), professor at the Department of British and American Studies of Oslo University, Haakon Melander, banker (Balliol 1966); and Erik Rudeng (Norway scholar 1969). Iver B. Neumann (Norway Scholar 1988) was recruited as young blood in 1993. When Bøe retired in 2003, Neumann took over as chair. Bjørn Blindheim (Norway Scholar 1992) and Neumann formed a Norwegian chapter of the Oxford Society, with Blindheim as chair. Since 1981 the Committee has organized an annual dinner with a guest of honour from Oxford University, who has also given one or more lectures locally in Oslo. Bjørn Blindheim took over the responsibility for these events, and they have continued uninterrupted to this day.|$|E

5000|$|Taoiseach Brian Cowen led tributes, {{saying he}} was [...] "shocked and saddened" [...] by the man's death, and calling him [...] "one of the most loved actors of his {{generation}} and will be dearly missed by the public and his colleagues in theatre and television". <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> <b>Culture</b> Mary Hanafin and Michael D. Higgins TD, <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Arts, <b>Culture</b> & Gaeltacht, were among the other political tributes. Arts Council of Ireland chair Pat Moylan called it [...] "a sad and shocking loss". Lally's screenwife Biddy aka Mary McEvoy said [...] "Mick and I loved each other and we got on really well".|$|R

5000|$|Swieqi is a {{predominantly}} Nationalist-oriented town, {{and at one}} time, the PN even polled 85% of the total votes. There has been a decline in PN fortunes over these past few years though perhaps due {{to the emergence of}} Professor Arnold Cassola who is now a General Secretary of the Green Party in Europe. He lately successfully contested the Italian elections. Swieqi is the hometown of Dolores Cristina, <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Education, <b>Culture,</b> Youth and Sport, and Michael Frendo, <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Foreign Affairs. Joe Borg, <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> <b>for</b> Foreign Affairs and now EU Commissioner for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries also lives here. A twinning agreement has been signed between the Swieqi Local Council and the Council of Taormina. This partnership was signed by the Mayor of Taormina Dott. Mario Bolognari and Swieqi's former mayor, Paul Abela. It is the aim of the Councils to lay out the foundations for a new and profound relationship of friendship and solidarity. The twinning should serve to strengthen the existing links between the Maltese and Sicilian Populations.|$|R
50|$|Due to {{the major}} catastrophes of recent years in Germany - the fire at the Duchess Anna Amalia Library in Weimar in 2004 and the {{collapse}} of the Historical Archive of the city of Cologne in 2009 - the public got only too painfully aware of the vulnerability of the written cultural heritage. Finally on the initiative of the <b>former</b> <b>Minister</b> of State <b>for</b> <b>Culture,</b> Bernd Neumann, the KEK was set up. In the budget of the <b>Minister</b> of State <b>for</b> <b>Culture</b> annual funding amounting to 500,000 Euro has been made available; the Federal States participate with a further 100,000 Euro a year via their Cultural Foundation (Kulturstiftung der Länder).|$|R
