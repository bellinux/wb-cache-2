5|$|In {{the scene}} where Tracy is on his bacon run, every mention of January 17th is either shot so the actor's mouth is hidden or dubbed over. This can be seen most clearly when Cerie says January 17th. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> {{original}} was February 17th but later changed to match the release date of the episode. Closed captioning still shows February 17th.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{successive}} remodelings and enlargements {{the architecture}} at Ashton Court {{is complex and}} seldom what <b>it</b> <b>seems.</b> <b>The</b> core of the house, a 15th-century manor, has been obliterated by later wings, which have in turn been remodelled and altered, most substantially around 1635. Therefore, the plan of the house has evolved as irregular with many juxtapositions and little cohesion; {{while the majority of}} the house was built in the 17th century, a time of classical architecture, remodelling and alteration to the fenestration has created an overall Gothic appearance.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's {{return to}} grace was only temporary. On 26 February 1307, Edward I {{announced}} that the prince's favourite {{had to leave the}} realm shortly after 30 April that year. This time <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> punishment was not intended for Gaveston, though, but for the Prince of Wales. According to Walter of Guisborough, the prince appeared before the King to request that his own county of Ponthieu be given to Gaveston. Edward I, enraged, tore out handfuls of his son's hair and threw him out of the royal chambers. Though Guisborough cannot necessarily be trusted on the details of the events, the story reflects the general exasperation the King felt with the prince's favouritism towards Gaveston, and the lavish gifts bestowed on the favourite. This extravagance was clearly seen on Gaveston's departure, when Prince Edward equipped him with horses, luxurious clothes, and £260 of money.|$|E

5|$|In the Muslim world, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> {{trend of}} hair styles is now favouring short over long in men. In the past, Bedouin Muslims often wore their hair in long braids, but {{influences}} from the Western world {{have caused a}} change in attitudes. Bedouins are now {{less likely to have}} long hair. Islamic countries in North Africa such as Egypt view long hair in men as modernist and in one case the Egyptian police viewed it as Satanic and a sign of an infidel. Spanish rulers during the Medieval Period suspected long-haired males to be Moors or Moriscos, therefore long hair was forbidden since it was believed to be a Moorish custom. However, modern North African men have adopted Western short hair.|$|E
5|$|Phips {{arrived back}} in Boston {{in the summer}} of 1688 and was welcomed back as a hero. His wife seemed very happy to see him. He was celebrated in sermons and at the Harvard college {{commencement}} he was compared to Jason fetching the Golden Fleece. Andros and Randolph were not so happy to see him and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> feeling was mutual. Almost all of New England was unified in their opposition to Andros and Randolph. It is interesting to note here that Phips, despite having been captain of Randolph's gunship in '83-4, {{does not seem to have}} carried an association with Randolph in the minds of the people of Massachusetts Bay.|$|E
5|$|Both Shaivism and Vaishnavism flourished {{during the}} Badami Chalukya period, though <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> former was more popular. Famous temples {{were built in}} places such as Pattadakal, Aihole and Mahakuta, and priests (archakas) were invited from {{northern}} India. Vedic sacrifices, religious vows (vrata) and the giving of gifts (dana) was important. The Badami kings were initially followers of Vedic Hinduism and dedicated temples to popular Hindu deities in Aihole. Sculptures of deities testify to the popularity of Hindu Gods such as Vishnu, Shiva, Kartikeya, Ganapathi, Shakti, Surya and Sapta Matrikas ("seven mothers"). The Badami kings also performed the Ashwamedha ("horse sacrifice"). The worship of Lajja Gauri, a fertility goddess is known. Jainism too was a prominent religion during this period. The kings of the dynasty were however secular and actively encouraged Jainism. One of the Badami Cave temples is dedicated to the Jain faith. Jain temples were also erected in the Aihole complex, the temple at Maguti being one such example. Ravikirti, the court poet of PulakeshinII was a Jain. Queen Vinayavati consecrated a temple for the Trimurti ("Hindu trinity") at Badami. Sculptures of the Trimurti, Harihara (half Vishnu, half Shiva) and Ardhanarishwara (half Shiva, half woman) provide ample evidence of their tolerance. Buddhism was on a decline, having made its ingress into Southeast Asia. This is confirmed by the writings of Hiuen-Tsiang. Badami, Aihole, Kurtukoti and Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar in the Gadag district) were primary places of learning.|$|E

25|$|Up {{until the}} early 19th century the parish was only lightly {{populated}} and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> people had an amicable relationship with the landowners.|$|E
25|$|During the Roman period, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> {{island was}} {{connected}} to the continent at low tide. It finally took its current shape around 1500.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> {{city was}} destroyed, {{never to be}} rebuilt, {{about the time of}} the death of the Greco-Bactrian king Eucratides around 145BC.|$|E

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> {{city was}} totally {{abandoned}} between 140 and 120BC following the Yuezhi invasion. There {{is evidence of}} huge fires in all the major buildings of the city.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the band}} which played the Alturas de Simpson, the first danzón; {{it was one}} of Faílde's compositions. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> band made no recordings, and it {{dispersed}} in 1921 after the death of its leader.|$|E
25|$|Bernzy meets a sultry widow, Kay Levitz (Barbara Hershey), {{who owns}} a fancy nightclub. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> mob is muscling in on her due to some {{arrangement}} with her late husband.

25|$|There {{have been}} regular rumours of the band's return, {{and in the}} past some band members have {{answered}} inquiries at the Stupido Twins message boards about returning to music in a reservedly optimistic manner. Like so many other bands, Come Inside have seemingly had both personal and artistic difficulties since the release of Fearless and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> band has split up for good.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of Byzantine rule (4th to 9th century) and a {{probable}} sack by the Vandals, the islands were invaded by the Aghlabids in AD 870. The fate of the population after the Arab invasion is unclear but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> islands may have been completely depopulated and were {{likely to have been}} repopulated {{in the beginning of the}} second millennium by settlers from Arab-ruled Sicily who spoke Siculo-Arabic.|$|E
25|$|The major {{literary}} {{output of}} the century was {{in the form of}} local plays composed for the art of kathakali, the dance dramas of Kerala also known as Attakkatha. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> Gitagovinda of Jayadeva provided a model for this type of literary composition. The verses in Sanskrit narrate the story and the dialogue is composed in imitation of songs in the Gitagovinda, set to music in appropriate ragas in the classical Karnataka style.|$|E

25|$|Much {{research}} has been done on elucidating the phylogeny of the ground beetles and adjusting systematics and taxonomy accordingly. While no completely firm consensus exists, a few points are generally accepted: As <b>it</b> <b>seems,</b> <b>the</b> ground beetles consist of a number of more basal lineages and the extremely diverse Harpalinae which contain over half the described species and into which several formerly independent families had to be subsumed.|$|E
25|$|Among other things, the {{observations}} demonstrate actual hunting behaviors of adult Architeuthis, a subject on which {{there had been}} much speculation. The photographs showed an aggressive hunting pattern by the baited squid, leading to it impaling a tentacle on the bait ball's hooks. This may disprove {{the theory that the}} giant squid is a drifter which eats whatever floats by, rarely moving so as to conserve energy. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> species has a much more aggressive feeding technique.|$|E
25|$|The cave {{is named}} after Captain A. Gorham of the 2nd Battalion Royal Munster Fusiliers who {{discovered}} it in 1907, when opening a fissure {{at the rear of}} a sea cavern. Gorham inscribed his name and the date of his discovery in lamp-black {{on the wall of the}} cave, which has borne his name ever since. After this initial discovery, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>the</b> cave was forgotten—at least at an official level—as Gibraltarian historian and potholer George Palao recalls an inscription on the cave wall that read J. J. Davies 1943.|$|E
