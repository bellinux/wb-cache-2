25|$|Researchers at the United States Department of Agriculture have {{investigated}} whether hydrogenation {{can be achieved}} without the side effect of trans <b>fat</b> <b>production.</b> They varied the pressure under which the chemical reaction was conducted— applying 1400kPa (200psi) of pressure to soybean oil in a 2-liter vessel while heating it to between 140°C and 170°C. The standard 140kPa (20psi) process of hydrogenation produces a product of about 40% trans fatty acid by weight, compared to about 17% using the high-pressure method. Blended with unhydrogenated liquid soybean oil, the high-pressure-processed oil produced margarine containing 5 to 6% trans fat. Based on current U.S. labeling requirements (see below), the manufacturer could claim the product was free of trans fat. The level of trans fat may also be altered by modification of the temperature {{and the length of}} time during hydrogenation.|$|E

Combined with in vitro evidence, it appears that Taf7l is capable of initiating brown fat (the so-called healthy <b>fat)</b> <b>production.</b> Additionally, they found that together with PPARgamma, Taf7l likely can regulate the binding of the TFIID/RNA Polymerase II (RNAP II) complex. Specifically, the presence of Taf7l may alter chromatin looping and thus the association of distal enhancer sequences to BAT specific gene promoters, like Cidea and Scd1.|$|E

50|$|Twelve {{percent of}} all {{infertility}} cases {{are a result of}} a woman either being underweight or overweight. Fat cells produce estrogen, in addition to the primary sex organs. Too much body <b>fat</b> causes <b>production</b> of too much estrogen and the body begins to react as if it is on birth control, limiting the odds of getting pregnant. Too little body <b>fat</b> causes insufficient <b>production</b> of estrogen and disruption of the menstrual cycle. Both under and overweight women have irregular cycles in which ovulation does not occur or is inadequate. Proper nutrition in early life is also a major factor for later fertility.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{potentials}} (pedigree-estimated breeding value) {{for milk}} and for fat were compared in cows grouped according to subclinical stage of bovine leukemia virus infection. Genetic potential for milk production was significantly greater in seropositive cows with persistent lymphocytosis (622 +/- 72 kg) and in seropositive hematologically normal cows (554 +/- 34 34 kg) than in seronegative herdmates (418 +/- 53 kg). When 305 -day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent {{milk production records}} for the current lactation were adjusted for genetic potential, bovine leukemia virus-infected cows that were hematologically normal had significantly greater milk production than did seronegative herdmates, suggesting that early bovine leukemia virus infection was positively associated with milk yield. Genetic potential for <b>fat</b> <b>production</b> was significantly greater for cows with persistent lymphocytosis (21 +/- 2 kg) than for other seropositive (16 +/- 1 kg) and seronegative herdmates (13 +/- 2 kg); however, 305 -day twice-daily-milking mature equivalent <b>fat</b> <b>production</b> for the current lactation was not significantly different between the groups. Thus, cows with persistent lymphocytosis did not produce fat according to their genetic potential. As an apparent consequence of tendencies for greater milk yield and less <b>fat</b> <b>production,</b> milk fat percentage was significantly reduced in cows with persistent lymphocytosis (3. 33 +/- 0. 09 %) and other seropositive cows (3. 48 +/- 0. 05 %) relative to seronegative herdmates (3. 67 +/- 0. 07 %).
