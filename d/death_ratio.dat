2500|$|With {{the arrival}} of Portuguese {{explorer}} Fernando Po, life changed drastically for the native Bubi. Some sources claim that a full 80% of tribespeople were killed by foreign plagues and fever, brought along with the Europeans aboard their ships. Other sources suggest that the high <b>death</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is a result of}} genocide. For several centuries, Europeans attempted to penetrate the island of Bioko. They, however, were met with staunch resistance, purported savagery, by the Bubi. A German Gold Coast merchant wrote [...] "The island of Fernando Po is inhabited by a savage and cruel sort of people," [...] and that Europeans did not dare to dock upon their beaches, for fear of surprise attacks from natives with dart-weapons. Surprise attacks on explorers and colonists were a common phenomenon during this period—in fact, the Bubi had a system of social rank that depended largely on how many rivals a man had killed through stealth or subterfuge. Because of this, the Bubi remained unconquered by European imperialism until the start of the 20th century. Led by their kings, the Bubi were well aware of the slave trade in the region and, for centuries, were highly guarded of outsiders. This was later reduced when the island leadership began to trade and barter with the Europeans, thus the Europeans were able to infiltrate the island's social and political structures.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the main}} cause of death in women and men in Brazil, but the trends for the <b>death</b> <b>ratios</b> for ischemic heart disease and stroke in women and men remain unknown. METHOD: In this study, the trends for the <b>death</b> <b>ratios</b> among women and men who were over 30 years of age were analyzed from 1980 to 2005. Data were collected for both the Brazilian population and the metropolitan area of São Paulo. Estimates of the population size and data for mortality were then obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics and the Ministry of Health. The risk for death was adjusted using a direct method. RESULTS: Death rates due to cardiovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and stroke have declined in both Brazil and the metropolitan region of São Paulo. A linear regression analysis revealed a similar trend for ischemic heart disease and demonstrated a male/female ratio of 1. 653 ¡ 0. 001 (r = 0. 228; p = 0. 262) in Brazil and 1. 763 ¡ 0. 008 (r = 0. 863; p, 0. 001) in São Paulo. Comparisons between the slopes of the linear regressions showed an increased ischemic heart disease ratio in men/women in São Paulo in comparison to those in Brazil (p, 0. 0001). The linear regression showed an increasing trend for the male/female stroke ratio of 1. 252 ¡ 0. 004 (r = 0. 776; p, 0. 0001) in Brazil and 1. 331 ¡ 0. 006 (r = 0. 580; p = 0. 002) in São Paulo. Comparisons between the regressions for the stroke ratio were similar for men/women in São Paulo compared to Brazil (p = 0. 244). CONCLUSION: We observed an increased trend in the ratio for ischemic heart disease death in men compared to women. Improvements in the control of risk factors and treatments {{for both men and women}} are mandatory to reduce the number of ischemic heart disease-related deaths in Brazil...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{association}} of atrial fibrillation (AF) with sudden {{death and the}} difference in prognostic significance between paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal AF remains unclear in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Our aim {{was to investigate the}} clinical significance of AF, and to assess the prognostic difference between paroxysmal and non-paroxysmal AF in HCM patients. MethodsThe study included 430 HCM patients. Documentation of AF was based on electrocardiograms obtained either after the acute onset of symptoms or fortuitously during routine examination of asymptomatic patients. ResultsAF was detected in 120 patients (27. 9 %). In the patients with AF, syncope and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia were more frequent and the left atrial dimension was larger. Multivariate analysis showed that AF was an independent determinant of the outcome, including the risk of HCM-related <b>death</b> (adjusted hazard <b>ratio</b> 3. 57, p< 0. 001) and sudden <b>death</b> (adjusted hazard <b>ratio</b> 2. 61, p= 0. 038). When patients with AF were divided into subgroups with paroxysmal AF (n= 75) or non-paroxysmal AF (n= 45), only paroxysmal AF was identified as an independent determinant of the outcome, including the risk of HCM-related <b>death</b> (adjusted hazard <b>ratio</b> 5. 24, p< 0. 001) and sudden <b>death</b> (adjusted hazard <b>ratio</b> 4. 67, p= 0. 002). ConclusionsAF is a common supraventricular arrhythmia in HCM and has an adverse influence on the prognosis. In addition, each type of AF had a different clinical impact, with paroxysmal AF being a significant independent determinant of an adverse outcome, including sudden death...|$|R

The fatality ratio for H5N1 infections would then be calculated as the same number of deaths, but divided by a doubled number for total cases, resulting in a hypothetical <b>death</b> <b>ratio</b> of half the currently reported fatality ratio.

50|$|In {{regards to}} US {{migration}} policy, from a structural functionalist point of view, {{illegal immigration is}} tacitly approved {{by the government and}} businesses despite surges in nativism starting in the 1980s. As the American population declines, the tax base to support social welfare programs such as Medicare and Social Security shrinks as well. Therefore, government welfare programs are dependent on some level to illegal immigrants who pay into the benefits, but will not receive them in their lifetimes. Further, both their legal and illegal children maintain a positive birth to <b>death</b> <b>ratio,</b> with more individuals living in America paying taxes than those dying. Illegal immigrants and their children play a fundamental role in maintaining government revenues. However, with a functionalist interpretation, it is in the government's best interest to keep these populations suppressed. This is where the interest of government and business intersect: If the undocumented workers were to be documented, employers would be forced to increase wages and the states would offer government assistance. With the fear of deportation after a lengthy detainment from the government and cases of harassment, abuse, rape and intimidation by employers, many illegal immigrants remain quiet about their plight. The second generation immigrants typically display reactive ethnic identities in response to the suppression and abuse their parents faced, further straining already strained race relations in America.|$|E

5000|$|On the mainland, {{prolonged}} conflict {{followed the}} frontier of European settlement. In 1834, John Dunmore Lang wrote: [...] "There is black blood at this moment on the hands of individuals of good repute in the colony of New South Wales of which all the waters of New Holland would be insufficient to wash out the indelible stains." [...] In 1838, twenty eight Aboriginal people were killed at the Myall Creek massacre; seven of the convict settlers responsible, six white men and one African man, were tried, convicted and hung for the murders. Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers, such as the Noongar of south-western Australia, led by Yagan, {{who was killed in}} 1833. The Kalkadoon of Queensland also resisted the settlers, and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884. There was a massacre at Coniston in the Northern Territory in 1928. Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions. The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate, with a figure of around 10,000 - 20,000 deaths being advanced by historians such as Henry Reynolds. However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised {{due to the fact that}} only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country-wide white-black <b>death</b> <b>ratio</b> in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths. Nevertheless, deadly infectious diseases like smallpox, influenza and tuberculosis were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths. Smallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population. Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 white people were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence. By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{compare the}} hazards of {{cigarette}} smoking in men who formed their habits at different periods, {{and the extent of}} the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at different ages. DESIGN: Prospective study that has continued from 1951 to 2001. SETTING: United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 34 439 male British doctors. Information about their smoking habits was obtained in 1951, and periodically thereafter; cause specific mortality was monitored for 50 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Overall mortality by smoking habit, considering separately men born in different periods. RESULTS: The excess mortality associated with smoking chiefly involved vascular, neoplastic, and respiratory diseases that can be caused by smoking. Men born in 1900 - 1930 who smoked only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about 10 years younger than lifelong non-smokers. Cessation at age 60, 50, 40, or 30 years gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10 years of life expectancy. The excess mortality associated with cigarette smoking was less for men born in the 19 th century and was greatest for men born in the 1920 s. The cigarette smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of dying in middle age (35 - 69) were 42 % nu 24 % (a twofold <b>death</b> rate <b>ratio)</b> for those born in 1900 - 1909, but were 43 % nu 15 % (a threefold <b>death</b> rate <b>ratio)</b> for those born in the 1920 s. At older ages, the cigarette smoker versus non-smoker probabilities of surviving from age 70 to 90 were 10 % nu 12 % at the death rates of the 1950 s (that is, among men born around the 1870 s) but were 7 % nu 33 % (again a threefold <b>death</b> rate <b>ratio)</b> at the <b>death</b> rates of the 1990 s (that is, among men born around the 1910 s). CONCLUSION: A substantial progressive decrease in the mortality rates among non-smokers over the past half century (due to prevention and improved treatment of disease) has been wholly outweighed, among cigarette smokers, by a progressive increase in the smoker nu non-smoker <b>death</b> rate <b>ratio</b> due to earlier and more intensive use of cigarettes. Among the men born around 1920, prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled age specific mortality rates, but cessation at age 50 halved the hazard, and cessation at age 30 avoided almost all of it...|$|R

Design: Hospital morbidity data, mortality statistics, and meteorological data were modelled using time series techniques to determine seasonality of coronary deaths. Data were also analysed to deter-mine whether {{there was an increase}} in deaths before or after the Christmas and New Year holidays. Results: A clear seasonality of coronary deaths was shown, with a peak in July. A mean of 2. 8 excess coronary deaths per 100 deaths was estimated to occur from June to August each year, with a mean annual excess of 224 winter deaths a year. Mortality data did not show an increase in coronary <b>death</b> <b>ratios</b> before (p = 0. 626) or after (p = 0. 813) the Christmas and New Year holidays in December. Conclusions: There is a higher incidence of coronary deaths in winter, which may reflect winter res-piratory infections, the direct effect of cold, seasonal changes in lipid concentration, and other factors associated with winter. Hospitals should have contingency plans during the winter months to manage larger numbers of cardiac admissions...|$|R

At present, there are no reliable markers from which to accurately predict how much an individual drug has redistributed. Knowledge of antemortem factors {{is essential for the}} interpretation of the effects of any measured drug or toxin. Keywords: postmortem drugs, drug redistributio...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This study {{demonstrates}} serious under-ascertainment {{of maternal}} mortality through death certificate reporting alone, and presents selected statistics by {{cause of death}} and demographic groups based on an enhanced surveillance method. Methods: All death records for women ages 10 - 50 were matched to live birth and fetal death files to identify deaths that occurred within one year after a delivery. Deaths reported as having an underlying or contributing cause of death related to pregnancy were also identified. Hospital discharge data were examined to identify additional deaths with a pregnancy-related discharge diagnosis. All of this information was then reviewed by a maternal-fetal medicine specialist to determine the role that pregnancy played in each death. Results: Nearly twice as many pregnancy-related deaths are identified from the enhanced surveillance as from death certificates alone. Older women, African-American women, and women of lower educational attainment have substantially higher pregnancy-related <b>death</b> <b>ratios.</b> Homicide and suicide are major causes of death to women during pregnancy and after delivery. Conclusions: Pregnancy-related mortality is seriously underestimated from death certificates alone. Enhanced surveillance significantly increases ascertainment of maternal deaths from all causes. This information helps improve {{our understanding of the}} causes and public health impact of pregnancyrelated mortality, and provides a more realistic picture of our progress toward the Healthy People 2010 goal for this indicator...|$|R
