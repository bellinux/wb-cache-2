5|$|From Thirlspot two routes lead up Helvellyn. The old pony route took a {{very safe}} and steady route {{for the benefit of}} early visitors, who took horses and a guide from the inn. The route {{traverses}} the flank of White Side to join the ridge at the col just below Lower Man. The other route, known as the White Stones Route, originally marked by stones painted white, crosses the <b>fellside</b> at a lower level and fords Helvellyn Gill to join the path from Swirls.|$|E
5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up the hillside, a self-acting incline to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the <b>fellside.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{possible}} routes {{begin at}} Wythburn church. A bridleway winds up the <b>fellside,</b> over Comb Crags and traverses {{the slopes of}} Nethermost Pike to arrive on the ridge at Swallow Scarth, the col just below Helvellyn. Other routes from Wythburn follow Comb Gill or Whelpside Gill, or Middle Tongue between these two gills. The shortest route of all follows the gill past the old lead mine, perhaps better used as a descent. Wainwright warned walkers with weak ankles to avoid it.|$|E
25|$|Mining, {{particularly}} of copper, lead (often associated with quantities of silver), baryte, graphite and slate, was historically a major Lakeland industry, {{mainly from the}} 16th to 19th centuries. Coppiced woodland was used extensively to provide charcoal for smelting. Some mining still takes place today; for example, slate mining continues at the Honister Mines, {{at the top of}} Honister Pass. Abandoned mine workings can be found on <b>fellsides</b> throughout the district. The locally mined graphite {{led to the development of}} the pencil industry, especially around Keswick.|$|R
2500|$|A {{circuit of}} high fells {{surrounds}} {{the head of}} Mardale, beginning at High Raise {{in the north and}} curving around over High Street and Harter Fell to Branstree and Selside Pike in the south. As the ridge is travelled in this direction, the countryside changes from crag and scree [...] to more rounded <b>fellsides</b> clothed with grass. Branstree is the first fell moving east where grass prevails, and a Pennine character begins to take over from Lakeland. From many directions the fell appears as a smooth domed hill with a wide top.|$|R
60|$|There was no {{wind and}} the frost was not keen. Gray clouds trailed across the sky that was touched with yellow in the west, and soft, elusive lights played about the dale. Patches {{of snow on the}} <b>fellsides</b> gleamed and faded; mossy belts glowed vivid green, red berries in the hedgerows shone among {{withered}} leaves and fern, and then the light passed on and left the valley dim. Something in its calm beauty reacted on the girl and made her thoughtful. She loved the dale and felt that she might be happy there {{if it were not for}} her father's poverty and overbearing temperament.|$|R
5|$|Grisedale Tarn is the {{starting}} point for the south ridge of Helvellyn, and may be reached from Grasmere or Patterdale, or from Dunmail Raise by a path alongside Raise Beck. Above the tarn the old pony track zigzags up the <b>fellside,</b> and takes a safe but unexciting route well away from crags {{on the side of the}} ridge, and avoiding all the intermediate tops. In suitable weather a more interesting and scenic route is to follow the edge of the crags as closely as possible, over the tops of Dollywagon Pike, High Crag and Nethermost Pike.|$|E
5|$|Brodie {{was born}} in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear {{and grew up in}} the town as a Sunderland supporter. He {{attended}} Whickham School and played football for the Gateshead district team as a teenager. He later played youth football with Whickham <b>Fellside</b> Juniors from the age of 10 to 16, Redheugh Boys Club, scoring six goals in a 14–2 victory over Consett Badgers in March 2004, and the Durham County under-18 team, featuring in the FA County Youth Cup in November. Brodie started his senior career in 2004 after making substitute appearances for Whickham in the semi-professional Northern League Division Two before playing for them permanently aged 17. He scored a hat-trick for Whickham in a 5–3 victory over Marske United in November 2005. He scored 21 league goals in 35 appearances for Whickham and was their top scorer in the 2005–06 season.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fellside</b> Power Station is a 168 MWe CHP {{gas-fired}} {{power station}} near the Sellafield site, which it supplies with steam and heat. It is run as <b>Fellside</b> Heat and Power Ltd, is wholly owned by Sellafield Ltd and is operated & managed by PX Ltd. It {{was built in}} 1993, being originally equally owned by BNFL and Scottish Hydro Electric (which became Scottish and Southern Energy in December 1998). The station uses three General Electric Frame 6001B gas turbines, with power entering the National Grid via a 132kV transformer. The turbines in <b>Fellside</b> Power Station are natural gas fired and are also able to run on distillate (diesel) fuel. BNFL bought SSE's 50% share in January 2002.|$|E
2500|$|The higher <b>fellsides</b> {{are also}} rich in mineral {{deposits}} and were formerly mined extensively. [...] A typical site situated {{just above the}} Middle Tongue Beck at NY 692/321 {{is known as the}} New Greuve Shop and seems to have yielded a variety of minerals ranging from coal to lead. This level is of particular interest as a large rock above the entrance has been inscribed with the initials of some of the miners. Some of these belong to families whose descendants still live in Milburn. [...] The largest mine in the area, Silver Band, is outside Milburn Parish but was a major source of employment in the village. [...] Miners would walk to work—a journey taking about two hours in each direction and involving a climb from Milburn of around 800 metres.|$|R
2500|$|The {{area was}} badly {{affected}} by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease across the United Kingdom in 2001. The outbreak started in Surrey in February, but had spread to Cumbria by end of March. Thousands of sheep, include the native Herdwicks which graze on the <b>fellsides</b> across the district, were destroyed. In replacing the sheep, one problem to overcome was {{that many of the}} lost sheep were heafed, that is, they knew their part of the unfenced fell and did not stray, with this knowledge being passed between generations. With all the sheep lost at once, this knowledge has to be relearnt and some of the fells have had discreet electric fences strung across them for a period of five years, to allow the sheep to [...] "re-heaf". At the time of the outbreak, worries existed about the future of certain species of sheep such as Ryeland and Herdwick in the district, however these fears have been allayed and sheep now occupy the district in abundance.|$|R
2500|$|Still {{further to}} the north, the steep <b>fellsides</b> above the Inlier are unenclosed and grazed {{exclusively}} by sheep. In the past this would perhaps be best described as [...] "ranching" [...] as, in the summer the sheep would range freely {{over the top of}} the Pennine escarpment and down into Teesdale. [...] Regular [...] "gathers" [...] would be held to round them up for dipping and shearing. [...] Much has changed in this respect, however, since the catastrophic foot-and-mouth outbreak of 2001. The [...] "hefted" [...] herds which had previously acquired a useful territorial instinct were all lost and are now only slowly being replaced. [...] The old [...] "commoner" [...] system, whereby grazing (and other) rights were granted exclusively to individuals, has also been bought out by English Nature, concerned about the effect of over-grazing. Sheep numbers are now closely controlled. [...] English Nature is also attempting to develop the diversity of the fell side habitat and has planted selected areas with hardy indigenous species such as juniper. A particular aim is to re-introduce the black grouse to the area.|$|R
25|$|Eastern {{approaches}} {{begin on}} the A591 at Rough How Bridge, making a start along the secluded valley of Shoulthwaite before {{heading up the}} <b>fellside</b> {{in the vicinity of}} Mere Gill.|$|E
25|$|From {{the village}} of Wythop Mill, the road between Ling Fell and Sale Fell {{provides}} a starting point, branching off up the <b>fellside</b> at the gate of Kelswick Farm.|$|E
25|$|Between Stone Arthur and Heron Pike is {{the little}} valley of Greenhead Gill. This bears {{evidence}} of former mining activities, beginning at around 600ft above sea level with a trial. Further up the <b>fellside</b> are the remains of Grasmere Lead Mine. This was operated by the Mines Royal between 1564 and 1573 {{and there are several}} levels and shafts around the 1,000ft contour.|$|E
5000|$|South of the lake, {{the only}} {{habitation}} is the occasional hill farm around Steel End. From {{the south end}} of the lake to the dam, the reservoir completely covers the floor of a narrow steep-sided valley whose sides have extensive and predominantly coniferous forestry plantations, without dwellings or settlements. During periods of dry weather the water level drops revealing a wide band of bare exposed rock. According to the Lake District National Park Authority:If the damming of the valley and the enlargement of two small lakes to form a large reservoir was landscape change on a large scale, so was the afforestation of nearly 800 hectares of land to prevent erosion, protect water quality and to profit from harvested timber. It is regarded by many as the greater crime. The large blocks of non-indigenous conifers and the scar left by draw-down of the reservoir in dry periods are undoubtedly elements which detract from Thirlmere’s natural beauty. However, the valley still has the drama of its soaring <b>fellsides,</b> a large body of water and north of the reservoir the rural charm of St John’s in the Vale. It is stunning scenery.|$|R
25|$|The north eastern {{flanks of}} Burnbank Fell are much steeper, with some crags {{on the upper}} slopes {{overlooking}} Loweswater. Lower down the <b>fellside</b> is Holme Wood, an attractive background to views across the lake. Holme Beck runs down through the trees, forming the boundary between Burnbank Fell and Blake Fell to the south. High up in the woods is Holme Force, an attractive parallel pair of waterfalls.|$|E
25|$|There {{was small}} scale mining {{activity}} {{in the late nineteenth}} century beneath Low Wax Knott, adjacent to the Scarth Gap path. Two men worked the operation, living on the <b>fellside</b> in a hut. A search was organised after their regular visits to the local hostelry abruptly ceased, and one was found dead in a pool at Warnscale. It was suspected that the other had killed him.|$|E
25|$|From the Pheasant Inn at the {{northern}} end of the lake, a side road runs west towards Routenbeck and Wythop Mill. A footpath branches off left before St Margaret's Church and makes up the <b>fellside,</b> joining a terrace path higher up. There is now a choice, either making for the western end of the summit ridge or joining it to the east near the forest fence.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} of mining in Caiston Glen, with {{the mouth of a}} level opening about halfway up the beck. This was an unsuccessful trial for lead and extends about 80ft into the <b>fellside.</b> There is a further small working nearby. There are also the remains of a trial for copper on the eastern flank of Middle Dodd, a 120ft level being driven into the fell from close to the modern road.|$|E
25|$|At {{the foot}} of the Dovedale face and {{continuing}} round above Brothers Water is Low Wood. This is an expanse of native woodland. Within the woodland are the remains of Hartsop Hall Mine. This was a lead mine operating at least {{as far back as the}} 17th century and closing in 1942. Four levels were driven northward into the <b>fellside</b> of Hartsop above How, but the production of ore was never significant.|$|E
25|$|From Ullister Hill to Tarbarrel Moss {{the ridge}} line and both flanks fall within Thornthwaite Forest. All {{sides of the}} lower slopes of Brown How also form part of the Forestry Commission holdings. Depending on the stage in the {{planting}} cycle {{large parts of the}} <b>fellside</b> will therefore be clad in conifers at any one time. Access problems have now been resolved and the landowner welcomes walkers, many marked trails being available through the woodland.|$|E
25|$|Piers Gill runs {{below the}} eastern crags of Lingmell {{in a deep}} ravine, {{one of the finest}} in the District. Averaging about 30ft, but much deeper in places, it pursues an L-shaped course down the <b>fellside</b> before {{emerging}} from its cutting to merge with Greta Gill. The scenery of Piers Gill and Lingmell from the Corridor Route ascent of Scafell Pike is remarkable and a faint path follows the eastern bank of the gill giving even more intimate views. The ravine appears to offer access at either end, but ordinary walkers should on no account attempt to follow it. Crossings of the ravine should also be considered impossible for the average hiker.|$|E
25|$|Little Langdale Tarn {{was several}} times larger {{at the end}} of the last ice age, the lost area having become filled with {{sediment}} and resulted in the flat farmland beside the current lake. The catchment area is a sheepfarm of rough grassland and sphagnum bog in the valley bottom and surrounding <b>fellside.</b> Sediment cores taken at the lake show a top layer of brown organic sediment followed by a grey coloured minerogenic layer rich in copper from the mining activities at Greenburn. There is an obvious increase in the sediment accumulation rate with time, the major source being peat pipes and sheep grazing close to Wrynose Beck, a tributary of the Brathay.|$|E
25|$|Lord's Seat {{gives birth}} {{to a number of}} streams which, {{although}} departing in different directions, all ultimately join the River Derwent. Aiken Beck and its many tributaries drain the south western flanks, most of which are clad in conifers. Hagg Beck, the main feeder of Beck Wythop, begins a little {{to the north of the}} summit. This runs across open <b>fellside</b> at first, only entering the trees at around the 1,100ft contour. Beckstones Gill flows to Bassenthwaite to the south of Barf, while an unnamed stream does the same to the north. All of the eastern flanks of the range are forested, except for the scree-ridden face of Barf between these two watercourses.|$|E
25|$|Above {{the wooded}} valley of Eskdale {{there is a}} skirt of crags before the open moor is reached. Over this edge tumble the waterfalls of Stanley Force and Birker Force, the former easily reached by made paths from the road. The farmers of Eskdale once {{extracted}} peat from the plateau {{and the remains of}} graded paths and peat huts can still be found on the <b>fellside.</b> On this flank the remains of Gate Gill iron mine can also be found. Haematite was won from a number of levels here in the 1880s. The Duddon flanks have shallower gradients, divided by dry stone walls into long strips of pasture land. This rough grazing supports a series of farms along the valley between Ulpha and Seathwaite.|$|E
500|$|Swirls is {{the start}} of the most direct route to the top of Helvellyn, [...] "the modern {{pedestrian}} highway" [...] which has been paved where necessary. It zigzags up the <b>fellside</b> above Helvellyn Gill, over Browncove Crags and joins the main ridge at Lower Man.|$|E
500|$|From Glenridding {{a similar}} long but safe and easy walk (...) [...] follows Greenside Road, past the old lead mine and towards Keppel Cove. This track, another old pony track, then zigzags up the <b>fellside</b> {{to join the}} main ridge path at the col between Raise and White Side.|$|E
500|$|U-43s {{fourth and}} final success on her fourth patrol {{took place on the}} morning of 17 July when she sank the 3,509-ton British {{merchant}} ship <b>Fellside,</b> a straggler from convoy OA-184, about [...] north-west of Bloody Foreland (Cnoc Fola), Donegal. The U-boat's first torpedo passed under the vessel, but the second struck the ship and caused her to sink within five minutes. Twelve of the crew were killed, 21 survivors were rescued. U-43 arrived back at Wilhelmshaven on 22 July after 71 days at sea.|$|E
2500|$|A 16th century mine, Launchy Gill Level, {{was driven}} [...] into the <b>fellside</b> below White Crags on the Thirlmere {{side of the}} fell. A {{scramble}} is required just to reach {{the mouth of the}} level.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{evidence}} of mining in Caiston Glen, with {{the mouth of a}} level opening about halfway up the beck. This was an unsuccessful trial for lead and extends about 80ft into the <b>fellside.</b> There is a further small working nearby. According to Wainwright [...] High Hartsop Dodd was briefly in the news in 1948 owing to efforts to save two terriers trapped in a hole on the Caiston flank.|$|E
2500|$|Alfred Wainwright {{described}} the 'Gable Girdle', a circuit around the fell at mid height. This links {{a number of}} existing paths, namely {{the north and south}} traverses, Styhead Pass, Aaron Slack and Moses Trod. The south traverse climbs westward from Sty Head and provides access to the Napes and Kern Knotts for rock climbers. The route is rough but allows the ordinary hillwalker to view Napes Needle, Sphinx Rock and many of the famous climbing locations. The north traverse similarly runs beneath Gable Crag with more excellent rock scenery, arriving ultimately at Windy Gap. In the west the two traverses are joined by a section of Moses Trod, running up the southern side of Beck Head. [...] "Moses" [...] was a possibly apocryphal trader-cum-smuggler, based at Honister Quarry. His route contoured the <b>fellside</b> from there to provide access to Wasdale markets for his illicit whisky. Moses Trod would also function as a route with minimal uphill sections for transporting slate from the quarry to the coast. Aaron Slack by contrast does anything but contour the <b>fellside,</b> but provides a fast [...] down from Windy Gap to Sty Head.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 November 1938 {{the company}} was renamed American President Lines. [...] In 1940 President van Buren {{was taken out of}} layup and {{returned}} to service but as a freighter. [...] She was now ‘’President Fillmore’’, a name previously held by a 1903-built ship. [...] While the new President Fillmore resumed civilian cargo service, the older ship was sold and renamed SS Panamanian. [...] The name switch may have been deliberate to cloud the role of the older vessel. [...] This role was revealed by the personal recollection of a British merchant seaman whose ship, the SS <b>Fellside,</b> had been sunk by torpedo: ...|$|E
2500|$|Milburn is a {{small village}} and civil parish in the Eden {{district}} of Cumbria, England. It {{is located on the}} northern side of the Eden Valley, about [...] east of Penrith. It lies beneath Cross Fell, the highest point of the Pennines and is one of a chain of villages following the [...] contour of the escarpment. The <b>fellside</b> forms part of the North Pennines Area of Natural Beauty which in 2003 was awarded the status of UNESCO European Geopark and includes the Moorhouse Upper Teesdale National Nature Reserve. The parish includes the outlying hamlets of Gullom Holme and Milburn Grange, respectively [...] and [...] from Milburn village centre.|$|E
2500|$|A further tarn serving Greenside Mine {{was created}} in Sticks Gill (East) by the {{construction}} of a stone barrage. Called Top Dam, this was still in existence in the 1950s but is now a dry bed. There are other signs of mining activity on the Stang ridge, in particular the stone smelter flue. Prominently marked 'chimney' on Ordnance Survey maps, the flue ran over half a mile up the <b>fellside</b> to a stone chimney at about [...] There are also the remains of a number of leats, artificial channels to divert streams to the thirsty mine. Stang now carries the marks of a more modern industry, with the Lake District's only permanent ski-tow installed on the northern slope. There is some rock outcropping on the eastern slopes of Raise, particularly at Stang End above the Glenridding Beck.|$|E
6000|$|... "The night air's bracing {{among the}} moors and I {{like to hear}} the whaups crying round the house," [...] he said to Whitney. [...] "There's a small hotel, built right on the <b>fellside,</b> and we should get there in an hour." ...|$|E
