40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to investigate and compare the human responses to two load carriage tasks performed with three different load masses and on three different gradients. The task of carrying hydrogel in one hand was observed in a silviculture industry and crude physiological and perceptual responses were measured. This task was simulated in a laboratory setting together with a suggested intervention of backpack carriage. Eighteen conditions were established which consisted of the two modes of carriage and a combination of three load masses (9 kg, 12 kg and 15 kg) and three gradients (5 %, 10 % and 15 %). Twenty eight Rhodes University female students comprised the sample and the experimental procedures were conducted on a Quinton treadmill. Each participant was required to complete nine of the eighteen conditions which were each four minutes in duration. Postural changes were assessed using lateral and posterior digital images taken at the second and fourth minute and compression and shearing forces were estimated with the ErgolmagerTM Physiological responses (heart rate, ventilation and metabolic responses) were measured continuously with the Quark b² and perceptual responses ('central' and 'local' RPE) were measured every minute during the experimentation and body discomfort was rated at the completion of each condition. Overall responses revealed that <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> (146 bt. min⁻¹, 25. 09 mIO₂. kg-l. min⁻¹) was generally found to be more physiologically stressful than backpack carriage (130 bt. min⁻¹, 22. 15 mIO₂. kg⁻¹. min⁻¹) independent of load mass and gradient. Physiological responses were higher (113 bt. min- 1 to 174 bt. min⁻¹) in responses to increasing gradient as opposed to increasing load mass (104 bt. min- 1 to 153 bt. min⁻¹) for both backpack and <b>hand</b> <b>carriage.</b> Categorisation using the guidelines of Sanders and McCormick (1993) allowed for classification of conditions, with respect to physiological responses, into 'moderate', 'heavy' and 'very heavy' stress. For almost all of the physiological responses the majority of conditions which were classified as 'moderate' were backpack carriage conditions and the conditions classified as 'very heavy' were mostly <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> conditions. In terms of postural responses <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> resulted in more strain and greater compression and shearing forces on the spine. In terms of the compression forces increasing gradient had a greater affect on backpack carriage (681 N to 935 N) compared to <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> (570 N to 793 N). In contrast, increasing load mass had a larger affect on <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> postures and compression forces (751 N to 935 N) in comparison to backpack carriage (723 N to 780 N). Shearing forces were found to be worse in <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> conditions overall. Although participants generally underrated perceived exertion in relation to cardiorespiratory responses, these perceptions revealed that backpack carriage, with a mean 'central' RPE of 12 compared to 11 for <b>hand</b> <b>carriage,</b> was somewhat preferred to <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> and that increasing gradient was perceived to be marginally more straining than increasing load mass.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{a simple}} mathematical model to describe the spread of Streptococcus pneumoniae. We suppose that the transmission of the bacterium is determined by multi-locus sequence type. The model includes vaccination and is designed to examine {{what happens in a}} vaccinated population if MLSTs can exist as both vaccine and non vaccine serotypes with capsular switching possible from the former to the latter. We start off with a discussion of Streptococcus pneumoniae and a review of previous work. We propose a {{simple mathematical model}} with two sequence types and then perform an equilibrium and (global) stability analysis on the model. We show that in general there are only three equilibria, the carriage-free equilibrium and two carriage equilibria. If the effective reproduction number [R_e] is {{less than or equal to}} one, then the carriage will die out. If [R_e] > 1, then the carriage will tend to the carriage equilibrium corresponding to the multi-locus sequence type with the largest transmission parameter. In the case where both multi-locus sequence types have the same transmission parameter then there is a line of <b>carriage</b> equilibria. <b>Provided</b> <b>that</b> <b>carriage</b> is initially present then as time progresses the carriage will approach a point on this line. The results generalize to many competing sequence types. Simulations with realistic parameter values confirm the analytical results...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of hexachlorophane disinfection on the bacterial hand flora of hospital personnel has been examined. Hexachlorophane effectively reduced {{the total number}} of bacteria and the staphylococcal carriage. Gram-negative bacilli were isolated from 18 · 8 % of the personnel, and 13 % of the carriers continued to carry Gram-negative bacilli for more than six months. The carrier rate was significantly higher among those using hexachlorophane detergents (20 · 8 %) than among those using plain soap (14 · 1 %). Prolonged <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of Gram-negative bacilli was often associated with skin irritation, especially of the nailfolds. <b>Hand</b> <b>carriage</b> may be an important source of Gram-negative infections in hospital, and the increase in these infections may partly be due to extensive use of hexachlorophane preparations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundRespiratory {{pathogens}} from CF {{patients can}} contaminate inpatient settings, {{which may be}} associated with increased risk of patient-to-patient transmission. Few data are available that assess the rate of bacterial contamination of outpatient settings. We determined the frequency of contamination of CF clinics and the effectiveness of alcohol-based disinfectants in reducing <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of bacterial pathogens. MethodsWe conducted a point prevalence survey and before–after trial in outpatient clinics at 7 CF centers. The study examined CF patients with positive respiratory cultures for Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Stenotrophomonas or Burkholderia species. <b>Hand</b> <b>carriage</b> and environmental contamination with respiratory pathogens were assessed during clinic visits (Part I) and the effectiveness of hand hygiene performed by CF patients (Part II) was determined using molecular typing of recovered isolates. ResultsIn Part I (n= 97), the contamination rate was 13. 6 %. Pseudomonas and S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, were cultured from patients' hands (7 %), the exam room air (8 %), and less commonly, environmental surfaces (1 %). In Part II (n= 100), the <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> rate of pathogens was 13. 5 % and 4 participants without initial detection of pathogens had hand contamination when recultured {{at the end of the}} clinic visit. ConclusionsRespiratory pathogens from CF patients can contaminate their hands and the clinic environment, but the actual risk of patient-to-patient transmission in the outpatient setting remains difficult to quantify. These findings support several recommendations CF infection control recommendations including hand hygiene for staff and patients, contact precautions for certain pathogens, and disinfecting equipment and surfaces touched by patients and staff...|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} culture technique (hand {{washed in}} a glove containing broth for 30 s) {{was used to}} determine the frequency of <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of aerobic Gram-negative rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. Overall, 31 % of health care workers carried aerobic Gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59 % of control subjects (P < 0 · 001). Enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40 % of the isolates, and other Enterobacter spp. 7 %. Other organisms included Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21 %, Serratia spp. 11 %, Klebsiella spp. 10 %, Moraxella spp. 3 %, Pseudomonas spp. 3 %, Proteus spp. 1 · 5 %, Escherichia coli 1 %; Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas sp. and an isolate that was not speciated accounted for 0 · 5 % each. We conclude that endemic <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects.

Objective: To study nasal and <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of bacteria in different groups of persons in a teaching hospital. Study Design: Prospective study. Setting: Surgical wards of J. N. Medical College Hospi­tal, A. M. U., Aligarh. Participants: Randomly selected persons from differ­ent groups of hospital staff (doctors, nurses, ward and OT assistants), visitors of patients, patients and medi­cal students. Sample Size: 275 persons. Study Variables: Nasal and <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of S. aureus and gram negative bacilli. Outcome Variables: Percentage of hospital staff show­ing bacterial carriage in their nose or on their hands. Statistical Analysis: By tests of significance. Result: Overall bacterial carriage rate in different cat­egories of hospital staff was found to be 54. 5 %. Doc­tors and paramedical staff had higher bacterial carriage rate as compared to other groups. Though Staphylo­coccus aureus was the commonest organism isolated from both nose and skin, carriage of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas and Klebsiella group of gram-negative bacilli was also observed. Nasal carriage was com­moner than dermal carriage.

Each subject was sampled repeatedly over three to six weeks. The mean number of samples for each group was 25. 2, 23. 2, 19. 8 and 25. 8 respectively. The HD group had more samples positive for aerobic Gram-negative rods than did {{the other two groups}} of health care workers while the control group had more samples positive than any of the three health care groups. Using various typing schemes and the following definition of continuous carriage (the isolation of an organism of the same serotype, pyocin type or biotype from more than two handwash samples) we found that 4 of 11 subjects from whom Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated carried this organism continuously; 2 of 3 carried Pseudomonas aeruginosa continuously and 4 of 5 of the control subjects carried the same biotype of Enterobacter agglomerans continuously. We conclude that continuous <b>hand</b> <b>carriage</b> of aeroic Gram-negative rods is common and, among health care workers, those with hand dermatitis carry Gram-negative rods more frequently and in greater numbers than health care workers without hand dermatitis...|$|R
