50|$|Sakharov {{observed}} that many condensed matter systems {{give rise to}} emergent phenomena that are analogous to general relativity. For example, crystal defects can look like curvature and torsion in an Einstein-Cartan spacetime. This allows one to create a theory of gravity with torsion from a World Crystal model of spacetime in which the lattice spacing is {{of the order of}} a Planck length.Sakharov's idea was to start with an arbitrary background pseudo-Riemannian manifold (in modern treatments, possibly with torsion) and introduce quantum fields (matter) on it but not introduce any <b>gravitational</b> <b>dynamics</b> explicitly. This gives rise to an effective action which to one-loop order contains the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In other words, general relativity arises as an emergent property of matter fields and is not put in by hand. On the other hand, such models typically predict huge cosmological constants.|$|E
50|$|The {{stars and}} {{gas in the}} Milky Way rotate about its center differentially, meaning that the {{rotation}} period varies with location. As is typical for spiral galaxies, the orbital speed of most stars in the Milky Way does not depend strongly on their distance from the center. Away from the central bulge or outer rim, the typical stellar orbital speed is between 210 and 240 km/s mph. Hence the orbital period of the typical star is directly proportional only {{to the length of}} the path traveled. This is unlike the situation within the Solar System, where two-body <b>gravitational</b> <b>dynamics</b> dominate, and different orbits have significantly different velocities associated with them. The rotation curve (shown in the figure) describes this rotation. Toward the center of the Milky Way the orbit speeds are too low, whereas beyond 7 kpcs the speeds are too high to match what would be expected from the universal law of gravitation.|$|E
50|$|Brandt {{notes that}} the physics of {{globular}} clusters {{are similar to those}} of diffusion. Repeated gravitational interchanges between bodies gradually act to equalize kinetic energy, which is proportional to the square of velocity. The net effect, over sufficiently long times, is sorting by mass. The more massive, low-velocity, objects tend to remain near the center of the cluster, while less massive objects are set on more distant trajectories, or expelled from the system entirely. In any case, the cluster gradually expands, while the most massive objects remain relatively close to the center of mass. Given the overwhelming dominance of dark matter in Eridanus II, the <b>gravitational</b> <b>dynamics</b> of the globular cluster must be driven by dark matter. And, if dark matter is mainly a collection of black holes larger than an average star, the sorting effect should cause the cluster to expand to large size and perhaps eventually eject all but the largest stars. Green (2016) has recently expanded on Brandt's equations to allow for a diverse range of black hole masses.|$|E

Equations of this kind are a powerful approach to simulating astrophysical problems. Numerical schemes applied for their solving must provide high-resolution capturing of shocks, prevent spurious oscillations and specify {{the behavior of the}} matter in the neighborhood of small perturbations beyond shock fronts.

The virial theorem can be obtained directly from Lagrange's Identity as applied in classical <b>gravitational</b> <b>dynamics,</b> the original form of which was included in Lagrange's [...] "Essay on the Problem of Three Bodies" [...] published in 1772.

However, the interpretations leading {{to the development of the}} equations were very different, since at the time of development, statistical dynamics had not yet unified the separate studies of thermodynamics and classical dynamics. [...] The theorem was later utilized, popularized, generalized and further developed by James Clerk Maxwell, Lord Rayleigh, Henri Poincaré, Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Enrico Fermi, Paul Ledoux and Eugene Parker. Fritz Zwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to deduce the existence of unseen matter, which is now called dark matter. As another example of its many applications, the virial theorem has been used to derive the Chandrasekhar limit for the stability of white dwarf stars.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{intriguing}} analogy between the <b>gravitational</b> <b>dynamics</b> of the horizons and thermodynamics. In case of general relativity, {{as well as}} for a wider class of Lanczos-Lovelock theories of gravity, it is possible to interpret the field equations near any spherically symmetric horizon as a thermodynamic identity TdS = dE + PdV. We study this approach further and generalize the results to two more generic cases within the context of general relativity: (i) stationary axis-symmetric horizons and (ii) time dependent evolving horizons. In both the cases, the near horizon structure of Einstein equations can be expressed as a thermodynamic identity under the virtual displacement of the horizon. This result demonstrates the fact that the thermodynamic interpretation of <b>gravitational</b> <b>dynamics</b> is not restricted to spherically symmetric or static horizons but is quite generic in nature and indicates a deeper connection between gravity and thermodynamics.
