5|$|An {{area was}} set aside within the <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> athletics, aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground. It {{consisted}} of a stadium opened in 1896; the hope was to provide additional entertainment for visitors to the tower in the winter months. The capacity of the grounds varied, but at one point was as high as 100,000, although attendances rarely, if ever, approached that figure.|$|E
5|$|At dawn, Tanaka {{learned that}} the palace had been invaded. He went there and confronted the rebellious officers, berating them for acting {{contrary}} {{to the spirit of}} the Japanese army. He convinced them to return to their barracks. By 08:00, the rebellion was entirely dismantled, having succeeded in holding the palace <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> much of the night but failing to find the recordings.|$|E
5|$|Bartlemas is a {{conservation}} area that incorporates the remaining buildings of a leper hospital founded by Henry I; {{it includes the}} sports <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> Oriel, Jesus and Lincoln Colleges, along with landscaping for wildlife and small scale urban development.|$|E

5|$|Before the Reformation, the {{extensive}} prohibited degrees of kinship, {{up to the}} fourth degree through consanguinity, meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation. This could later be used as <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, {{although there was no}} divorce as such. After the mid-sixteenth century the prohibited degrees were reduced to those in Leviticus 13: 4–13, which limited them to relationships in the second degree of kinship. Separation from bed and board continued to be allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery, and under the Reformed Kirk divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery or desertion. Scotland {{was one of the first}} countries to allow desertion as legal <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> divorce and, unlike England, where divorce necessitated and act of parliament, divorce cases were initiated relatively far down the social scale.|$|E
5|$|Colt set up {{libraries}} and educational programs within his armories for his employees which were seminal training <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> {{several generations of}} toolmakers and other machinists, who had great influence in other manufacturing efforts of the next half century. Prominent examples included Francis A. Pratt, Amos Whitney, Henry Leland, Edward Bullard, Worcester R. Warner, Charles Brinckerhoff Richards, William Mason and Ambrose Swasey.|$|E

50|$|The {{area has}} many parks, {{including}} Geoff Watt Oval, the major sporting <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> Cricket, and Soccer, and Crawford Park, across {{the other side}} of the highway. This park is a second sporting <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> soccer.|$|R
50|$|Negative {{answers on}} one or even two of these {{questions}} are not <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> immediate rejection of the possible operation. But they are <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> requiring some unusually high entries on the credit side of the ledger.|$|R
50|$|The League itself leased the North Melbourne Cricket <b>Ground</b> <b>for</b> £1,500 during 1965, {{and used}} it junior football, umpire training, school programs, and from June it {{was used as a}} central <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the Essendon District Football League game-of-the-week.|$|R
5|$|Many {{populations of}} moorland birds, {{including}} {{the black and}} red grouse live here, and the country has internationally significant nesting <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> seabirds such as the northern gannet. The golden eagle has become a national icon, and white-tailed eagles and ospreys have recently re-colonised the land. The Scottish crossbill is the only endemic vertebrate species in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Marriages, {{particularly}} {{higher in}} society, were often political {{in nature and}} the subject of complex negotiations over the tocher (dowry). Some mothers took a leading role in negotiating marriages, as Lady Glenorchy did for her children in the 1560s and 1570s, or as matchmakers, finding suitable and compatible partners for others. Before the Reformation, the extensive marriage bars for kinship meant that most noble marriages necessitated a papal dispensation, which could later be used as <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> annulment if the marriage proved politically or personally inconvenient, although there was no divorce as such. Separation from bed and board was allowed in exceptional circumstances, usually adultery. Under the reformed Kirk, divorce was allowed on grounds of adultery, or of desertion.

5|$|Prior {{to modern}} {{settlement}} in villages, the nomadic indigenous peoples of Ethiopia provided easy hunting <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> the bushcrow {{as they left}} loose, dung-covered soil behind as they moved their cattle. This provided a rich abundance of beetle larvae for the bushcrow to feed upon.|$|E
50|$|The Perth Canyon is {{a feeding}} <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> pygmy blue whales, {{especially}} at the rims of the abyss. It is also a training <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> the Royal Australian Navy Submarine Service, stationed at a naval base at nearby Garden Island.|$|R

5|$|Scotland's {{wildlife}} {{is typical}} of the north-west of Europe, although several of the larger mammals such as the lynx, brown bear, wolf, elk and walrus were hunted to extinction in historic times. There are important populations of seals and internationally significant nesting <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> a variety of seabirds such as gannets. The golden eagle is something of a national icon.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts provide {{habitats}} and spawning <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the ocean floor. Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E
5|$|Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as Vernon Bellecourt (White Earth Ojibwe) and Suzan Shown Harjo (Southern Cheyenne-Muscogee Creek), {{argue that}} his {{assertion}} of Native American ancestry without {{the ability to}} prove it might constitute misrepresentation and <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> termination. The University {{has said that it}} does not hire on the basis of ethnicity.|$|E
30|$|Ground {{occupancy}} during {{morning and}} late afternoon probably also relates to dispersal, mating, and oviposition. For example, sexually mature males usually search on the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> ground-feeding females, and females {{must be on}} the <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> oviposition into soil (Stauffer and Whitman 1997).|$|R
50|$|The Centre is an {{important}} refuge and feeding <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> many species of resident birds, {{as well as several}} migratory bird species from Northern Asia. In addition, it is a breeding <b>ground</b> <b>for</b> marine life protected by the Fishery Department of Sabah.|$|R

5|$|The Allies {{had more}} serious <b>grounds</b> <b>for</b> {{complaint}} about the Belgian anti-tank defences along the Dyle line, {{that covered the}} Namur–Perwez gap which was not protected by any natural obstacles.
