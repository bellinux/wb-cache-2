5|$|At 07:53, {{minutes before}} the <b>Israeli</b> attack was to commence, <b>Israeli</b> forces near El-Qantarah became heavily engaged with a brigade {{composing}} the 18th Division's right flank, as Egyptian troops sought to secure the town and its vicinity. Fuad, the division commander supported the brigade with two companies of T-62 tanks. To prevent <b>Israeli</b> forces in the area from being outflanked, Gonen ordered Nir to remain near El-Qantarah to help contain the Egyptian attack. This left Adan with only 50 tanks under Amir's command {{to carry out the}} attack.|$|E
5|$|At 5:30AM on 21 March, the <b>Israeli</b> forces {{attacked}} simultaneously on {{the three}} bridges. Combat engineers built a pontoon bridge {{in the north and}} the troops crossed the river.

5|$|At 6:30AM, <b>Israeli</b> {{helicopters}} started landing {{the bulk}} of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh. An <b>Israeli</b> aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses. When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The <b>Israeli</b> Air Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, the Jordanians repelled several <b>Israeli</b> assaults.|$|E
5000|$|According to Amos Harel, {{attempts}} by the security forces to bring violent right-wing zealots to justice have suffered from two main problems: investigating <b>Israelis</b> as opposed to Palestinians is subject to more restrictions, and courts {{have proved to be}} lenient. Yesh Din has produced a report, [...] "A Semblance of Law", which found problems with law enforcement actions against <b>Israelis</b> in the West Bank. According to Yesh Din's study, which was conducted in 2005, more than 90% of complaints against <b>Israelis</b> were closed without indictments mainly due to perpetrators not being found, 96% of trespassing cases (including sabotage of trees) against <b>Israelis</b> led to no indictment, 100% of vandalism and other property offences against <b>Israelis</b> led to no indictment and 5% of complaints against <b>Israelis</b> were lost and never investigated.|$|R

5|$|Brigadier General Hafez, {{commanding}} the 16th Infantry Division, planned {{to contain the}} <b>Israeli</b> attack from the south by having the 18th Mechanized Brigade occupy defenses north of the Chinese Farm, directly behind the 16th Infantry Brigade, but without its organic tank battalion, which was designated {{as part of the}} division's reserve. The 1st Armored Brigade moved southward to occupy positions between Lateral Road and the canal on the right flank of the 18th Brigade. Upon the brigade's arrival, it engaged <b>Israeli</b> armor from Reshef's brigade in al-Galaa'; Egyptian armor destroyed around 15 tanks and several half-tracks. At around 1:00 PM, sorties of Egyptian Su-7s destroyed many <b>Israeli</b> tanks in ground-attack missions over al-Galaa' village. The 1st Brigade countered a flanking attempt on its left at 2:00 PM by a tank battalion, thwarting the attack and destroying ten tanks. During its engagements on October 16, the 21st Division managed to destroy over 50 <b>Israeli</b> tanks and APCs, while subjected to frequent <b>Israeli</b> air strikes and artillery barrages. The 1st Brigade accounted for most of the kills, while suffering fewer losses.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan.

This move combined with increasing competition from <b>Israeli</b> citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an <b>Israeli</b> military-appointed administration. During the course of the <b>Israeli</b> occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

50|$|<b>Israeli's</b> {{philosophical}} works exercised {{a considerable}} influence on Christian and Jewish thinkers, and {{a lesser degree}} of influence among Muslim intellectuals. In the twelfth century, a group of scholars in Toledo transmitted many Arabic works of science and philosophy into Latin. One of the translators, Gerard of Cremona, rendered <b>Israeli's</b> Book of Definitions (Liber de Definicionibus/Definitionibus) and Book on the Elements (Liber Elementorum) into Latin. <b>Israeli's</b> work was quoted and paraphrased {{by a number of}} Christian thinkers including Gundissalinus, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Vincent de Beauvais, Bonaventura, Roger Bacon and Nicholas of Cusa. Isaac <b>Israeli's</b> philosophical influence on Muslim authors is slight at best. The only known quotation of <b>Israeli's</b> philosophy in a Muslim work occurs in Ghayat al-Hakim, a book on magic, produced in eleventh-century Spain, translated into Latin and widely circulated in the West under the title Picatrix.

5|$|In {{the late}} night hours of 24 October 2001, during the Second Intifada, the <b>Israeli</b> Army (IDF) {{launched}} an incursion into Beit Rima in {{what became the}} first major <b>Israeli</b> military raid into Palestinian-controlled territory, according to Human Rights Watch (HRW). The IDF stated {{the intent of the}} raid was to capture the alleged killers of <b>Israeli</b> Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi, who was shot dead by members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) in retaliation for Israel's assassination of the party's leader Mustafa Zibri (Abu Ali Mustafa) in August. About 50 people from Beit Rima were detained and brought to the <b>Israeli</b> settlement of Halamish for interrogation. Most were released before the day's end, but eleven men remained in <b>Israeli</b> custody, two of whom Israel alleged to be directly involved in Ze'evi's assassination. In the course of the raid, <b>Israeli</b> forces killed six Palestinians, including three members of the Palestinian National Security Forces and two officers from the Civil Police, and wounded seven others. The Palestinian authorities in Beit Rima stated they had not received prior warning from the IDF and their slain men had been resting in an olive grove near the local police station, while <b>Israeli</b> military officials stated all those killed had either fired on <b>Israeli</b> forces or approached them threateningly and all were members of various armed groups. The HRW stated that the Red Crescent was prevented from treating the injured men until 7:00 am, a delay that resulted in the death of two of the police officers. <b>Israeli</b> forces also demolished three homes in the town, alleging that they belonged to family members of Ze'evi's killers.|$|E
