5|$|This large {{collection}} of meteorites allows {{a better understanding}} of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. New types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. Among these are pieces blasted off the Moon, and probably Mars, by impacts. These specimens, particularly ALH84001 discovered by ANSMET, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on Mars. Because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time <b>elapsed</b> since the meteorite hit the Earth can be determined from laboratory studies. The <b>elapsed</b> time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of Antarctic ice sheets.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{given that}} the way {{airborne}} ash is deposited after an eruption is strongly influenced by the meteorological conditions, a certain variation of the ash type will occur, {{as a function of}} distance to the volcano or time <b>elapsed</b> from eruption. The ash from Mount St. Helens is no exception, and hence the ash properties have large variations.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1922, Speer began courting Margarete (Margret) Weber (1905–1987), the {{daughter}} of a successful craftsman who employed 50 workers. The relationship was frowned upon by Speer's class-conscious mother, who felt that the Webers were socially inferior. Despite this opposition, the two married in Berlin on August 28, 1928; seven years <b>elapsed</b> before Margarete Speer was invited to stay at her in-laws' home.|$|E

5|$|Mobile, Alabama, {{had fallen}} to Union control on April 12, 1865. Reports reached Taylor of the meeting between Johnston and Sherman about the terms of Johnston's {{surrender}} of his armies. Taylor agreed to meet with Major General Edward R. S. Canby for a conference north of Mobile, and they settled on a 48 hour's truce on April 30. Taylor agreed to a surrender after this time <b>elapsed,</b> which he did on May 4 at Citronelle, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|Nagumo quickly {{reversed}} {{his order}} to re-arm the bombers with general purpose bombs {{and demanded that}} the scout plane ascertain {{the composition of the}} American force. Another 20–40 minutes <b>elapsed</b> before Tones scout finally radioed the presence of a single carrier in the American force. This was one of the carriers from Task Force 16. The other carrier was not sighted.|$|E
5|$|The {{intended}} dive {{profile is}} {{useful as a}} planning tool {{as an indication of}} the risks of decompression sickness and oxygen toxicity for the exposure, and also for estimating the volume of open-circuit breathing gas needed for a planned dive, as these depend in part upon the depth and duration of the dive. A dive profile diagram is conventionally drawn with <b>elapsed</b> time running from left to right and depth increasing down the page.|$|E

40|$|One area of {{research}} of the Information Sciences Division at NASA Ames Research Center {{is devoted to the}} analysis and enhancement of processors and advanced computer architectures, specifically in support of automation and robotic systems. To compare systems' abilities to efficiently process Lisp and Ada, scientists at Ames Research Center have developed a suite of non-parallel benchmarks called <b>ELAPSE.</b> The benchmark suite was designed to test a single computer's efficiency as well as alternate machine comparisons on Lisp, and/or Ada languages. <b>ELAPSE</b> tests the efficiency with which a machine can execute the various routines in each environment. The sample routines are based on numeric and symbolic manipulations and include two-dimensional fast Fourier transformations, Cholesky decomposition and substitution, Gaussian elimination, high-level data processing, and symbol-list references. Also included is a routine based on a Bayesian classification program sorting data into optimized groups. The <b>ELAPSE</b> benchmarks are available for any computer with a validated Ada compiler and/or Common Lisp system. Of the 18 routines that comprise <b>ELAPSE,</b> provided within this package are 14 developed or translated at Ames. The others are readily available through literature. The benchmark that requires the most memory is CHOLESKY. ADA. Under VAX/VMS, CHOLESKY. ADA requires 760 K of main memory. <b>ELAPSE</b> is available on either two 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS format diskettes (standard distribution) or a 9 -track 1600 BPI ASCII CARD IMAGE format magnetic tape. The contents of the diskettes are compressed using the PKWARE archiving tools. The utility to unarchive the files, PKUNZIP. EXE, is included. The <b>ELAPSE</b> benchmarks were written in 1990.

5|$|The ships {{used the}} basic {{design of the}} Cerberus-class breastwork {{monitors}} to reduce design and construction time. Their hulls were completed very quickly, but the pace of building reduced as the likelihood of their immediate use diminished.

As a matter of practice, the defendant may already have been prosecuted for the initial offence (for example, another offence against the person). Accordingly, the Attorney General's consent is required if {{more than three years}} has <b>elapsed,</b> or where the defendant has already been prosecuted in the circumstances alleged to have resulted in the victim's death.|$|E
5|$|Bottom time is {{the time}} spent at depth before {{starting}} the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the <b>elapsed</b> time between leaving the surface {{and the start of}} the final ascent at 10 metres per minute, and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.|$|E
5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake at {{the head}} of a party of 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, most of whom had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck in the head with a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had <b>elapsed</b> from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E

5|$|Clemson's post-score kickoff was {{returned}} to the Georgia Tech 15-yard line, where the Yellow Jackets began their first offensive possession. On the first two plays of the game, Georgia Tech running back Roddy Jones escaped the Clemson defense for gains of 21 yards and 22 yards, respectively. Those plays advanced the Yellow Jackets to the Clemson 42-yard line, where Georgia Tech began advancing by small gains. In three plays, Georgia Tech gained a first down, but two subsequent plays lost yardage before kicker Scott Blair came onto the field to attempt—and convert—a 48-yard field goal. The score narrowed Clemson's lead to 7–3 with the quarter exactly half <b>elapsed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The injured Lindwall {{came out}} to bat at 365/7 without a runner to join Hassett, and {{appeared}} to be able to run twos and threes without significant difficulty. Hassett, who had scored only 30 runs in the first 75 minutes of the day, swept Laker for four and then hit him for the first six of the match. The Australian vice-captain added 53 in the two hours of the morning session to reach lunch at 94. The tourists were unhurried and remained patient as they had bowled England out quickly on the first day and there was still sufficient time to force a result with less than half the playing time <b>elapsed.</b>|$|E
5|$|The war-time {{deployment}} of the Territorial Army envisioned it being deployed piecemeal, to reinforce the regular army {{that had already been}} deployed to the European mainland, as equipment became available. The plan envisioned the {{deployment of}} the whole force in waves, as divisions completed their training, with the final divisions not being deployed until a year had <b>elapsed</b> from the outbreak of war. As a result, the division did not leave the United Kingdom as the British Expeditionary Force was evacuated from France during May and June 1940.|$|E

5|$|Three years <b>elapsed</b> between series VI and VII, {{partly due}} to the {{dissolving}} of the Grant and Naylor partnership, but also due to cast and crew working on other projects. When the series eventually returned, it was filmised and no longer shot in front of a live audience, allowing for greater use of four-walled sets, location shooting, and single-camera techniques. When the show returned for its eighth series two years later, it had dropped use of the filmising process and returned to using a live audience.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the month}} of May the radio scintillations became less {{noticeable}} until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded {{in the time that}} had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the <b>elapsed</b> time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light. While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.|$|E

The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time <b>elapsed</b> from jumping on the roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E
