40|$|B {{lymphocytes}} may {{be activated}} {{by a variety}} of agents, including antigens and mitogens. The minimum stage of activation so far demonstrated has been passage from the resting <b>Go</b> <b>stage</b> into an activated GI phase. This is operationally defined as blastogenesis, and is marked by increased RNA synthesis and expression of surface markers characteristic of proliferating cells in the absence of DNA synthesis (1 - 3). In the presence of appropriate soluble factors, these cells will proliferate, then terminally differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 1 infects resting B cells (4 - 9) and drives them to differentiate into Ig-secreting lymphoblasts (10, 11) that express cell surface markers characteristic of activated B cells (12, 13). These lymphoblasts proliferate indefinitely in culture (14, 15), a process that has been termed growth transformation or immortalization. We have proposed (12) that growth transformation by EBV involves two processes. The first parallels the normal differentiation pathway for resting B cells whereby they become activated and proliferate. The second involves th...|$|E
40|$|The sub{{seasonal}} to seasonal timescale {{provides a}} unique opportunity to capitalise on the expertise of the weather and climate research communities, and to bring them together to improve predictions on a timescale of particular relevance to the Global Framework for Climate Services (GFCS). A planning group which included representatives from WWRP/THORPEX, WCRP, CBS and CCl drafted the implementation plan, giving high priority to establishing collaboration and coordination between operational centres and the research community involved in subseasonal to seasonal prediction, and to sponsorship of key international research activities. From the end-user perspective, the subseasonal to seasonal time range is a very important one, as many management decisions in agriculture and food security, water, disaster risk reduction and health fall into this range. Improved weather-to-climate forecasts promise to be of significant social and economic value. An integrated decisional framework such as the READY, SET, GO being developed by the Red Cross and IRI, where seasonal forecast provide READY information, subseasonal the SET and weather forecasts the <b>GO</b> <b>stage</b> illustrates the potential benefit of a more seamless approach to predictions.

40|$|ABSTRACT The glucose antimetabolite, 2 -deoxy-D-glucose (2 -DG) has {{previously}} {{been shown to be}} a radio-sensitiser in certain tumours and a protector in dividing lymphocytes. Since the majority of lymphocytes under normal physiological conditions are in <b>Go</b> <b>stage</b> and could be considered to represent tumour-surrounding tissues, they were exposed in vitro to gamma radiation from a Co- 60 teletherapy unit at a dose-rate of 1. 0 Gy / minute, in the presence and absence of 2 -DG. The doses studied ranged from control to 4. 0 Gy. Whole blood cultures were set up and the various types of chromosomal aberrations were analysed. The results indicated that there was a decrease in the frequency of dicentric chromosomes from the dose of 0. 1 Gy up to 4. 0 Gy. In case of excessive acentric fragments there was reduction at the doses of 0. 05, 0. 5, 1. 0 and 3. 0 Gy. Surprisingly there was an increase of double-minute chromosomes in the doses of 0. 05, and from 2. 0 to 4. 0 Gy. The total chromosomal aberrations showed decrease in the doses from 1. 0 to 3. 0 Gy. The study indicates that 2 -DG {{could be used as a}} radio protectant at clinically useful dose of 2. 0 Gy and the median dose-rate of 1. 0 Gy / min, apart from discussing the reasons for the decrease and increase of the various chromosomal aberrations...|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{living in}} malaria-endemic areas show {{generally}} low T cell responses to malaria Ags. In this study, we show murine dendritic cell (DC) interaction with parasitized erythrocytes (pRBC) arrested their maturation, resulting in impaired ability to stimulate naive, but not recall T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, within the naive T cell population, pRBC-treated DC were selectively deficient in priming CD 8 + but not CD 4 + T cells. Indeed, DC {{that had taken}} up pRBC were shown {{for the first time}} to efficiently prime CD 4 + T cell responses to a known protective merozoite Ag, MSP 4 / 5. In contrast, impaired priming resulted in decreases in both proliferation and cytokine production by CD 8 + T cells. Deficient priming was observed to both a model and a Plasmodium berghei-specific CD 8 + T cell epitope. The mechanisms underlying the inability of parasite-treated DC to prime CD 8 + T cells were explored. pRBC treatment of DC from wild-type C 57 BL/ 6, but not from IL- 10 knockout animals, suppressed DC-mediated T cell priming across a Transwell, suggesting active IL- 10 -depcndent suppression. CD 8 + T cells were arrested at the <b>Go</b> <b>stage</b> of the cell cycle after two cell divisions post-Ag stimulation. The proliferation arrest was partially reversible by the addition of IL- 2 or IL- 7 to respondcr cultures. These results suggest that in malaria-endemic areas, priming of CD 8 + T cell responses may be more difficult to induce via vaccination than the priming of CD 4 + T cells. Moreover, pathogens may selectively target the CD 8 + T cell arm of protective immunity for immune evasion...|$|E
40|$|It {{is shown}} {{here that the}} ability of B {{lymphocytes}} to act as supportive host cells for virus infections requires they be activated from the resting <b>Go</b> <b>stage</b> of the cell cycle. I have used a series of activation regimens, which allow B cells to progress to different stages in their activation/differentiation pathway toward antibody secretion, in order to evaluate the extent of activation required to support vesicular stomatitis or Newcastle disease virus infections. At least three distinct phases during B cell activation which affected VSV infection were defined. Freshly isolated resting murine splenic B cells in the Go phase of the cell cycle do not support VSV, assessed by protein synthesis, infectious center formation, and PFU production. Small B cells cultured for 48 hours without stimulation still do not support VSV. B cells stimulated with the lymphokines found in Con A activated supernatants from splenic T cells or cloned T cell lines transited into the G 1 phase of the cell cycle but remain refractory to VSV. These VSV non-supportive B cell populations do take up virus particles and transcribe viral mRNAs which can be translated in vitro, suggesting a translational block to VSV. B cells stimulated into the S phase of the cell cycle with anti-immunoglobulin synthesize VSV proteins and increased numbers of infectious centers, but only low level PFU synthesis (3 ̆c 1 PFU per infectious 3 ̆ecenter) is observed. Co-stimulation with anti-Ig and lymphokines, which supports differentiation to antibody secretion, enhanced PFU synthesis without further {{increasing the number of}} infected B cells. LPS, which activates B cells directly to antibody secretion by a pathway different from anti-Ig, induced infectious centers, and PFUs at levels comparable to those seen when stably transformed permissive cell lines are infected. Co-stimulation of LPS activated B cells with the same lymphokine populations that enhance PFU production when anti-Ig is used as a stimulator suppresses PFU production completely, suggesting that anti-Ig and LPS activated B cells are differentially responsive to lymphokines. NDV infection of murine B cells differed markedly from VSV infection, as all B cell populations examined gave a similar response pattern. NDV viral proteins were synthesized by B cells in each of the activation states previously described, even freshly isolated B cells. Infectious center formation increased up to 5 -fold over the levels observed with unstimulated B cells after anti-Ig or LPS activation. However, PFU synthesis was low (3 ̆c 1 PFU per infectious 3 ̆ecenter) for all B cell populations. These results suggest that these two similar viruses may be dependent on different host cell factors and that these factors are induced for VSV but not NDV by the B cell activators employed here or that the process of infection of B cell by these two viruses induces different cellular responses...|$|E
40|$|Dr Monde Kagonyera {{was born}} in {{south-western}} Uganda. After completing advanced studies in veterinary science at the Universities of Nairobi and California, Davis, he taught clinical veterinary medicine at Nairobi and Makerere Universities. In 1988 he was appointed Minister of Animal Industries and Fisheries for Uganda ? a position he held until 1991. Currently he is a Member of Parliament in Uganda, {{and chairman of the}} Appointments Board of Makerere University. With most economies in Africa and other ACP States largely based on agriculture, the question governments and donors have to ask themselves is 'are they doing enough of the right kind of interventions to assist farmers?' At a recent seminar in Swaziland on 'Livestock Development Policies', organised by CTA in collaboration with OAU/IBAR and the Swaziland Ministry of Agriculture (see Spore 72), Dr Kagonyera delighted delegates with his frank perspectives. He spoke with ACP journalist Anita Allen. Dr Kagonyera began by saying that 'Any agricultural policy in Africa must address the needs of the peasant, and must be aimed at a viable food strategy programme leading to self-sufficiency in food production as well as addressing the question of poverty alleviation, since we cannot yet talk about poverty elimination. ' Such brevity is remarkable for a politician, but then Kagonyera {{is an example of the}} new breed of scientist-turned-politician. He would like to see many more such figures occupying parliamentary benches throughout the continent. Sometimes called an African Renaissance man, he believes that the tide has turned for Africa. One reason for optimism, he says, is that the quality of politicians is improving. 'As you realise at the time of Independence a lot of political leaders had very poor education and experience. Things are different now. If you look at the parliament of Uganda for example, I'm sure 80 % of the members have got at least one university degree. So the politics are completely different. ' The African renaissance Things may be different, but they are not yet right and Kagonyera reserves some of his most pithy remarks for politicians and their various organisations, recalling the prayer book saying: 'we have left undone those things we ought to have done and we have done those things we ought not to have done'. Kagonyera sets great store in education as a key in the African renaissance, and he would like to see donors throwing everything they have into capacity building. 'I think Africa should be given time to prepare itself to join the rest of the world and the best way to help Africa prepare itself is to emphasise capacity building, whether it is in education, industry, or agriculture. ' He is, though, a little wary of aid: 'it tends to give you breathing space not to work hard, and that's not good'. The fact that democracy is coming to Africa only now doesn't bother him and he dismisses a suggestion that it has taken a long time. 'All over the world these things have taken a long time. Look how long it took the Europeans to become democratic. Africa is on the launching pad, there's no question in my mind. I wish I could live long enough to see Africa a better place. We are taking off already ? look how many countries have adopted democratic principles of governance, look how many countries are registering positive economic growth after long decades of negative growth, look at the coming to the stage of South Africa with its economic might ? Africa is going to be a different continent. ' In this awakening, Kagonyera says Africa must look to itself first. 'Africa has first to put its own house in order before it can go to the global field, and it is important to <b>go</b> <b>stage</b> by stage. This can only be based on each country doing a good job within its own borders, then in regional groups, then the whole of Africa can look to the world. ' Is enough attention being paid to agriculture by governments in Eastern and Southern Africa? Kagonyera thinks not. 'One problem we have is that when farmers make mistakes, instead of finding a remedy, they are punished. That's wrong because those mistakes are not intentional. It's a learning process and we are not allowing that to take place. ' Scientists, he believes, have a crucial role to play in ensuring a better tomorrow for Africa's people. 'I would like to see scientists assert themselves more because they can be listened to, that's my view. Certainly in Uganda, we can listen to them because even in parliament we have so many professionals ? at least seven vets and probably more medical doctors and professors. ' He dismisses any suggestion that scientists are not noted for their assertiveness, and says that in their labs they have to be assertive. Furthermore, he believes that scientists must become political animals. Plant your people 'It's like playing American football, you must plant your people. Scientists must take the game to the politicians ? if you don't take the initiative ? and this is true of every walk of life ? there are times when if you don't promote a thing, you don't get it. You must draw programmes that are achievable,' he says, and that means focusing on food self-sufficiency with government interventions directed at enabling and empowering the peasant to produce more. 'If you do not understand the problems of the small farmer, then you will not be able to help him ? and how do you know his problems? You must talk to him, so there must be forums with the peasant farmers, where they can come and give their problems and tell their stories. Government archives are full of projects, but none of it gets to the people, so follow-up is the rule. ' Which brings him back to his only words of advice to donors: build capacity in the people.
