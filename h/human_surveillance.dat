In computer vision, his work pioneered the simultaneous segmentation and fitting of complex objects, statistical model-based tracking, shape representation, learning, sparsity, ASL {{as well as}} gesture recognition. In particular, Dr. Metaxas is focusing on human body and shape motion analysis, <b>human</b> <b>surveillance,</b> security applications, ASL recognition, behavior modeling and analysis and scalable solutions to large and distributed sensor-based networks. In the area of biomedical applications, Dr. Metaxas {{has developed}} new methods for material modeling and shape estimation of internal body parts (such as the lungs) using data from MRI, SPAMM and CT scan. He has pioneered the linking of the anatomical and physiological models {{of the human body}} and deformable models used for the automatic diagnosis of heart disease from MRI data. In computer graphics, Dr. Metaxas introduced the Navier-Stokes methodology for Fluids, based on which the water scenes in the movie Antz were created in 1998. For this work, his student Nick Foster won a Technical Achievement award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in 1999. Since then, Dr. Metaxas is working on new techniques for modeling fluid phenomena, and control theoretic techniques for automating and improving the animation of articulated (e.g., humans) objects. Dr. Metaxas has published over 350 research articles and has graduated more than 35 PhD students. He has more than 20,000 citations.|$|E

40|$|This {{framework}} outlines {{a proposed}} start-to-finish approach {{to improve the}} prevention of anthrax outbreaks. Outbreak prevention is achieved primarily through vaccination of livestock against anthrax, which is the principle method for prevention and control of anthrax in animals and subsequent anthrax in <b>humans.</b> <b>Surveillance</b> of animal and human cases is important to identify suspect cases, estimate incidence, and evaluate the impact of control programs. Enhancing outbreak response is key to rapidly implementing control programs and halting the outbreak. Laboratory diagnostic capacity at biosafety level 2 {{is critical to the}} rapid identification of animal and human cases. These steps augment effective and efficient vaccination of livestock to prevent and control anthrax. The principles and methods described in this framework can apply to any anthrax-endemic country, and can be modified to meet specific areas needing improvement. As epidemiological information is accrued about a given region, this framework can be expanded to include detailed protocols, system descriptions, and in-depth evaluations.

40|$|Abstract. The 2001 {{foot and}} mouth disease (FMD) {{epidemic}} in the United Kingdom {{resulted in the}} popularisation of the concept of biosecurity. At its most basic, biosecurity refers to simple cleansing and disinfecting, but during the FMD epidemic it became associated with a powerful system of surveillance. We characterise surveillance as a thing in itself, a mode of ordering that can be added to others. The establishment and maintenance of categories are fundamental to the practice of surveillance, but social studies of surveillance have not yet fully realised the way such categorisation operates within the nonhuman and the spatial. Strange materialities are those things which do not quite belong within a particular order. We examine the actions of surveillance in the world of strange materialities that was the FMD epidemic. Here we see that surveillant practices acted on the nonhuman FMD virus by constructing territories to control <b>humans.</b> <b>Surveillance</b> seems to proceed as the translation of a worldview (a system of categorisation) into materiality and we conclude with some thoughts on what this may mean for geographical studies of technical, biological, and human materialities in which surveillant processes are at work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Yersinia pestis, the causative {{agent of}} plague, has been {{detected}} in fleas and mammals throughout the western United States.

For these reasons, some local health departments in these plague-affected regions have hesitated to undertake surveillance and other prevention activities. To aid in targeting limited public health resources, we created a fine-resolution human plague risk map for New Mexico, the state reporting more than half the human cases in the United States. Our GIS-based model included three landscape features—a nonlinear relationship with elevation, distance to water, and distance to the ecotone between Rocky Mountain/Great Basin open and closed coniferous woodlands—and yielded an overall accuracy of ≈ 80 %. The model classified 17. 25 % of the state as posing significant risk of exposure to humans on privately or tribally owned land, which suggests that resource requirements for regular surveillance and control of plague could be effectively focused on < 20 % of the state...|$|R

40|$|West Nile {{disease in}} humans has been {{detected}} {{for the first}} time in Italy in two regions, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto. Surveillance subsequently set up in Veneto detected a case of West Nile neuroinvasive disease and a few asymptomatic infections, but no case of West Nile fever. We conclude that also West Nile fever cases should be specifically targeted by surveillance. Background The first equine outbreak of West Nile virus (WNV) infections in Italy was reported in 1998 in Tuscany (province of Florence) [1]. Subsequent active <b>human</b> <b>surveillance</b> of stable workers identified four individuals who were seropositive but did not report any symptoms [2]. To our knowledge, no human passive surveillance (for ill people) was carried out in Italy at that time. For the purpose of this paper, we define active surveillance as the active search for infected workers in stables who reported equine disease, while we define passive (rapid) surveillance as the screening for WNV disease among patients who seek medical care and fulfil the case definition (of suspected cases) outlined below. Since 2001, a national veterinary surveillance system based on periodic testing of sentinel chickens and horses has identified sporadic seroconversions [3] without further occurrence of actual WNV disease until 2008 [4]. In August 2008, an equine WNV outbreak was detected in areas surrounding the Po river delta, involving the regions Emilia-Romagna (provinces of Bologna and Ferrara) and Veneto (province of Rovigo) (Figure 1). Subsequently, active and passive <b>human</b> <b>surveillance</b> was started in both region...|$|E

40|$|AbstractToxoplasma gondii is a {{zoonotic}} protozoan parasite {{that can}} cause significant disease in most warm-blooded animals, including <b>humans.</b> <b>Surveillance</b> testing of <b>human</b> and animal populations is essential to estimate disease prevalence, assess food safety risks and establish control programmes. Serological tests are the most practical methods to detect the prevalence of infection in {{a broad range of}} host populations. The modified agglutination test (MAT) is a sensitive serological method to detect Toxoplasma IgG antibodies in livestock and wild animals. An in-house MAT was developed using tachyzoites produced by in vitro cultivation instead of traditional propagation in murine peritoneal cavity. The assay was evaluated using samples of serum and/or meat juice from pigs and cats experimentally infected with T. gondii. Samples were also tested by a commercially available MAT kit. Comparative analysis of test results from serum and meat juice samples showed excellent agreement between the in-house MAT and the commercial MAT. Serum and/or blood samples from naturally infected cats, sheep, and 20 wildlife host species were also tested by the in-house MAT, with overall results comparable to those obtained using the commercial MAT kit. Therefore, this new MAT is an efficient and convenient method for testing a variety of terrestrial and aquatic domestic or wild host species for T. gondii...|$|R
