Within this context, development of <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>after-treatment</b> systems undertakes a significant role. Among the techniques used is selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which converts nitrogen oxides (NOx) into diatomic nitrogen (N- 2) and water (H 2 O).

In relation to the SCR system as well as to NOx reduction, we concluded that urea-based mixtures are the most efficient, although they present higher values of NH 3 slip.

40|$|A {{thermodynamic}} simulation is used {{to study}} effects of O 2 -enriched intake air on performance and NO emissions of a locomotive diesel engine. Parasitic power of the air separation membrane required to supply the O 2 -enriched air is also estimated. For a given constraint on peak cylinder pressure, gross and net power output of an engine operating under different levels of O 2 enrichment are compared with those obtained when a high-boost turbocharged engine is used. A 4 % increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in 13 % increase in net engine power when intake air with 28 vol% O 2 is used and fuel injection timing retarded by 4 degrees. When the engine is turbocharged to a higher inlet boost, the same increase in peak cylinder pressure can result in only 4 % improvement in power. If part of the higher exhaust enthalpies from the O 2 enrichment is recovered, the power requirements of the air separator membrane can be met. O 2 enrichment with its higher combustion temperatures reduces emissions of particulates and visible smoke but increases NO emissions (by up to 3 times at 26 % O 2 content). Therefore, <b>exhaust</b> gas <b>after-treatment</b> and heat recovery would be required if the full potential of O 2 enrichment for improving the performance of locomotive diesel engines is to be realized...|$|R
