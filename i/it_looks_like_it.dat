The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function â€” thus they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, {{it seems to me}} that, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like,</b> <b>it</b> appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{members were}} {{dissatisfied}} {{with the release of}} [...] "Soul Sound" [...] as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, [...] "New Year", [...] "Run for Cover" [...] and [...] "Soul Sound", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: [...] "Everything happens for a reason and <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> has all worked out". [...] "Soul Sound" [...] was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch, which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze, Jr. and Jessica Biel.|$|E

Not only are these games overly simplistic, they're just not that much fun." [...] Navarro wrote, [...] "Most offensive of all, however, is how cheaply The Apprentice handles its license. This game presents itself horribly. <b>It</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> was programmed hastily with Macromedia, with all the characters appearing as weirdly drawn cartoon versions of themselves." [...] Navarro also criticized the game's audio clips of Donald Trump, and its short length, noting that the entire game could be completed in 20 minutes.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{these type}} of possessors are problematic. There is a {{discrepancy}} between where the possessor appears syntactically in an inalienable possession construction and what its semantic relationship to the inalienable noun seems to be. Semantically, the possessor of an inalienable noun is intrinsic to its meaning and acts like a semantic argument. In the surface syntactic structure, however, the possessor appears in a position that marks it as an argument of the verb. [...] Thus, there are different views on how these types of inalienable possession constructions should be represented in the syntactic structure. The binding hypothesis argues that the possessor is an argument of the verb. Conversely, the possessor-raising hypothesis argues that the possessor originates as an argument of the possessed noun and then moves to [...] a position where on the surface <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> is an argument of the verb.|$|E

2500|$|A formal {{quotient}} of polynomials, that is, an algebraic fraction {{wherein the}} numerator and denominator are polynomials, {{is called a}} [...] "rational expression" [...] or [...] "rational fraction" [...] and is not, in general, a polynomial. Division of a polynomial by a number, however, yields another polynomial. For example, [...] is considered a valid term in a polynomial (and a polynomial by itself) because it is equivalent to [...] and [...] is just a constant.

2500|$|Still Water (The River Thames, for Example) (1999) is {{a single}} work {{composed}} of fifteen photographic offset lithographs, each 30 1/2 x 41 1/2". It is {{in the collection of}} the Museum of Modern Art [...] It was commissioned around 1998, and Horn has noted that it came about at the same time as the end of a long love relationship. Each of the 15 lithographs features a photograph of the surface of the River Thames that has been annotated with many small white numerals that correspond to a bar of footnotes that runs along the lower border of each image. In one footnote, Horn puts a fine point on the lens through which this project looks at the river, [...] "(41) The Thames has the highest rate of suicides of any urban river. Maybe it's not the highest but it's close. It doesn't really matter because even if it doesn't, <b>it</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> does." [...] Horn describes these annotations as footnoting [...] "whatever I was thinking of at the time, what the river provoked in me, and what was in the river itself." [...] The result is a mixture of poetic fragments, reports culled from interviews and newspaper clippings about deaths (primarily planned suicides) by drowning in the Thames, references to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, questions about identity and consideration of the subject of water from many different perspectives. In most cases, the photographs were taken with such exactitude that the moving surface of the water is stopped in highly detailed topographies, so that the substance of water is shown in more sculptural views than can usually be observed by the naked eye.|$|E
