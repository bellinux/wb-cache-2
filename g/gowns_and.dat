5|$|Altogether, around fifty Christian {{artifacts}} {{were found}} in Hasekura's estate in 1640, such as crosses, rosaries, religious <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> religious paintings. The artifacts were seized and stored by the Date fief. An inventory was made again in 1840 describing the items as belonging to Hasekura Tsunenaga. Nineteen books were also mentioned in the inventory, {{but they have been}} lost since. The artifacts are today preserved in the Sendai City Museum and other museums in Sendai.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are non-specific. Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, {{just before the}} {{outbreak}} of World War II, there was {{a revival of the}} hooped crinoline from designers such as Edward Molyneux, who put hoops in both day skirts and evening <b>gowns,</b> <b>and</b> Norman Hartnell, whose late 1930s Winterhalter-inspired crinoline designs for Queen Elizabeth were so successful that the Queen is popularly (if inaccurately) credited with having single-handedly brought crinolines back into fashion. Both as Queen, and as the Queen Mother, Elizabeth adopted the traditional bell-shaped crinoline as her signature look for evening wear and state occasions. The film Gone With The Wind, released in 1939, inspired the American fashion for prom dresses with crinolines in Spring 1940.|$|E
5|$|Norman wore {{a variety}} of brightly colored, {{elaborate}} costumes and was often photographed by media while wearing royal-style <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> wigs and holding a scepter. She stated that her habiliments mirrored the practices of extraterrestrials, whose attire she said was brighter and more radiant than clothing on Earth. At the group's headquarters, she had a gold-colored throne that was decorated with peacock feathers. Her assistants helped shepherd her media image; Kirkpatrick and Tumminia speculate that her charisma was primarily responsible for gaining publicity for the group.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} days of the Flamingo {{engagement}} went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.|$|E

After being formally admitted during the ceremony, they exit the Theatre and assume the <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> hoods of their new degrees {{and then return to}} the Theatre in their new <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> hoods. For certain degrees such as the higher doctorates and MAs, if they profess the Christian faith, the graduand may (if they wish) kneel in front of the (Vice-)Chancellor and be admitted in 'the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit' whilst being tapped on the head with the Bible.|$|E

25|$|Nigeria {{replaced}} the QC nomenclature {{with the new}} title of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN).

The SANs are entitled to wear silk <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> enjoy similar privileges as the Queen's Counsel.|$|E
25|$|Women’s {{fashion in}} the Regency era {{started to change}} drastically. It popularized the empire silhouette, which {{featured}} a fitted bodice and high waist. This “new natural style” emphasized {{the beauty of the}} body's natural lines. Clothing became lighter and easier to care for than in the past. Women often wore several layers of clothing, typically undergarments, <b>gowns,</b> <b>and</b> outerwear. The chemise, the standard undergarment of the era, prevented the thin, gauzy dresses from being fully transparent. Outerwear, such as the spencer and the pelisse, were popular.|$|E

25|$|Scarlet day is {{the term}} used in the University of Cambridge to {{designate}} those days on which Doctors are required to wear the festal form of academic dress.

On these days it is also permitted for members of the University to wear the academic dress of other Universities from which they have obtained degrees.|$|E

She helped Catherine mount an outdoor banquet and lavish show depicting the Apotheosis of Woman on 9 June 1577 at the château of Chenonceau. During the banquet the male guests were served by Catherine's most beautiful ladies-in-waiting who wore topless <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> their hair flowing loose as was the custom of brides on their wedding night.|$|E
25|$|What's My Line? {{is known}} for its {{attention}} to manners and class. In its early years, business suits and street dresses were worn by the host and panelists, but by 1953, the men normally wore black suits with bow ties (a few guests in fact wore tuxedos) while female panelists donned formal <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> often gloves. Exceptions to this dress code were on the broadcasts immediately following the deaths of Fred Allen and Dorothy Kilgallen, in which the male cast members wore straight neckties and the women wore simpler dresses.|$|E

25|$|People {{who care}} for those {{infected}} with Ebola should wear protective clothing including masks, gloves, <b>gowns</b> <b>and</b> goggles. The US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommend that the protective gear leaves no skin exposed. These measures are also recommended for those who may handle objects contaminated by an infected person's body fluids. In 2014, the CDC began recommending that medical personnel receive training on the proper suit-up and removal of personal protective equipment (PPE); in addition, a designated person, appropriately trained in biosafety, should be watching each step of these procedures to ensure they are done correctly. In Sierra Leone, the typical training period {{for the use of}} such safety equipment lasts approximately 12 days.|$|E
25|$|Lucile {{was most}} {{famous for its}} lingerie, tea <b>gowns,</b> <b>and</b> evening wear. Its luxuriously layered and draped {{garments}} in soft fabrics of blended pastel colors, often accentuated with sprays of hand-made silk flowers, became its hallmark. However, Lucile also offered simple, smart tailored suits and daywear. The dress illustrated at right typifies the classically draped style often found in Lucile designs. Lucy Duff-Gordon originally designed it in Paris, for Lucile Ltd's spring 1913 collection, and later specially adapted it for London socialite Heather Firbank and other well-known clients, including actress Kitty Gordon and dancer Lydia Kyasht of the Ballets Russes. The example illustrated was worn by Miss Firbank and is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E
25|$|Macewen {{was born}} near Port Bannatyne, Isle of Bute, Scotland in 1848 and {{studied at the}} University of Glasgow, {{receiving}} a medical degree in 1872. He was greatly influenced by Joseph, Lord Lister (1827–1912), who revolutionised surgery by developing antisepsis, {{by the use of}} phenol, thus decreasing drastically the enormous mortality of surgical patients due to infections. By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep cleansing and disinfection of hands and arms), sterilisation of surgical tools, use of surgical <b>gowns,</b> <b>and</b> (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen {{became one of the most}} innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients.|$|E
