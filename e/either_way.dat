5|$|Pussy Riot's {{performances}} {{can either}} be called dissident art or political action that engages art forms. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> our performances {{are a kind of}} civic activity amidst the repressions of a corporate political system that directs its power against basic human rights and civil and political liberties.|$|E
5|$|Putting on socks {{resembles a}} {{commutative}} operation since which sock {{is put on}} first is unimportant. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and trousers is not commutative.|$|E
5|$|The {{literary}} scholar Yōichi Katagiri concluded, on {{the lack}} of surviving evidence, that, while it is possible that Narihira and Ono no Komachi knew each other and were lovers, there was no usable evidence to say conclusively <b>either</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Panchari melam is {{performed}} either in its elaborate form (during annual temple festivals) or in its sketchy detail (to accompany the daily or weekly temple rituals). <b>Either</b> <b>ways,</b> they are performed {{only within the}} walls of the temple. The Panchari Melam represents [...] "Satthva Guna", and elevates listeners to higher pedestals.|$|R

5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting <b>either</b> <b>way</b> for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally easily be seen as a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5|$|<b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. For example, if a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} whether Balaputra was {{expelled}} from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in Suvarnadvipa (Sumatra). <b>Either</b> <b>ways,</b> it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in Srivijayan capital of Palembang. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother — Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in Nalanda inscription dated 860.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} {{there are other}} glosses on this text, and on other Insular gospel books, that are yet to be identified. The names themselves might be significant {{if they can be}} dated, as the provenance of the manuscript is uncertain. An eighth-century date would show that the gospel book was in Anglo-Saxon territory before arriving in Wales, whereas a date {{after the end of the}} 10th century (at Lichfield) would add little to what is already known—although a dating <b>either</b> <b>ways</b> does little to rule out a making in Ireland or Northumbria for a Welsh or Mercian ecclesiastic center.|$|R
5|$|In series 2, {{the format}} {{consists}} of six rounds with eight contestants. This time, {{they do not}} have to choose their colour prior to the start of a round and can hold their nerve. In each of the first three rounds, the eight contestants watch a series of stunts, sporting challenges or performances. They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have their powers of observation tested. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> the contestants must strike their buzzer and pick either red or black.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle, Herodotus says that the Persian fleet sailed around Cape Sounion to attack Athens directly. As has been discussed above, some modern historians place this attempt just before the battle. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> the Athenians evidently realised that their city was still under threat, and marched as quickly as possible back to Athens.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a raiding party {{attacked}} Williams Station, a Pony Express station {{located on}} the Carson River near present-day Lake Lahontan. One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out {{when they went to}} investigate and free the women. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> the war party killed five men and the station was burned.|$|E

5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists {{do not know if}} sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E
5|$|The nominal heir of Perdiccas, his son Amyntas IV, was at {{this time}} still an infant. Philip, the sole {{surviving}} son of Amyntas III, was the obvious candidate to rule Macedon and was acclaimed by the army, probably as king. It {{is also possible that}} he was initially acclaimed as regent for his nephew Amyntas IV, and later usurped the throne, although if so, he did not harm Amyntas. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> Philip II became king by 359 BC, and began energetically attempting to save Macedon from destruction.|$|E
5|$|This module {{starts in}} one of two ways. If the players have {{finished}} Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, they have been transported to the glacial rift via the magic chain. They will know that they are searching for some force behind the giant alliance. If the players are starting with Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, then they have been hired by nobles to destroy the frost giants. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> a safe, hidden cave is easily found for a base of operations.|$|E

Such relation offers questions of Fragmentation and Wholeness pertaining {{to the nature of}} Natural reality. It is the question whether the reality is fragmented or undivided, and whether it is a series of static images or an unbroken continuity of flow? Whether it is the same as it is viewed by humanity or as it appears differently in human consciousness?

5|$|While Hungarian scholar György Györffy {{supports}} {{the identification of}} Ivan the Russian as the Iwan dicto Oroz of Hungarian chronicles, historian István Vásáry points {{to the lack of}} clear evidence and the large time span between the two. Before that identification was proposed, it was considered that Ivan had arrived in Bulgaria after fleeing the Mongol conquest of Rus', much like another Russian in Bulgarian service, Jacob Svetoslav. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> in 1323 Ivan's right-hand man was a Hungarian named Inas.|$|E
5|$|After the Kid {{returns and}} recovers, Rucks gives him another choice: He {{can have the}} Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity {{in the hopes of}} {{preventing}} it, or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe. Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound, as {{there was no way to}} test the process. The game ends <b>either</b> <b>way,</b> showing images of the characters (with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits. In the New Game+ mode, which is unlocked after beating the game once, it is hinted that restoring the world didn't prevent the Calamity.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. Not wanting to risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared <b>either</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} his Thracian campaign, Philip moved {{against the}} city of Perinthos, {{formerly}} his ally. Diodorus says that this was because the city had begun to oppose him, and favour the Athenians; however, from Athenian sources, {{there is no indication that}} this was the case. One possible explanation is that Perinthos had refused to send aid to Philip during the Thracian campaign, and it was for this reason he decided to attack it. <b>Either</b> <b>way,</b> since Perinthos was a Greek city, Philip's actions gave the Athenian war-party the excuse it had been looking for to disrupt the peace Philip had wrought in Greece, thereby starting a new phase in the wars.|$|E
5|$|Dax confides in Sisko {{that she}} knows she {{is in love with}} her former wife. He tells her that Trill customs mean that if they resumed their relationship, then they would be exiled from their homeworld and their {{symbionts}} would never be joined with a new host, but that she will have his support <b>either</b> <b>way.</b> Kahn and Dax continue to work on the experiment, but it goes wrong and Defiant is severely damaged. Kahn is injured in the explosion, but Dax rigs a force field across a plasma fire that allows her to reach Kahn, coming to the realization that the relationship is worth exile. After returning to the station, Kahn recuperates from her injuries. She decides against resuming her relationship with Dax, and—with the experiments complete—departs with the science team, leaving Dax heartbroken.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as to whether it was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but <b>either</b> <b>way</b> the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E
