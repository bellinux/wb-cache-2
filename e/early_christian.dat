5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention has been paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> history.|$|E
5|$|Symeon is {{recognized}} as the first Byzantine mystic to freely share his own mystical experiences. Some of his writings {{are included in the}} Philokalia, a collection of texts by <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> mystics on contemplative prayer and hesychast teachings. Symeon wrote and spoke frequently about the importance of experiencing directly the grace of God, often talking about his own experiences of God as divine light. Another common subject in his writings was the need of putting oneself under the guidance of a spiritual father. The authority for many of his teachings derived from the traditions of the Desert Fathers, <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> monks and ascetics. Symeon's writings include Hymns of Divine Love, Ethical Discourses, and The Catechetical Discourses.|$|E
50|$|In 1999 Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium was {{released}} as {{a study on}} the historical Jesus. Ehrman argues that the historical Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> documents: the Gospel of Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. The <b>earliest</b> <b>Christians</b> believed Jesus would soon return, and their beliefs are echoed in the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> writings.|$|R
25|$|Easter, {{the preeminent}} feast that celebrates {{the resurrection of}} Jesus, is clearly the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> festival. Since the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> times, it {{has focused on the}} redemptive act of God in the death and resurrection of Christ.|$|R
50|$|There is {{scholarly}} {{disagreement on}} how <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> felt about abortion, and no explicit prohibition of abortion {{in either the}} Old Testament or New Testament books of the Christian Bible. Some scholars have concluded that <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> took a nuanced stance on {{what is now called}} abortion, and that at different times and in separate places <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> have taken different stances. Other scholars have concluded that <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> considered abortion a sin at all stages; although there is disagreement over their thoughts on what type of sin it was and how grave a sin it was held to be, it was seen as at least as grave as sexual immorality. Some <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> believed that the embryo did not have a soul from conception, and consequently opinion was divided {{as to whether or not}} early abortion was murder or ethically equivalent to murder.|$|R
5|$|The {{spread of}} Scots culture from Dalriada north of Ardnamurchan is poorly {{understood}} and little is recorded of Raasay's <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> period. The placename Kilmaluag suggests {{the presence of}} St Moluag in the late sixth century.|$|E
5|$|Although {{archaeology}} {{shows that}} the myth reflects an actual custom, the placement of coins with the dead was neither pervasive nor confined to a single coin in the deceased's mouth. In many burials, inscribed metal-leaf tablets or Exonumia {{take the place of}} the coin, or gold-foil crosses during the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> period. The presence of coins or a coin-hoard in Germanic ship-burials suggests an analogous concept.|$|E
5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she {{had been}} told Bible stories by her mother. The particular variety of her <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God. She rejected {{the teachings of the}} New Testament that urged slaves to be obedient and found guidance in the Old Testament tales of deliverance. Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E
50|$|The <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> {{who first}} began {{to use the term}} martyr in its new sense saw Jesus as the first and {{greatest}} martyr, on account of his crucifixion. The <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> appear to have seen Jesus as the archetypal martyr.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Early</b> <b>Christians</b> adapted Roman motifs {{and gave}} new {{meanings}} {{to what had}} been pagan symbols. Among the motifs adopted were the peacock, grapevines, and the [...] "Good Shepherd". <b>Early</b> <b>Christians</b> also developed their own iconography, for example, such symbols as the fish (ikhthus), were not borrowed from pagan iconography.|$|R

5|$|Churches of Christ are {{autonomous}} Christian congregations {{associated with}} one another through distinct beliefs and practices. Represented chiefly in the United States and one of several branches to develop out of the American Restoration Movement, they claim Biblical precedent for their doctrine and practice and trace their heritage back to the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> church {{as described in the}} New Testament.|$|E
5|$|In Christianity, Saint Apollonia is {{the patron}} saint of {{toothache}} and other dental problems. She was an <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> martyr who was persecuted for her beliefs in Alexandria during the Imperial Roman age. A mob struck her repeatedly in the face until all her teeth were smashed. She was threatened with being burned alive unless she renounced Christianity, but she instead chose to throw herself onto the fire. Supposedly, toothache sufferers who invoke her name will find relief.|$|E
5|$|Parentage : The Apollodorus {{responsible}} for the Library lists Troilus last of Priam and Hecuba's sons – a detail adopted in the later tradition – but then adds that {{it is said that}} the boy was fathered by Apollo. On the other hand, Hyginus includes Troilus {{in the middle of a}} list of Priam's sons without further comment. In the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> writings the Clementine Homilies, it is suggested that Apollo was Troilus' lover rather than his father.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the other}} hand, several notable {{scholars}} have {{maintained that the}} <b>early</b> <b>Christians</b> had a thoroughly [...] "Jewish" [...] outlook {{on the nature of}} the resurrection. Contrary to Carrier, N.T. Wright argues that the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> belief concerning resurrection was thoroughly physical and very much related to the common Pharisaic doctrine of resurrection.|$|R
25|$|Bart Ehrman {{argues that}} the {{historical}} Jesus was an apocalyptic preacher, and that his apocalyptic beliefs are recorded in the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> documents: Mark and the authentic Pauline epistles. The <b>earliest</b> <b>Christians</b> believed Jesus would soon return, and their beliefs are echoed in the <b>earliest</b> <b>Christian</b> writings. The Gospel of Thomas proclaims that the Kingdom of God is already present for those who understand the secret message of Jesus (Saying 113), and lacks apocalyptic themes. Because of this, Ehrman argues, the Gospel of Thomas was probably composed by a Gnostic {{some time in the}} early 2nd century.|$|R
5|$|Some <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> {{groups had}} {{separate}} {{descriptions of the}} life and teachings of Jesus that {{are not included in}} the New Testament. These include the Gospels of Thomas, Peter, and Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other apocryphal writings. Most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} depictions of Jesus at the Dura-Europos church are firmly dated to before 256. Thereafter, {{despite the lack of}} biblical references or historical records, a wide range of depictions of Jesus appeared during the last two millennia, often influenced by cultural settings, political circumstances and theological contexts. As in other <b>Early</b> <b>Christian</b> art, {{the earliest}} depictions date to the late 2nd or early 3rd century, and surviving images are found especially in the Catacombs of Rome.|$|E
5|$|Symeon {{wrote in}} a similar style and taught the {{traditional}} views of several <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> fathers and hesychasts, including St. Augustine, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Mark the Hermit. Where Symeon differed from his predecessors was in his transparent and open sharing of his most interior experiences. Symeon was the first Byzantine mystic to freely share those experiences, which were given {{in the context of}} his teaching that the direct experience of God was something to which all Christians could aspire.|$|E

5|$|The abbey {{library was}} {{described}} by John Leland, King Henry VIII's antiquary who visited it, as containing unique copies of ancient histories of England and unique <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> documents. It {{seems to have been}} affected by the fire of 1184, but still housed a remarkable collection until 1539 when it was dispersed at the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Around 40 of the manuscripts from Glastonbury are known to have survived after the dissolution.|$|E
5|$|The custom is {{primarily}} {{associated with the}} ancient Greeks and Romans, though it {{is also found in}} the ancient Near East. In Western Europe, a similar usage of coins in burials occurs in regions inhabited by Celts of the Gallo-Roman, Hispano-Roman and Romano-British cultures, and among the Germanic peoples of late antiquity and the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> era, with sporadic examples into the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Although many aborigines assumed Han {{religious}} practices, several sub-groups sought {{protection from}} the European missionaries, who had started arriving in the 1860s. Many of the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> converts were displaced groups of Plains Aborigines that sought {{protection from the}} oppressive Han. The missionaries, under the articles of extraterritoriality, offered a form of power against the Qing establishment and could thus make demands on the government to provide redress for the complaints of Plains Aborigines. Many of these early congregations have served to maintain aboriginal identity, language and cultures.|$|E

5|$|Chadwick also edited Oxford <b>Early</b> <b>Christian</b> Studies (from 1990). With {{his brother}} Owen, he edited The Oxford History of the Christian Church (12 vols., 1981–2010). His own volumes {{in this series}} were The Church in Ancient Society: from Galilee to Gregory the Great (2001) and East and West: The Making of a Rift in the Church: From Apostolic Times until the Council of Florence (2005). His final work {{was to have been}} on Photios I of Constantinople, {{research}} for which covered many of his interests, particularly classical learning and Christianity, and ecumenism. Some of his material on the topic was published in East and West. He was also an Editorial Advisor of Dionysius. He died in Oxford on 17 June 2008.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{discovery}} of many hundreds of Iron Age sites in Scotland {{there is still a}} great deal that remains to be explained {{about the nature of the}} Celtic life in the <b>early</b> <b>Christian</b> era. Unfortunately radiocarbon dating for this period is problematic and chronological sequences are poorly understood. For a variety of reasons much of the archaeological work to date in Scotland has concentrated on the islands of the west and north and both excavations and analysis of societal structures on the mainland are more limited in scope.|$|E
5|$|Early Medieval architecture's secular {{buildings}} were simple constructions mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Ecclesiastical architecture {{ranged from a}} synthesis of Hiberno—Saxon monasticism, to <b>Early</b> <b>Christian</b> basilica and architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. After the Norman conquest in 1066 various Castles in England were created so law lords could uphold their authority and in the north to protect from invasion. Some of the best-known medieval castles are the Tower of London, Warwick Castle, Durham Castle and Windsor Castle.|$|E
