The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the trends in obesity and sugar consumption in Australia over the past 30 years and to compare and contrast obesity trends and sugar consumption patterns in Australia with the UK and USA. Data on consumption of sugar in Australia, the UK and USA were obtained from the Food and Agriculture Organization for the years 1980 - 2003. The prevalence of obesity has increased 3 fold in Australians since 1980. In Australia, the UK and USA, per capita consumption of refined sucrose decreased by 23 %, 10 % and 20 % respectively from 1980 to 2003. When all sources of nutritive sweeteners, including <b>high</b> <b>fructose</b> <b>corn</b> <b>syrups,</b> were considered, per capita consumption decreased in Australia (− 16 %) and the UK (− 5 %), but increased in the USA (+ 23 %). In Australia, there was a reduction in sales of nutritively sweetened beverages by 64 million liters from 2002 to 2006 and a reduction in percentage of children consuming sugar-sweetened beverages between 1995 and 2007. The findings confirm an “Australian Paradox”-a substantial decline in refined sugars intake over the same timeframe that obesity has increased. The implication is that efforts to reduce sugar intake may reduce consumption but may not reduce the prevalence of obesity...|$|R

The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and obesity in Kuwait {{has been on the}} rise in the last 2 decades; at the moment just over 74 {{percent of the population is}} overweight or obese, according to the World Health Organization. Fructose intake has recently received considerable negative media attention, as the use of <b>high</b> <b>fructose</b> <b>corn</b> <b>syrups</b> has become more widely used. Fructose intake has been believed to be linked with a rise in Metabolic Syndrome and an increase in obesity. It has been considered that moderate fructose consumption of ≤ 50 g/day or ∼ 10 % of total energy has no harmful effect on lipids and of ≤ 100 g/day does not influence body weight. In this study 60 adult participants filled out a two day detailed food diary including quantities. The diaries were then analyzed by a dietitian using the USDA nutrient database and the Food Processor program version 9. 9. 0, and the total fructose intake per day of the normal Kuwaiti diet was calculated. In addition a 24 - hour urine collection for fructose was measured to correlate the results with the food diaries. Once the results were tabulated and verified, a mean fructose intake of 27. 9  grams was calculated, ranging in daily fructose intakes from 2. 8  g to 101. 6 g per day.

40|$|Fructose is {{available}} {{as a component of}} invert sugar and of <b>high</b> <b>fructose</b> <b>corn</b> <b>syrups</b> (HFCS) in which fructose and glucose are present in nearly equimolar concentrations. This study reports on a new mutant, Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATCC 36858, which is able to produce enriched and pure fructose syrups from synthetic glucose/fructose mixtures, sucrose and raffinose, and from molasses media. In this study, the results showed that S. cerevisiae ATCC 36858 can hydrolyze sucrose, raffinose and melibiose then selectively ferment glucose and galactose to ethanol. In batch tests, the fructose yield was above 93 % of the theoretical value in synthetic glucose/fructose media with a total sugar concentration of 300 g/L. The ethanol yield was about 76 % of the theoretical value. The fructose yield was above 90 % of the theoretical value in synthetic media with a sucrose concentration up to 726 g/L and in molasses media with a sugar concentration up to 323 g/L. The ethanol yield was between 72 and 85 % in synthetic media with a sucrose concentration up to 451 g/L. A lower ethanol yield was obtained in molasses media. The strain of yeast used can be considered osmophilic because it can grow in synthetic media even with a sucrose concentration above 530 g/L. In synthetic media with initial raffinose concentrations between 30 and 242 g/L, fructose and ethanol yields were between 82 and 96 %, and 67 and 76 %, respectively. Syrups with more than 97 % fructose based on the final total sugar concentrations can be produced from synthetic media with initial sucrose concentrations below 360 g/L. Even at a sucrose concentration of 574 g/L, the produced syrup contained 59 % fructose and thus, it was richer in this carbohydrate than the ordinary 55 % HFCS. The fructose fractions in the carbohydrate content of the produced syrups was more than 95 % when the total initial sugar concentrations in sugar cane and beet molasses media were below 274 and 242 g/L, respectively. Syrups with more than 96 % fructose based on the final total sugar concentrations can be produced in media with initial raffinose concentrations below 189 g/L. The effects of initial biomass, yeast extract and ethanol concentrations, pH, and media sterilization on the production of fructose and ethanol in synthetic sucrose media were also examined.

40|$|Starch is, after cellulose, one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} polysaccharides produced by plants and is composed of amylose (18 - 33 %) and amylopectin (67 - 82 %). Amylose is a linear molecule consisting of α- 1, 4 -linked glucopyranose residues. Amylopectin is a branched polymer containing α- 1, 6 glycosidic linkages in addition to the α- 1, 4 bonds. The major use of the polysaccharide is its processing for the production of glucose, which is subsequently used to produce crystalline dextrose, dextrose <b>syrups</b> or <b>high</b> <b>fructose</b> <b>corn</b> <b>syrups.</b> Alternatively, glucose may be fermented to produce other products, such as ethanol, aminoacids and organic acids. However, owing to the complex structure of starch, its hydrolysis requires the coordinate action of several enzymes, such as α-amylase, β-amylase, glucoamylase, α-glucosidase and several debranching enzymes. Endo-acting enzymes, such as α-amylase, hydrolyze linkages in the interior of the starch polymer in a random fashion, which leads to the formation of linear and branched oligosaccharides. α-Amylases are among the most important enzymes and find application in the present-day biotechnology. Although they can be derived from several sources, such as plant or animal tissues and microorganisms, the bacterial α-amylases usually meet the industrial demands. In the present thesis the production of a thermophilic α-amylase from Bacillus subtilis, isolated from fresh sheep’s milk, was studied. More specifically, the effect of various physicochemical factors on the productivity of the amylase was investigated thoroughly. Most notable among these parameters were the initial pH and composition of the growth medium, the type and the concentration of carbon, nitrogen as well as phosphate, the presence of surfactants, concentration of inoculum and the culture temperature. Furthermore, a low cost fermentation medium, containing by-products of the food industry, such as corn steep liquor and cheese whey, was developed for the production of α-amylase. Optimization of the growth medium’s composition was achieved by using the above mentioned by-products and other complex organic nitrogen sources, such as tryptone and yeast extract, in different ratios. In an attempt to improve further the α-amylase production alternative methods, other than submerged fermentation, were investigated, such as the extractive cultivation and the use of immobilized cells. More specifically, extractive cultivation was carried out in aqueous two phase systems, composed of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and dextran and the effect of the concentration of the phase-forming polymers on the distribution of α-amylase between the two phases as well as its overall production was studied. Furthermore, a semi-continuous operation, based on the re-circulation of living cells contained in the dextran-rich bottom phase as well as the PEG-rich upper phase, after of course the extraction of α-amylase from this phase, was developed. High amylase productivity was sustained after 12 successive fermentation batches, raising the cumulative α-amylase production to 600, 000 U, while the specific activity of α-amylase produced in this semi-continuous operation was 9 fold higher in comparison to that of the homogeneous system. Immobilization of growing Bacillus subtilis cells in calcium alginate gel capsules resulted in 2 - 3 fold higher α-amylase productivity in comparison to the free cell cultures. The α-amylase yield and the operational stability of the immobilized system were increased by tailoring the capsules’ characteristics. Furthermore, cell immobilization offered the advantage of using the biocatalysts in a semi-continuous fermentation process and concomitantly raising the cumulative α-amylase production to 2, 990, 000 U after 15 successive batches. Interestingly, α-amylase production in the above mentioned semi-continuous fermentation processes was enhanced by the presence of corn steep liquor and cheese whey in the growth medium. ...|$|R

Hepatic expression of lipid metabolism and insulin signaling genes were increased in ALIOS mice compared with normal chow-fed mice. Progressive activation of the mouse hepatic stem cell niche in response to ALIOS correlated with steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation. Hepatocellular neoplasms were observed in 6 of 10 ALIOS mice after 12 months.

5000|$|Dr. Mattson’s {{work has}} {{revealed}} {{mechanisms by which}} diabetes adversely affects hippocampal plasticity and cognitive function. He showed that, in both insulin-deficient rats and insulin-resistant mice, diabetes impairs hippocampus-dependent memory, perforant path synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis, and the adrenal steroid corticosterone contributes to these adverse effects. Changes in hippocampal plasticity and function in both models were reversed when normal physiological levels of corticosterone were maintained, suggesting that cognitive impairment in diabetes may result from glucocorticoid-mediated deficits in neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity. In a related study, Mattson showed that rats fed with a high-fat, high-glucose diet supplemented with <b>fructose</b> <b>corn</b> <b>syrup</b> exhibit alterations in energy and lipid metabolism similar to clinical diabetes, with elevated fasting glucose and increased cholesterol and triglycerides. Rats maintained on this diet for 8 months exhibited impaired spatial learning ability, reduced hippocampal dendritic spine density, and reduced long-term potentiation at Schaffer collateral—CA1 synapses. These changes occurred concurrently with reductions in levels of BDNF in the hippocampus. Dr. Mattson also investigated whether manipulations that enhance neurotrophin levels will also restore neuronal structure and function in diabetes. He found that running wheel activity, caloric restriction, or {{the combination of the}} two treatments increased levels of BDNF in the hippocampus of diabetic mice. Enhancement of hippocampal BDNF was accompanied by increases in dendritic spine density on the secondary and tertiary dendrites of dentate granule neurons. These studies suggest that diabetes exerts detrimental effects on hippocampal structure, and that this state can be attenuated by increasing energy expenditure and decreasing energy intake.
