5|$|Little Thetford {{resisted}} the Parliamentary <b>Inclosure</b> Acts of William IV for sevenyears, {{which may have}} led to the strong Baptist following amongst the poor of the village. About half of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed under the Parliamentary <b>Inclosure</b> Thetford Act of Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The <b>Inclosure</b> (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was not completed in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human occupation from the Mesolithic. This developed for agriculture and extraction of mineral ores into the bronze and Iron Ages. The remains of standing stones, cairns and bridges can still be identified. The royal forest was granted a charter in the 13th century, however foresters who managed the area were identified in the Domesday Book. In the Middle Ages sheep farming was common with a system of agistment licensing the grazing of livestock as the <b>Inclosure</b> Acts divided up the land. The area is now used {{for a range of}} recreational purposes.|$|E

5000|$|The parish {{is mostly}} {{heathland}} and bogland, intermixed with 20th-century forest <b>inclosures.</b> All of the woodlands are {{administered by the}} Forestry Commission as Crown woodland. Many of the forest <b>inclosures</b> on the eastern border of the parish were planted in the 1960s {{in an attempt to}} screen the area from the industrial landscape alongside Southampton Water.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the Christchurch Inclosures Act 1802, {{more than}} 70% of the Westover area was common land. The act, {{together}} with the <b>Inclosure</b> Commissioners' Award of 1805, transferred 5000 acres {{into the hands of}} five private owners, including James Harris, 1st Earl of Malmesbury, and Sir George Ivison Tapps. In 1809 the Tapps Arms public house appeared on the heath. A few years later, in 1812, the first official residents, retired army officer Lewis Tregonwell and his wife, moved into their new home built on land purchased from Tapps. The area was well known to Tregonwell who, during the Napoleonic wars, spent much of his time searching the heath and coastline for French invaders and smugglers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Inclosure</b> Act {{separated}} Gateshead Fell into Wrekenton and Sheriff Hill (collectively High Fell) plus Low Fell. Commissioners {{were appointed}} to settle claims in land and to apportion Gateshead Fell accordingly. Plans were laid for the requisition {{and construction of}} wells (including Carter's Well; located on Durham Road and accompanied today by a commemorative Gateshead blue plaque), quarries, drains, roads, watering places and other essential requirements. Progress was slow, with the last allotment disputes not settled until 1822, {{but by the time}} of completion, Gateshead Fell was entirely enclosed and effectively consigned to history. The divisions of Gateshead Fell have remained more or less settled, so that the villages created by enclosure have survived, almost entirely intact, to the present day.|$|E
5|$|An Enclosure Act is a {{parliamentary}} authority to fence-off common land, thus making that land private property, while awarding commoners land in compensation. <b>Inclosure</b> {{is the name}} given to the parliamentary statute thus created. The enclosure process began in the 13th century and was supported by Acts of Parliament from 1640. In November 1833, the Isle of Ely intended to apply for Acts of Parliament to enclose the lands of Little Thetford. Officials arrived in the village armed {{with nothing more than}} a notice to be pinned on the Church of England's St. George's church door, but were prevented from doing so by a dozen villagers. They returned later with ten constables, authorised by Ely magistrates, and were confronted this time by 150stick-wielding protesters, who continued to prevent due process. When the clergyman, Henry Hervey Baber, arrived the following afternoon, he was prevented from carrying out his normal Sunday service. Villagers may have rebelled against the church at this time, perhaps believing it was acting on behalf of the establishment in the enclosure acts. This event may have been the trigger that, five years later, encouraged a strong Baptist following amongst the poorer villagers. About half the total area of Little Thetford was eventually enclosed in 1844, seven years after that of Stretham.|$|E

60|$|Colonel Coote now drew up {{his army}} {{in order of}} battle, and marched his troops so as {{to take up a}} {{position}} in front of some gardens, and other <b>inclosures,</b> which extended for some distance from the foot of the mountains out on to the plain. These <b>inclosures</b> would serve as a defence, in case the army should be forced to retire from the open.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{the coal}} mines of Wales and {{northern}} England, the Cornish mines generally {{did not provide}} housing for their workers, largely owing to the casual nature of work under the tribute team system. Bal maidens would typically travel to the mines from their family homes, some families building homes near the mine. (Until the <b>Inclosure</b> Acts of the late 18th and early 19thcenturies, anyone moving to an area {{had the right to}} build a house on common land, provided they could build it overnight.) They would generally remain living with their families until marriage. (Much of early 19thcentury Cornwall retained the old custom of 'keeping company', by which a couple would not be formally married until the woman became pregnant, and the woman would continue to work and to live with her family until that time.) While some lived at or near the mine at which they worked, mine workers typically walked three to four miles (five to sevenkm) to and from work each day. The miners' cottages were generally crowded and squalid, sometimes with ten or more people living in each small cottage, while the abstraction of the region's water supplies for use in the mines led to serious problems with sanitation and the provision of fresh water.|$|E

25|$|Show jumping is a {{relatively}} new equestrian sport. Until the <b>Inclosure</b> Acts, which came into force in England in the 18th century, there had been little need for horses to jump fences routinely, but with this act of Parliament came new challenges for those who followed fox hounds. The <b>Inclosure</b> Acts brought fencing and boundaries to {{many parts of the country}} as common ground was dispersed amongst separate owners. This meant that those wishing to pursue their sport now needed horses that were capable of jumping these obstacles.|$|E

25|$|In 1873, {{following}} the General <b>Inclosure</b> Act of 1845, over 300 acres of common land were enclosed. This {{area to the}} north of the town stretched from east to west as far as the Avon and Stour respectively, and thus prevented expansion.|$|E
25|$|In 1792 an <b>Inclosure</b> Act enabled William Currie MP to inclose most of Horsley Common at the {{northern}} end of the parish and the common fields and waste at the southern part, very much on the chalk. The parsonage and glebe were at the same time moved within the parish.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} more {{rectangular}} <b>inclosures,</b> {{which may be}} mentioned here as being connected in all probability with the settlement of which this villa was part, though they are actually over the border of Banstead parish. Two of these are south of the two windmills south of Tadworth. They are well-marked, nearly square <b>inclosures,</b> with a mound and ditch and gateways to the east or south-east. They are east of the road from Betchworth to Banstead. The third is west of the road, and very close to Walton village; but though on land known commonly as Walton Heath, is actually on the Banstead side of the boundary. It {{is larger than the}} others, less well-preserved, and with a gateway to the north-west. Roman tiles may be found in or near all three. These <b>inclosures</b> have been commonly referred to as the 'Roman Camps' on Walton Heath, but it is not obvious that they were camps.|$|R
60|$|They had now {{reached a}} flat shoulder; {{and on this}} the houses were {{somewhat}} scattered, standing in little <b>inclosures,</b> with hedges of cactus and geranium, and embowered in shrubs and flowers.|$|R

25|$|In the 19th century, {{in common}} with many other English towns, Cambridge {{expanded}} rapidly, {{due in part to}} increased life expectancy and improved agricultural production leading to increased trade in town markets. The <b>Inclosure</b> Acts of 1801 and 1807 enabled the town to expand over surrounding open fields and in 1912 and again in 1935 its boundaries were extended to include Chesterton, Cherry Hinton, Fen Ditton, Trumpington, and Grantchester.|$|E
25|$|This {{arises in}} the {{following}} way. We never need four colors in a neighborhood unless there be four counties, {{each of which has}} boundary lines in common with each of the other three. Such a thing cannot happen with four areas unless one or more of them be inclosed by the rest; and the color used for the inclosed county is thus set free to go on with. Now this principle, that four areas cannot each have common boundary with all the other three without <b>inclosure,</b> is not, we fully believe, capable of demonstration upon anything more evident and more elementary; it must stand as a postulate.|$|E
25|$|As the 16th {{century had}} worn on, {{inflation}} in Spain (a result of state debt and, more importantly, {{the importation of}} silver and gold from the New World) triggered hardship for the peasantry. The average cost of goods quintupled in the 16th century in Spain, led by wool and grain. While reasonable {{when compared to the}} 20th century, prices in the 15th century changed very little, and the European economy was shaken by the so-called price revolution. Spain, which along with England was Europe's only producer of wool, initially benefited from the rapid growth. However, like in England, there began in Spain an <b>inclosure</b> movement that stifled the growth of food and depopulated whole villages whose residents were forced to move to cities. The higher inflation, the burden of the Habsburgs' wars and the many customs duties dividing the country and restricting trade with the Americas, stifled the growth of industry that may have provided an alternative source of income in the towns. Another factor was the militaristic nature of the Castilian nobility, which had developed during the centuries of the reconquest of the Iberian peninsula. They preferred careers in the government bureaucracy, the military, or the church, shunning economic activities. This militarism also meant that Spain exhausted its wealth and manpower in near-continuous wars. Under Philip II, these wars {{had much to do with}} combating Protestantism, but in the 17th century it became clear that the world that had existed before 1517 could not be restored. Spain's wars during that century became increasingly more to do with preserving the hegemonic power of the Habsburg alliance in Europe; although it should be noted that the Habsburg alliance was successful in buttressing the Catholic Church against the rise of Protestantism.|$|E
50|$|By 1786 Horton had no large <b>inclosures</b> {{but about}} 150 small ones {{covering}} {{a total of}} 90 acre. A further 460 acre continued to be worked as common fields. West Farm at Horton {{was built in the}} 17th century.|$|R
50|$|Charles Wedge practised as a {{surveyor}} {{and assisted}} John Rennie {{in the construction}} of canals. He was often appointed a Commissioner of the <b>Inclosures</b> and also practised modern agricultural techniques on his farms at Little Wilbraham and Shudy Camps, in Cambridgeshire.|$|R
50|$|In 1801 {{a modest}} sized house called Boscombe Cottage was built as the {{residence}} of Mr Phillip Norris. The Christchurch <b>Inclosures</b> Act 1802 increased the estate size to 17 acre. This property became {{the nucleus of the}} Boscombe Manor Estate.|$|R
500|$|In the Victorian era it {{also became}} a centre for the {{production}} of clothing. The last mill, used as a shirt factory, closed in the early 1950s. William Wilberforce saw the poor conditions of the locals when he visited Cheddar in 1789. He inspired Hannah More in her work to improve the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers. In 1801, [...] of common land were enclosed under the <b>Inclosure</b> Acts.|$|E
500|$|Rhoshirwaun lies [...] to {{the north}} east of Aberdaron, and was {{formerly}} a marshy area. It provided fuel from peat cuttings, pasture for animals and accommodated squatters, mainly fishermen, who had encroached on the common with the tacit acceptance of the community. An <b>inclosure</b> act was drawn up in 1802, designed to remove all squatters who had been there less than 20years. Resistance to the evictions was fierce and was only suppressed by a contingent of dragoons. The act was finally applied in 1814; new roads were built across the moor; boundaries were established; allotments allocated; and wetland reclaimed.|$|E
500|$|On 20 April 2006, Janet Anderson (Member of Parliament for Rossendale and Darwen) asked Margaret Beckett, then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, {{whether the}} {{development}} {{would meet the}} provisions of the Commons Bill regarding the protection of and public access to common land. The reply from Jim Knight, (Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Rural Affairs, Landscape and Biodiversity) was that [...] "hese applications are made under section 147 of the <b>Inclosure</b> Act 1845. Consideration is given under these provision to the effect of the exchange on the general public's legal right of access over the land. The future provisions in the Commons Bill are not relevant." ...|$|E
