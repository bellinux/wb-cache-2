25|$|In The Horse and His Boy, Lewis {{uses the}} {{cultural}} settings of Narnia, Archenland, and Calormen {{to develop a}} theme of freedom in contrast to slavery. Lewis depicts the Calormene culture as one in which a primary guiding principle is that the weak must {{make way for the}} strong: For in Tashbaan there is only one traffic regulation, which is that <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> less important has {{to get out of the}} way for <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> more important; unless you want a cut from a whip or a punch from the butt end of a spear.|$|E

25|$|Emanuel co-wrote, The {{complete}} lives system discriminates against older people. Age-based allocation is ageism. Unlike allocation by sex or race, allocation by age is not invidious discrimination; {{every person}} lives through different life stages {{rather than being}} a single age. Even if 25-year-olds receive priority over 65-year-olds, <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> 65 years now was previously 25 years. Treating 65-year-olds differently because of stereotypes or falsehoods would be ageist; treating them differently because they have already had more life-years is not.|$|E
25|$|Second-impact {{syndrome}} (SIS) {{occurs when}} the brain swells rapidly, and catastrophically, after a person suffers a second concussion before symptoms from an earlier one have subsided. This second blow may occur minutes, days or weeks after an initial concussion, and even the mildest grade of concussion can lead to SIS. The condition is often fatal, and almost <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> not killed is severely disabled. The cause of SIS is uncertain, but {{it is thought that}} the brain's arterioles lose their ability to regulate their diameter, and therefore lose control over cerebral blood flow, causing massive cerebral edema.|$|E

500|$|Machine Head {{finished}} touring for The Burning Red, {{and entered}} a studio with producer Johnny K to record Supercharger. Debuting at number 115 on the Billboard 200, {{the album was}} released on October 2, 2001. The album met the same criticism as The Burning Red, especially for the ever-present rapping vocals. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Borivoj Krgin stated Supercharger [...] "is likely to disappoint <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> expecting the Bay Area quartet {{to return to the}} ultra-testosterone-charged sounds of their first two albums".|$|E
500|$|The first lap {{collision}} between Kvyat and Vettel {{that put}} the latter {{out of the race}} was a major talking point afterwards. The two had already been embroiled in an argument after the previous Grand Prix in China, when Vettel felt that Kvyat had caused a collision between the two Ferrari drivers. This time around, Vettel reacted to his retirement with what The Telegraph described as [...] "one of the most explosive outbursts heard over team radio for years". He later demanded an apology from Kvyat, as did Red Bull teammate Ricciardo, who felt that Kvyat, who pushed Vettel into him, had ruined his race as well. Red Bull announced that they would summon Kvyat to talks about the incident, calling their race a [...] "disaster", with Helmut Marko, the team's young driver coordinator, calling him [...] "over-motivated". Kvyat received three penalty points on his licence {{as a result of the}} incident. He himself said after the race: [...] "I apologise to <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> involved and I will learn from it. I think we have to speak. It is easy now to attack me and I guess everyone will, but I am OK with that." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} on The John and Ken Show on KFI, Headley {{was asked if he}} experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization. He said that he had been issued a declaration that he was to be considered a [...] "Suppressive Person" [...] by members of the organization, and explained, [...] "That's basically the thing that goes out to anyone and <b>everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> in Scientology, saying, 'This person is a Suppressive Person, and you can no longer speak to him ever again.' If you are in Scientology, and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person, you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person." [...] Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a [...] "freeloader statement", a bill for US$62,000, for courses he had received in Scientology. [...] "It's actually illegal, because they are basically charging me for on-the-job training – in California you can't charge somebody for on-the-job training. It's of no real value, but you don't know that, when you're in Scientology. You think, 'Are they going to garnish my wages, are they going to sue me?' You don't know," [...] said Headley.|$|E

500|$|Throughout the year, {{the show}} uses a {{custom-designed}} Winnebago recreational vehicle called the [...] "Wheelmobile" [...] to travel across the United States, holding open auditions at various public venues. Participants {{are provided with}} entry forms which are then drawn randomly. Individuals whose names are drawn appear on stage, five at a time, and are interviewed by traveling host Marty Lublin. The group of five then plays a mock version of the speed-up round, and five more names are selected after a puzzle is solved. <b>Everyone</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> called onstage receives a themed prize, usually determined by the spin of a miniature wheel. Auditions typically last two days, with three one-hour segments per day. After each Wheelmobile event, the [...] "most promising candidates" [...] are invited {{back to the city}} in which the first audition was held, to participate in a second audition. Alternatively, a participant may submit an audition form with a self-shot video through the show's website to enter an audition. Contestants not appearing on stage at Wheelmobile events have their applications retained and get drawn at random to fill second-level audition vacancies. At the second audition, potential contestants play more mock games featuring a miniature wheel and puzzle board, followed by a 16-puzzle test with some letters revealed. The contestants have five minutes to solve as many puzzles as they can by writing in the correct letters. The people who pass continue the audition, playing more mock games which are followed by interviews.|$|E

They were upset at Butler's selection because of her remarks about Israel and specifically her [...] "calls for a boycott against Israel".
