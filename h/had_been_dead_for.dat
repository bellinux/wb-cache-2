5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy {{to hold it in}} a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden effigy with {{a copper}} crown {{was made for}} the funeral; {{this is the first}} known use of a funeral effigy in England, and was probably necessary because of the condition of the King's body, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> three months. Edward's heart was removed, placed in a silver container, and later buried with Isabella at Newgate Church in London. His tomb includes a very early example of an English alabaster effigy, with a tomb-chest and a canopy made of oolite and Purbeck stone. Edward was buried in the shirt, coif and gloves from his coronation, and his effigy depicts him as king, holding a sceptre and orb, and wearing a strawberry-leaf crown. The effigy features a pronounced lower lip, and may be a close likeness of Edward.|$|E
25|$|During 1982, the {{skeletal}} remains of two unidentified women were unearthed near property owned by Wilder in Loxahatchee, Florida. One victim <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> {{one to three}} years, and apparently had her fingers cut off; police theorize that whoever killed her could {{be linked to the}} crime if the body was ever identified.

25|$|In his {{capacity}} as Vice President of the Voluntary Euthanasia Society, later renamed Exit, Koestler wrote a pamphlet on suicide, outlining the case both for and against, with a section dealing specifically with {{how best to}} do it.

25|$|At 12:10a.m. on June 13, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman {{were found}} murdered outside of Nicole's Bundy Drive {{condominium}} in the Brentwood area of Los Angeles. Brown had been stabbed multiple {{times in the}} head and neck, and had defensive wounds on her hands. The larynx could be seen through the gaping wound in her neck, and vertebra C3 was incised; her head remained barely attached to the body. Both victims <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> about two hours prior to being discovered by police. Robert Riske, one of the first two officers on the scene, found a single bloody glove, among other evidence.|$|E

25|$|The Pope had {{appointed}} Carlo Maderno in 1602. He was {{a nephew}} of Domenico Fontana and had demonstrated {{himself as a}} dynamic architect. Maderno's idea was to ring Michelangelo's building with chapels, but the Pope was hesitant about deviating from the master's plan, even though he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> forty years. The Fabbrica or building committee, a group drawn from various nationalities and generally despised by the Curia who viewed the basilica as belonging to Rome rather than Christendom, were in a quandary {{as to how the}} building should proceed. One of the matters that influenced their thinking was the Counter-Reformation which increasingly associated a Greek Cross plan with paganism and saw the Latin Cross as truly symbolic of Christianity.|$|E
25|$|By 1860 Charlotte <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> five years, and {{the only}} people living at the parsonage were Mr. Brontë, his son-in-law, Arthur Bell Nicholls, and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell's {{biography}} of Charlotte was published and though Mr. Brontë at its first reading approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, who hated Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte's writing {{and she had to}} struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters – although this never actually happened.|$|E
25|$|On December 24, 2008 {{at about}} 3:30p.m. (JST), Iijima {{was found dead}} in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment, not far from Shibuya Crossing. She was found lying face-down on the floor when medics forced their way into her place. She <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> about seven days, police said. On March 3, 2007, Sports Nippon had {{reported}} that Ai Iijima was suffering from hay fever, pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), cystitis, and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. In February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia, {{and that there was no}} suggestion of either suicide or murder.|$|E

25|$|In {{the closing}} {{years of the}} {{politically}} and socially unstable Late Republic, any aristocratic owner of gladiators had political muscle at his disposal. In 65 BC, newly elected curule aedile Julius Caesar held games that he justified as munus to his father, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> 20 years. Despite an already enormous personal debt, he used three hundred and twenty gladiator pairs in silvered armour. He had more available in Capua but the Senate, mindful of the recent Spartacus revolt and fearful of Caesar's burgeoning private armies and rising popularity, imposed a limit of 320 pairs as {{the maximum number of}} gladiators any citizen could keep in Rome. Caesar's showmanship was unprecedented in scale and expense; he had staged a munus as memorial rather than funeral rite, eroding any practical or meaningful distinction between munus and ludi.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{one year}} later, on July 5, 1968, the {{partially}} decomposed, mutilated {{body of a}} 20-year-old art student named Joan Elspeth Schell was found by construction workers on an Ann Arbor roadside. She had been raped, then stabbed 25 times with a knife estimated to have measured four inches in length. Several of these wounds had punctured her lungs, liver and carotid artery, with one additional wound inflicted behind her left ear fracturing her skull. In addition, her throat had been slashed, and her miniskirt then tied around her neck. Although Schell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> several days, her entire lower body was in a remarkably preserved condition, whereas her head, shoulders and breasts were in an advanced state of decomposition, leading the pathologist to conclude her body had been stored in a naturally cool environment, but with the upper third of her body exposed to natural heat.|$|E
25|$|In {{between the}} columns were slabs of marble covered in silver about 1.00 to 1.10 meters tall. On {{them had been}} carved the monograms of Justinian and Theodora (6th century), even though Theodora <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> several years, {{as well as a}} many-armed cross in the center. On the center of the {{architrave}} was a repoussé medallion of Christ. On either side of Him were medallions of angels, the Prophets, the Apostles, and finally the Virgin Mary. The carvings on the architrave were deeply tied to the liturgy. Another templon roughly contemporary to Hagia Sophia’s is that of the church to St. John of Ephesus, rebuilt by Justinian as a domed crucifix. There was an inscription to St. John the Theologian over a side door, since the crypt of the saint was within the enclosed sanctuary. St. John the Baptist was probably carved over the other door of the templon of Hagia Sophia, since he features prominently in liturgical writings of the church.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 17 September 2007, a brand-new gym bag was left {{in front of a}} shop lot in PJS 1/48, Petaling Jaya, {{discovered}} by the shop owner. It contained an unidentified child's naked body which was stuffed in a fetal position; police believed that she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> more than six hours before the discovery. A cucumber and a brinjal was found stuffed inside her genitals and had caused her rectum to rupture. It was determined that bacterial infection had contributed to her death. At the time, Nurin Jazlin's parents were not able to identify the body as their daughter's due to the changes in her physical features; it was even suggested that the child might be a foreigner, as she lacked a scar which would be caused by the mandatory BCG vaccination against tuberculosis. Her parents initially maintained hope that their daughter might be alive and were the victims of several prank calls from people claiming that Nurin was under their care. Later DNA tests conducted confirmed the body as Nurin Jazlin's.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Prince's representatives called Howard Kornfeld, a California {{specialist}} in addiction medicine and pain management, seeking medical help for Prince. Kornfeld {{scheduled to meet}} with Prince on April 22, and he contacted a local physician who cleared his schedule for a physical examination on April 21. On April 21, at 9:43a.m., the Carver County Sheriff's Office received a 9-1-1 call requesting that an ambulance be sent to Prince's home at Paisley Park. The caller initially told the dispatcher that an unidentified person at the home was unconscious, then moments later said he was dead, and finally identified the person as Prince. The caller was Kornfeld's son, who had flown in with buprenorphine that morning to devise a treatment plan for opioid addiction. Emergency responders found Prince unresponsive in an elevator and performed CPR, but a paramedic said he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> <b>for</b> about six hours, and {{they were unable to}} revive him. They pronounced him dead at 10:07a.m., 19 minutes after their arrival. There were no signs of suicide or foul play. A press release from the Midwest Medical Examiner’s Office in Anoka County on June 2 stated that Prince had died of an accidental overdose of fentanyl, at the age of 57.|$|E
