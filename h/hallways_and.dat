5|$|At {{about six}} {{o'clock in the}} morning, some of the protesters {{discovered}} a small gate to the palace was unguarded. Making their way inside, they searched for the queen's bedchamber. The royal guards raced throughout the palace, bolting doors and barricading <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> those in the compromised sector, the cour de marbre, fired their guns at the intruders, killing a young member of the crowd. Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|The Youth Performing Arts School {{has its own}} {{building}} a half-block from Manual's main building. It was completed in 1978 {{at a cost of}} $1.5 million as the final stage of the same plan that expanded Manual's campus and built Noe. Noe had been built without an auditorium in anticipation of a theater-oriented school being built on site. The YPAS building includes production facilities, a costume shop and an 886-seat proscenium-style theater. The YPAS building did not contain extensive classroom space, however, and for many years teachers conducted YPAS classes in <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> on loading docks if other space wasn't available. Since 1993, YPAS has used an adjacent facility, built in 1899 and formerly home to Cochran Elementary, as an annex.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to enter}} Cortex's castle after getting there via bridge, Crash climbs the tower walls, {{and enters the}} castle through the window he had {{previously}} escaped from. After making {{his way through the}} dark <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> the Castle's many machines, Crash is confronted by Brio inside his laboratory. Brio uses chemicals to mutate himself into a monster. While Crash is successful in defeating Brio, the castle laboratory catches on fire during the struggle. Crash escapes to Cortex's airship, where he confronts Cortex himself as the castle burns. Cortex attacks him with a plasma gun, but Crash deflects his own projectiles against him and sends Cortex falling out of the sky. Tawna embraces Crash as the two escape the burning castle on Cortex's airship.|$|E

5|$|Just {{outside the}} Eastlake Estates, an honors {{ceremony}} {{was being held}} at Westmoore High School {{at the time of}} the tornado. Adequate warning time allowed those at the school to seek shelter, however, and more than 400 adults and children attending the awards ceremony at the school's auditorium were moved to the main building, sheltering in reinforced <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> bathrooms. Ultimately, Westmoore High sustained heavy damage and dozens of cars in the parking lot were tossed around, some of which were completely destroyed or thrown into nearby homes. No injuries took place at the school, though a horse was found dead between a couple of destroyed cars in this area. The tornado proceeded through additional densely populated areas of Moore shortly thereafter, where several large groups of homes were flattened in residential areas, with a mixture of high-end F4 and low-end F5 damage noted. Near Janeway Avenue, four people were killed in an area where multiple homes were completely destroyed. A woman, who took shelter with her husband and two children, was also killed when she was blown out from under the Shields overpass on Interstate 35. The tornado weakened somewhat as it moved through the Highland Park neighborhood of Moore, but still caused widespread F3 and F4 damage.|$|E

25|$|A Purananuru poem (poem 30) {{says that}} big ships entered {{the port of}} Puhar without slacking sail, and poured out onto the beach {{precious}} merchandise brought from overseas. In the extensive markets of Puhar there were many tall mansions surrounded by platforms reached by high ladders. These mansions had many apartments and were provided with doorways, great and small, and with wide <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> corridors (Pattinappaalai – II –142-158). In {{all parts of the}} town there were flags flying of various kinds and shapes.|$|E
25|$|In new construction, minimum {{requirements}} are typically more stringent. All smoke detectors must be hooked {{directly to the}} electrical wiring, be interconnected and have a battery backup. In addition, smoke detectors are required either inside or outside every bedroom, depending on local codes. Smoke detectors on the outside will detect fires more quickly, assuming the fire does not begin in the bedroom, {{but the sound of}} the alarm will be reduced and may not wake some people. Some areas also require smoke detectors in stairways, main <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> garages.|$|E
25|$|The Andrews Building, {{the first}} {{completed}} {{building of the}} campus named after its designer, John Andrews, was built in a brutalist architectural style and completed in 1964. The interiors were made to mimic streets of a city, with wide <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> balconies on upper floors. The building {{is divided into two}} wings, known as the Science Wing and the Humanities Wing. The Meeting Place, a large atrium at the center of both wings, is often used to hold events. The design of the Andrews Building, along with its unique closed circuit television teaching system, were targets of international acclaim during the decade.|$|E

25|$|A most {{significant}} feature of Ponce High School is its two-story high, elongated auditorium, which {{also contains a}} generous stage area and a U-shaped wood mezzanine supported from the concrete ceiling. Its original lighting fixtures were removed and replaced by fluorescent ones. Classrooms are well lit and ventilated; there are many openings. Walls are plain, having been painted over and over throughout the years. The original wood floor finish is still retained in the library, the auditorium, {{and many of the}} classrooms; some have been substituted or changed to concrete. <b>Hallways</b> <b>and</b> stairs are paved in concrete. Vinyl flooring is used at offices. Glazed concrete tile is found at the lobby, where the original iron grilles, of geometrical design, are still in use.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Arden {{investigates the}} death chute {{to find the}} empty cart Grace was taken from and inhuman {{footprints}} leading out of the tunnel. He later shows Kit a plaster cast of the footprint, believing it to be alien. He asks Kit if {{he had sex with}} wife Alma (Britne Oldford) and Grace (Lizzie Brocheré) before their abductions, thinking the aliens are experimenting with eugenics. Arden asks Kit's permission to cause his temporary death to see if the aliens return. Kit consents, believing it will allow him to see Alma again. Arden renders Kit dead by a potassium chloride injection, promising to revive him in a few minutes with atropine and epinephrine. Bright light and loud sounds fill the <b>hallways,</b> <b>and</b> Arden leaves Kit to find Pepper (Naomi Grossman) and a naked full-term pregnant Grace.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1980s the R. Dakin Company {{assembled}} a large collection {{of contemporary art}} from artists worldwide. The media included watercolor, oil painting, serigraph, lithograph, etching, collage, ceramic plate, sculpture and mixed media. These pieces were used to grace {{the interior of the}} Dakin Building, and were hung in literally all public areas, conference rooms, <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> the atrium. The collection featured some well-known artists and some rising artists, who were not well established at that time. Some of the artists featured are Jeff Glenn, tapistry artist; Barbe; Marachal; Heiliger; Marlatt; Frings; Dudley and Garber. When C. Michael Hogan purchased the building in 1990, he hung some of his art collection to add to the museum character of the building, including a well-known suite of Roberto Matta. When Dakin left the building, Hogan purchased the bulk of the Dakin art collection.|$|E

5000|$|The {{school is}} {{in the shape of}} an [...] "H," [...] with two {{hallways}} on each open end of the [...] "H" [...] on the first floor. The auditorium and the band room are in the first <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> the physical education areas are in the third. Each hallway is given a number. The hallway with the main entrance is #1, the middle <b>hallway</b> is #2 <b>and</b> the <b>hallway</b> with the back entrance facing the football field is #3. The room numbers ar four digit numbers. The first digit is the floor, the second digit is the <b>hallway</b> number, <b>and</b> the last two digits are the room number. For example, the German language classroom is on the first floor, third <b>hallway,</b> <b>and</b> is the 18th classroom in that hallway, therefore the room number is 1318. Similarly, if the room number is 3117, it's located on the third floor, in the first <b>hallway</b> <b>and</b> is the 17th room in that hallway.|$|R
25|$|The Imperial Harem (Harem-i Hümayûn) {{occupied}} one of {{the sections}} of the private apartments of the sultan; it contained more than 400 rooms. The harem was home to the sultan's mother, the Valide Sultan; the concubines and wives of the sultan; {{and the rest of}} his family, including children; and their servants. The harem consists of a series of buildings and structures, connected through <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> courtyards. Every service team and hierarchical group residing in the harem had its own living space clustered around a courtyard. The number of rooms is not determined, with probably over 100, of which only a few are open to the public. These apartments (Daires) were occupied respectively by the harem eunuchs, the Chief Harem Eunuch (Darüssaade Ağası), the concubines, the queen mother, the sultan's consorts, the princes and the favourites. There was no trespassing beyond the gates of the harem, except for the sultan, the queen mother, the sultan's consorts and favourites, the princes and the concubines as well as the eunuchs guarding the harem.|$|E
25|$|Several {{additions}} {{had been}} built onto the original structure between 1970 and 1976, creating a sprawling, non-linear complex of function rooms and service areas. The resulting complex was roughly square in shape, and {{though it was not}} situated in a north-south direction, reports of the fire have tended to assign those points to points in the complex for ease of reference. Assuming this system, the front entrance of the complex lay at the southern point of the compass. Along the central portion of the southern wall, to the east of the building entrance, was a small event room called the Zebra Room. A narrow corridor to the Zebra Room's east separated it from the Viennese Room and a series of service spaces, which ran northward along the building's eastern wall. This interior corridor terminated between the Garden Room, occupying the central portion of the north wall of the building, and the Cabaret Room, which jutted out from the northeastern corner of the building. A smaller, branching corridor led from the internal corridor to an exit door that sat between the Garden Room and the Cabaret Room; to exit the building from the Cabaret Room using that corridor, a person would have, in order, pass through a set of double doors into the main interior corridor, pass through a single door between the main interior corridor and the branching interior corridor, turn a sharp corner into the branching corridor, and proceed approximately one-quarter of the length of the Cabaret Room to the single door that connected the branching corridor to the exterior of the building. This complex navigation was not atypical for the building; a number of other event and services spaces were scattered {{throughout the rest of the}} building, with some rooms leading into each other, some leading into interior <b>hallways,</b> <b>and</b> some leading to the outside of the building. A partial second story covered approximately the southern third of the building, sitting above the main entrance, Zebra Room, and main dining room; it held two more small event rooms made of six smaller rooms conjoined, collectively labeled the Crystal Rooms.|$|E

500|$|The Chemical Safety Board {{released}} its report in September 2009, saying the explosion had been [...] "entirely preventable." [...] It {{noted that the}} sugar industry had {{been aware of the}} risk of dust explosions since 1926. Specifically, internal company memorandums by managers in 1967 expressed their concern about the potential of explosions from sugar dust. Imperial Sugar had recently made construction changes that enabled the accumulation of sugar dust. It had never practiced evacuation procedures, and the lack of emergency lighting meant that people were confined to dark <b>hallways</b> <b>and</b> tunnels {{at the time of the}} explosions.|$|E
500|$|According to hip-hop activist Afrika Bambaataa and b-boy Richard [...] "Crazy Legs" [...] Colón, {{the purest}} hip-hop dance style, {{breaking}} (commonly called [...] "breakdancing"), {{began in the}} early 1970s as elaborations on how James Brown danced to his song [...] "Get on the Good Foot".
