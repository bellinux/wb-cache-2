5|$|A {{player who}} commits three major {{penalties}} (including fighting) {{during a game}} is automatically <b>ejected,</b> suspended, and fined. A player <b>ejected</b> for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted the rule in 2005â€“06, and the NHL includes a fine against the <b>ejected</b> player's head coach.|$|E

50|$|The left <b>eject</b> is lit for 25,000 at {{start of}} game. Hitting this <b>eject</b> scores and {{advances}} the <b>eject</b> hole value (10,000, 25,000, 50,000, 100,000, and 150,000 plus ball lock). Upon locking a ball, right <b>eject</b> lights for lock. Hitting right <b>eject</b> when lit for lock starts multiball. During multiball, completing HARLEY and DAVIDSON scores 5 million, and lights the orbit shots for 1 million each {{for the rest}} of multiball. The jackpot is not related to multiball. After the first multiball, the <b>eject</b> hole resets to 10,000 (no lights).|$|R

5|$|The B-52 shared many {{technological}} similarities {{with the}} preceding Boeing B-47 Stratojet strategic bomber. The two aircraft {{used the same}} basic design, such as swept wings and podded jet engines, and the cabin included the crew ejection systems. On the B-52D, the pilots and electronic countermeasures (EDM) operator <b>ejected</b> upwards, while the lower deck crew <b>ejected</b> downwards; until the B-52G, the gunner had to jettison the tail gun to bail out.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are <b>ejected.</b> <b>Ejected</b> Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or Jupiter-family comets. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 <b>ejected</b> Jupiter trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of {{ejection}} on end-systolic pressure in isolated heart preparations. <b>Ejecting</b> beats were compared with isovolumic beats having the same volume as at end systole. While holding end-systolic volume constant, various stroke volumes, including negative stroke volumes (volume injected during systole), were imposed using a predetermined volume command. After switching contraction mode between <b>ejecting</b> and isovolumic, we measured the immediate and steady changes in end-systolic pressure. In the first isovolumic beat after switching from steady-state <b>ejecting</b> beats, the change in end-systolic pressure was variable, depending on the stroke volume. The end-systolic pressure of the <b>ejecting</b> beat exceeded that of the isovolumic beat on average by up to 18 mm Hg with small stroke volume, but the <b>ejecting</b> end-systolic pressure became lower than isovolumic with either large stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume < 0. 96) or with negative stroke volume. During the transient phase following a switch from <b>ejecting</b> to isovolumic, the end-systolic pressure gradually decreased to a steady state. Consequently, even in steady state, <b>ejecting</b> end-systolic pressure exceeded isovolumic pressure over a significant range of stroke volume (stroke volume/end-systolic volume < 1. 18). After returning contraction mode from isovolumic back to <b>ejecting,</b> w...|$|R

5|$|The {{ultimate}} dissipation of protoplanetary disks is {{triggered by}} a number of different mechanisms. The inner part of the disk is either accreted by the star or <b>ejected</b> by the bipolar jets, whereas the outer part can evaporate under the star's powerful UV radiation during the T Tauri stage or by nearby stars. The gas in the central part can either be accreted or <b>ejected</b> by the growing planets, while the small dust particles are <b>ejected</b> by the radiation pressure of the central star. What is finally left is either a planetary system, a remnant disk of dust without planets, or nothing, if planetesimals failed to form.|$|E

50|$|An {{amount of}} energy {{exceeding}} the atomic binding energy of the s electron must be supplied to that electron in order to <b>eject</b> it from the atom to result in IC; that is to say, internal conversion cannot happen if the decay energy of the nucleus {{is less than a}} certain threshold.
