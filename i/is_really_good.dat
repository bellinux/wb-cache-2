500|$|The album {{has been}} {{described}} as showing that Mitsuda was [...] "well ahead of the curve" [...] when he composed the Chrono Trigger soundtrack. [...] IGN described [...] "Chrono Trigger ~Orchestra Version~" [...] as having a heavy 1970's influence and as being [...] "a testament to Mitsuda's compositional skills", while calling [...] "Chrono Trigger Medley ~Orchestra Version~" [...] "playfully romantic" [...] with [...] "a fairy tale element" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} song that later transforms into [...] "an entirely more grandiose arena". Patrick Gann described the soundtrack as [...] "awesome" [...] and said that [...] "Kameoka <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> at orchestral arrangement". His primary complaint was the length of the album, as he wished it had been a full album instead of a [...] "mini-album" [...] of only two tracks.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the lines}} and scenes from the episode were {{improved}} or ad-libbed by the cast. Jenna Fischer named the party planning scene her favorite scene and called it [...] "longest most horrible meeting of all time". On the commentary track for the episode, Fischer revealed that the scene was almost entirely ad-libbed. At one point, Phyllis Smith, who portrays Phyllis Margaret Vance (née Lapin), made a joke that made every one on set laugh, forcing production to halt for almost 45 minutes. Dwight's [...] "gun show" [...] joke was written by Rainn Wilson. Larry Wilmore later called the [...] "gun show" [...] scene his favorite. Wilmore later said of ab-libs, [...] "part of the fun in writing a show like this is trying to write lines that sound like ad-libs." [...] Daniels also praised the episode's lines, saying, [...] "when you know the acting <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>good,</b> it all sounds like it's been improvised." ...|$|E

500|$|After the band's movie {{debut in}} Roger Corman's Rock 'n' Roll High School (1979), renowned {{producer}} Phil Spector {{became interested in}} the Ramones and produced their 1980 album End of the Century. During the recording sessions in Los Angeles, Spector held Johnny at gunpoint, forcing him to repeatedly play a riff. Though it was to be the highest-charting album in the band's history—reaching number 44 in the United States and number 14 in Great Britain—Johnny made clear that he favored the band's more aggressive punk material: [...] "End of the Century was just watered-down Ramones. It's not the real Ramones." [...] This stance was also conveyed by the title and track selection of the compilation album Johnny later oversaw, [...] Despite these reservations, Johnny did concede that some of Spector's work with the band had merit, saying [...] "It really worked when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'—the production really worked tremendously. 'Rock 'N' Roll Radio' <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>good.</b> For the harder stuff, it didn't work as well." [...] The string-laden Ronettes cover [...] "Baby, I Love You" [...] released as a single, became the band's biggest hit in Great Britain, reaching number8 on the charts.|$|E
500|$|Mariel Concepcion of Billboard {{was also}} {{positive}} of the video, saying that [...] "not only does she {{walk away from}} an unhealthy situation in the clip- she looks completely stunning while doing so." [...] A reviewer from Kayrhythm.com said, [...] "The clip is fairly successful, despite its simplicity and sobriety, which probably result {{from a lack of}} budget. In the song, Kelly is very beautiful and very emotional because it gives way to sadness created by the decline of a relationship with her boyfriend. In the absence of a spectacular clip, Kelly still focused on her wardrobe, perfect for the occasion." [...] The reviewer pointed out that the video works because of Rowland having a good team behind her. [...] "Kelly's team <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>good.</b> Imagine the damage that Kelly could have done with the team of Rihanna!..." [...] Julia Guez of Ados.fr was also critical of the clip, saying, [...] "The aesthetic is the rendezvous, the Destiny's Child alum appears sexier than ever, but why has it increased the costumes? Something is missing...coherence, an imprint? We do not yet see the real Kelly..." ...|$|E

[...] With Hirsh in spring training with the major league team, manager Phil Garner summed up his estimation of Hirsh as follows: [...] "He {{looks to me like}} he maintains good concentration.

2500|$|In Soulcalibur II, Taki {{was given}} more distance-closing moves to help {{compensate}} for her limited range. Nevertheless, the Soulcalibur II guide by GamePro verdicted Taki is an [...] "excellent short range fighter {{with plenty of}} height variation in attack," [...] yet still [...] "weak against good long range opponents" [...] and with [...] "poor offensive capabilities outside short range." [...] The game's review by Marlon Ramos of Philippine Daily Inquirer [...] "of course" [...] highly recommended Taki for the players who are [...] "after speed". In GameSpot's guide to Soulcalibur II, Stephen Kleckner wrote that Taki has [...] "a lot of options and variety which allow her to really mix up her attack heights" [...] and very quick moves making her highly capable at close range, but might [...] "essentially become a moving target" [...] if her player [...] "can't rush down someone who <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> at sustaining a range game, such as Kilik." [...] Andrew Alfonso wrote in GameSpy's guide that [...] "what makes Taki so fearsome is her speed. She's still the fastest character in the game, and despite this her damage potential is still very good at times. However, unlike the big power hitters like Cervantes and Astaroth, she needs to work for her wins." [...] Alfonso added that Taki can be [...] "somewhat hard to learn and execute with" [...] and the key strategy [...] "is to maintain her flow of attack." [...] Taki and Talim, who are both the most acrobatic and fastest characters in Soulcalibur II, were noted to be particularly dangerous in the original version of the HD Online edition due to the Internet multiplayer lag problems.|$|E

I was trying to make a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's to keep us from having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen <b>is</b> <b>really</b> <b>good</b> [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases.
