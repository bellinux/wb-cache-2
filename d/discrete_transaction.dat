The existing literature related to this topic takes three approaches. Prior literature {{on the concept of}} equity has focused mostly on the division problem: how to allocate indivisible goods and how to create a proportionality or prioritization system that appeals to parties 2 ̆ 7 intuitive understandings of fairness. Prior economics and game theory literature has largely focused on explaining how cooperation and coalitions affect the feasibility of discrete transactions, such as spot contracts. Prior literature on international law tends to limit itself to political analysis on how issue linkages have facilitated consensus during treaty negotiations. This Comment tries to link these three approaches together to explain the economic incentives behind a general international phenomenon: the tendency to negotiate in more narrowly defined entitlements (smaller units) to build consensus for ambitious, comprehensive treaties that stretch over several regulatory regimes (greater interdependence). This approach differs from earlier approaches in equity literature because it proposes that parties want more than fair division from a <b>discrete</b> <b>transaction.</b> It differs from previous approaches in contract theory because the parties in focus here are states, who all have incentives to create agreements for the long-term 5 and institutionalize norms that incentivize cooperation.

40|$|Customer {{satisfaction}} {{has long}} been considered top priority in B 2 B markets: it is widely accepted, indeed, that business suppliers’ success in the markeplace is deeply intertwined with their ability {{to look beyond the}} <b>discrete</b> <b>transaction,</b> and to establish long-standing relationships with customers. Customer satisfaction is however costly. While buyers pay growing attention to suppliers’ ability of adding value to the business offering from the very beginning until {{the very end of the}} supplying process, competition facilitates switching behaviours, and makes customers more reluctant to pay premium prices to suppliers that are excellent in managing their satisfaction. It turns out that satisfied customers can sometimes result in dissatisfaction of their suppliers, until extreme cases where customer relationships turn from assets to liabilities. Although such an issue has been discussed thus far mostly in consumer markets, there are hints from recent studies about the relevance of controlling for the efficiency of business customer relationships over time. Indeed, the nature itself of a wide portion of business markets, where few customers account for large shares of suppliers’ portfolios, and thus are key for engendering not only revenues but also costs, suggests that economics of customer satisfaction have to be kept in the highest consideration. This brings the question of how business marketers can reconcile their effectiveness in satisfaction management with their efficiency in managing those costs they incur in attaining satisfaction. Indeed such an issue is receiving growing attention in consumer marketing settings, particularly when it comes to the intangible components of value propositions. Elsewhere (Cugini, Carù and Zerbini, 2007), we have shown how intangible offerings require a re-framing of the assessment of satisfaction and its costs, basing upon the relevance that service components assume for customer segments, and the absorption of costs on those company activities that are related to the production and delivery of those components. In the present article, we build on this research in order to extend it to the management of satisfaction costs of business customers. In that context, traditional segmentation-based analyses poorly fit with satisfaction management. Customization instances are far much relevant, and push towards ad one-to-one solutions whose costs should be assessed on an individual, rather than a group basis. In shifting the unit of analysis, we will provide a guidance to allow cost analysis at the single customer level, thus enabling assessing the economics of one-to-one strategies based on intangible offerings. Therefore, we will answer to recent calls on research in business service settings, and on linking satisfaction and profitability as well. In this article we provide a review of prior studies on the satisfaction-cost management relationships, looking both at the accounting and the marketing domain of research, then we discuss the framework of cost satisfaction management already developed for consumer settings - highlighting the adaptations to be performed once shifting to B 2 B services – to provide a test of this framework on the case of the customers of an advertising business; finally, we discuss how the analysis of business services contributes to the development of a more generalizable framework on the management of satisfaction costs, and will show the implication for practice and the limitations of our analysis...|$|E
40|$|Asset {{variance}} and covariance {{are fundamental}} for {{financial risk management}} and many finance applications. With the advent of tick-by-tick high-frequency data, the estimation of univariate variances and multivariate covariance matrices has attracted more attention from econometricians. Many of the proposed high-frequency variance and covariance estimators are based on time-domain measurements. In this thesis, we investigate variance and covariance estimators constructed on the price domain: the price duration based variance and covariance estimators. A price event occurs when the absolute cumulative price change equals or exceeds a pre-specified threshold value. The time taken between two consecutive price events is a price duration. Intuitively, shorter durations are indicative of higher volatility. The duration-based approach provides a new angle {{to look at the}} high-frequency data, additionally, the duration based variance and covariance estimators are shown to be more efficient than competing time-domain high-frequency estimators. The information advantage of the duration based approach is demonstrated through two empirical applications, a volatility forecasting exercise and an out-of-sample globalminimum-variance portfolio allocation problem. The duration based estimators are shown to provide both better forecasting performance and better portfolio allocation results. The paper in Chapter 2 is under the first round Revise&Resubmit to the Journal of Business & Economic Statistics. In Chapter 2, we discuss the estimation of univariate variance using price durations. Variance estimation using high-frequency data needs {{to take into account the}} effect of market microstructure (MMS) noise, including <b>discrete</b> <b>transaction</b> times, discrete price levels, and bid/ask spreads, as well as price jumps. The price duration estimator has a built-in feature to be robust to large price jumps, while its robustness against the MMS noise is achieved through a careful selection of the threshold value that defines a price event. We discuss the selection of this optimal threshold value through both simulation and empirical evidence. We devise both a non-parametric and a parametric estimator. For the estimation of integrated variance at a daily frequency, the non-parametric duration based variance estimator suffices, while the parametric estimator additionally provides us with an instantaneous variance estimator. As an empirical application to 20 DJIA stocks, we compare the volatility forecasting performance of three classes of volatility estimators, including the realized volatility, the option implied volatility, and the price duration based volatility estimators, on one-day, one-week, and one-month horizons. Forecasting comparisons among individual estimators, as well as in a combination setup, are considered. The duration based estimators, especially the parametric price duration volatility estimator, are found to provide more accurate out-of-sample forecasts. In Chapter 3, we introduce a covariance matrix estimator using price durations. In the multivariate setting, there is the additional issue of nonsynchronous trade arrival times when estimating a high-dimensional variance-covariance matrix using tick-by-tick transaction data. Through simulation, we assess the effects of the lasttick time-synchronization method and MMS noise on the duration based covariance estimator, and compare its accuracy and efficiency with other candidate covariance estimators. Since the covariance matrix is estimated on a pairwise basis, it is not guaranteed to be positive semi-definite (psd). To reduce the number of negative eigenvalues produced by a non-psd matrix, we devise an averaging estimator which is the average of a wide range of duration based covariance matrix estimators. This estimator is applied to a portfolio of 19 DJIA stocks on an out-of-sample global minimum variance portfolio allocation problem where the objective is to minimize the one-day ahead portfolio variance. A simple shrinkage technique is used to improve non-psd and ill-conditioned matrices. The price duration covariance matrix estimator is shown to provide a comparably low portfolio variance while yielding considerably lower portfolio turnover rates than previous estimators...|$|E
40|$|Attention in the {{alliance}} literature has developed from {{a focus on}} strategic alliances and joint ventures to a broader focus including marketing based alliances such as co-marketing, co-development (Crespin-Mazet and Ghauri, 2007). In doing so the empirical literature has followed the tide of practitioner activity that has flowed from manufacturing and associated rigid structures, to {{a greater emphasis on}} service and alliance roles that are typically less pre-defined. This brings with it a general emphasis on short-term task-specific interactions between firms. These are, by their nature, characteristically collaborative and frequently non-equity arrangements. In these contexts strategy can be emergent and outcome measures uncertain at the outset, with the result that the process of exchange usurps discrete performance outcomes as a true measure of efficacy. Clear understanding of this process of exchange and the antecedent conditions responsible for effective exchange is much needed yet lacks proper attention and clear explanation in the literature. Explanation is commonly couched in a buyer – seller dyadic context with a transaction costs emphasis (Heide, 2003, Parkhe, 1993, Subramani and Venkatraman, 2003, Williamson, 1985, Yilmaz and Kabadayi 2006), and where relational perspectives are explored this is frequently an extension of transaction costs logic with attention to ‘transaction costs, [] and high asset specificity’ (Bunduchi 2008). Attention is also given to interdependencies between partner firms (Bunduchi 2008) and information exchange (Sobrero and Schrader 1998) but these are frequently set out as explanations of forbearance under conditions of uncertainty further demonstrating a transaction costs perspective. A fuller explanation of successful collaborative exchange requires a departure from this logic towards one in which the nature of exchange will be knowledge-based rather than property-based (Hoetker and Mellewigt, 2009), one which can facilitate an understanding of the antecedent conditions of this ‘intensive and reactive rhythm’ (Crespin-Mazet and Ghauri 2007) and one that responds to calls for research in the understanding of the development of these exchange norms (Palmatier 2007). 	The present study seeks to address this gap by conceptualizing exchange behaviour among collaborating non-hierarchical firms. This operational exchange process is described from a social exchange perspective. This conceptualization marks a departure from the transaction costs logic providing an explanation of the social exchange process and is a central contribution of the study. The antecedent conditions necessary for successful operational exchange receive little attention in the literature. A further contribution of the present study is the modeling of these conditions as antecedents to operational exchange. 	Non-equity collaborative alliances were taken from the UK construction industryand analysed through Structural Equation Modeling using AMOS software. The measurement model was assessed for reliability using construct reliability and Cronbach’s coefficient alpha with both measures giving values above. 70 (Nunnally 1978). Convergent validity is demonstrated through confirmatory factor loadings >. 51 for each item on its respective construct, and average variance extracted values for each construct above >. 50 (Fornell & Larcker 1981). The confirmatory factor analysis showed that the proposed factor model had a good fit to the data with CFI and NNFI values above 0. 90, and a RMSEA value indicating an acceptable fit (Byrne 2001), χ 2 (46) = 83. 773, p= 0. 000, CFI= 0. 96, NNFI= 0. 96, RMSEA= 0. 07. 	The results give support for the hypothesised relationships between prior relational and relational capital and compatibility among partner firms and relational capital. These variables form the antecedent conditions for successful operational exchange between partners which is presented as the outcome variable in this study. The study contributes to understanding of the function of operational exchange as an on going reciprocal process by clarifying the distinction between this and a <b>discrete</b> <b>transaction</b> perspective of exchange. A further contribution of the study is the identification of firm size as a negative moderator of compatibility on relational capital. In larger firms the function of compatibility in this antecedent arrangement is muted and this effect is explored in the study. Managerial implications abound, however specific deliverable messages centre on the importance of relationship capital in facilitating a barrier-free exchange of valuable information as an ongoing feature of a successful alliance exchange process. Prior close relationships across social contexts aid the development of relational capital. A desire for fairness and transparency may lead decision makers to under value existing social relationships in professional contexts, however social capital aids the exchange process in collaborative business to business alliances and there are benefits in acknowledging and accommodating this. Compatibility is central to avoiding negative influences on the development of relationship capital. Commonly held as a pre requisite among alliance partners this is less variable among larger firms and remains a particular area for attention in smaller firms...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} {{by the need to}} speed up complex network simulation, especially in telecommunications settings, where high bandwidth translates into exorbitant numbers of packets that take inordinate CPU time to simulate. Since the simulation complexity of fluid workload is invariant under scaling bandwidth, flows of discrete units of workload may be replaced by (approximate) fluid streams for savings in CPU time and memory storage. To this end, the paper outlines the design of a new hybrid simulator, called HNS (Hybrid Network Simulator). HNS simulates the movement of workload in a queueing network, where transactions may be of two types: traditional <b>discrete</b> <b>transactions</b> (e. g., packets) and continuous (fluid) transactions, all of which arrive discretely at the network in traffic flows, and each discrete arrival carries a workload. Arriving transactions only differ in the way their workload is transported: the user specifies whether the workload should be packetized or fluidized, respectively, for transport across the network. The novel feature of HNS is that it admits models with both discrete and continuous traffic flows, and collects detailed statistics for both, including arrival, loss, buffer contents, departure, and delay statistics. HNS facilitates the fundamental trade off between the modeling accuracy of discrete flows and savings i...|$|R

Marketing researchers have often cited reciprocity as an important aspect of relational exchange; however the extant research has not conceptualized or measured reciprocity in marketing relationships. This research is a first attempt to explicate the role of reciprocity in these exchange relationships. Reciprocity is first conceptualized as a component of <b>discrete</b> <b>transactions.</b> A theoretical model is built and tested in (a) a laboratory setting and (b) through a survey of car dealership managers. The role of reciprocal debt is established and shown to impact exchange relationships. Next, reciprocity is conceptualized as a multidimensional element of ongoing exchange relationships. Through a survey of business customers of a bank, the existence of relational reciprocity is established and shown to impact numerous indicators of relationship success.

These conceptual developments along with growing competitiveness of Iranian financial services industry, have urged top management of this industry to seek more accurate ways on how to better manage their relationships with customers and prevent losses by distinguishing high value and low value customers. Although there are many value measurement tools developed by researchers in different industry settings, there is no such model specified to financial services which brings into account the risk of relationship. This research has focused on developing a value measurement model by which a bank’s management could better decide whether a business credit facility applicant is worth the resources s/he receives. This model is developed based on “customer lifetime value” concept and is risk-adjusted to overcome this common flaw of such models. The risk is modeled by both Delphi method (qualitative risk) and logistic regression method (quantitative risk) to partially resolve the unreliability issues concerned with financial statements in Iran.

5000|$|Relational {{contract}} {{theory is}} characterized by a view of contracts as relations rather than as <b>discrete</b> <b>transactions</b> (which, Macneil argued, traditional “classical” or [...] "neo-classical contract" [...] theory treats contracts as being). Thus, even a simple transaction can properly be understood as involving a wider social and economic context. For instance, if A purchases a packet of cigarettes from a shop he has never been into before and will never enter again, that seems quite discrete. However, A will almost certainly have a loyalty to a particular brand of cigarettes and expectations about quality about which he would be prepared to complain to the manufacturer, although he has no contractual privity with the manufacturer. There is also an understanding that A will pay for the cigarettes, not simply run off with them, and that if he tenders a £10 note in exchange for the cigarettes which are priced at £6, the paper money will be acceptable and change of £4 will be given. None of this is explicitly stated between the parties, whose conversation is likely limited to “20 Marlboro, please” on A’s part and “That’ll be £6, please” {{on the part of the}} retailer. Thus, even the simplest transaction has a good deal that is unstated and dependent on a wider web of social and economic relations. How far outwards into that web one needs to investigate will depend on the transaction and on the purpose for which it is being examined.|$|R

40|$|New {{organisational}} forms, including strategic {{partnerships and}} networks, are replacing simple market-based transactions and traditional, bureaucratic, hierarchical organisations (Webster, 1992). The {{shift in the}} way marketing is being organised is accompanied by both environmental and structural changes (Morgan and Hunt, 1994; Palmer, 2000; Investor Digest, 2001). This new emerging paradigm of thought argues {{that it is more}} important to focus on the development and management of relationships than on <b>discrete</b> <b>transactions</b> (Ford, 1980; IMP Group, 1982; Webster, 1992; Gronroos, 1994 a, 1994 b, 1995, 1997 a, 1997 b; Berry, 1995). These business-to-business buyer-seller trading interactions have been revealed to take place under a variety of governance structures (Bradach and Eccles, 1989; Heide, 1994), with each one undergoing different stages of development (Dwyer et al., 1987). Despite this overall agreement, existing relationship marketing literature appears silent regarding the deciding factors that determine whether or not a business relationship is continued. More specifically the literature appears to lack any information and normative guidelines as to the relative importance of criteria when assessing the performance of a business relationship (i. e., the relative importance of performance criteria within and between relationship development stages). Consequently, this study examined the bilateral governance structure, business relationship development stages and performance measures in relationship marketing. A conceptual matrix framework was developed with the most representative performance measures in the framework being operationalised. The framework was tested with the aid of self-completion questionnaires in the UK manufacturing sector, the study setting, which has been achieved through a positivist empirical situational study in the form of scenarios. The findings provided an original contribution to academia through an evaluation of the relative importance of performance measures as deciding factors in furthering the development of a business relationship within a bilateral governance structure. For example, there was differential importance of evaluation criteria within and between stages. Within all the stages trust was significant, whilst only commitment and transaction-specific asset investments were significant within the initiation stage; opportunistic behaviour was significant within the monitoring and termination stages; and distance within the initiation and monitoring stages. When moving from the initiation to monitoring stage, commitment and distance were significant. In addition, distance was also significant when moving from the monitoring to termination stages, and when moving from the initiation to termination stages, commitment and opportunistic behaviour were significant. In addition, a contribution has been made to business practice, through the development of normative managerial guidelines to aid decision-making when moving forward or not along the relational continuum under a bilateral governance structure. For example, trust was found to be a significant determinant for all stages of the business relationship and remains constant across all these stages. This implies that suppliers, whether potential or existing, should attempt to demonstrate high levels of trust at all stages of a business relationship. This can be achieved by different actions in different stages of the business relationship...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} decade, the retail banking {{industry}} started {{to face a}} set of radically new challenges that had an overall negative impact on industry margin and profitability. In response to these challenges, more and more retail banks have focused on increasing the scale of their operations, {{which has led to}} a rising importance of mergers and acquisitions (M&A). From a Marketing perspective, M&A transactions are nothing other than the acquisition of the customer base of one company by another one, usually {{based on the assumption that}} the acquiring bank can manage this customer base more profitably than the selling bank was able to. It is therefore not surprising that questions about the valuation of customers have become more important than ever in the retail banking industry. Our article provides a contribution in this area by presenting a customer valuation model that we developed in cooperation with a leading German retail bank, which takes account of the specific requirements of this industry.

40|$|We {{consider}} the delta-hedging strategy for a vanilla option under the <b>discrete</b> hedg-ing and <b>transaction</b> costs, assuming that an option is delta-hedged using the Black-Scholes-Merton model with the log-normal volatility {{implied by the}} market price of the option. We analyze the expected profit-and-loss (P&L) of the delta-hedging strategy assuming the four possible dynamics of asset returns under the statistical measure: the log-normal diffusion, the jump-diffusion, the stochastic volatility and the stochas-tic volatility with jumps. For all of the four models, we derive analytic formulas for the expected P&L, expected transaction costs, and P&L volatility assuming hedging at fixed times. Using these formulas, we formulate the problem of finding the opti-mal hedging frequency to maximize the Sharpe ratio of the delta-hedging strategy. Also, we show that the Sharpe ratio of the delta-hedging strategy can be improved by incorporating the price and delta bands for the rebalancing of the delta-hedge and provide analytical approximations for computing the optimal bands in our opti-mization approach. As illustrations, we show that our method provides a very goo...|$|R
40|$|The {{viability}} of long-term investment contracts {{is dependent on}} the effective and efficient distribution of risk and reward between the parties, while retaining the potential for flexibility in the face of future pressures for alteration. Petroleum contracts as long-term state contracts have complex economic and legal aspects, and their performance depends upon a durable relationship between the investor, whether foreign or domestic, and the host government. Such contracts cannot be seen as <b>discrete</b> commercial <b>transactions</b> or isolated agreements. Hence, the sustained contractual relationship for petroleum transactions is based on the ability to accommodate changing expectations in changing circumstances, and on the ongoing balance and adjustment of contractual rights and obligations in changed framework. International energy investment agreements are very vulnerable and exposed to a range of actions or inactions by public authorities (government or state agencies) which could considerably affect the profitability of a project. Amongst the principal reasons for the risk of expropriation is that the host state seeks to obtain a greater share of the return from a successful operation, by raising taxes or tightening other provisions in the investment contract without necessarily taking over ownership of the investment or to drive the investor out of business. As a result, the business relationship between the foreign oil company and host government resembles a model of an ‘obsolescing bargain’, (OBM). The thesis explores the role of the contractual equilibrium and bargaining positions and their interactions with contractual clauses in a relational model of relationship to reduce and manage risk of expropriation in international energy investment transactions. The thesis examines the classical and the relational theories of contract and their response to contractual obligations, and then suggests an adaptive contractual mechanism to maintain the equilibrium of the contract {{in order to protect the}} contracting parties’ interests and resolve disputes. ...|$|R
40|$|Contemporary {{marketing}} studies {{claim that}} in order to effectively create value firms should approach themselves and the market through a service-dominant logic (SDL) rather than a goods-dominant logic (GDL). Whereas GDL draws attention to tangible output and <b>discrete</b> <b>transactions,</b> SDL emphasizes knowledge and skills, exchange processes, and relationships. Overall, SDL enables a broader view on value creation. For {{the purposes of this study}} I approached SDL as a particular strategic perspective on value creation, forming the backbone of a service-dominant strategy. I focused especially on customer value, which refers to customer-perceived benefits less sacrifices. Despite the proliferation of research on SDL it had attracted little empirical examination. There was a lack of studies on how service-dominant strategies could be constructed and formulated. In addition, strategy research had not focused on how companies could accomplish value creation, although it is a prerequisite for continued success and survival. In order to narrow this research gap I set out to develop a novel theoretical framework to strategizing about customer value creation, and to elaborate on this perspective empirically through a case study set in a waste management start-up. The framework builds on the so-called practice turn in social theory and strategy research. The practice approach enables a simultaneous view on the micro-activities and the macro-cultural structures that constitute strategizing. According to the practice-theoretical framework, strategizing is a social activity that arises from habituated tendencies and dispositions rather than from deliberate and purposeful reflection. Thus, a strategic perspective on value creation is immanent in strategizing: it builds on the social practices that strategy practitioners draw upon. The case study involved ethnographic materials and analysis. Over a period of 20 months I participated in the start-up company’s meetings and negotiations, which constituted a considerable part of the overall strategizing. The aims were to identify the most significant social practices involved, and to analyze how they enabled or inhibited a service-dominant strategy and the tensions they formed with regard to a strategic perspective on value creation. Overall, the case study provided a nuanced view on the practical complexities of strategizing about customer value creation in the context of new business development. I found that the strategizing built largely on ten practices, including engaging in product hobbyism and building large networks, which had different inherent logics that guided the strategizing. I also identified seven tensions between the inherent logics, such as rigid versus flexible organizational boundaries and atomistic versus holistic offerings, which were ‘played out’ in the everyday strategy making, sometimes sparking observable conflicts. Significantly, I discovered that the construction of a service-dominant strategy hinged upon how the tensions were resolved. The present study has several contributions to marketing and strategy-as-practice research. With regard to the SDL literature in marketing, the novel theoretical framework, with its solid foundation in the practice turn, will enable researchers to examine different strategic perspectives on value creation in the social practices of strategizing. The case study provides an extensive empirical exploration of the construction of a service-dominant strategy, which was found to depend on specific practical tensions. It also showed that multiple perspectives on value creation coexist within a single organization. With regard to strategy-as-practice research, this study highlights the worldview on value creation that is always immanent in strategizing, and emphasizes the role of extra-organizational actors in co-creating value. Furthermore, whereas previous strategy research has focused on struggles between ideologies and discourses, this study acknowledges the embodied nature of the tensions between practices. In addition, the empirical part demonstrates the role of historically and culturally transmitted, trans-individual practices. It also sheds light on strategizing in a small entrepreneurial company, which is something that has been overlooked. Finally, practitioners could use this study to create space for alternative strategies to emerge by reflecting on the different perspectives on value creation that are presented in the theoretical framework. In shifting toward a service-dominant strategy they could use the tensions that were identified in the case study as a tool enabling them to focus on the most significant aspects of strategizin...|$|R
40|$|This article conceptualizes {{recently}} enacted legislation addressing 2 ̆ 2 derivative forward agreements 2 ̆ 2 (DFAs) and 2 ̆ 2 synthetic disposition arrangements 2 ̆ 2 (SDAs), {{as well as}} the subsequently proposed provisions addressing 2 ̆ 2 synthetic equity arrangements 2 ̆ 2 (SEAs), {{as examples}} of specific anti-avoidance rules that are risk-based overrides of the concept of share ownership for private-law purposes in the assignment of income tax attributes. Although these specific anti-avoidance rules address <b>discrete</b> and unrelated <b>transactions,</b> they share some broad design features. Most importantly, they take the form of detailed rules rather than generally expressed standards, and they incorporate risk exposure, either explicitly or implicitly, as a proxy for taxpayer purpose for a range of targeted transactions. The author argues that this set of risk-based overrides of ownership in the Income Tax Act could be recast using a uniform approach to the targeting of each of the relevant transactions. This approach involves the specification of a level of risk exposure explicitly as a percentage amount, which holds the possibility of more accurate targeting [...] particularly if the specification is tailored differently for different overrides [...] than is currently the case using either imprecise verbal formulas or proxies for risk exposure. Precise specification requires, however, precise measurement of risk exposure, which presents certain practical challenges and suggests some practical limitations. Moreover, boundaries in the tax law that are the source of tax-driven substitution are especially problematic with respect to a bright-line distinction between tax-driven and non-tax-driven positions in property that is characteristic of precise specification and should ideally be backstopped with a purpose-based standard rather than reliance on the general anti-avoidance rule in section 245 of the Act. The author suggests that, despite skepticism in the literature, the financial concept of delta provides a measurement tool that is feasible with positions in traded shares. This potential is not inconsiderable, since traded shares tend to be a particular focus of the relevant set of avoidance transactions addressed by risk-based overrides. For other types of property, including non-traded shares, an imprecise specification of risk exposure using verbal formulas and a purpose-based standard may be used in preference to the existing set of eclectic approaches to the targeting of risk-based overrides as specific anti-avoidance rules...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{analyses and}} contextualises {{the results of}} archaeological investigations carried out between 1998 and 2000 on Mer and Dauar in Torres Strait. Along with Waier these small volcanic islands {{are commonly known as}} the Murray Islands, and form the most eastern group of the formation of islands scattered between northeastern Australia and southern Papua New Guinea. Unlike the research into human occupation and subsistence in Australia and New Guinea, the archaeology of the Torres Strait Islands is by contrast a relatively recent academic pursuit. Over the last 30 years various researchers have postulated the timing of first human occupation of Torres Strait, the development of maritime and horticultural subsistence systems and the emergence of ethnohistorically documented trade networks. A lack of archaeological data, however, has prevented informed consideration of these issues. This dissertation presents the results of the first systematic archaeological excavations undertaken in the Eastern Torres Strait, and includes the first detailed radiocarbon chronological sequence for the Murray Islands and for the Torres Strait more generally. The excavations on Dauar revealed extensive archaeological deposits of marine subsistence remains, and previously unrecorded material culture of Torres Strait; most notably, several sherds of earthenware pottery. These artefacts have provided new opportunities for investigating the traditional trade and exchange networks between the Torres Strait Islands and New Guinea that existed at the time of European contact. The Murray Islands data illustrates the existence of a maritime subsistence base from the time of first human occupation now securely dated to almost 3000 years BP. Although plant macrofossils where absent during the excavations, evidence for horticultural subsistence on Dauar was identified through the extraction and identification of plant phytoliths and starch grains from excavated sediment samples. In combination with the radiocarbon site chronologies and changes to sediment deposition rates and assemblage densities, it is concluded that these results indicate the onset of widespread clearance and horticultural activities on the island from at least 2000 years BP, providing the earliest date for the emergence of horticulture so far established in Torres Strait. Dated to between 2000 and 700 years BP, the excavated pottery from Dauar suggests the possibility of sustained linkages between the peoples of the Eastern Torres Strait and New Guinea. Ethnohistoric records suggest southward trade into the Eastern Torres Strait was dominated by southwestern coastal Papuan communities, and particularly by groups of the Fly Estuary. Surprisingly, mineralogical analysis of selected pottery sherds from the Murray Islands revealed the presence of sand tempers sourced to the metamorphic and volcanic lithology of the Eastern New Guinea Highlands. More accurately, these results are concluded to portray linkages between the Torres Strait and the adjacent southern Papuan lowlands through which more <b>discrete</b> movements and <b>transactions</b> with interior areas occurred along key riverways that connected the hinterland to the coast. The timing of human occupation of Torres Strait, the development of subsistence systems and the relationships that islanders had with the peoples of northern Australia and the western Pacific have only started to be explored archaeologically. It is concluded from the combined ethnohistorical and field archaeological evidence that settlement and subsistence in Torres Strait is a product of late-Holocene human expansions and cultural intensification previously documented for the adjacent mainlands and the broader western Pacific region. This research confirms that the archaeology of Torres Strait must be interpreted within the broader cultural, chronological and geographical context in which it is centrally located...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the article}} {{is an attempt to}} ground the concept of {{transformation}} of national institutional environment as the prerequisites for forming of prosperous class of small and medium-sized enterprises. Institutional analysis considers the interaction on the level of individuals and divides a market transaction into transactions (institutional agreements), estimating their value with the help of transaction costs. We conducted a systematization of the notion that brings the institutional environment to the aggregate of norms, regulations, agreements, rules of the game. For the quality assessment of institutional environment on the macrolevel, direct indicators of its assessment were used – quality indexes in international ratings and activities of specialized institutional researches. Practical significance. In the result the quality of the institutional environment of the assessment of The Global Competitiveness Index is extremely low and needs a systematic increase. Values of indicators of a pillar “Institutions” of The Global Competitiveness Index should be a guiding line for development and introduction of state economic policy. An important line of investigations of development mechanism’s improvement and regulatory policy’s conducting is the institutional environment conception that combines the notions of institute, institutional agreements and transaction costs. A model of institutional environment allows determining of the regulatory policy as a policy that changes elements of institutional environment – institutions, displays in changes of transaction costs. It is grounded that a state apparatus consciously sets as an object the increase of socio-economic role of the entrepreneurship through the creating of favourable conditions of its functioning; a way of this object’s achievement is the regulatory policy, efficiency criterion of which is the improving of national institutional environment’s quality that is measured by reducing of transaction costs of entrepreneurship subjects. All stated above allows describing the mechanism of regulatory policy in the field of entrepreneurship as a logical order. Measures of regulatory policy influence the quality of institutional environment that leads to the change in transaction costs’ value related to its use. A schematic model of modern institutional environment is developed. In accordance with the rules of methodological individualization, subjects of institutional economic relations are separate entities, individuals. Subjects implement among themselves standard institutional agreements, which are presented by lines (“tracks”). These “tracks” necessarily go through formal and informal institutions. Conclusion of institutional agreements is the choice among the institutional alternatives, <b>discrete</b> choice and <b>transaction</b> performance. Some institutions (both formal and informal) can be not involved into conclusion of institutional agreements, thus it is the question of institutions market – subjects’ possibility to choose institutions for interaction. Subjects can conclude institutional agreements within the framework of company or state (hierarchies of institutions with certain cruelty) or within the framework of market (relatively soft institution). An important socio-economic role of small and medium-sized enterprises must be confirmed by effective public policy with its support and development. Institutional economic analysis provides the possibilities of qualitative research of problems of small and medium-sized enterprises, developments and introduction of regulatory police, determining of the criteria of its efficiency. The use of system model of institutional environment and principle of methodological individualism allows considering the economic interaction between representatives of small and medium-sized enterprises and state. An increase of institutional environment quality is the main task of regulatory policy. The quality of Ukrainian institutional environment by the criteria of international rating Doing Business in comparison with the leading countries during 2007 - 2013 not exceeded 27 %. A criterion of regulatory policy effectiveness in the model of institutional environment is a cheapening of institutional agreements, i. e. transaction costs decrease that leads to increase of socio-economic effectiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises...|$|R
