In 2010, during his time at the university, he registered a YouTube account under the name PewDiePie. The following year, {{he dropped out of}} Chalmers after becoming disinterested with his degree field, much to the dismay of his parents. After failing to earn an apprenticeship with an advertising agency in Scandinavia, he then decided to focus on creating content for his YouTube channel. In order to fund his videos, PewDiePie began selling prints of his Photoshop art projects and working at a hot dog stand. PewDiePie soon gathered a rapidly increasing online following, and in July 2012, his channel surpassed one million subscribers.|$|E

500|$|During {{his early}} {{schooling}} life, {{he was interested}} in art, and has detailed that he would draw popular video game characters such as Mario and Sonic the Hedgehog. During high school, he would skip classes to play video games at an Internet cafe with friends; on this topic, PewDiePie has commented, [...] "Sweden has a great culture around gaming." [...] In 2008, he graduated from Göteborgs Högre Samskola. He then went on to pursue a degree in <b>industrial</b> <b>economics</b> and technology management at Chalmers University of Technology, but left the university in 2011. On his decision, PewDiePie has stated, [...] "Thinking about it now, it was utterly absurd. To get into Chalmers for <b>industrial</b> <b>economics</b> you need straight A's, but somehow I was happier selling hot dogs and making my own gaming-videos." [...] While his reason for leaving Chalmers has often been reported as a want to focus on his YouTube career, in 2017, PewDiePie clarified, [...] "Why does everyone get this story wrong? [...] I dropped out of university because I didn't like it. To drop out of university to pursue YouTube, that'd just be fucking stupid." [...] He added that [...] "industrial management and economics [...] boring as hell [...] I couldn't relate to fucking anyone." ...|$|E
