500|$|The Sugababes and the song's {{producers}} and programmers, Flex Turner and Elliot Malloy, received co-writing credits on the song. [...] "Denial" [...] was mixed by Jeremy Wheatley at Twenty One Studios, London, with assistance from Richard Edgeler. The song's instruments {{were provided by}} Pete Boxsta Martin and Wheatley. When Metro questioned Brown about her feelings towards the group's ownership of the song, she responded: [...] "When you write songs for other people you’ve <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it go, it becomes their property, they have to interpret {{it in the way}} they feel. You can’t be too precious about it otherwise you wouldn’t have given it away in the first place." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Buddy Guy, [...] " [...] {{feel this}} {{psychedelic}} stuff at all... {{and if the}} feeling is gone, that's it. You can't get too busy behind a singer. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What the hell do you have a record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm so sick of that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Burn" [...] was {{considered}} a [...] "window to Usher's inner thoughts", along with the controversial track [...] "Confessions" [...] and [...] "Confessions Part II". The song is about breakups and ending relationships. According to Matt Cibula of Popmatters, [...] "Burn" [...] is constructed from [...] "two-step concept". In the lyrics [...] "You know that it's over / You {{know that it was}} through / Let it burn / <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it burn", Usher breaks up with his woman but found her sad about feeling bad about what happened to their relationship. However, Usher says that she must deal with it before she can accept the truth. For the lines [...] "It's been fifty-eleven days / Umpteen hours / I'm gonna be burnin' / Till you return", the direction changes after Usher realized that breaking up with her was a huge mistake and that he wanted her back.|$|E

500|$|Javie had an on-court {{incident}} {{during the}} 1990–91 NBA season {{in a game}} between the Portland Trail Blazers and Washington Bullets. Bullets' forward Pervis Ellison threw the ball at referee Billy Spooner prompting Javie to run across the court to impose a technical foul on Ellison. [...] In {{the sequence of events}} that followed, Javie ejected Ellison after protesting the call, the Bullets' head coach Wes Unseld for protesting the dismissal of Ellison, and the Bullets' mascot, [...] "Hoops", for making gestures to incite the crowd. [...] Rod Thorn, then the NBA's vice president for operations, ruled that Javie overreacted in ejecting Ellison and would be subject to discipline. The extent of the disciplinary action was not disclosed. [...] Javie reflected on the experience saying, [...] "My fatal mistake was getting involved with Billy [...] and Pervis [...] in the first place. You have to be there for your partners, {{but most of the time}} you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them call their game." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2017, Holt {{talked about}} {{recording}} the guitar solos, [...] "That's {{one of my}} favorites on the album. I'm never blown away by anything I've done musically. I always want to redo it five minutes after I'm done with it. That goes down to songwriting too - it's never going to be perfect. Nothing's perfect. So yeah, I went in and did all the solos for that album in a day. I just sat down with a six pack of beer with Kerry and Terry Date. They just let me do my own thing. Tom came in after I had been messing around with a solo for a half an hour and he told me the first take was perfect. I told him they've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me know because I'll keep going over it and sometimes you lose a good thing when that happens. You've got to know when to just let it go and keep it whether it's raw or rough or perfect or maybe there a little bit of magic in there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 24 November 2007, U2 {{played a}} secret gig at the Little Noise Sessions in Islington, London. During their {{performance}} of [...] "Desire", Bono changed {{the lyrics of}} a verse to include a line from INXS' [...] "Need You Tonight", [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you know / You're one of my kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{show her}} up, James," [...] he said; [...] "but just {{tell her that}} my time is precious, and that I don't {{want to listen to}} long {{rambling}} stories, so whatever she has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say, <b>let</b> her say it straight out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Man!" [...] cried Alan, [...] "if I make a boat, I'll make a body {{to take it}} back again! So deave me with no more of your nonsense, but walk (for that's what you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do)--and <b>let</b> Alan {{think for}} ye." ...|$|R

2500|$|The team quickly made {{themselves}} {{at home at}} HemisFair Arena, playing to increasingly large and raucous crowds. Despite a respectable 17–10 start during the 1974–75 season, Coach Tom Nissalke was fired as owners become tired of the Spurs' slow defensive style of games. He would be replaced by Bob Bass, who stated that the Spurs would have an entirely new playing style: [...] "It is my belief that you cannot throw a set offense at another professional team for 48 minutes. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them play some schoolyard basketball." [...] George Gervin and James Silas took that style to heart, as the Spurs became an exciting fast breaking team {{on the way to}} a solid 51–33 record, good enough for second place in the West. Gervin said, [...] "Our whole theory was that you shoot 100 times, we'll shoot 107." [...] However, in the playoffs the Spurs would fall to the Indiana Pacers in six games.|$|E
2500|$|She {{has stated}} that her stage {{forename}} ("Whoopi") was taken from a whoopee cushion; [...] "If {{you get a little}} gassy, you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it go. So people used to say to me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from." [...] She said in 2011, [...] "My mother did not name me Whoopi, but Goldberg is my name, it's part of my family, part of my heritage. Just like being black." [...] Henry Louis Gates, Jr., in his book In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past, found that all of Goldberg's traceable ancestors were African Americans, that she has no known Jewish ancestry, and that none of her ancestors were named Goldberg. Results of a DNA test, revealed in the 2006 PBS documentary African American Lives, traced part of her ancestry to the Papel and Bayote people of modern-day Guinea-Bissau. Her admixture test indicates that she is of 92% sub-Saharan African origin and of 8% European origin.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where Villaraigosa was chairman, the {{original}} 2012 party platform caused controversy {{after it was}} written, because the lack of typical invocations and references to God and God-given rights as well as lack of language affirming the role of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Both of these matters had been included in some previous platforms. [...] On the second day, September 5, former Ohio Governor Ted Strickland introduced an amendment {{on the floor of}} the convention to reinsert language invoking God and recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Convention Chairman Villaraigosa put the amendment to a voice vote requiring a two-thirds majority for passage. After the first vote was indecisive, Villaraigosa called for a second vote, which was again met with an equal volume of [...] "ayes" [...] and [...] "nos". A woman standing to his left said, [...] "You've got to rule, and then you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them do what they're gonna do." [...] Villaraigosa called a third vote with the same result. Villaraigosa then declared the amendment passed, causing an eruption of boos on the floor.|$|E

2500|$|Caputo {{worked as}} the {{campaign}} manager for Carl Paladino in his 2010 bid for Governor of New York. Caputo was profiled in a subject piece about him during the campaign in The New York Times; the paper said of his campaign strategy: [...] "Michael R. Caputo's impish spirit and no-holds-barred campaign style have helped propel his boss, Carl P. Paladino, a relatively unknown real estate mogul from Buffalo, to the Republican nomination for New York governor". Paladino was supported at the time by the Tea Party movement, and {{in an interview with}} The New York Times, his campaign manager embraced the outsider nature of their bid in the 2010 New York gubernatorial election: [...] "This is a campaign of junkyard dogs, not pedigreed poodles. Carl knows the background of everyone who works for him. He knows that each of us comes to the campaign with warts. And he has his own warts. We don't hide anything." [...] Paladino explained his hiring choice of Caputo as campaign manager to The New York Times: [...] "I'm facing some major demons here, and I needed someone who could go right back on top of them in a matter of minutes. You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> them know {{they are going to get}} punished." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lorre was {{originally}} fixated on {{a character in}} his mid to late forties and originally approached Hugh Grant, who was fifty at the time. However, meeting 33-year-old Kutcher changed his mind. Lorre {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "It <b>got</b> easy <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go once I met with Ashton.

6000|$|... "It was a woman," [...] the man replied. [...] "It {{is always}} women who help {{men out of}} scrapes. It was the wife {{of one of the}} jailers. She used to bring her husband's dinner {{sometimes}} when we were exercising in the yard. When I first went there she had a child in her arms--a little thing about a year old. I was always fond of children; for we had a lot at home, brothers and sisters, and I was the eldest. She saw me look at it one day, and I suppose she guessed it reminded me of home. So she stopped and let me pat its cheek and talk to it. Then I knitted it some socks and a little jacket and other things, and that made a sort of friendship between us. You can always win a woman's heart by taking notice of her child. Then she <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>letting</b> me carry it about on my shoulder while she took her husband's dinner in to him, if he did not happen to be in the yard. And when the little thing was able to totter it would hold on to my finger, and was always content to stay with me while she was away. So it went on till the child was four years old.|$|R
