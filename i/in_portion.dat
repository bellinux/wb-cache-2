5000|$|A thin {{is created}} when a stamp is {{improperly}} {{removed from the}} paper it was attached. Since paper is created by depositing layers of fibers onto each other to form a web, they can be separated by the layers too. When the paper is finished, the outside layers become the strongest layers. Soaking a stamp in water is the usual way of removing it from the postal matter. Water will dissolve the glue used as the adhesive but it also weakens the bonds of the paper's fibers. Just as the removal of water strengthens the bonding between fibers, adding water weakens them. A failed attempt at removing the stamp from other paper typically results <b>in</b> <b>portion</b> of the stamp's paper being left attached to the postal matter. Thins can be created {{in a variety of}} ways and all result in a damaged stamp.|$|E
