5|$|The {{action of}} assumpsit had several {{advantages}} over a writ of debt; the plaintiff could count on always having a jury, while in writs of debt the defendant could rely on wager of law, where he produced twelve people to swear he did not owe the plaintiff money and had the case dismissed. In addition, <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> executory agreements, not just normal contracts. In 1585 {{a new form of}} the Court of Exchequer Chamber was set up, an appellate court where the Common Pleas judges held a majority, and regularly began to reverse King's Bench judgments which were based on assumpsit. This, and the conflict between the King's Bench and the Common Pleas as a whole, was problematic; a plaintiff at assizes could not be sure which sort of judge his case would come before, lending uncertainty to the law. Boyer suggests that, in this environment, the Chief Justice of the King's Bench John Popham deliberately provoked the Common Pleas to resolve the matter, and did so through Slade's Case.|$|E

George Pope took eight wickets in the second match, only to miss the third, and then came back to take six in the fourth match.|$|E

After his death, it was bought by Rose Gelston who had it moved to Bridgehampton where <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> more than 50 years. In 1882, it was bought by James Sanford {{and moved to a}} site south of the railroad. Later, a steam engine was installed to provide power when the wind was not blowing. In 1888, the mill was repaired by millwright Nathaniel Dominy of Long Island. It was moved to a site north of the railroad in 1889. It was operated here until 1915 by the Bridgehampton Milling Company. In that year, it was bought by John E. Berwind and moved to his summer estate, Minden.|$|E

25|$|For {{the case}} of two levels (L=2), Plackett and Burman used the method found in 1933 by Raymond Paley for {{generating}} orthogonal matrices whose elements are all either 1 or −1 (Hadamard matrices). Paley's method {{could be used to}} find such matrices of size N for most N equal to a multiple of 4. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> all such N up to 100 except N=92. If N is a power of 2, however, the resulting design is identical to a fractional factorial design, so Plackett–Burman designs are mostly used when N is a multiple of 4 but not a power of 2 (i.e. N=12, 20, 24, 28, 36 …). If one is trying to estimate less than N parameters (including the overall average), then one simply uses a subset of the columns of the matrix.|$|E

He felt that its [...] "greatest virtue" [...] was being terrifying and that <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> being an [...] "urban fairytale". However, he also criticized it for putting Scully in danger.

O'Donnell also introduced a distinctive piano theme which had never been heard before, and first made its appearance in the Halo 3 announcement teaser. In an interview, O'Donnell stated that he has always approached music from the keyboard, and that at the Electronic Entertainment Expo—where the trailer would first be shown—he had a feeling that, [...] "no [...] would start with a piano." [...] O'Donnell planned on composing the music [...] "at the last minute", saying {{he had no intention of}} producing a large amount of music that would never be used. [...] "It drives everyone crazy but <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> me in the past and it works for the game in the best way.

500|$|This was {{the first}} episode to air which was {{executive}} produced by Mike Scully. Sam Simon pitched an episode {{for one of the}} first seasons which saw Homer getting a gun and nobody wanting him to have it. The episode concluded with Homer foiling a robbery and stating that although guns bring destruction, <b>it</b> <b>worked</b> <b>for</b> him. However, this episode was pitched by Scully for either season seven or eight, before being used for season nine. This provided the basic outline, and John Swartzwelder wrote the script. A lot of lines in the episode put guns in a positive light, as the staff felt that they could not just make an episode about how bad they were. Several of the staff, including Swartzwelder, are [...] "pro gun", although others, such as Matt Groening, are completely against them. The episode was designed to be non-biased and to portray each side of the argument equally. Scully noted that if there is any message in the episode it is that a man like Homer should not own a gun. The censors were nervous about some of the episode's subject matter, such as Homer pointing the gun in Marge's face, and Bart aiming the gun at Milhouse with the apple in his mouth, but ultimately let it go.|$|E

Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that [...] "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the normal path of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: [...] "Everyone does different things.
