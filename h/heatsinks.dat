5|$|The {{original}} Mac Pro's {{main memory}} uses 667MHz DDR2 ECC FB-DIMMs; the early 2008 model uses 800MHz ECC DDR2 FB-DIMMS, the 2009 and onward Mac Pro use 1066MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs {{for the standard}} models, and 1333MHz DDR3 ECC DIMMs for systems configured with 2.66GHz or faster CPUs. In the original and 2008 models, these modules are installed in pairs, one each on two riser cards. The cards have 4 DIMM slots each, allowing a total of 32GB of memory (8 × 4GB) to be installed. Notably, due to its FB-DIMM architecture, installing more RAM in the Mac Pro will improve its memory bandwidth, but may also increase its memory latency. With a simple installation of a single FB-DIMM, the peak bandwidth is 8GB/s, but this can increase to 16GB/s by installing two FB-DIMMs, one {{on each of the}} two buses, which is the default configuration from Apple. While electrically the FB-DIMMs are standard, for pre-2009 Mac Pro models Apple specifies larger-than-normal <b>heatsinks</b> on the memory modules. Problems have been reported by users who have used third party RAM with normal size FB-DIMM <b>heatsinks.</b> (see notes below). 2009 and later Mac Pro computers do not require memory modules with <b>heatsinks.</b>|$|E

NISMO-specific options are low-gloss matte gray paint and a full titanium exhaust with additional <b>heatsinks.</b> These changes in aggregate reduce weight by 38lbs which {{is the reason why}} it accelerates even faster than before.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, thermal {{analysis}} of <b>heatsink</b> for 30 W class Chip-on-Board (COB) LED light source is performed by using SolidWorks Flow Simulation package. In {{order to increase}} the convection heat transfer, number of fin {{and shape of the}} <b>heatsink</b> is optimized. Furthermore, a copper spread is applied between the COB LED light source and the <b>heatsink</b> to mitigate the heat concentration on the <b>heatsink.</b> With the copper spread, the junction temperature between the COB LED light source and the <b>heatsink</b> is 50. 9 ℃, which is 5. 4 ℃ lower than the <b>heatsink</b> without the copper spread. Due to the improvement of the junction temperature, the light output is improved by 5. 8 % when the LED light source is stabilized. The temperature difference between the simulation and measured result of the <b>heatsink</b> with the copper spread is within 2 ℃, which verifies the validity of the thermal design method using a simulation package...|$|R

2500|$|The home charger {{provided}} by GM, which {{was required for}} [...] "fast recharging" [...] of the car, measured roughly 1.5 by 2 by 5 feet (0.45 x 0.60 x 1.50 m), and featured integrated <b>heatsinks</b> and a resemblance to a gasoline pump. The charger refueled the car using induction, accomplished by inserting a Magne Charge paddle into the slot between the EV1's headlights. The wireless charging technology meant that no direct connection was made, and charging the car while it was raining did not pose any risks, though there were isolated incidents involving fires starting at the charge port. GM also offered a 120 V AC convenience charger {{that could be used}} with any standard North America power socket to slow-charge the battery pack. The convenience charger was not available for EV1s equipped with the NiMH battery packs. Installation of the device took between one and two weeks, at an additional average cost of $2500.|$|E
50|$|The output {{transistors}} of solid-state amplifiers can be passively cooled {{by using}} metal fins called <b>heatsinks</b> to radiate away the heat. For high-wattage amplifiers (over 800 watts), a fan {{is often used}} to move air across internal <b>heatsinks.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many modern {{motherboard}} chipsets have hot northbridges {{which may}} come with active cooling, {{in the form}} of a small, noisy fan. Some motherboard manufacturers have replaced these fans by incorporating large <b>heatsinks</b> or heatpipe coolers, however they still require good case airflow to remove heat. Motherboard voltage regulators also often have <b>heatsinks</b> and may need airflow to ensure adequate cooling.|$|E

50|$|Ultra120 extreme (also called U120E) has six thermal conductors.

Thermalright then declared that the copper-base <b>heatsink</b> is manufactured with protruding face, not flat one, which is different from the concept of thermal conduct as convention would have it. Afterwards, Thermalright manufactured the Ultra120E <b>heatsink</b> with protruding face, fascinating other <b>heatsink</b> manufacturers following with this concept.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the sizing {{optimization}} of a thermoelectric generator, combined with a potential <b>heatsink,</b> that harvests heat from the human body. To ensure success, energy models describing a thermoelectric module and a <b>heatsink</b> are introduced; these two models are then simplified for small temperature differences while respecting the continuity between them (both with and without the <b>heatsink).</b> In order to maximize the power produced by such a system, the dual thermal and electrical matching of the generator with its environment is studied in detail. Lastly, to optimize the sizing, a set of optimization parameters are defined, namely leg length, the capture surface area of the thermoelectric generator and, if a <b>heatsink</b> is present, its height.
