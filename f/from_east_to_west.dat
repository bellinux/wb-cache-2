5|$|Near {{the end of}} {{the twelfth}} century, the Spanish Muslim {{astronomer}} al-Bitrūjī (Alpetragius) sought to explain the complex motions of the planets without Ptolemy's epicycles and eccentrics, using an Aristotelian framework of purely concentric spheres that moved with differing speeds <b>from</b> <b>east</b> <b>to</b> <b>west.</b> This model was much less accurate as a predictive astronomical model, but it was discussed by later European astronomers and philosophers.|$|E
