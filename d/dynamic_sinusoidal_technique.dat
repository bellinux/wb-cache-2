40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fixed- and low-dimensional, perceptually based <b>dynamic</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> model of speech {{referred to as}} PDM (Perceptual Dynamic Model). To decrease and fix the number of sinusoidal components typically used in the standard sinusoidal model, we propose to use only one <b>dynamic</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> component per critical band. For each band, the sinusoid with the maximum spectral amplitude is selected and associated with the centre frequency of that critical band. The model is expanded at low frequencies by incorporating sinusoids at {{the boundaries of the}} corresponding bands while at the higher frequencies a modulated noise component is used. A listening test is conducted to compare speech reconstructed with PDM and state-of-the-art models of speech, where all models are constrained to use an equal number of parameters.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method for}} {{restoring}} the missing or corrupted observations of nonstationary sinusoidal signals which are often encountered in music and speech applications. To model nonstationary signals, we use a time-varying sinusoidal model which is obtained by extending the static sinusoidal model into a <b>dynamic</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> model. In this model, the in-phase and quadrature components of the sinusoids are modeled as first-order Gauss–Markov processes. The inference scheme for the model parameters and missing observations is formulated in a Bayesian framework {{and is based on}} a Markov chain Monte Carlo method known as Gibbs sampler. We focus on the parameter estimation in the <b>dynamic</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> model since this constitutes the core of model-based interpolation. In the simulations, we first investigate the applicability of the model and then demonstrate the inference scheme by applying it to the restoration of lost audio packets on a packet-based network.

This paper presents two ways for using <b>dynamic</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> models for statistical speech synthesis, enabling the sinusoid parameters to be modelled in HMM-based synthesis. In the first method, features extracted from a fixed- and low-dimensional, perception-based dynamic sinu-soidal model (PDM) are statistically modelled directly. In the second method, we convert both static amplitude and dynamic slope from all the harmonics of a signal, which we term the Harmonic Dynamic Model (HDM), to intermediate param-eters (regularised cepstral coefficients) for modelling. Dur-ing synthesis, HDM is then used to reconstruct speech. We have compared the voice quality of these two methods to the STRAIGHT cepstrum-based vocoder with mixed excitation in formal listening tests.

This fact means that converter does not need DC-link capacitor which increases the costs and volume requirements of the converter.

On the other hand it means that the output voltage amplitude is limited by 86. 6 % of the input voltage amplitude. Higher voltages can be achieved with overmodulation, which causes input current distortion.

The upright stance of 20 healthy young participants tested with their eyes closed was analyzed during the {{application of}} four different levels of noise and compared to that in the absence of noise (control) in three conditions: static, static on foam, and <b>dynamic</b> (<b>sinusoidal</b> translation). The quiet standing condition was conducted with the eyes open and closed to determine the subjects' visual dependency to maintain postural stability. Postural performance was assessed using posturographic and motion analysis evaluations. The results in the static condition showed that the spectral power density of body sway significantly decreased with an optimal level of noise and that the higher the spectral power density without noise, the greater the noise effect, irrespective of visual dependency. Finally, noise application was ineffective in the foam and dynamic conditions. We conclude that the application of mechanical noise to ankle muscle tendons is a means to improve quiet standing only.

A laboratory model consisting of a metal tapered cone, surrounded by a cement mantle, was developed. The cone was gradually compressed in the cement by a <b>dynamic,</b> <b>sinusoidal</b> axial force, cycling between 0 and 7 kN for 1. 7 million cycles at a frequency of 1 Hz.

In this model, the creep properties obtained in dynamic and static, tension and compression experiments measured earlier, were used. The subsidence patterns of both tapers were similar, but one subsided more than the other (380 vs 630 pm). Both subsided stepwise instead of continuous, with a frequency much smaller than that of the applied load. The characteristics of the subsidence and cement-strain patterns could be reproduced by the FE model, but not with great numerical precision. The stepwise subsidence could be explained by slip-stick mechanisms at the interface starting distally and gradually working towards proximal.

40|$|Large-amplitude <b>sinusoidal</b> ac voltammetric <b>techniques,</b> when {{analyzed}} {{in the frequency}} domain using the Fourier transform-inverse Fourier transform sequence, produce the expected dc and fundamental harmonic ac responses in addition to very substantial second, third, and higher ac harmonics that arise from the presence of significant nonlinearity. A full numerical simulation of the process, Red right arrow over left arrow Ox + e(-), incorporates terms for the uncompensated resistance (R(u)), capacitance of the double layer (C(dl)), and slow electron transfer kinetics (in particular, the reversible potential (E degrees), rate constant (k(0)), and charge transfer coefficient (alpha) from the Butler-Volmer model). Identification of intuitively obvious patterns of behavior (with characteristically different sensitivity regimes) in dc, fundamental, and higher harmonic terms enables simple protocols to be developed to estimate R(u), C(dl), E degrees, k(0), and alpha. Thus, if large-amplitude sinusoidal cyclic voltammograms are obtained for two concentrations of the reduced species, data obtained from analysis of the recovered signals provide initial estimates of parameters as follows: (a) the dc cyclic component provides an estimate of E degrees (because the R(u) and k(0) effects are minimized); (b) the fundamental harmonic provides an estimate of C(dl) (because it has a high capacitance-to-faradaic current ratio); and (c) the second harmonic provides an estimate of R(u), k(0), and alpha (because the C(dl) effect is minimized). Methods of refining the initial estimates are then implemented. As {{a check on the}} fidelity of the parameters (estimated on the basis of an essentially heuristic approach that solely utilizes the dc, fundamental, and second harmonic voltammograms), comparison of the predicted simulated and experimental third (or higher) harmonic voltammograms can be made to verify that agreement between theory and experiment has been achieved at a predetermined level.
