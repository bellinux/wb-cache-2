500|$|Under a cloud for {{suspected}} disloyalty and treason, Stone {{was arrested}} {{just after midnight}} on February 8, 1862, on orders of Maj. Gen. McClellan, who was acting under orders from Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, dated January 28. Awaiting Stone {{near his home in}} Washington were 18 soldiers led by Brig. Gen. George Sykes. When Stone approached, Sykes stated [...] "I have now the most disagreeable duty to perform that I ever hadit is to arrest you." [...] When Stone angrily asked why, Sykes said [...] "I don't know. It's by order of Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, general-in-chief of the army... <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> tell you that you are to be sent to Fort Lafayette." [...] This shocked Stone, who stated [...] "That's where they send secessionists! I have been as true a soldier to the Government as any in service." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Wittgenstein's insistence, Moore, {{who was now}} a Cambridge don, {{visited him}} in Norway in 1914, reluctantly because Wittgenstein {{exhausted}} him. David Edmonds and John Eidinow write that Wittgenstein regarded Moore, an internationally known philosopher, {{as an example of}} how far someone could get in life with [...] "absolutely no intelligence whatever." [...] In Norway it was clear that Moore was expected to act as Wittgenstein's secretary, taking down his notes, with Wittgenstein falling into a rage when Moore got something wrong. When he returned to Cambridge, Moore asked the university to consider accepting Logik as sufficient for a bachelor's degree, but they refused, saying it wasn't formatted properly: no footnotes, no preface. Wittgenstein was furious, writing to Moore in May 1914: [...] "If I am not worth your making an exception for me even in some STUPID details then <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> go to Hell directly; and if I am worth it and you don't do it then—by God—you might go there." [...] Moore was apparently distraught; he wrote in his diary that he felt sick and could not get the letter out of his head. The two did not speak again until 1929.|$|E

6000|$|It {{would be}} {{handsome}} {{of you to}} write. The doctor says <b>I</b> <b>may</b> be <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> ever; {{but in the meantime}} I go slow and am fit for little.--Ever yours, ...|$|R

60|$|Anyhow, on the chance, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> add {{a word or}} two to {{dear old}} Quatermain's narrative.|$|E

6000|$|... "O, take me back!--take me back!" [...] cried {{poor little}} Daffydowndilly, {{bursting}} into tears. [...] "If {{there is nothing}} but Toil all the world over, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{go back to the}} school-house!" ...|$|R

60|$|All {{the rest}} are the merest supers. Perhaps you <b>may</b> wonder that <b>I</b> thus {{anticipate}} criticism; but review-writing is so easy that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> fill up with this as with {{any other kind of}} padding.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> turn in, all standing, as {{the sailors}} say, {{and get a}} few hours' sleep; for in this climate one cannot keep at it, night and day, as {{we had to do}} in Spain." ...|$|R

60|$|Pemmican being {{a kind of}} {{food with}} which people in the civilised world are not {{generally}} acquainted, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> describe it here.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>may</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{tell you}} {{at once that}} I don't know {{anything}} more of him. But de Barral was of the opinion, speaking in his low voice from under his hand, that this relation would have been only too glad to have secured his guidance.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Come on, officer,' says <b>I,</b> dignified. 'I <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{make the}} best of it.' And then I turns to old Banks and rattles my chains.|$|R
6000|$|He {{thought to}} himself, [...] "Here they are. What's this about game? Are they talking of me?"

6000|$|... "It begins," [...] said O'Connor, in a {{slightly}} hesitating tone, [...] "with some expressions of a--a--raither endearin' charackter, that perhaps <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> pass." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} name. I haven't spoken yet, and perhaps never shall; so <b>I</b> <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> keep that to myself,--for the present, at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! but indeed I {{would much}} rather have it only in one. Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know--No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, <b>I</b> <b>may</b> just <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.

6000|$|He {{thought to}} himself, [...] "Here they are. What's this about game? Are they talking of me?"

6000|$|... "I shall not," [...] she answered, [...] "but I {{want those}} men who are {{following}} {{me to think that}} <b>I</b> am. They <b>may</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> lose a little time for their rudeness." ...|$|R
