5|$|The chronological list of Burges's major {{buildings}} {{is believed}} to be complete, although some minor works, or minimal additions to pre-existing structures, have not been included. The list of furniture and other works <b>is</b> <b>selective.</b> No listing is given of his extensive creations of jewellery, metalwork and stained glass. Crook has a comprehensive, chronological, appendix of Burges's work with indications as to whether the work is still in situ, was never executed, has been removed elsewhere, has been demolished or where the present location is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Admission to Baltimore City College <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> but {{is open to}} {{residents}} of Baltimore City and the surrounding counties in the metropolitan area, though non-Baltimore City residents must pay tuition. Applicants must meet all requirements for promotion to ninth grade, {{as determined by the}} Maryland State Department of Education. Additionally, applicants must earn a minimum composite score of 610, calculated by Baltimore City Public Schools. Generally, candidates for admissiom must have a 3.0 overall numeric grade average (B letter grade; 80 or better percentage grade), have at least a 3.0 average in both Mathematics and English, rank in the 65th percentile or better among all Maryland students in Math and English on the Maryland School Assessment (MSA), and have 90% or better attendance rate. Due to the highly competitive nature of the City College admissions process, successful applicants typically exceed the aforementioned minimums. J.D. Merrill, BCC '09, is the school's current Director of Admissions and Institutional Advancement.|$|E

5|$|The main {{sources for}} {{knowledge}} of Wilfrid are the medieval Vita Sancti Wilfrithi, written by Stephen of Ripon soon after Wilfrid's death, and {{the works of}} the medieval historian Bede, who knew Wilfrid during the bishop's lifetime. Stephen's Vita is a hagiography, intended to show Wilfrid as a saintly man, and to buttress claims that he was a saint. The Vita <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> in its coverage, and gives short shrift to Wilfrid's activities outside of Northumbria. Two-thirds of the work deals with Wilfrid's attempts to return to Northumbria, and is a defence and vindication of his Northumbrian career. Stephen's work is flattering and highly favourable to Wilfrid, making its use as a source problematic; despite its shortcomings however, the Vita is the main source of information on Wilfrid's life. It views the events in Northumbria in the light of Wilfrid's reputation and from his point of view, and is highly partisan. Another concern is that hagiographies were usually full of conventional material, often repeated from earlier saints' lives, {{as was the case with}} Stephen's work. It appears that the Vita Sancti Wilfrithi was not well known in the Middle Ages, as only two manuscripts of the work survive.|$|E

25|$|The {{undergraduate}} law {{program of}} Panthéon-Assas <b>is</b> <b>selective,</b> with an acceptance rate of 14%. The first-year pass rate in law hovers around 40%. All French universities are legally obliged to {{allow students to}} change universities and curriculums after the first semester of their first year. However, {{they are allowed to}} accept as few or many students as they like; Panthéon-Assas accepts only 3% of transfer requests. Admission to the second year of the university's master programs <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> as well, some of these programs admitting only 1.7% of applicants.|$|E

25|$|Aerobic {{granular}} sludge can {{be formed}} by applying specific process conditions that favour slow growing organisms such as PAOs (polyphosphate accumulating organisms) and GAOs (glycogen accumulating organisms). Another {{key part of}} granulation <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> wasting whereby slow settling floc-like sludge is discharged as waste sludge and faster settling biomass is retained. This process has been commercialized as Nereda process.|$|E
25|$|Admission <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> with {{decisions}} based on recent grades, an interview, and the candidate's score on either the ISEE or SSAT test. The largest point of entry is in sixth grade, with between 50 and 55 places available each year. In the ninth grade, 40 to 45 new students are traditionally enrolled. A smaller number of students are accepted in other grades but never the senior year.|$|E

50|$|A glycine reuptake {{inhibitor}} (GRI) {{is a type}} of drug which inhibits the reuptake of the neurotransmitter glycine {{by blocking}} {{one or more of the}} glycine transporters (GlyTs). Examples of GRIs include bitopertin (RG1678), Org 24598, Org 25935, ALX-5407, and sarcosine, which <b>are</b> <b>selective</b> GlyT1 blockers, and Org 25543 and N-arachidonylglycine, which <b>are</b> <b>selective</b> GlyT2 blockers. Some weak and/or non-selective GlyT blockers include amoxapine and ethanol (alcohol).|$|R
25|$|Though inefficient, {{a team of}} terriers, when {{coupled with}} an {{enthusiastic}} digger, can control red fox, raccoon or groundhog on small farms where their presence might {{be a problem for}} chickens, geese, wild bird populations, and crop production. Because terrier work <b>is</b> <b>selective,</b> animals can be dispatched, or else they can be moved and relocated to nearby farms, forests or waste areas where they will do no harm.|$|E
25|$|The Conservatory {{is located}} on the college campus. Conservatory {{admission}} <b>is</b> <b>selective,</b> with over 1400 applicants worldwide auditioning for 120 seats. There are 500 performances yearly, most free of charge, with concerts and recitals almost daily. The Conservatory was one of the recipients of the 2009 National Medal of Arts. The Allen Memorial Art Museum, with over 13,000 holdings, was the first college art museum west of the Alleghenies.|$|E
25|$|Herbicide — Asulam (also {{known as}} Asulox) <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> for ferns; {{glyphosate}} is not; but {{the latter has}} the advantage that the effects can be seen soon after application.

Rare ferns such as adder’s tongue, killanery and lemon-scented ferns can also be found in similar habitats and it is important that these are not destroyed in the process of bracken control.|$|E

In 2015–2016, over 45% of students received financial aid from grants totaling over $19M. The school <b>is</b> <b>selective,</b> with an acceptance rate of 17% for the 2017–2018 school year, and {{nearly a third of}} graduates attend Ivy League institutions.|$|E
25|$|The golden silk {{orb weaver}} targets many {{different}} organisms as prey, ranging from small flies and beetles to larger cicadas and locusts. As {{a result of}} their strong web structure small birds and bats can also become trapped and fed upon. Whilst most of the captured prey is relatively small compared to Nephila sp the majority of biomass consumed comes from larger more rare prey. Prey larger than 66% of the captors size accounts for just 16.5% of prey captured but 85% of prey consumed, indicating the spider <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> in its feeding habits.|$|E
25|$|The {{selective}} {{culture medium}} is called HAT medium {{because it contains}} hypoxanthine, aminopterin and thymidine. This medium <b>is</b> <b>selective</b> for fused (hybridoma) cells. Unfused myeloma cells cannot grow because they lack HGPRT and thus cannot replicate their DNA. Unfused spleen cells cannot grow indefinitely because of their limited life span. Only fused hybrid cells, referred to as hybridomas, are able to grow indefinitely in the media because the spleen cell partner supplies HGPRT and the myeloma partner has traits that make it immortal (similar to a cancer cell).|$|E
