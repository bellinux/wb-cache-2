40|$|AbstractLasofoxifene (las) and bazedoxifene (bza) are third {{generation}} selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with minimal estrogenic side effects, approved {{for treatment of}} postmenopausal osteoporosis. T cells {{are involved in the}} pathology of postmenopausal osteoporosis and previous studies have established an important role for 17 β-estradiol (E 2) in T cell development and function. E 2 causes a drastic thymic atrophy, alters the composition of thymic T cell populations, and inhibits T cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation.</b> In contrast, the second generation SERM raloxifene (ral) lacks these properties. Although las and bza are drugs approved for treatment of postmenopausal bone loss, it is of importance to study their effects on other biological aspects in order to extend the potential use of these compounds. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate if treatment with las and bza affects T lymphopoiesis and T cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation.</b> C 57 Bl 6 mice were ovariectomized (ovx) and treated with vehicle, E 2, ral, las or bza. As expected, E 2 reduced both thymus weight and decreased the proportion of early T cell progenitors while increasing more mature T cell populations in the thymus. E 2 also suppressed the T cell dependent delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction to oxazolone (OXA). Ral and las, but not bza, decreased thymus weight, while none of the SERMs had any effects on T cell populations in the thymus or on inflammation in DTH. In conclusion, this study shows that treatment with las or bza does not affect T lymphopoiesis or T cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation...</b>|$|E
40|$|At menopause, {{the levels}} of {{estrogen}} decline, leading to loss of estrogen-mediated protective effects on bone and {{an increased risk of}} osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, containing estrogen, has been used for many years to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. However, the estrogen receptor agonistic effects on the reproductive organs increases the risk of developing cancer. Therefore, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) have been developed, that can act as tissue-specific estrogen receptor agonists or antagonists. This enables SERMs to mediate the positive effects of estrogen on bone metabolism while avoiding side effects on the reproductive organs. Estrogen has a number of effects on the immune system; it decreases B- and T lymphopoiesis and increases antibody production. In addition, estrogen potently inhibits T-cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> and suppresses synovitis and inflammation-mediated bone loss in arthritis. Similarly to estrogen, the second-generation SERM raloxifene suppresses B-cell development and ameliorates arthritis. However, raloxifene lacks effects on antibody production and T-cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation.</b> Lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene are third-generation SERMs, approved for treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The bone-protective properties of these compounds are well documented; however the effects of lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene on the immune system have not earlier been assessed. Therefore, the aim of the studies included in this thesis was to investigate the immune-regulating effects of these third-generation SERMs. We found that lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene suppressed B-cell development in ovariectomized (ovx) mice, but lacked effects on antibody production and on T-cell development. Furthermore, lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene did not suppress T-cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation,</b> but potently inhibited synovitis and bone loss in mice subjected to experimental postmenopausal arthritis. Phenotypic analysis of lymph nodes in arthritic mice showed that while estrogen increased a subpopulation of dendritic cells (DCs), as well as T helper 17 (Th 17) cells, B cells and surface markers connected to antigen-presentation on B cells, the SERMs lacked these effects. In conclusion, the third-generation SERMs lasofoxifene and bazedoxifene suppressed experimental arthritis and inhibited B-cell development in ovx mice, but lacked effects on T-cell development and T-cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation.</b> SERMs also lacked effects on lymph node DCs, B cells and T cells in arthritic mice. Therefore, further investigation is needed to find the target for the suppressive effects of SERMs on arthritis. Nonetheless, the anti-arthritic effects of the third-generation SERMs suggest possibility for an extension of the clinical indications of these drugs to include also postmenopausal RA...|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{examined}} the repertoire {{and extent of}} <b>inflammation</b> <b>dependent</b> gene regulation in a bovine mammary epithelial cell (MEC) model, {{to better understand the}} contribution of the MEC in the immune defence of the udder. We challenged primary cultures of MEC from cows with heat inactivated Escherichia coli pathogens and used Affymetrix DNA-microarrays to profile challenge related alterations in their transcriptome. Compared to acute mastitis, the most prominently activated genes comprise those encoding chemokines, interleukins, beta-defensins, serum amyloid A and haptoglobin. Hence, the MEC exert sentinel as well as effector functions of innate immune defence. E. coli stimulated a larger fraction of genes (30 %) in the MEC belonging to the functional category Inflammatory Response than we recorded with the same microarrays during acute mastitis in the udder (17 %). This observation underscores the exquisite immune capacity of MEC. To more closely examine the adequacy of immunological regulation in MEC, we compared the <b>inflammation</b> <b>dependent</b> regulation of factors contributing to the complement system between the udder versus the MEC. In the MEC we observed only up regulation of several complement factor-encoding genes. Mastitis, in contrast, in the udder strongly down regulates such genes encoding factors contributing to both, the classical pathway of complement activation and the Membrane Attack Complex, while the expression of factors contributing to the alternative pathway may be enhanced. This functionally polarized regulation of the complex complement pathway is not reflected in the MEC models...|$|R
40|$|Background: Chronic lung {{diseases}} are the third {{leading cause of}} death in the United States due in part to an incomplete understanding of pathways that govern the progressive tissue remodeling that occurs in these disorders. Adenosine is elevated in the lungs of animal models and humans with chronic lung disease where it promotes air-space destruction and fibrosis. Adenosine signaling increases the production of the pro-fibrotic cytokine interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). Based on these observations, we hypothesized that IL- 6 signaling contributes to tissue destruction and remodeling in a model of chronic lung disease where adenosine levels are elevated. Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested this hypothesis by neutralizing or genetically removing IL- 6 in adenosine deaminase (ADA) -deficient mice that develop adenosine <b>dependent</b> pulmonary <b>inflammation</b> and remodeling. Results demonstrated that both pharmacologic blockade and genetic removal of IL- 6 attenuated pulmonary inflammation, remodeling and fibrosis in this model. The pursuit of mechanisms involved revealed adenosine and IL- 6 dependent activation of STAT- 3 in airway epithelial cells. Conclusions/Significance: These findings demonstrate that adenosine enhances IL- 6 signaling pathways to promote aspects of chronic lung disease. This suggests that blocking IL- 6 signaling during chronic stages of disease may provid...|$|R
40|$|The {{effector}} {{phase of}} adaptive immune responses {{is characterized by}} the accumulation of lymphocytes in the inflamed tissue. The migration of effector cells to acute inflamed sites requires the interaction of various adhesion molecules. During the initial response granulocytes represent the dominant cell type, while lymphocytes predominate at later time points. Especially antigen (ag) -specific T-cells can be found. The role of antigen for this process is unclear. Here we show that local activation of ag-specific T-effector cells within the site of inflamma-tion conditions the local environment to promote recruitment of effector cells irrespective of their ag-specificity. However, {{over a period of several}} days, ag-specific T-cells dominate within the site of ag-challenge most likely due to recruitment of progeny of ag-specific activated T-cells.

METHODS [...] An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was used to measure}} the activation of the classical pathway of complement by monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor. Monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor was bound to IgG Fc adsorbed onto microtitre plates and then reacted with diluted normal human serum as a source of complement. The activation and binding of C 4 were measured with F(ab') 2 antibody to human C 4. The complement activating property of IgM rheumatoid factor bound to IgG Fc was tentatively expressed as the ratio of the amount of bound C 4 to the amount of bound IgM rheumatoid factor. RESULTS [...] The complement activating property of monoreactive IgM rheumatoid factor was shown to be about three times higher than that of polyreactive IgM rheumatoid factor.

METHODS: To understand the pathomechanism of IL- 36 <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation,</b> we investigated the biological impact of IL- 36 α signaling in the hTNFtg mouse. Also the impact on osteoclastogenesis by IL- 36 α was tested in murine and human osteoclast assays. RESULTS: Diseased mice showed an increased expression of IL- 36 R and IL- 36 α in inflamed knee joints compared to wildtype controls. However, preventively treating mice with an IL- 36 R blocking antibody led to no changes in clinical onset and pattern of disease. Furthermore, blockade of IL- 36 signaling did not change histological signs of TNF-induced arthritis. Additionally, no alteration on bone homeostasis was observed in ex vivo murine and human osteoclast differentiation assays. CONCLUSION: Thus we conclude that IL- 36 α {{does not affect the}} development of inflammatory arthritis...|$|E
40|$|The R-ras gene encodes a small GTPase that is {{a member}} of the Ras family. Despite close {{sequence}} similarities, R-Ras is functionally distinct from the prototypic Ras proteins; no transformative activity and no activating mutations of R-Ras in human malignancies have been reported for it. R-Ras activity appears inhibitory towards tumour proliferation and invasion, and to promote cellular quiescence. Contrary to this, using mice with a deletion of the R-ras gene, we found that R-Ras facilitates DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumour induction. The tumours appeared in wild-type (WT) mice on average 6 weeks earlier than in R-Ras knockout (R-Ras KO) mice. WT mice developed almost 6 times more tumours than R-Ras KO mice. Despite strong R-Ras protein expression in the dermal blood vessels, no R-Ras could be detected in the epidermis from where the tumours arose. The DMBA/TPA skin tumourigenesis-model is highly <b>dependent</b> upon <b>inflammation,</b> and we found a greatly attenuated skin inflammatory response to DMBA/TPA-treatment in the R-Ras KO mice in the context of leukocyte infiltration and proinflammatory cytokine expression.

Recently it was shown that BCP {{is a natural}} agonist of endogenous cannabinoid 2 (CB(2)) receptors, which are expressed in immune cells and mediate anti-inflammatory effects. In this study we aimed to test the effects of BCP in a clinically relevant murine model of nephropathy (induced by the widely used antineoplastic drug cisplatin) in which the tubular injury is largely <b>dependent</b> on <b>inflammation</b> and oxidative/nitrative stress. β-caryophyllene dose-dependently ameliorated cisplatin-induced kidney dysfunction, morphological damage, and renal inflammatory response (chemokines MCP- 1 and MIP- 2, cytokines TNF-α and IL- 1 β, adhesion molecule ICAM- 1, and neutrophil and macrophage infiltration). It also markedly mitigated oxidative/nitrative stress (NOX- 2 and NOX- 4 expression, 4 -HNE and 3 -NT content) and cell death. The protective effects of BCP against biochemical and histological markers of nephropathy were absent in CB(2) knockout mice. Thus, BCP may be an excellent therapeutic agent to prevent cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity through a CB(2) receptor-dependent pathway. Given the excellent safety profile of BCP in humans it has tremendous therapeutic potential in a multitude of diseases associated with inflammation and oxidative stress...|$|R

To protect against invading pathogens, the skin harbors specialized immune cells, including dermal dendritic cells (DDCs) and interleukin (IL) - 17 producing γδ T cells (γδT 17), whose aberrant activation by IL- 23 can provoke psoriasis-like inflammation 1 – 4. The skin is also innervated by a meshwork of peripheral nerves consisting of relatively sparse autonomic and abundant sensory fibers. Interactions between the autonomic nervous system and immune cells in lymphoid organs are known to contribute to systemic immunity, but how peripheral nerves regulate cutaneous immune responses remains unclear 5, 6. Here, we have exposed the skin of mice to imiquimod (IMQ), which induces IL- 23 <b>dependent</b> psoriasis-like <b>inflammation</b> 7, 8. We show that a subset of sensory neurons expressing the ion channels TRPV 1 and NaV 1. 8 is essential to drive this inflammatory response. Imaging of intact skin revealed that a large fraction of DDCs, the principal source of IL- 23, is in close contact with these nociceptors.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Perturbations in dermal blood flow, temperature and skin color were analyzed using laser-speckle contrast imaging, infrared and polarized-light colorimetry following cold-hand immersion (CHI) challenge in patients with cold-induced urticaria compared to the response in healthy controls. Evidence for mast cell degranulation was established by documentation of serum histamine levels and the localized release of tryptase in post-challenge urticarial biopsies. Laser-speckle contrast imaging quantified the attenuated response to cold challenge in patients on cetirizine. We found that the histamine-associated vascular response accompanying mast cell degranulation is rapid and extensive. At the tissue level, it is characterized by a uniform pattern of increased blood flow, thermal warming, vasodilation, and recruitment of collateral circulation. These vascular responses are modified by the administration of an antihistamine. Conclusions/Significance: Monitoring the hemodynamic responses within tissues that are associated with mast cel...|$|E

Rabbits were killed from zero hours to 6 weeks and their colons examined. Rabbits were examined by endoscopy at weekly intervals. A single dose of TNB in ethanol produced dose <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> and ulceration, which at its optimum (40 mg) resulted in cobblestoning, strictures, and bowel wall thickening.

Histopathological features of inflammation and ulceration observed in all animals that received 40 mg TNB included crypt abscesses, ulceration, crypt architectural distortion and, occasionally, granulomas and pseudopolyps. These changes, which are similar to those observed in IBD, persisted for 6 weeks. No lasting abnormalities were observed in control animals treated with TNB in saline, with ethanol alone, or with saline only. Histopathological similarity and the prolonged duration of inflammation, compared to other models, make this a suitable model for investigating inflammation in the colon.

To establish the role of NF-κB inhibitors in RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 and RV replication, we used pharmacological inhibitors of NF-κB, and steroids and/or β 2 agonists were used for comparison. Primary human lung fibroblasts were infected with RV- 16 {{in the presence of}} NF-κB inhibitors: BAY- 117085 and dimethyl fumarate; β 2 agonist: salmeterol; and/or corticosteroids: dexamethasone; fluticasone. RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 and RV replication were assessed using ELISAs and virus titration assays. RV replicated and increased IL- 6 and IL- 8 release. Salmeterol increased, while dexamethasone and fluticasone decreased RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8 (P< 0. 05). The NF-κB inhibitor BAY- 117085 inhibited only RV-induced IL- 6 (P< 0. 05) and dimethyl fumarate did not alter RV-induced IL- 6 and IL- 8.

40|$|Briefly, {{the aim of}} {{the study}} {{described}} in this thesis was to investigate whether the joint inflammations that occur in AlA can also be induced by cloned helper T cells and the antigen they recognize, and whether these joint inflammations can also show flare-up phenomena after repeated administration of the antigen. In Chapter 2 it is shown that cloned T cells with the helper phenotype can induce delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions and that these reactions can give rise to flare-up reactions after local, iv or oral administration of the antigen. We hypothesized that these DTH reactions underly the development of joint inflammations in the AlA model, and presumably in human rheumatoid diseases. In Chapter 3 we present the model of induction of joint inflammation by similar cloned T cells. Dose response curves of the antigen and the cloned T cells injected into the joints are shown, as are the kinetics of the joint inflammations induced. Furthermore we show {{that it is possible to}} evoke flare-up reactions of these joint inflammations, but also of joint inflammations induced by systemically administered T cells and local injection of the antigen. The induction of joint inflammation by the cloned T cells was found to be dependent on H- 2 restricted interactions with recipient cells or tissues. In Chapter 4 we show that both the joint inflammation and the flareup reactions can be evoked in T cell deficient nude mice as well. Furthermore, this paper pays attention to the role of antigen in the retention of the cloned T cells in the joint. In our model, the induction of an inflammatory reaction is dependent on H- 2 restricted interactions between T cells and recipient cells and tissues, presumably antigen presenting cells. In Chapter 5 the characterization of a macrophage cell line, AP 284, is described that is able to present antigen efficiently in vivo to the cloned helper T cells used in our studies. Injection of AP 284 and syngeneic cloned helper T cells into the hind foot of allogeneic mice induces a full blown DTH reaction. This model, in which both the antigen presenting cells and the T cells are monoclonal, is attractive to investigate the cellular interactions in the induction of T cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammations.</b> Therefore we applied this approach in our studies on AlA to investigate whether antigen activated helper T cells and macrophages are sufficient for the induction of joint inflammation in allogeneic recipients. The data presented in Chapter 6 show that this was indeed the case.

MMP- 2 deficiency as well as therapeutic or prophylactic selective gelatinase blockage protected mice from the development of T. gondii–induced immunopathology. Moreover, IL- 23 –dependent up-regulation of IL- 22 was essential for the development of ileitis, whereas IL- 17 was down-regulated and dispensable. CD 4 + T cells were the main source of IL- 22 in the small intestinal lamina propria. Thus, IL- 23 regulates small intestinal inflammation via IL- 22 but independent of IL- 17.

In helminth-infected mouse intestine, distinct protease phenotypes are observed for connective tissue MCs (CTMCs) (mMCP- 4 +– 7 +, and CPA 3 +) and mucosal MCs (MMCs) (mMCP- 1 + and 2 +). To determine whether the protease phenotype was regulated by the tissue, we compared the phenotype of constitutive CTMCs and induced MMCs in trachea and large airways in antigen-sensitized unchallenged and challenged mice to MCs in skin and helminthic-infected intestine. We found that in the trachea, unlike in skin and intestine, CTMCs and MMCs both express all six serine proteases and CPA 3 (mMCP- 1 +, - 2 +, 4 +– 7 +, CPA 3 +). This phenotype also holds for the lung CTMCs in the proximal bronchi, whereas the induced MMCs express only four proteases, mMCP- 1, - 2, - 6, and - 7. Thus, the T-cell–dependent induction of MMCs in trachea, large bronchi, and small intestine provides numbers but does not determine the protease phenotype.

Recent studies, however, have implicated the parasites' endosymbiotic Wolbachia bacteria, rather than the nematode, as the cause of inflammatory-mediated filarial disease. Soluble extracts of a variety of filarial species stimulate innate inflammatory responses, which are absent or reduced when using extracts derived from species either devoid of bacteria, or those cleared of bacteria by antibiotics. Characterization of the molecular nature of the bacterial derived inflammatory stimulus points toward an endotoxin-like activity that is dependent on the pattern recognition receptors CD 14 and TLR 4 and can be inhibited by lipid A antagonists. TLR 4 <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> has been shown to occur in the systemic inflammatory adverse reaction to Brugia malayi following anti-filarial chemotherapy and in the development of neutrophil-mediated ocular inflammation in a mouse model of river blindness. The development of acute and severe inflammatory responses in people infected with Brugia malayi and Onchocerca volvulus is associated with the release of Wolbachia into the blood following death or damage of the worms after anti-filarial chemotherapy. Together these studies suggest that Wolbachia are the principal cause of acute inflammatory filarial disease. Accumulated exposure to acute episodes of inflammation may also underlie the development of chronic filarial pathology. The use of antibiotic therapy to target Wolbachia of filarial parasites may therefore provide a means to prevent the development of filarial pathology...|$|E

Hyperinflammation is also a significant clinical manifestation of CGD. Herein, we evaluated humoral immunity in the phagocyte oxidase p 47 phox-deficient model of CGD and found that UV-inactivated Streptococcus pneumoniae and Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) elicited higher specific antibody (Ab) titers in p 47 phox-/- mice than wild-type (WT) mice. Both organisms elicited robust and distinct antigen-presenting cell maturation phenotypes, including IL- 12 hypersecretion, and higher major histocompatibility complex II and costimulatory protein expression in Lm-stimulated p 47 phox-/- dendritic cells (DCs) relative to WT DCs. Furthermore, p 47 phox-/- DCs pulsed with Lm and adoptively transferred into naïve WT mice elicited Ab titers, whereas Lm-pulsed WT DCs did not elicit these titers. The observed robust p 47 phox-/- mouse humoral response was recapitulated with live Lm and sustained in vivo in p 47 phox-/- mice. Notably, anti–serum samples from p 47 phox-/- mice that survived secondary Lm infection were protective in WT and p 47 phox-/- mice that were rechallenged with secondary lethal Lm infection.

IQGAP 1, an actin-binding scaffold protein, is a key regulator for actin cytoskeleton and motility. We previously demonstrated that IQGAP 1 mediates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced ROS production and migration of cultured endothelial cells (ECs); however, its role in post-ischemic neovascularization is unknown. Methodology/Principal Findings: Ischemia was induced by left femoral artery ligation, which resulted in increased IQGAP 1 expression in Mac 3 + macrophages and CD 31 + capillary-like ECs in ischemic legs. Mice lacking IQGAP 1 exhibited {{a significant reduction in}} the post-ischemic neovascularization as evaluated by laser Doppler blood flow, capillary density and a-actin positive arterioles. Furthermore, IQGAP 12 / 2 mice showed a decrease in macrophage infiltration and ROS production in ischemic muscles, leading to impaired muscle regeneration and increased necrosis and fibrosis. The numbers of bone marrow (BM) -derived cells in the peripheral blood were not affected in these knockout mice. BM transplantation revealed that IQGAP 1 expressed in both BM-derived cells and tissue resident cells, such as ECs, is required for post-ischemic neovascularization.

Although initially identified {{as a component of}} eosinophilic leukocytes, mEar 2 mRNA and protein were also detected in lung tissue accompanied by enzymatically active mEar 2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). At t = 3 days post-inoculation with PVM (strain J 3666), we observed the characteristic inflammatory response accompanied by diminished expression of total mEar mRNA and protein in lung tissue and a corresponding fivefold drop in ribonuclease activity in BALF No change in mEar expression was observed in response to infection with PVM strain 15, a replication-competent strain of PVM that does not elicit a cellular inflammatory response. However, mEar expression is not directly <b>dependent</b> on <b>inflammation</b> per se, as diminished expression of mEar mRNA and BAL ribonuclease activity were also observed in PVM-infected, inflammation-deficient, MIP- 1 alpha -/- mice. We propose that this mechanism may represent a novel virus-mediated evasion strategy, with a mechanism that is linked in some fashion to virus-specific pathogenicity. Published by Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{and severity of}} asthma has increased in the last 20 years, and the greatest increase has been seen among {{children and young adults}} living in U. S. inner cities. The reasons for this increase are obviously complex, but include environmental exposures to allergens and pollutants, changing patterns of medication, and the psychosocial stresses of living in poor inner-city neighborhoods. This paper presents an overview of environmental, immunologic, and genetic factors associated with asthma morbidity and mortality. This overview can be used to provide a framework for designing an interdisciplinary research program to address the complexities of asthma etiology and exacerbation. The strongest epidemiologic association has been found between asthma morbidity and the exposure of immunologically sensitive asthmatic patients to airborne allergens. Our current understanding of the process of sensitization suggests that there is a strong genetic predisposition to form IgE to allergenic proteins on airborne particles. Much of this work has been conducted with animal models, but in a number of instances, specific confirmation has been reported in humans. Sensitized individuals respond to inhaled exposure with immediate mast-cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> that may be augmented by pollutant particles, especially diesel exhaust particles. Relatively {{little is known about the}} methods of assessing exposure to airborne pollutants, especially biologically active particulates. However, to examine the relationship of morbidity in genetically predisposed individuals, it will be important to determine the most relevant method of making this assessment...|$|E
40|$|Goodpasture's {{disease or}} anti-glomerular {{basement}} membrane disease (anti-GBM-disease) is included among immune complex small vessel vasculitides. The definition of anti-GBM {{disease is a}} vasculitis affecting glomerular capillaries, pulmonary capillaries, or both, with GBM deposition of anti-GBM autoantibodies. The disease is a prototype of autoimmune disease, where the patients develop autoantibodies that bind to the basement membranes and activate the classical pathway of the complement system, which start a neutrophil <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation.</b> The diagnosis of anti-GBM disease relies on the detection of anti-GBM antibodies in conjunction with glomerulonephritis and/or alveolitis. Overt clinical symptoms are most prominent in the glomeruli where the inflammation usually results in a severe rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. Despite modern treatment less than {{one third of the}} patients survive with a preserved kidney function after 6 months follow-up. Frequencies vary from 0. 5 to 1 cases per million inhabitants per year and there is a strong genetic linkage to HLA-DRB 1 (∗) 1501 and DRB 1 (∗) 1502. Essentially, anti-GBM disease is now a preferred term for what was earlier called Goodpasture's syndrome or Goodpasture's disease; anti-GBM disease is now classified as small vessel vasculitis caused by in situ immune complex formation; the diagnosis relies on the detection of anti-GBM in tissues or circulation in conjunction with alveolar or glomerular disease; therapy is effective only when detected at an early stage, making a high degree of awareness necessary to find these rare cases; 20 - 35 % have anti-GBM and MPO-ANCA simultaneously, which necessitates testing for anti-GBM whenever acute test for ANCA is ordered in patients with renal disease...|$|E
40|$|IF 10. 569 International audienceIntroduction: In patients, the {{therapeutic}} use of bleomycin (BLM), a potent anticancerous drug, is strongly restrained {{because of its}} lung toxicity with pulmonary fibrosis (PF) being the most devastating form. Toxic and Idiopathic PF start classically in the subpleural area. It is know that 1) Pleural mesothelial cells (PMCs) acquire a TGF-β 1 -induced myofibroblast phenotype and 2) inflammation {{plays a significant role}} in fibrogenesis. The role of mesothelial cells in PF and in BLM lung toxicity has still to be investigated. Methods: C 57 Bl/ 6 mice were intravenously (IV) injected with BLM or NaCl. In vitro, human pleural mesothelial cells (Met 5 A) were treated with BLM. Results: Repeated IV BLM induces a peculiar lung fibrotic response with 1) an histological peripheral distribution, 2) a collagen accumulation in pleural and subpleural area, 3) an overexpression in PMCs of MMP- 2, - 9, HSP 27, all involved in myofibroblast tranformation and 4) a migration of PMCs into the lung. This process was associated with an inflammatory profile with an increase 1) in neutrophils in pleural lavage fluid (PLF) and 2) an enhanced caspase- 1 activity (total lung tissue). TGF-β 1 was overexpressed in PLF. TGF-β 1 and collagen accumulations were hampered after pleural inhibition of IL- 1 β (Anakinra intrapleural injection). IV administration of BLM triggered cell death in pleural and subpleural area (TUNEL). In vitro, BLM-induced cell death correlated with an increase in caspase- 1 activity. Conclusion: IV BLM in rodent induces subpleural PF as observed in toxic and idiopathic PF in human. Our results demonstrate a key role of PMCs and suggest a caspase- 1 <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> in this fibrogenesis process...|$|E

Thus, {{the aim of the}} study was to test possible TLR 9 inhibitors (H 154 -thioate, IRS 954 -thioate, and chloroquine) for their ability to protect the cardiovascular system in a murine model of CpG oligodeoxynucleotide- (ODN-) <b>dependent</b> systemic <b>inflammation.</b> Sepsis was induced by i. p. application of the TLR 9 agonist 1668 -thioate in C 57 BL/ 6 wild type (WT) and TLR 9 -deficient (TLR 9 -D) mice. Thirty minutes after stimulation TLR 9 antagonists were applied i. v. Survival was monitored up to 18 [*]h after stimulation. Cardiac mRNA expression of inflammatory mediators was analyzed 2 [*]h and 6 [*]h after stimulation with 1668 -thioate and hemodynamic parameters were monitored at the later time point. Stimulation with 1668 -thioate induced a severe sepsis-like state with significant drop of body temperature and significantly increased mortality in WT animals. Additionally, there was a time-dependent increase of inflammatory mediators in the heart accompanied by development of septic heart failure. These effects were not observed in TLR 9 -D mice. Inhibition of TLR 9 by the suppressive ODN H 154 -thioate significantly ameliorated cardiac inflammation, preserved cardiac function, and improved survival.

Experiments {{were designed to}} test whether or not Rap 1 is present in atheromatous lesions and affects NF-κB <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> in macrophages, the predominant cell type involved in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions. METHODS: The expression of Rap 1 and macrophages in human atheromatous lesions was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of lipopolysaccharide- (LPS, 50 ng/mL, 4 h) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α, 100 ng/mL, 4 h) induced NF-κB dependent genes and proteins in wild type and Rap 1 knockdown THP- 1 cells were measured using real-time PCR and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assays. Western blotting was applied to determine the expression of p 65 and its phosphorylation in wild type and Rap 1 knockdown THP- 1 cells. RESULTS: Rap 1 co-localized with macrophages and its staining positively correlated with graded human atherosclerosis. In THP- 1 cells, Rap 1 knockdown suppressed the phosphorylation of p 65 and reduced the expression of LPS- or TNFα-induced NF-κB dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines at mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: Telomere-independent Rap 1 is present in human athermanous lesions. Cytoplasmic Rap 1 within macrophages may impact on inflammation during atherosclerosis. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective The {{phenomena}} manifested {{during inflammation}} require interplay between circulating effector cells, local resident cells, soluble mediators and genetic host factors to establish, develop and maintain itself. Of the molecues involed in the initiation and perpetuation of acute allergic inflammation in asthma, {{the involvement of}} effector cells in redox reactions for producing O 2 - (superoxide anion) through the mediation of NADPH oxidase is a critical step. Prior data suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by NADPH oxidase homologues in non-phagocytic cells {{play an important role}} in the regulation of signal transduction, while macrophages use a membrane-associated NADPH oxidase to generate an array of oxidizing intermediates which inactivate MMPs on or near them. Materials and Methods and Treatment To clarify the role of gp 91 phox subunit of NADPH oxidase in the development and progression of an acute allergic asthma phenotype, we induced allergen <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation</b> in a gp 91 phox -/- single knockout and a gp 91 phox-/-MMP- 12 -/- double knockout mouse models. Results In the knockout mice, both inflammation and airway hyperreactivity were more extensive than in wildtype mice post-OVA. Although OVA-specific IgE in plasma were comparable in wildtype and knockout mice, enhanced inflammatory cell recruitment from circulation and cytokine release in lung and BALf, accompanied by higher airway resistance as well as Penh in response to methacholine, indicate a regulatory role for NADPH oxidase in development of allergic asthma. While T cell mediated functions like Th 2 cytokine secretion, and proliferation to OVA were upregulated synchronous with the overall robustness of the asthma phenotype, macrophage upregulation in functions such as proliferation, and mixed lymphocyte reaction indicate a regulatory role for gp 91 phox and an overall non-involvement or synergistic involvement of MMP 12 in the response pathway (comparing data from gp 91 phox-/- and gp 91 phox-/-MMP- 12 -/- mice). </p...|$|E
40|$|Anandamide (AEA) is an {{endogenous}} {{fatty acid}} which activates the same cannabinoid receptors as ∆ 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive substance in marijuana. In vivo, anandamide exerts {{a number of}} actions including effects upon pain and inflammation. However, AEA has a short duration of action since it is rapidly metabolised, primarily by the intracellular enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). The general aim of this thesis has been to identify and characterize compounds capable of preventing the metabolism of anandamide. The chemical approach {{was based on the}} endogenous anti-inflammatory compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a compound related to anandamide with the ability to inhibit anandamide degradation by substrate competition, but without the ability to directly activate cannabinoid receptors. A number of compounds were identified as inhibitors of rat brain FAAH in the initial in vitro studies, without having major affinity for the cannabinoid receptors. In particular, palmitoylisopropylamide (PIA) was found to reduce the metabolism of AEA in intact C 6 glioma cells with potency similar to the prototypical AEA reuptake inhibitor AM 404. This compound was in addition found to exert less effect upon C 6 glioma cell proliferation than either AM 404 or the closely related uptake inhibitor VDM 11. To evaluate if PIA was effective in vivo, a model of mast cell <b>dependent</b> <b>inflammation,</b> oedema of the ear following local injection of compound 48 / 80, was set up using anaesthetised mice. Initially, a CB 2 cannabinoid receptor selective agonist was used to probe the model and demonstrated to produce an anti-oedema effect. In contrast, the compound was inactive in vitro in skin slice preparations. PIA showed a similar pattern, although there was a large variation in responses which affected the significance of the result obtained, as did the vehicle used to dissolve the compound. Taken together, the present data would suggest that PIA can inhibit the degradation of AEA without having deleterious effects upon cell proliferation or affinity for the cannabinoid receptors. Further experimentation is necessary to elucidate the usefulness of this compound in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) airways are characterised by chronic inflammation, increased interleukin (IL) - 8 secretion, and neutrophil activation {{which are}} considered the principal factors {{of morbidity and mortality}} in CF patients. Optimising management of this chronic inflammatory response is therefore a key issue of basic and clinical CF research. Several reports have addressed ways to manage CF airways inflammation, and an attractive therapeutic strategy may be the inhibition of the p 38 -mitogen activated protein kinase (p 38 -MAP-k) pathway. Methods: A new ex vivo model was used to study the mucosal inflammatory response to environmental airways stimuli. Nasal biopsy tissues from CF patients and controls were cultured ex vivo for 20 minutes, 4 hours, and 24 hours in the presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) with and without the p 38 -MAP-k inhibitor SB 203580. Quantitative mRNA assessment, immunohistochemistry, and Western blots were used to detect the expression and modulation of inflammatory markers. Results: PA-LPS challenge induced a time <b>dependent</b> mucosal <b>inflammation</b> indicated by rapid epithelial activation, IL- 8 release, COX- 2 upregulation, and neutrophil migration to the upper mucosal layers. Some of these LPS induced changes (IL- 8 release and neutrophil migration) were specific to CF tissues. SB 203580 significantly controlled all LPS induced mucosal changes in CF tissues. Conclusion: These findings provide a rationale and proof of principle for the potential use of p 38 -MAP-k inhibitors to control inflammation in patients with CF...|$|R
40|$|We here present {{evidence}} for the lifelong plasticity of the peripheral nervous system, especially of the peptidergic skin innervation, employing a mouse model. This plasticity occurs outside the known remodeling processes during injury or neurodegenerative disease. Depending on demands posed on cutaneous innervation by tissue remodeling processes like hair follicle morphogenesis, hair growth or allergic dermatitis, density of skin innervation increases. This plasticity depends on the interaction between peptidergic nerve fibers in the skin with their target cells, e. g. keratinocytes in the epidermis and skin appendages or mast cells and depends on neurotrophins. Neuronal plasticity and cutaneous neurotrophin expression in skin however not only depend on but also cause tissue remodeling. The neuropeptide Substance P (SP) {{as well as the}} neurotrophin Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) interfere with trophic processes in skin and both alter the course of the hair cycle. These findings widen the scope of the biological functions of the classical neuromediators and install them as important growth factors {{in the context of the}} hair follicle. We were able to transfer the data obtained for NGF from the mouse model to the human system. A transfer, that demonstrates the significance of the mouse model for the human situation. Fascinatingly, environmental stressors such as noise stress also lead to neuronal plasticity of the peripheral innervation and altered neuron-immune communication in the skin. This adaptation process has pathogenetic relevance for skin diseases with a neurogenic component such as hair loss or allergic dermatitis. It is followed by massive neurogenic inflammation and subsequent termination of hair growth or a significant worsening of allergic dermatitis. In detail the works presented here employ four models for the exploration of neurotrophic and psychoneuroimmunologic interactions in skin: 1) Complex tissue remodeling processes, that take place during morphogenesis and life-long cycling of hair follicles in the skin, are accompanied by life-long plasticity of peripheral peptidergic nerve fibers, mast cell-nerve-interaction und neurotrophinexpression (124, 156, 158). These processes are of trophic relevance for hair growth. 2) Stress terminates hair growth in the back skin of mice prematurely via SP and NGF <b>dependent</b> neurogenic <b>inflammation</b> (28, 60, 128, 140, 159). This response can be blocked by SP-antagonists and NGF-neutralizing antibodies. 3) Stressmediators such as NGF also terminate human hair growth prematurely, depending on Tumor Growth Factor beta (TGF&# 61538;) and p 75 (low-affinity pan-neurotrophin receptor) in vitro (28, 153, 156). 4) In the mouse model stress worsens inflammatory skin diseases such as atopic dermatitis-like allergic dermatitis through SP <b>dependent</b> neurogenic <b>inflammation</b> (160), a response not inducible NK 1 -/- mice lacking the SP receptor. With the data presented here we were able to bridge the gap between experimental dermatology and psychoneuroimmunology. This bridge joins the clinical observation of the psychosocially induced worsening of hair loss or chronic dermatitis such as atopic dermatitis and the modern insight into the cutaneous stress-response and its immunologic consequences. Neuropharmacologic interventionen that interferes with the signal cascades initiated by SP und NGF is therefore ideally suited to alter these response mechanisms. The effectiveness of rezeptorantagonists or neutralizing antibodies serves as a starting point for the development of new therapeutic strategies in the stress-management of respective diseases...|$|R
