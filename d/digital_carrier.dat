50|$|The {{creative}} process in traditional and digital painting {{is more or}} less the same, but when the digital artist is done, there is nothing to hang on a wall. The painting is on the hard disk of a computer. The usual way to make it presentable and salable is to project it on a traditional carrier, such as paper, canvas or polyester. This is commonly done by a professional printer. For an original painting, the traditional physical carrier substitutes the <b>digital</b> <b>carrier,</b> which is deleted. For a series, the <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> is deleted when the prefixed number of copies has been reached.

50|$|Before {{the digital}} T-1 system, carrier wave {{systems such as}} 12-channel carrier systems worked by {{frequency}} division multiplexing; each call was an analog signal. A T-1 trunk could transmit 24 telephone calls at a time, because it used a <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> signal called Digital Signal 1 (DS-1). DS-1 is a communications protocol for multiplexing the bitstreams of up to 24 telephone calls, along with two special bits: a framing bit (for frame synchronization) and a maintenance-signaling bit. T-1's maximum data transmission rate is 1.544 megabits per second.|$|E

50|$|These {{alarm states}} are also lumped under the term Carrier Group Alarm (CGA). The meaning of CGA is that {{connectivity}} on the <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> has failed.

Simultaneously, the customer data is often coerced to a 0x7F pattern, signifying a zero-voltage condition on voice equipment. Data equipment usually passes whatever data may be present, if any, leaving it to the customer equipment to deal with the condition.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the concept}} of content {{preservation}} rather than carrier preservation has become the norm with regard to long-term digital preservation. Nonetheless, the life expectancy of <b>digital</b> <b>carriers</b> is important because, {{in addition to other}} digital system parameters, it determines the migration time of digital content. In general, a cleaner,cooler, drier, and more stable environment extends the life expectancy, and appropriate protection of individual types of carriers is based on understanding the vulnerability of the carrier and consequently on providing optimal storage conditions and appropriate handling. This paper presents the effects of specific environmental factors (i. e., temperature, humidity, and light) on the life expectancy of physical digital recording media, with an emphasis on optical media. Although optical discs are just one of the various methods of digital data storage today, they continue to be a popular archive medium. It should be noted that optical discs are not permanent recording media, as is often wrongly believed, and that their life expectancy is significantly influenced by environmental factors. At the ZRC SAZU Institute of Ethnomusicology, an experiment was conducted to analyze the durability of digital records saved on CD-Rs that were exposed to light in everyday working conditions. The results showed that exposing recordable optical discs to light, especially direct sunlight, can result in complete destruction of the data recorded within a few days or weeks. This confirmed the importance of careful handling, appropriate storage, and regular testing of <b>digital</b> <b>carriers...</b>|$|R

50|$|An NTSC {{television}} channel as transmitted occupies a total bandwidth of 6 MHz. The actual video signal, which is amplitude-modulated, is transmitted between 500 kHz and 5.45 MHz above the lower bound of the channel. The video carrier is 1.25 MHz above the lower bound of the channel. Like most AM signals, the video carrier generates two sidebands, one above the carrier and one below. The sidebands are each 4.2 MHz wide. The entire upper sideband is transmitted, but only 1.25 MHz {{of the lower}} sideband, known as a vestigial sideband, is transmitted. The color subcarrier, as noted above, is 3.579545 MHz above the video carrier, and is quadrature-amplitude-modulated with a suppressed carrier. The audio signal is frequency-modulated, like the audio signals broadcast by FM radio stations in the 88-108 MHz band, but with a 25 kHz maximum frequency deviation, as opposed to 75 kHz as is used on the FM band, making analog television audio signals sound softer than FM radio signals as received on a wideband receiver. The main audio carrier is 4.5 MHz above the video carrier, making it 250 kHz below {{the top of the}} channel. Sometimes a channel may contain an MTS signal, which offers more than one audio signal by adding one or two subcarriers on the audio signal, each synchronized to a multiple of the line frequency. This is normally the case when stereo audio and/or second audio program signals are used. The same extensions are used in ATSC, where the ATSC <b>digital</b> <b>carrier</b> is broadcast at 0.31 MHz above the lower bound of the channel.|$|E

50|$|The DAB {{system that}} has been {{identified}} as the best fit for LPFM is IBOC system. This is a hybrid system that uses existing frequencies and can operate carrying digital information along with analog broadcast signal on the sidebands. However, the <b>digital</b> <b>carriers</b> require the bandwidth to be widened, which would cause interference to stations on the first adjacent channel. If LPFM adopts IBOC, then LPFM would also need to accept a second adjacent channel restriction between two LPFM stations, as there is a potential that the sidebands of two LPFM stations would overlap causing interference. Currently, imposing a second adjacent channel restriction would impact less than 10 LPFM stations.|$|R
