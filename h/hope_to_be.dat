The Corral was deemed insufficient for the National Hockey League (NHL) in 1977, leading the World Hockey Association's Calgary Cowboys to fold rather than <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a team selected to merge with the NHL.|$|E

5|$|Pegasus was {{converted}} to the prototype fighter catapult ship in November 1940, carrying three Fairey Fulmar fighters from 807 Squadron between 1 December and 10 February 1941, which {{were replaced by}} aircraft from 804 Squadron between 10 February and 23 July. These fighters were supposed to defend convoys against attacks from Focke-Wulf Fw 200 maritime patrol bombers and {{to prevent them from}} radioing location reports to U-boats. If out of range of land, the fighters would have to ditch at sea and <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recovered by a ship from their convoy. The ship escorted nine convoys between December 1940 and July 1941. At some point during the war, the ship's anti-aircraft armament was supplemented with a pair of Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns mounted in the bow, the ship's bridge was enlarged and the mast was replaced with a tripod mast bearing a Type 291 air warning radar. The ship then became a seaplane training ship again, hosting 763 Squadron aboard from 20 April 1942 to 13 February 1944. Pegasus then became a barracks ship until May 1946 and was then listed for disposal in June.|$|E

Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> saved from the tortures of hell in the next life?

25|$|Barbary slaves could <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> freed through {{payment of}} a ransom. Despite {{the efforts of}} {{middlemen}} and charities {{to raise money to}} provide ransoms, they were still very difficult to come by. As European communities increased their charity funding for ransoming slaves, North African states increased the amount of ransom required. Lack of money to pay a ransom was not the only problem. Persons taken captive needed to notify their families of their status and tell them the ransom price. Mail charges were often beyond the reach of ordinary captive slaves, and it could take several months for the mail to be delivered.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} of an increasing fractal dimension with space-filling {{might be taken}} to mean fractal dimensions measure density, {{but that is not}} so; the two are not strictly correlated. Instead, a fractal dimension measures complexity, a concept related to certain key features of fractals: self-similarity and detail or irregularity. These features are evident in the two examples of fractal curves. Both are curves with topological dimension of 1, so one might <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to measure their length or slope, as with ordinary lines. But we cannot do either of these things, because fractal curves have complexity in the form of self-similarity and detail that ordinary lines lack. The self-similarity lies in the infinite scaling, and the detail in the defining elements of each set. The length between any two points on these curves is undefined because the curves are theoretical constructs that never stop repeating themselves. Every smaller piece is composed of an infinite number of scaled segments that look exactly like the first iteration. These are not rectifiable curves, meaning they cannot be measured by being broken down into many segments approximating their respective lengths. They cannot be characterized by finding their lengths or slopes. However, their fractal dimensions can be determined, which shows that both fill space more than ordinary lines but less than surfaces, and allows them to be compared in this regard.|$|E

25|$|On the 17th a {{division}} of cavalry and infantry under Brigadier General Doyle after having been given information by local Arabs intercepted a body of 550 camels escorted by 560 French soldiers going from Alexandria when they had departed on the 14th towards Middle Egypt to secure provisions. The French cavalry made a tired charge but they were overtaken by a party of British dragoons and surrendered upon honourable terms. The small garrison about 200 of the fort of Ras El Bar on the Damietta branch of the Nile was invested {{on the same day}} on the land side by a by a flotilla of British guns and Ottoman gunboats and near the mouth of the Damietta. On seeing this the French abandoned the post and retired upon Port Said; the two garrisons numbering altogether 700 men were also evacuated and embarked on board five small vessels in the <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to reach the port of Alexandria. Four of these vessels however were captured and carried into Abu Qir Bay with only one escaping to the coast of Italy. On the 6th of June Colonel Lloyd with his detachment of the 86th regiment numbering about 150 men set out to march across the desert to Cairo a distance by a route intended to be taken in order to avoid meeting a superior force. By the 10th these men joined Colonel John Stewart's detachment which was to be attached to Yusuf Pashas' (the Grand Vizier) army on the right bank of the Nile.|$|E
500|$|Lee divided {{his forces}} into {{multiple}} columns, spread apart widely {{as he moved}} into Maryland and also maneuvered to capture the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry. This was a risky move for a smaller army, but Lee was counting on his knowledge of McClellan's temperament. He told one of his generals, [...] "He is an able general but a very cautious one. His army {{is in a very}} demoralized and chaotic condition, and will not be prepared for offensive operations—or he will not think it so—for three or four weeks. Before that time I <b>hope</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> on the Susquehanna."
