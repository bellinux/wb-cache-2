500|$|Early {{before the}} release of B'Day in 2006, Knowles held a {{nationwide}} audition for female musicians which ended in Sony Music Studios {{where she and her}} father and collaborator Mathew Knowles were among the judges. The auditions searched for keyboard players, bassists, guitarists, horn players, percussionists and drummers with stops in New Jersey, Atlanta, Burbank, Chicago and Houston. The musicians were asked to re-create the performance of [...] "Work It Out" [...] from the live album Live at Wembley (2004) and be able to perform at least a one-minute solo. Knowles stated that her goal was to get together a group of [...] "fierce, talented, hungry, beautiful" [...] women and form an all-female band. Speaking about her tour and the decision to form a band, Knowles said, [...] "I'm all about female empowerment. I'm all about pushing the envelope. I know it's my responsibility to do something different. I said, 'I want a band, I want something different.'" [...] She further described the process of choosing the contestants during an interview, saying: [...] "I had worldwide auditions; people flew in from Atlanta, Houston, Israel, all over the world. It was extremely difficult [...] [...] so many talented women. I wanted only a nine-piece band, but the girls were so amazing, I couldn't decide. I think I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> having 12 people so I have two [...] certain instruments, because [...] were just brilliant. It's a thing called star quality, it's a thing you can't put your finger on, can't describe. When they were playing, I said, 'I want to see y'all battle.' I brought in two of every instrument and that's how I chose. You see the one that really wants it. It was so entertaining, the energy, seeing the girls battle ... God, it was the best. It was magical." [...] Between segments of the show, Suga Mama performed periodic instrumental interludes, with every member giving a solo so Knowles could change her costumes seven times. Describing them as [...] "fantastic", Eamon Sweeney of the Irish Independent noted that [...] "the interval music works perfectly... but two excruciating drum solos are absolutely unnecessary".|$|E
2500|$|From 1991 to 1993 the {{two teams}} were {{designated}} [...] "AFC" [...] and [...] "NFC" [...] to distinguish where their coaching staffs were from and to stress the professional nature of the game. This was confusing to some, as the game occurred well before the NFL draft {{and there was no}} way of determining which conference the players were actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in to start their professional careers. In 1994 this was dropped and the designations were reverted to the traditional [...] "North vs. South" [...] format.|$|E
2500|$|Karl Carter of Atlanta-based Guerrilla Tactics Media said fans of {{the show}} Aqua Teen Hunger Force would {{recognize}} the character and think it was funny, but other people who saw the signs wouldn't get the joke. [...] "This is probably better set up for nightclubs and other sorts of scenarios where {{the people that are}} receiving the message, one, would know what it's about, but also two, wouldn't be frightened," [...] he said. [...] "You know, if you put these in certain environments, like public spaces in this post-9/11 sensitivity, then of course you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in trouble." [...] Make magazine editor Phillip Torrone said the advertisers should have used better judgment, but called the Mooninite board a [...] "neat electronic project." [...] As reported by Boing Boing, the media and the State of Massachusetts insisted on maintaining the use of the words [...] "bomb hoax" [...] when describing the event, despite Turner Broadcasting Systems' firm contentions that the devices were not intended to resemble bombs and the company had no intent to arouse suspicion or panic in approving the advertising campaign.|$|E

When Rodney {{describes}} her, Del realises he knows the woman and sees an attempt to tease his younger brother. Del tells Rodney that he's been dubbed [...] "The Peckham Pouncer" [...] by the police, and that vigilantes are also looking for him. When Rodney leaves the room {{and goes back to}} bed, Del explains to Grandad that Rodney had just met Blossom, a mental hospital patient who is let out on weekends for practice, and accusing people is her hobby which makes her well known to the police. Grandad asks why he doesn't tell Rodney, but Del suggests that he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> Rodney <b>up</b> with the Peckham Pouncer story. Grandad then warns him to be careful with this joke.|$|R
2500|$|Israel was {{concerned}} over the dropout rate, {{and suggested that}} Soviet emigres be flown directly to Israel from the Soviet Union or Romania. Israel argued that it needed highly skilled and well-educated Soviet Jewish immigrants for its survival. In addition to contributing to the country's economic development, Soviet immigration was also seen as a counterweight to the high fertility rate among Israeli-Arabs. In addition, Israel {{was concerned}} that the dropout rate could result in immigration being banned once again. The Ministry of Immigrant Absorption's position was that [...] "it could jeopardize the whole program if Jews supposedly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Israel all <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> in Brooklyn and Los Angeles. How will the Soviets explain to their own people that it's just Jews who are allowed to emigrate to the U.S.?" ...|$|R

Lisa Anthony from BIG! magazine said that Julie accusing the Lim family of eating her dog Holly was [...] "one of the most bizarre storylines ever".

5000|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers {{praised the}} cast while {{acknowledging}} his dislike for the film. Travers rated it {{two out of}} four stars and said, [...] "Think of yourself sitting down for a big two-hour wallow in instant stupid with a vat of popcorn, slathered in fake butter and possibly a mound of melted M&Ms on top. It feels great chugging it down, then your stomach hurts, your head aches and you puke {{the whole thing up}} so you can forget about it in the morning. That's Baywatch in a nutshell." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, writing: [...] "As was the case with CHiPS, The Dukes of Hazzard, The Beverly Hillbillies, Car 54, Where Are You? and I’ll just stop there, when you make films from junk TV, more often than not you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> with a junk movie." ...|$|E

The people in the tavern listen to Fritz read from his latest story about a local aristocrat, Prince Otto, and his young son, Prince Florian. Prince Otto dies while on a hunting trip. His heart has been replaced with a clockwork mechanism that enables him to drive his son home in their sledge. Fritz wrote down the story after having a dream, but he has not thought of an ending for it, and hopes that {{he will be able to}} think up one on the spot: [...] "He was just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> the story, set it going, and make up the end when he got there." ...|$|E
5000|$|Brian Lowry of Variety gave a {{score of}} 80%, and wrote, [...] "Maintaining this sort of rat-a-rat patter is no small feat, but the series gets off to such a {{promising}} start as to bode well for future installments. Moreover, the shifting pairings from episode to episode create a semi-serialized element that deftly builds off the groundwork laid the previous week, conjuring questions about who’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> with whom." [...] Karen Valby of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a [...] "B" [...] grade, and wrote, [...] "If you like--or like zoning out to--slick and shiny romantic comedies in the vein of New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day, Mixology is the show for you. But underneath the glossy, Ryan Seacrest-produced banner, this cocktail actually has some genuine sweetness and originality." [...] Diana Werts of Newsday gave the series a grade of [...] "B", and wrote, [...] "Some twisty situations, some unexpected heart, some nuanced acting. Some serious single-camera potential. Could be worth awaiting last call to see who goes where, and why." ...|$|E

"The {{reason we}} did it this way {{actually}} {{has something to do}} with the fact…that the audience was so saturated with a kind of pre-existing knowledge about Jimmy's plans to leave," [...] explained Milch. [...] "It seemed to me that no story line that relied on any sort of unprepared-for outcome would work. Because… the audience's pre-existing expectations were that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> going. So if you did some sort of surprise event there would be too radical a dysfunction between the story's premise and the audience's emotional expectation." [...] —David Milch, The Buffalo News (November 25, 1998). [...] In April, Bochco stated that he did not intend to kill off Smits' character, Simone. On L.A. Law, Smits had returned to the show for critically acclaimed guest appearances during sweeps episodes after leaving his regular role. Whether Smits' character would overlap with Schroder's character on screen was undetermined when Schroder was announced in June, but at the time Season 6 production was scheduled to commence on August 10, 1998. As of mid-July, Smits' departing episode was not scheduled to film until September.|$|E
5000|$|The film {{includes}} material {{taken from}} over 1,000 hours of historical and new footage, {{and interviews with}} the current members of Foo Fighters, former bandmembers William Goldsmith and Franz Stahl, and producer Butch Vig. Frontman Dave Grohl has said the main inspiration for the film was the decision to record Wasting Light in the garage of his mansion in Encino, California - [...] "Personally, I {{thought it would be}} a good idea to now tell the story of the last 16 years, so it would make more sense to watch us make a record in a garage. After selling out fucking stadiums and becoming this big rock band, why would you make a garage record? To me the first hour and 20 minutes of the movie is leading up to that moment." [...] He also added that while the band [...] "always believed a little mystery is important to rock’n’roll", he considered it was time to tell their story, and referencing the Tom Petty documentary Runnin' Down a Dream, [...] "If we wait any longer, we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wind</b> <b>up</b> with a four-hour-long documentary".|$|E
