40|$|An <b>industrial</b> <b>gauge</b> for {{measuring}} thickness of a gold coating layer deposited on a steel base through detection of the backscattered beta particles has been described. 3 H, 14 C and 63 Ni pure beta emitters {{have been tested}} as the radioisotopic sources of the system individually in a fixed geometry. Analytical calculations have been performed in each case. Furthermore, simulations based on Monte Carlo stochastic technique (MCNP) have been processed. The obtained results from both methods have been compared to define {{the sensitivity of the}} system in each case. Finally for the first time, fuzzy TOPSIS method has been used for choosing the best source in the defined geometry for manufacturing, considering the following three criteria: (a) saturation thickness, (b) precision and (c) sensitivity. Results have shown that 3 H source is the best alternative to the introduced measuring system...|$|E

Alpha radiation is used in static eliminators and smoke detectors. The sterilizing effects of ionizing radiation are useful for cleaning medical instruments, food irradiation, and the sterile insect technique. Measurements of carbon-14, can be used to date the remains of long-dead organisms (such as wood that is thousands of years old).|$|R

50|$|After the war, Vossberg set out {{to apply}} {{electronics}} technology to industrial applications. Electron-Machine Corporation was formed in 1946 {{for the purpose of}} designing automatic electronic gaging and indicating equipment. The company was established {{in the back of a}} radiator repair shop in Lynbrook, New York. Instruments for diameter and thickness measurements for steel and cable products were conceived, developed, and licensed to other manufacturers. These instruments included the first commercial x-ray thickness gage, optical cable diameter gages, and an industrial process control computer. In 1950 he, in partnership, formed the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Gauges</b> Corporation and later established Research Developments, Inc., as a subsidiary.
