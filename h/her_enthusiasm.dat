5|$|Outside her {{political}} duties Bessie, a keen fan of boxing, accepted the honorary {{presidency of the}} Professional Boxers' Association, and was a passionate defender of the sport. <b>Her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> arose in part from her experiences as a juvenile court magistrate; she believed that the sport fostered character and mutual respect. She was frequently at odds with her parliamentary colleague Edith Summerskill, a physician who wrote the anti-boxing tract The Ignoble Art, and campaigned for the sport's abolition.|$|E
5|$|Hiromi {{struggles to}} {{overcome}} her mental weakness. Later, she {{falls in love}} with another tennis player, , but coach Munakata tells her not to get too involved and that she should forget him and work on her tennis skills. Hiromi often loses confidence in her playing abilities, but with the support of her coach and her friends she overcomes her anxiety. By training herself to become a better player, Hiromi grows into a mentally stronger person. <b>Her</b> <b>enthusiasm,</b> her love of tennis and the support from people around her helps her {{to become one of the}} best players in the world.|$|E
5|$|Marcos {{initially}} {{needed to}} win votes of the delegates of the Nacionalista Party for the presidential candidacy. Imelda assumed the managerial position in her husband's campaign. The other candidates of the party noted <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would {{have a say in}} the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda {{was the only one who}} went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> {{over the}} {{existing}} opportunities {{were those of}} a connoisseur loaded with the offered commodity, yet unable to endure {{the thought of a}} Philistine invasion.|$|R

6000|$|For all <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms,</b> {{for all the}} fondness and the [...] "crushes" [...] {{which she}} inspired, Carol's acquaintances were shy of her. When she was most ardently singing hymns or {{planning}} deviltry she yet seemed gently aloof and critical. She was credulous, perhaps; a born hero-worshipper; yet she did question and examine unceasingly. Whatever she might become {{she would never be}} static.|$|R
25|$|Although Lizzie {{did help}} Gbemi design the can, Harry M. {{did not bring}} her back due to <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and strong {{presentation}} skills during the pitch.|$|E
25|$|Caroline Birley (16 November 1851– 15 February 1907) was an English geologist, fossil {{collector}} and children's author. As a geologist, she was noteworthy, {{not so much}} for the scientific value of her collection, but for the regard with which she was held in a predominately male profession. Her interest in geology started with stones she collected as a child and <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> continued until her death.|$|E
25|$|In 1938 Murphy rented {{space for}} a second Patricia Murphy’s Candlelight Restaurant at 33 East 60th Street. At that time, she wrote, she was losing {{interest}} in operating the Brooklyn restaurant and needed the challenge of Manhattan to restore <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm.</b> In Manhattan she began by taking over a former tea room with a clientele composed largely of working women, whom she described as a significant new category of restaurant-goers.|$|E
60|$|Indeed, {{she was not}} at {{all sure}} that half this colonial {{prejudice}} was not assumed in order to tease her, just as in former times her brother would make game of <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> about school children; for he was altogether returned to his old self, his sister Jane, who had seen the most of him, testifying that the original Maurice had revived, as never {{in the course of his}} married life.|$|R
50|$|She {{loved to}} {{exercise}} hospitality and {{shared with her}} friends what she herself enjoyed. Beautiful pictures, fine laces, and basketry were among <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> and in <b>her</b> occasional exhibitions of the two latter she not only communicated her own careful information and appreciation concerning them, but evoked a real interest in their possibilities. Her hands were seldom idle, and the homes of many of her friends had examples of her painting, basketry, and needlework.|$|R

25|$|In 1977, {{she moved}} to Toronto, to try for success in a larger arena. She {{immediately}} began appearing on, and eventually producing, segments of the popular national CBC Radio program Morningside, where she usually paired with host Don Harron for free-wheeling discussions of favourite old comic strips and other pop culture. She also wrote, produced and acted in scores of comedy skits. Collins made similar appearances on CBC Television, on the Don McLean show. In her appearances Saba demonstrated, with humor, <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> and knowledge of cartooning, comics history, theatre and music.|$|E
25|$|She also {{expressed}} <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> at simply {{learning a new}} style of music. Although influenced by Adele's interest in country music at the time, 21 remains faithful to the Motown influences of 19 and exhibits both gospel and soul music inflections. Instruments such as the saxophone, harp, banjo and the accordion contributed to its exploration of blues and soul. The singer drew from the music of Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Elbow, Mos Def, Alanis Morissette, Tom Waits, and Sinéad O'Connor in the cultivation of the album's sound, and credited Yvonne Fair, Andrew Bird, Neko Case, and The Steel Drivers with its musical direction.|$|E
25|$|The White Lady, {{without making}} a sound, {{advances}} along the terrace. Raymonda follows her {{in a state of}} unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E

6000|$|Daily he {{returned}} to the subject of the new house, but as to time and mode he was indefinite. At first she believed. She babbled of a low stone house with lattice windows and tulip-beds, of colonial brick, of a white frame cottage with green shutters and dormer windows. To <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> he answered, [...] "Well, ye-es, might be worth thinking about. Remember where I put my pipe?" [...] When she pressed him he fidgeted, [...] "I don't know; seems to me those kind of houses you speak of have been overdone." ...|$|R
60|$|And somehow her father's wish, her brother's death, {{all seemed}} mingled {{in her brain}} with that religion, for which in <b>her</b> {{juvenile}} <b>enthusiasm</b> she would willingly have laid down her life.|$|R
25|$|Ballet {{was further}} {{shaped by the}} French ballet de cour, which {{consisted}} of social dances performed by the nobility in tandem with music, speech, verse, song, pageant, decor and costume. When Catherine de' Medici, an Italian aristocrat {{with an interest in}} the arts, married the French crown heir Henry II, she brought <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for dance to France and provided financial support. Catherine's glittering entertainments supported the aims of court politics and usually were organized around mythological themes. The first ballet de cour was the Ballet de Polonais. This Ballet was performed in 1573 {{on the occasion of the}} visit of the Polish Ambassador. It was choreographed by Balthasar de Beaaujoyeulx and featured an hour-long dance for sixteen women, each representing a French province. Ballet Comique de la Reine (1581), which was also choreographed and directed by Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx, was commissioned by Louise of Lorraine, queen consort of King Henry III, son of Catherine, to celebrate the marriage of Henry's favorite the Duke de Joyeuse to Marguerite de Lorraine, the sister of Queen Louise. The ballet lasted for more than five hours and was danced by twenty four dancers: twelve naiades and twelve pages.|$|E

500|$|Kentikian {{discovered}} <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for boxing {{when she}} {{was twelve years old}} after accompanying her brother to his boxing training. She started with regular training herself and stated that boxing had allowed her to forget the difficulties of her life for a short time: [...] "I could let everything out, my whole energy. If you have so many problems like our family, you need something like that." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted my}} hand to her lips. I foresaw what was coming; I tried to speak. But she gave me no opportunity; <b>her</b> eloquent <b>enthusiasm</b> rushed into a new flow of words.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked up}} sharply from his row of little pictures. Katharine was {{disposing}} of the American lady in far too arbitrary a fashion. Surely the victim herself must see how foolish <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> {{appeared in the}} eyes of the poet's granddaughter. Katharine never made any attempt to spare people's feelings, he reflected; and, being himself very sensitive to all shades of comfort and discomfort, he cut short the auctioneer's catalog, which Katharine was reeling off more and more absent-mindedly, and took Mrs. Vermont Bankes, with a queer sense of fellowship in suffering, under his own protection.|$|R
50|$|When Boston died, {{he left a}} widow, Audrey, who {{was still}} living in 2015. She shared <b>her</b> husband's <b>enthusiasm</b> for steam and for many years {{continued}} to co-organize the Market Bosworth Steam Rally.|$|R
500|$|... "Reaction" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Dr. Otto Octavius as Dr. Octopus. Coyle noted <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the character, particularly towards his design; she has given noteworthy praise towards his arms, as they [...] "are amazing, and the timing has been really good for this show, {{so much so that}} I think you feel the impact of those arms." [...] Coyle also believes that people can connect with the character on different levels. Similarly, Sean Galloway—a character designer on the series—said that he is [...] "probably one of [...] favorites" [...] to have designed.|$|E
500|$|During {{her time}} at Oxford, she was noted for her {{isolated}} and serious attitude. At Oxford, {{she met a}} young man named Tony Bray (1926–2014) who was impressed by her and later recalled that she was [...] "very thoughtful and a very good conversationalist. That's probably what interested me. She was good at general subjects". <b>Her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for politics as a girl made him think of her as [...] "unusual". Bray met Roberts' parents and described her father as [...] "slightly austere" [...] and [...] "totally correct" [...] and her mother as [...] "very proper" [...] and [...] "motherly".|$|E
500|$|While {{conductor}} of the Philharmonic, Chen set up a box in her office so that students could leave notes for her about themselves. One musician in the orchestra felt that Chen was [...] "kind of formal" [...] during rehearsal but felt [...] "like a big sister" [...] once practice ended. Chen {{has been described as}} a [...] "firecracker: small, bright and full of ka-boom", and <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> at times caused her to lose her breath. One of the organization's board members praised Chen's attitude and felt that her lack of ego was a [...] "rare quality in top symphony performers".|$|E
60|$|The idea of {{remarriage}} {{had never}} occurred to her. At eight and thirty, though tragedy had left its mark, it had been powerless to destroy the sweetness of a nature of such vitality as hers. The innate necessity of loving remained, and as time went on had grown more wistful and insistent. Insall and her Silliston neighbours were wont, indeed, gently to rally <b>her</b> on <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms,</b> while understanding and sympathizing with this need in her. A creature of intuition, Janet had appealed to her from the beginning, arousing first her curiosity, and then the maternal instinct that craved a mind to mould, a soul to respond to her touch....|$|R
60|$|Mrs Ford kissed <b>her</b> with an <b>enthusiasm</b> which {{hitherto}} she had {{reserved for}} Ogden.|$|R
60|$|Her father too {{remained}} {{silent for a}} little while. He was reminded of his weakness; he was, he perceived, still a little hysterical. He felt that he might weep at <b>her</b> youthful <b>enthusiasm</b> {{if he did not}} restrain himself.|$|R

She has {{the powers of}} tactile telepathy and hypnosis which allows her to control or convince others {{to do the things}} she wants them to by physical touch. However, Victor is immune to telepathy. Describing her role, Collins said [...] "I had to play off all the guys and their testosterone-heavy abilities. But I learned that the female powers of persuasion easily trump fangs and knives and guns." [...] Michelle Monaghan turned down the role because of scheduling conflicts, despite <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> to work with Jackman.|$|E
500|$|The visuals were disliked by reviewers, with Smith {{saying the}} game was [...] "plagued with bizarre design choices and lacklustre visuals" [...] and {{attributed}} this to the rush of the development. Walton wrote that {{the game was}} a good example for how to not make fighting games for the Kinect, continuing {{on to say that}} the presentation was sub-par. Gibson believed that [...] "everything about this game is incorrect". She said that <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> for the game diminished with the intro movie, and criticized the [...] "static images of ugly men with stupid names rolling across the screen". DeVries described the game as being rushed, hence the static and unflattering visuals.|$|E
500|$|In 1934 Mitford {{began her}} third novel, Wigs on the Green, a satire on Mosley's fascist [...] "Blackshirt" [...] movement. Mitford herself had briefly flirted with this cause, {{although}} <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasm</b> was [...] short-lived [...] and she {{soon became a}} vociferous opponent of fascism. When the novel was published in 1935 it made little critical impact, while seriously offending members of her own family, particularly her sisters Diana and Unity, {{both of whom were}} supporters of Mosley's movement and devotees [...] of the German dictator Adolf Hitler. Diana eventually forgave her, but the rift with Unity, who was outraged by her depiction in the book as the ridiculous [...] "Eugenia Malmains", was never fully healed.|$|E
60|$|And {{he talked}} {{on and on}} to her, and found that she entered into his plans with all <b>her</b> wild <b>enthusiasm,</b> but also with sound {{practical}} common sense; and Tom began to respect her intellect {{as well as her}} heart.|$|R
60|$|But M. le Duc {{would have}} had to be more than human not to be {{satisfied}} in a measure at the result of Gaston de Stainville's diplomacy; he stood in for a goodly share of the millions promised by England. But it was the diplomacy itself which horrified him. He had vainly tried to dissuade Lydie from chivalrous and misguided efforts on behalf of the young prince, or at any rate from active interference, if His Majesty had plans other than her own; but whilst she had rejected his merest suggestions on that subject with unutterable contempt, she had not only listened to Gaston de Stainville, but actually yielded her will and <b>her</b> <b>enthusiasms</b> to his pleadings.|$|R
