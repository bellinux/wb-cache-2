5|$|Another {{survivor}} was Katriel Katz, Israeli Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Katz {{had been}} {{expelled from the}} Soviet Union by Andrei Gromyko on 10 June 1967, {{the last day of}} the Six-Day War. During the evacuation from the aircraft, Katz was the only passenger to escape through the forward port door, despite the efforts of Hutchinson and Unwin to stop him using that door. The two flight crew were almost carried out through the door by Katz, who was a large man. Katz was seriously injured jumping <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> He was taken to Hillingdon Hospital, where it was initially feared that he would become the sixth victim of Flight 712. Katz recovered after a few days. He died in 1988 aged 80.|$|E
5|$|Don meets Rachel {{for dinner}} {{to make amends}} for the meeting. During the dinner, Don says he is living life to extract {{the maximum amount of}} {{pleasure}} as there is no tomorrow, while Rachel recognizes in Don the element of the disconnected outsider, for whom the world is laid out like a puzzle waiting to be solved. The two of them begin to bond, and she agrees to give Sterling Cooper another shot. Meanwhile, Pete and some of his co-workers go to a gentlemen's club to celebrate Pete's impending wedding. There, a waitress rejects Pete's advances. Dejected from this rejection and Don's recent criticisms, Pete arrives drunk at Peggy's apartment, and she invites him in. Don takes a train to a large house in the suburbs, where he is greeted by his loving wife Betty (January Jones), whom he has made no mention of thus far in the episode. He checks on their two sleeping children as she watches admiringly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Most {{doors are}} hinged {{along one side}} to allow the door to pivot away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> in one direction, but not the other. The axis of {{rotation}} is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged garage doors, the axis may be horizontal, above the door opening.|$|E

50|$|The station {{once had}} extra sidings {{on the far}} side of {{platform}} 2, as well as a turntable. The original stationmaster's house still stands. It was built in 1897, and at the time the stationmaster was able to see along <b>the</b> track <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways.</b>|$|R

25|$|In the {{basement}} of the floor of the Rene Block Gallery in Berlin, Beuys positioned himself on the floor wrapped in a large felt blanket. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares, often seen in his performances. Around him was an installation of copper rod, felt and fat. Inside a blanket he held a microphone and for a period of eight hours grunted into the microphone as viewers watched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> The grunts are compared to those of a stag, as the stag is a symbol of something like a chief. The performance directly relates and even includes elements of the Fluxus movement that Beuys was a part of. The grunting is seen in part of a composition as a reflection of suffering. Being wrapped in a felt blanket mirrors the story of his suffering and rescue by the Tartars after his plane crashed in the war.|$|E
25|$|The dalem is an {{enclosed}} structure typically subdivided along a north-south axis into different domains. In {{the case of}} kampung and limasan models this is a simple distinction between {{the front and rear}} parts of the omah, but in joglo houses, a more complex division is used to divide the front, middle, and back of the house. The dalem is often dark, lit only by light <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> The eastern part of the front portion of the dalem is where family chores are performed and where {{all the members of the}} family sleep, on a large bamboo bed, prior to the puberty of the children. The middle section of the dalem in joglo houses is defined by the four principal house posts which forms the tumpang sari of the joglo roof. In modern day, the area has no specific usage, but traditionally, this area was where incense was burnt once a week to honor the rice goddess Sri. The space below the tumpang sari is also the place where the bride and bridegroom are seated during their marriage ceremony.|$|E
500|$|The New Smoking Room {{built to}} hold the {{collection}} was only planned from 1891, and the collection was moved in there in early 1896, {{less than three years}} before Ferdinand's death. Good photographs allow an appreciation of how the objects were displayed, in glassed cases and on open shelves around the walls, over doors, and over the small fireplace, which had an elaborate shelved chimneypiece in wood above. [...] Several objects, including the Casket of Saint Valerie, were on tables away from the walls. Comfortable seating was plentiful, some upholstered with pieces from medieval vestments, and there were framed photographs and houseplants. [...] The room is now refilled with objects from the same period though of somewhat different types, and visitors to Waddesdon Manor can see it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Scarcely had it {{died away}} when the pussys began to appear. They leaped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> roofs of <b>the</b> houses, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways,</b> and even <b>from</b> among <b>the</b> shady clumps of long grass. Every house added six or seven to the number, and soon {{hundreds}} of pussycats were standing before the Queen, bowing gracefully and crying, [...] "Welcome, your Majesty!" [...] {{in all sorts of}} voices.|$|R
6000|$|And {{then came}} the policeman. [...] "Get outa that, you bloomin' swine! Eigh! eigh! Get out now!"

[...] "Shocking!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "Shocking! And of a Sunday morning! A pretty sight! Eigh! eigh! Get outa that, you bleeding nuisances!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{interior}} design {{was very different}} <b>from</b> previous models. <b>The</b> R44s had orange and yellow plastic bucket seats, a feature which would {{be incorporated into the}} other 75-foot B-division cars and the A-division R62s & R62As. The seats were protected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> by faux wood and glass panels. The walls were tan with [...] "wallpaper" [...] featuring the seals of New York State and New York City. This design continued onto the subsequent R46 cars.|$|R
500|$|On a busy New York City street, Jones and {{his team}} use the energy cell to open a doorway into a {{parallel}} universe and bring a truck through, but are apparently unsuccessful, as Jones complains he used the [...] "wrong coordinates". Having previously observed Walter at the graveyard, The Observer (Michael Cerveris) arrives with Walter at the Bishops' beach house, and gives Walter a coin, telling him to remember {{what he has to}} find. Walter goes on alone into the house, while Olivia and Charlie interview witnesses who saw Jones extract the truck <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway.</b> They discover that the truck's VIN numbers do not exist, which implies the [...] "truck was never made". A further interview with Nina reveals to the Fringe team that the truck is from another universe, and that Jones is using the stolen energy cell to travel to that universe.|$|E

2500|$|The tomb of Fabio Chigi, Pope Alexander VII, {{towards the}} end of the aisle, is the work of Bernini and called by Lees-Milne [...] "one of the {{greatest}} tombs of the Baroque Age". It occupies an awkward position, being set in a niche above a doorway into a small vestry, but Bernini has utilized the doorway in a symbolic manner. Pope Alexander kneels upon his tomb, facing outward. The tomb is supported on a large draped shroud in patterned red marble, and is supported by four female figures, of whom only the two at the front are fully visible. They represent Charity and Truth. The foot of Truth rests upon a globe of the world, her toe being pierced symbolically by the thorn of Protestant England. Coming forth, seemingly, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorway</b> as if it were the entrance to a tomb, is the skeletal winged figure of Death, its head hidden beneath the shroud, but its right hand carrying an hourglass stretched upward towards the kneeling figure of the pope.|$|E

50|$|In 2016 Metro Trains Melbourne began {{refurbishing}} {{the interior}} carriages of Siemens trains. All windguards and glass screens were removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> {{and replaced with}} a smaller verticalhandrail (except where wheelchair access is required), a number of seats removed near the doors and extra vertical and horizontal handrails fitted to improve comfort and capacity. A cleaning program occurred at the same time, which included fitting new seat pads and covers, re-painting walls and applying anti-graffiti film to the windows. As of August 2017, the entire fleet had been refurbished. A similar refurbishment has been completed on the older Comeng trains.|$|R
60|$|Sam Rover {{broke off}} short {{as a series}} of shrieks in a high-pitched {{feminine}} voice issued <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pantry of the big farmhouse. An instant later a hired girl, followed by a middle-aged cook, came flying forth <b>from</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>doorway.</b>|$|R

50|$|Contemporary music often formed part of The Scholars' {{programmes}} {{and included}} specially composed works by Philip Radcliffe (Cor Cordium), Malcolm Williamson (Death of Cuchulan), William Wordsworth (Adonais), John Rutter (It was a Lover and his Lass), John Joubert (Five Carols), William Mathias (Ceremony After A Fire Raid), Robert Walker (The Sun on the Celandines), Christopher Brown (Herrick Songs, <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Doorways</b> of <b>the</b> Dawn) and Howard Blake (The New National Songbook and 'Lullaby - A Christmas Narrative' {{which includes the}} original version of Walking in the Air).

60|$|So we mounted, and he trotted {{before us}} like a running footman, such as the great lords of Kaloon {{employed}} when they went about their business or their pleasure. Leaving the main street, he led us through {{a quarter of the}} town that had an evil reputation, and down its tortuous by-ways. Here we met a few revellers, while from time to time night-birds flitted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>doorways</b> and, throwing aside their veils, looked at us, but as we made no sign drew back again, thinking that we passed to some assignation. We reached the deserted docks upon the river's edge and came to a little quay, alongside of which a broad ferryboat was fastened.|$|R
