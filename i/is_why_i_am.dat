Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always on about peace." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera also {{supported}} Stripped by embarking {{on two different}} tours. In summer 2003, Justin Timberlake and Aguilera embarked on the Justified and Stripped Tour, {{which took place in}} North America. Talking about the tour, Timberlake revealed that [...] "She's got one of the most amazing voices I've ever heard. That homegirl can sing... this <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> standing here". Several tour dates were cancelled and rescheduled due to the collapse of lightning systems. An extended play entitled Justin & Christina was released exclusively at Target Stores in July 2003 to promote the tour. The CD contains four remixes of Aguilera and Timberlake's songs from their two albums, and two new tracks. In late 2003, The Stripped Tour, the former's extension, happened without Timberlake's acts. The tour took place in Europe, Japan and Australia. The former grossed total US$30,261,670, becoming the sixteenth highest-grossing tour of 2003. In summer 2004, Aguilera was expected to return to North American during the second leg of the tour. However, the 29 tour dates were cancelled in the last minute due to the singer's vocal strain. On November 15, 2008, an accompanying video release of the tour, Stripped Live in the U.K., was released worldwide. On December 8, 2004, a compilation album which includes Stripped and the DVD was released in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|On 18 February 1972 {{the state}} formed the Bangladesh Women's Rehabilitation Board, which was tasked with helping {{the victims of}} rape and {{to help with the}} {{adoption}} programme. Several international agencies took part in the adoption programme, such as Mother Teresa's Sisters of Charity. The majority of the war babies were adopted in the Netherlands and Canada as the state wished to remove the reminders of Pakistan from the newly formed nation. However, not all women wanted their child taken, and some were forcibly removed and sent for adoption, a practice which was encouraged by Rahman, who said, [...] "I do not want those polluted blood in this country". While many women were glad for the abortion programme, as {{they did not have to}} bear a child conceived of rape, others had to go full term, filled with hatred towards the child they carried. Others, who had their children adopted out so as to return to [...] "mainstream life", would not look at their newborn as it was taken from them. In the 1990s many of these children returned to Bangladesh to search for their birth mothers. In 2008, D'Costa attempted to find those who had been adopted, however very few responded, one who did said [...] "I hated being a kid, and I am angry at Bangladesh for not taking care of me when I needed it most. I don’t have any roots and that makes me cry. So that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> trying to learn more about where I was born." ...|$|E

2500|$|Later that year, he {{was made}} {{the head of the}} {{legislative}} bureau, but he rejected all attempts to congratulate him, stating [...] "I will only receive condolences, not congratulations." [...] When his mother asked why, he stated, [...] "I did not have accomplishments and was not an old acquaintance of the emperor. I have, however, received great favors from the emperor, and my position is high and important. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid." [...] When people suggested to him that he spend more time managing his properties, Cen responded: ...|$|E
2500|$|The dispute {{came to a}} head at the AFL's {{convention}} in Atlantic City in 1935, when William Hutcheson, the President of the United Carpenters, made a slighting comment about a rubber worker who was delivering an organizing report. Lewis responded that Hutcheson's comment was [...] "small potatoes," [...] and Hutcheson replied, [...] "I was raised on small potatoes, that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so small." [...] After some more words, Lewis punched Hutcheson, knocking him to the ground. Lewis then relit his cigar and returned to the rostrum. The incident, which was also [...] "small potatoes" [...] but very memorable, helped cement Lewis's image in the public eye as someone willing to fight for workers' right to organize.|$|E
2500|$|This dispute {{came to a}} head at the AFL's {{convention}} in Atlantic City in 1935, when Hutcheson interrupted a speech by a representative of the committee that was attempting to organize tire factory workers with a point of order. John L. Lewis, President of the Mine Workers, responded that Hutcheson's point of order was [...] "small potatoes," [...] to which Hutcheson replied [...] "I was raised on small potatoes, that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so small." [...] Lewis left the podium and, after some more words, knocked Hutcheson down, then relit his cigar and returned to the rostrum. Lewis {{and a number of other}} unions left the AFL two years later to form the Congress of Industrial Organizations.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Seaforth, [...] "Flora sent me {{back the}} last {{exchange}} somewhat indignantly, which <b>was</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{able to take}} my share in the Consolidated. Still, all {{that is a little}} outside the question, isn't it?" ...|$|R

2500|$|On January 4, 2010, U.S. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar {{called a}} meeting of {{principal}} parties to resolve remaining issues after the National Park Service ruled that Nantucket Sound is eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its cultural and spiritual significance to two Native American tribes. [...] "After several years of review, {{it is now time}} to move the Cape Wind proposal to a final decision point. That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gathering the principal parties together next week to consider the findings of the Keeper and to discuss how we might find a common-sense agreement on actions that could be taken to minimize and mitigate Cape Wind’s potential impacts on historic and cultural resources. [...] I am hopeful that an agreement among the parties can be reached by March1. If an agreement among the parties can’t be reached, I will be prepared to take the steps necessary to bring the permit process to conclusion. The public, the parties, and the permit applicants deserve certainty and resolution." ...|$|E
2500|$|Late that year, an {{incident}} involving Xu Yushi's son Xu Ziran (許自然) {{would lead to}} Xu Yushi's removal. [...] Xu Ziran, {{who was in charge}} of imperial wagons, had gone out on a hunt, and during the hunt, he had damaged a farmer's crops. [...] When the farmer became angry, Xu Ziran fired arrows toward the farmer. [...] Xu Yushi caned Xu Ziran 100 times, but did not report this to the emperor. [...] When the farmer submitted a formal accusation, the accusation was initially put aside by the official Yang Deyi (楊德裔), but another official, Yuan Gongyu (袁公瑜), then resubmitted the accusation directly to the emperor under a pseudonym. [...] Emperor Gaozong, in anger, stated, [...] "Xu Yushi is a chancellor, but when the people's lives and properties were interfered with, he did not report to me. [...] Is this not an abuse of power?" [...] Xu responded, [...] "I serve in a key position of the government, and I serve Your Imperial Majesty with honesty and fairness, and I could not please everyone. [...] That <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> being attacked. [...] As for abusing power, only someone who commands strong troops or is stationed at a key military post can do so. [...] I am but a civilian who serves the emperor, and I only know how to perfect myself behind closed doors. [...] How can I abuse power?" [...] This caused Emperor Gaozong to be angrier, and he stated, [...] "Are you displeased that you do not command troops?" [...] Another chancellor, Xu Jingzong, who happened to be present, stated, [...] "For an imperial subject to have this kind of attitude, death would be too good of a treatment for him!" [...] Emperor Gaozong ordered that Xu Yushi be expelled from his presence and removed from his post.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, Indians named [...] "No Neck" [...] and [...] "Black Heart" [...] {{testified in}} an inquiry before the Office of Indian Affairs. [...] The hearing weighed the {{morality}} of Indian employment in show business. [...] "You are engaged in the exhibition or show business," [...] observed the acting commissioner, A.C. Belt. [...] "It is not considered among white people a very helpful or elevating business. [...] I believe that which {{is not good for}} the white people is not good for the Indians, and what is bad for the white people is bad for the Indians." [...] The Indians defended their work as adamantly as any white performer, and they turned the inquiry into a pointed denunciation of the Indian policy by comparing conditions in the show with those of the Pine Ridge Agency. [...] The contrast reflected poorly on the Office of Indian Affairs. Rocky Bear began by pointing out that he long had served the interests of the federal government (Great White Father) by encouraging the development of Indian reservations. [...] He worked in a show that fed him well; [...] "that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> getting so fat," [...] he said, stroking his cheeks. [...] It was only in returning to the reservation that [...] "I am getting poor." [...] If the Great [...] Father wanted him to stop appearing in the show, he would stop. [...] But until then, [...] "that is the way I get money." [...] When he showed his inquisitors a purse filled with $300 in gold coins, saying [...] "I saved this money to buy some clothes for my children," [...] they were silenced. [...] Black Heart, too, denounced the allegations of mistreatment. [...] "We were raised on horseback; that is the way we had to work." [...] Buffalo Bill Cody and Nate Salsbury [...] "furnished us the same work we were raised to; that is the reason we want to work these kind of men." ...|$|E

5000|$|Shortly {{after losing}} the petition, Mr Kipoi told Daily Monitor that he is just a victim of [...] "jealous rivals". [...] "I have the {{required}} qualification that <b>is</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> nominated.
