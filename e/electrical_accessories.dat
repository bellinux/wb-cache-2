25|$|A {{photovoltaic}} system, or solar PV {{system is}} a power system designed to supply usable solar power by means of photovoltaics. It consists of an arrangement of several components, including solar panels to absorb and directly convert sunlight into electricity, a solar inverter to change the electric current from DC to AC, as well as mounting, cabling and other <b>electrical</b> <b>accessories.</b> PV systems range from small, roof-top mounted or building-integrated systems with capacities from a few to several tens of kilowatts, to large utility-scale power stations of hundreds of megawatts. Nowadays, most PV systems are grid-connected, while stand-alone systems only account for {{a small portion of}} the market.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, several {{automobile}} manufacturers announced that future vehicles will use aspects of hybrid electric technology {{to reduce fuel consumption}} {{without the use}} of the hybrid drivetrain. Regenerative braking can be used to recapture energy and stored to power <b>electrical</b> <b>accessories,</b> such as air conditioning. Shutting down the engine at idle {{can also be used to}} reduce fuel consumption and reduce emissions without the addition of a hybrid drivetrain. In both cases, some of the advantages of hybrid electric technology are gained while additional cost and weight may be limited to the addition of larger batteries and starter motors. There is no standard terminology for such vehicles, although they may be termed mild hybrids.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>electrical</b> <b>accessory</b> {{connection}} was supplied by a DC generator. Voltage varied with engine speed {{and because of}} technological limitations, complicated mechanical devices were used to regulate it. Even so, voltage at idle was too low to be useful. A lead-acid battery was used to provide proper voltage when the generator could not, and was recharged at higher engine speed or lower electrical load. The automobile self starter was an early engine system to use this.|$|R

30|$|Connections to {{the vehicle}} {{controller}} area network bus (CANbus) have allowed information relating to speed, distance, time of trip, fuel consumption, <b>electrical</b> <b>accessory</b> usage, and heating and ventilation usage to be gained. This information is then used to provide feedback and support. The existence of sensor technology, radio frequency communication-based technology, ad-hoc communication, positioning technology and video image processing technology enables extra information on the driving environment to be collected and interpreted. Examples of such information are distance and/or speed from the vehicle ahead, lateral position of the vehicle on the lane and degree of visibility (e.g. day or night). Integrating them into in-vehicle driver support systems should decrease human errors, alert the driver as early as possible to an impending danger, warn him/her if there is no driver reaction to the first alert and actively assist or ultimately intervene in order to avert the accident or mitigate its consequences [14, 41, 50, 51]. Warnings should be given in visual or audible formats rather than vibrating format as elderly drivers are less sensitive to vibration [52].|$|R

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{a methodology}} for determining desirable characteristics and {{requirements of the}} energy storage system for fuel cell hybrid vehicles. The purpose of this work was to provide supporting analysis for the FreedomCAR Technical Teams in defining energy storage requirements for fuel cell vehicles. The power and energy requirements related to specific roles of the energy storage system have been determined for two vehicle class scenarios, a mid-size car and a mid-size SUV. The specific roles of the energy storage system considered included driveline traction power during fuel cell start-up, powerassist capability during the drive cycle, regenerative braking energy recapture capability, gradeability and acceleration performance improvement, <b>electrical</b> <b>accessory</b> loads, and fuel cell startup and shutdown loads. Considering the requirements for each role individually provides the ability to mix and match the characteristics desired based on the specific design scenario. In the short term, specific cost and specific volume of fuel cell systems will likely lead to hybridized fuel cell vehicles to satisfy cost and volume constraints. The process was applied to define the energy storage system characteristics for several scenarios. Through hybridization, it has been demonstrated that the powertrain system cost and volume can be reduced in the near-term scenario over the fuel cell only vehicle scenario...|$|R

50|$|A jon boat (or johnboat) is a {{flat-bottomed}} boat {{constructed of}} aluminum, fiberglass, or wood with one, two, or three bench seats. They {{are suitable for}} fishing and hunting. The hull of a jon boat is nearly flat, therefore it tends to ride over the waves rather than cut through them as a V-hull might, thus limiting {{the use of the}} boat to calmer waters. Jon boats typically have a transom onto which an outboard motor can be mounted. They are simple and easy to maintain, and inexpensive with many options to upgrade. Typical options might include live wells/bait wells, side or center consoles, factory installed decks and floors, <b>electrical</b> wiring, <b>accessory</b> pads/mountings, casting and poling platforms.|$|R
