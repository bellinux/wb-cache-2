60|$|Chlorophyll.--This {{substance}} was tried, as {{it contains}} nitrogen. Dr. Moore sent me some preserved in alcohol; it was dried, but soon deliquesced. Particles {{were placed on}} four leaves; after 3 hrs. the secretion was acid; after 8 hrs. {{there was a good}} deal of inflection, which in 24 hrs. became fairly well marked. After four days two of the leaves began to open, and the other two were then almost fully re-expanded. It is therefore clear that this chlorophyll contained matter which excited the leaves to a moderate degree; but judging by the eye, little or none was dissolved; so that in a pure state it would not probably have been attacked by the secretion. Dr. Sanderson tried that which I [page 126] used, as well as some freshly prepared, with artificial <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid,</b> and found that it was not digested. Dr. Lauder Brunton likewise tried some prepared by the process given in the British Pharmacopoeia, and exposed it for five days at the temperature of 37o Cent. to <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid,</b> but it was not diminished in bulk, though the fluid acquired a slightly brown colour. It was also tried with the glycerine extract of pancreas with a negative result. Nor does chlorophyll seem affected by the intestinal secretions of various animals, judging by the colour of their excrement.|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarnivorous plants usually grow in nutrient-deficient habitats, {{and thus}} they partly depend on insects for {{nitrogen}} and phosphate needed for amino acid and nucleotide synthesis. We report that a sticky <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid</b> from a sundew, Drosera adelae, contains an abundant amount of an S-like ribonuclease (RNase) that shows high amino acid-sequence similarity to S-like RNases induced by phosphate starvation or wounding in normal plants. By giving leaves an RNase “coat”, D. adelae seems to achieve two requirements simultaneously to adapt itself to its specific surroundings: it obtains phosphates from insects, and defends itself against pathogen attack...|$|E

40|$|The {{use of the}} {{clinoptilolite}} rich natural zeolites in biomedical {{applications such}} as in anticancer therapy, drug or drug support systems and as nutritive supplement is highly dependent on their behavior in digestive conditions. Aim {{of this study is}} to investigate structural stability of clinoptilolite rich natural zeolites in simulated digestion conditions and their interactions with digestive media and with Caco- 2 (human colon adenocarcinoma) cells. X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES) analyses of the clinoptilolite rich zeolite samples showed that zeolites preserved their structural stabilities during in vitro digestion. Slight interactions were detected in UV measurements of the <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid</b> media and FTIR spectra of the intestinal digested media powders. SEM results implied that zeolites might have a role in the aggregation of the digestive enzymes. Cytotoxicity test using colon cancer cells showed that clinoptilolite rich natural zeolites have cytotoxic effect against Caco- 2 cells and cytotoxicity did not significantly change with respect to simulated digestion process.

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{performed}} analyses of the factors that contributed the infected meat reach food chain, we have found out that the infection occurred after consuming the meat inspected by the method of collective samples artificial digestion by using a magnetic stirrer (MM). In this work there are presented assay results which show how modifications of the method, on the level of final sedimentation, influence the reliability of Trichinella larvas detection in the infected meat samples. It has been shown that use of inadequate laboratory containers for larva collecting in final sedimentation and change of volume of <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid</b> that outflow during colouring preparations, can significantly influence inspection results. Larva detection errors ranged from 4 to 80 % in presented the experimental groups in regard to the control group of samples inspected by using MM method, which had been carried out completely according to Europe Commission procedure No 2075 / 2005, where no errors in larva number per sample was found. We consider that the results of this work will contribute to the improvement of control of the method performance and especially of the critical point during inspection of meat samples to Trichinella larvas in Serbia...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe pitcher-shaped {{leaves of}} Nepenthes {{carnivorous}} {{plants have been}} considered as pitfall traps that essentially rely on slippery surfaces to capture insects. But {{a recent study of}} Nepenthes rafflesiana has shown that the viscoelasticity of the digestive fluid inside the pitchers plays a key role. Here, we investigated whether Nepenthes species exhibit diverse trapping strategies. We measured the amount of slippery wax on the pitcher walls of 23 taxa and the viscoelasticity of their <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid</b> and compared their retention efficiency on ants and flies. The amount of wax was shown to vary greatly between species. Most mountain species exhibited viscoelastic digestive fluids while water-like fluids were predominant in lowland species. Both characteristics contributed to insect trapping but wax was more efficient at trapping ants while viscoelasticity was key in trapping insects and was even more efficient than wax on flies. Trap waxiness and fluid viscoelasticity were inversely related, suggesting the possibility of an investment trade-off for the plants. Therefore Nepenthes pitcher plants do not solely employ slippery devices to trap insects but often employ a viscoelastic strategy. The entomofauna specific to the plant's habitat may exert selective pressures, favouring one trapping strategy {{at the expense of the}} other...|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} real-time PCR markers to identify the origin of contamination in shellfish. Oyster, cockles or clams were either contaminated with fecal materials and host-associated markers designed from Bacteroidales or Catellicoccus marimammalium 16 S RNA genes were extracted from their intravalvular <b>liquid,</b> <b>digestive</b> tissues or shellfish flesh. Extraction of bacterial DNA from the oyster intravalvular liquid with FastDNA spin kit for soil enabled the selected markers to be quantified in 100 % of artificially contaminated samples, {{and the source of}} contamination to be identified in 13 out of 38 naturally contaminated batches from European Class B and Class C areas. However, this protocol did not enable the origin of the contamination to be identified in cockle or clam samples. Although results are promising for extracts from intravalvular liquid in oyster, it is unlikely that a single protocol could be the best across all bacterial markers and types of shellfish.

40|$|This NebGuide {{describes}} {{the most common}} species of spiders found in Nebraska, including the black widow and brown recluse, and how to control them. General Description and Habits Spiders can be distinguished easily from insects. All spiders have two major body regions and four pair of legs; insects have three body regions and three pair of legs. Spiders vary widely in color, shape, size, and habits. All produce venom that is poisonous to their normal prey. Few spiders are considered dangerous to humans, however. These animals are predaceous by nature and use their venom, which is injected through hollow fangs or chelicerae, to immobilize their prey. Spiders normally feed on insects and other small arthropods, but some large tropical species capture small mice, rats, birds, or fish. Spiders can only ingest <b>liquids.</b> <b>Digestive</b> fluids are either injected into the prey or regurgitated on to it. The spider then imbibes the liquified material. Spiders are generally considered beneficial because they consume large numbers of insects and are of almost no importance as disease carriers. Unfortunately, they do not differentiate between beneficial and destructive insects in their diet...|$|R
40|$|Candida albicans colonizes {{the human}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{and can cause}} life-threatening systemic infection in susceptible hosts. We study here C. albicans virulence determinants using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans in a pathogenesis system that models candidiasis. The yeast form of C. albicans is ingested into the C. elegans <b>digestive</b> tract. In <b>liquid</b> media, the yeast cells then undergo morphological change to form hyphae, which results in aggressive tissue destruction and death of the nematode. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that hyphal formation is critical for C. albicans pathogenesis in C. elegans. First, two yeast species unable to form hyphae (Debaryomyces hansenii and Candida lusitaniae) were less virulent than C. albicans in the C. elegans assay. Second, three C. albicans mutant strains compromised {{in their ability to}} form hyphae (efg 1 Δ/efg 1 Δ, flo 8 Δ/flo 8 Δ, and cph 1 Δ/cph 1 Δ efg 1 Δ/efg 1 Δ) were dramatically attenuated for virulence. Third, the conditional tet-NRG 1 strain, which enables the external manipulation of morphogenesis in vivo, was more virulent toward C. elegans when the assay was conducted under conditions that permit hyphal growth. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the C. elegans assay in a screen for C. albicans virulence determinants, which identified several genes important for both hyphal formation in vivo and the killing of C. elegans, including the recently described CAS 5 and ADA 2 genes. These studies in a C. elegans-C. albicans infection model provide insights into the virulence mechanisms of an important human pathogen...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBackground and Aims: The {{slippery}} waxy zone in {{the upper}} part of pitchers has long been considered the key trapping structure of the Nepenthes carnivorous plants; however, the presence of wax is reported to be variable within and between species of this species-rich genus. This study raises the question of the adaptive significance of the waxy zone and investigates the basis for an ontogenetic cause of its variability and correlation with pitcher shape. Methods: In Brunei (Borneo) the expression of the waxy zone throughout plant ontogeny was studied in two taxa of the Nepenthes rafflesiana complex, typica and elongata, which differ in pitcher shape and size. We also tested the adaptive significance of this zone by comparing the trapping efficiency and the number of prey captured of wax-bearing and wax-lacking plants. Key Results: In elongata, the waxy zone is always well expanded and the elongated pitchers change little in form during plant development. Wax efficiently traps experimental ants but the number of captured prey in pitchers is low. In contrast, in typica, the waxy zone is reduced in successively produced pitchers until it is lost {{at the end of the}} plant's juvenile stage. The form of pitchers thus changes continuously throughout plant ontogeny, from elongated to ovoid. In typica, the number of captured prey is greater, but the role of wax in trapping is minor compared with that of the <b>digestive</b> <b>liquid,</b> and waxy plants do not show a higher insect retention and prey abundance as compared with non-waxy plants. Conclusions: The waxy zone is not always a key trapping structure in Nepenthes and can be lost when supplanted by more efficient features. This study points out how pitcher structure is submitted to selection, and that evolutionary changes in developmental mechanisms could play a role in the morphological diversity of Nepenthes...|$|E
