5|$|On 26 January 1814, Edmund Kean debuted as Shylock in Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice at London's Drury Lane theatre. William Hazlitt, drama critic <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Chronicle {{since the}} {{previous}} September, {{was in the}} audience. He wrote a stunning review, followed by several others applauding (but sometimes censuring) Kean's performances in other Shakespearean tragedies, including King Richard II, King Richard III, Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, and, what Hazlitt considered the best of Kean's performances, Othello. (These were written <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Chronicle, the Champion, and the Examiner; he was to continue as principal drama critic for the last of these for three years.) Kean was hitherto unknown in London. Hazlitt, having recently begun {{a career as a}} theatrical reviewer, was no better known than the subject of his reviews. These notices quickly brought both Kean and Hazlitt before the public eye.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Clarke had {{a varied}} {{military}} career {{that began with}} a posting to Mesopotamia in 1919. During the Iraqi revolt of 1920, he helped evacuate Europeans from the region by boat.

Clarke volunteered to help the local British force and was tasked with feeding misinformation to Turkish nationalists– a first taste of the activities that would define his later military career. In 1925, during another period of leave, Clarke covered the Rif War <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Morning</b> Post.|$|E
5|$|Australia's lower order batted the {{tourists}} into {{control on the}} second morning. Despite the loss of Lindwall for 15 at 275/8, Tallon kept on batting, supported by Johnston and Toshack, who scored their highest Test scores. Australia's wicket-keeper put on 45 with Johnston—who scored 29— before becoming Bedser's second victim <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Toshack then joined Johnston and the last pair put on 30 more runs before Johnston was stumped from Wright's leg spin. Yardley was later criticised for not bringing Wright into the attack at an earlier stage, as the Australian tail were dealing well with the English pacemen. Bedser was the most successful of the bowlers, ending with 4/100 from 43 overs, while debutant Coxon took 2/90 from 35 overs.|$|E

During the fifth session, held on the morning of January 22, 29 drivers participated, and Joey Logano was quickest with a speed of 197.516mph. Brad Keselowski was quickest with a speed of 198.605mph in the final session.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had been worked with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on the line, with the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there was someone waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E

5|$|With {{both sides}} {{exhausted}} from the fighting {{the night of}} 5/6 October was less eventful than expected, and the Australians used {{the opportunity to develop}} their position. To add further depth to their defences and to probe the Chinese positions, Taylor ordered the Australians to capture the central remaining Chinese position, the Sierra feature—a wooded knoll halfway between the summit of Maryang San and the Hinge—the next day. Meanwhile, the Fusiliers would renew their attack on Hill 217. The southern approach to Hill 217 had proved to be too strongly defended by the Chinese and it became obvious that if it was to be overcome Taylor would need to split the fire of its defenders. To do this the high ground to the north-west of Maryang San, known as the Hinge, would be vital. Indeed, adjacent to Hill 217, the Hinge dominated it from the north. As such for the next assault, planned <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> the Fusiliers would detach their reserve company to attack the Hinge from the east, using the Australian positions on Maryang San as a firm base and thereby allowing them to outflank their opponents on Hill 217.|$|E
