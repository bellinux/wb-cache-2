30|$|Similarly, in {{the middle}} 60 s when women entered the labor force, state {{response}} was absent. Hence, for-profit ECE services expanded within the private sector with the major goal {{of taking care of}} children while their mothers were at work. Families had to afford all the cost of the services by paying monthly fees. Broadly identified as non-formal private centers, these institutions operated beyond the scope of educational authorities, following only fiscal and sanitary and <b>hygienic</b> <b>norms</b> (Arakaki et al. 1986; Martin et al. 1977). Strikingly, this is still the case for many jurisdictions, where for-profit, non-formal private centers are legally framed as a business; they are not required to hire qualified teachers; neither are they mandated to implement a curriculum, nor are they supervised by education authorities (Burgos and Silva 2013).|$|R

The {{purpose of the}} study was to assess stress in workers exposed to overheat in the hot period of the year. The microclimate components and wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) were measured in two units: glass manufacturing unit and iron foundry. Stress was estimated in 15 males, exposed to heat and in a control group of 15 men from each unit. Stress hormones were followed up on three-hour intervals during the early morning shifts: cortisol was assessed using RIA kits, cathecholamines – with spectrofluorimetric method. The heart rate was followed up too. The psychosocial factors were assessed by the questionnaire “My job”. The microclimate parameters and WBGT indicated a high heat load in glass manufacturing unit, and a moderate one, mainly due to infrared radiation in the iron foundry. A highly significant in-crease in the secretion of the stress hormones in the exposed to heat workers in both units was found, more pronounced and considerable in the glass manufacturing unit. The over-heat rises a considerable increase in the activity of the stress system, more expressed with high heat load.

The purpose {{is the development of}} <b>hygienic</b> <b>norms</b> for a series of dispersing agents present in the reservoir water and validation of sanitary conditions determining their use in the process of additional cleaning of water reservoirs from the oil film. The conditions defining the degree of harmless use of the dispersing agents (illustrated by the use of Oxyphos-B) for additional cleaning of a water object from thin-film oil have been determined. The character, the laws and the degree of evidence of the biological action have been studies; the degree of the danger has been evaluated; the parameters of the harmful action thresholds and the levels of harmless action of six dispersing agents in water reservoirs have been determined. The intensity of the processes of self-cleaning water reservoir at their contamination with dispersing agents has been assessed. Six dispersing agents have been recommended for use.

40|$|Considering {{the more}} {{frequently}} events (volcanic eruptions, explosions, chemical contaminations etc.) which occur in nature, villages and industrial towns, the paper presents simple solutions and mechanical devices {{that allow the}} use of aeration function within habitable places for life protection and human health. These devices were the objective of some research studies {{that led to the}} determination of air amount needed for performing the activity under normal conditions in diverse habitable places (kitchens, living-rooms, bed-rooms or places with special destination in accordance with the imposed <b>hygienic</b> <b>norms)</b> and the determination of their constructive and functional features, implicitly. Experimental models devices for adjusting the aeration function in three constructive variants (with valve closure, with sliding cylinder element) were elaborated based on the performed studies and research. Based on the research studies performed by the author in Romania, EU countries and other areas, it is noticed that a small number of habitable places are endowed with such simple but efficient devices used for controlling the aeration function in case of calamities. These devices can be mounted in subassemblies of windows or in mixed elements; the production costs are reduced. The constructive systems, under normal exploitation conditions, allow the aeration/ventilation of habitable spaces ensuring the protection against insects as well. In case of calamities the slop panels can be equipped with special filters for air purification; these can be fixed without a special training. The proposed solutions may represent an alternative to the classical solutions for air conditioning that request high costs and available power source...|$|R
40|$|The {{biologic}} {{effects of}} an electromagnetic field of a frequency of 2375 t 50 MHz was studied in rats and rabbits in specially constructed absorbant chambers. The results of the investigations have shown that microwave radiation of 10, 50, 500,uW/cm 2 for 30 days, 7 hr/day, causes a number of changes in bioelectric brain activity and also in behavioral immunological, and cytochemical reactions. It was found that levels of 10 and 50,AW/cnt 2 stimulate the electric brain activity at the initial stage of irradiation, while a level of 500,AW/cm 2 causes its suppression, {{as seen from the}} increase of slow, high amplitude A-waves. At 500 j. W/cm 2 a decrease in capacity for work, in value of unconditioned feeding stimulus, in investigating activity, electronic irradiation threshold, and in inhibition of cellular and humoral immunity were also observed. Rudnev,* The Soviet side studied the nature of the effect of nonionizing microwave radiation on the biological activity of some structures of the brain, behavioral reactions and also the immunological properties of blood in test animals. This was done in conjunction with the program and agreed to plans for cooperation involving the first stage (in 1976). Method for Exposing the Animals Various technical solutions for organizing the experiment are possible (strip-line, parallel plates, waveguide, and others) in studying the nature, degree and repeated effects associated with the effect of electromagnetic energy on an organism. Our experience shows that irradiating animals in the far field of an antenna is an adequate condition for the actual irradiation of a population and consequently most acceptable for research whose objective is the establishment of <b>hygienic</b> <b>norms</b> for environmental factors.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{awareness}} of health {{risks associated with}} body art among secondary school pupils has never previously been studied in depth. A large sample of secondary school adolescents from the Veneto Region (North East Italy) were investigated in order to inform health education programs. Methods 6 public secondary schools {{from each of the}} 7 Provinces of the Veneto Region were selected. All students attending the 1 st, 3 rd, and 5 th school years were surveyed by an anonymous self administered questionnaire on their perception of health risks related to body art and other explanatory variables. Logistic regression analysis was employed, reporting adjusted Odds Ratios (OR) with 95 % Confidence Interval (CI). Results Among 4, 277 available students (aged 14 - 22 years), boys were consistently: less knowledgeable of infectious diseases related to body art (OR = 0. 78; CI: 0. 66, 0. 94), less likely {{to be aware of the}} <b>hygienic</b> <b>norms</b> to be observed in a body art parlour (OR = 0. 54; 0. 44, 0. 65), less likely to refer to a certified body art parlour (OR = 0. 56; 0. 48, 0. 66), less likely to refer to a professional health care provider for complications related to body art (OR = 0. 71; 0. 59, 0. 86). Students attending the first school year (baseline) had a lesser knowledge of body art related infectious diseases, were less likely to refer to a certified body art parlour, and to know the mandatory hygienic rules to be observed when performing body modifications. Interviewees from the provinces of Rovigo and Vicenza were less likely to be conscious of the health risks associated with body modifications, and those with tattoos were less knowledgeable about the infection risk (OR = 0. 60; 0. 42, 0. 86) and less likely to refer to a professional health care provider in case of medical complication (OR = 0. 68; 0. 48, 0. 95). Students with piercings were less likely to refer to a certified practitioner for receiving body art (OR = 0. 62; 0. 50, 0. 77) or therapy for medical complications (OR = 0. 37; 0. 29, 0. 46). Conclusions Health education programs should focus on males, pupils attending lower school years, living in specific Provinces of the Region, and with a positive attitude towards piercing or tattoo. </p...|$|R
40|$|Wood is {{the most}} ancient {{material}} used by mankind for furniture making. During the ages it was almost completely replaced by new materials like metal, plywood, chipboard, plastic, MDF and some others. But nowadays, as the world has become too filled with different chemicals and harmful substances, people have started to worry about ecological and human-friendly materials. Thus wood has received its "re-birth". The market share of solid wood glued board furniture is increasing every year. However if we {{take a close look}} at the Russian furniture market, we will notice that this process is extremely slow in our country because of local stereotypes regarding common furniture appearance which can be clearly seen through IKEA example. IKEA is one of the largest wood producers on the Russian furniture market. Four years ago IKEA opened its first store in Russia. Yet the sales share for solid wood furniture is still much lower than that in Europe. That is why there is a huge need for solid wood furniture products specifically adapted to the Russian market. The main goal of this thesis is to design a factory capable of producing a furniture set made of solid wood which could fit in the IKEA range in Russia. The choice of overall appearance and construction is based on the Russian market research. All technological and environmental requirements are based on internal IKEA specifications. The designed furniture production viability was checked from technological and economical points of view. The well-known “wooden glued board” production system was chosen because it gives an opportunity to increase the yield. The idea is that sawn goods are splitted into planed lamellas in 4 -side molder and glued together in pressing machine to get the glued board which can be processed further like a usual board material like chipboard or MDF. Then the CNC router center used to get the non-linear shape of the edges. For finishing the UV-curing line was chosen as the system which can give us the most cheap surface treatment layer. The exact equipment models were chosen according to the needed capacities on the each stage of production process. The whole line is able to produce 45000 pieces of universal furniture unit per year in case of three shifts which corresponds to ~ 2600 m 3 of highly treated furniture. The raw materials needs were calculated using original Russian method which allows taking into account the exact amounts of all wastes on each stage of technological process. The annual sawn goods need was estimated to ~ 6000 m 3. Also all additional need like glue, stains, sealer, lacquer and sanding paper were calculated in purpose to get the real direct production costs. The total factory layout including all additional areas was made based on Russian legislation and <b>hygienic</b> <b>norms.</b> It was needed to calculate annual electricity, water and heat assumption. The final stage of the thesis is the total economical calculation of all costs to carry out during the production of annual program. Taking into calculation all direct and indirect production costs the profitability became 36, 5 % which is really high figure for Russian market. The IRR of 11, 3 % and payback time of 4, 6 years is also suitable for Russia, so the project appears to be vital and profitable. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} world stocks of {{sturgeons}} {{is on the}} edge of catastrophe. These species are either extinct or under threat of extinction under human impacts. At the same time, there are enterprises, fish hatcheries, which deal with restoration and replenishment of natural stocks with of endangered fish species. One of such hatcheries is the sturgeon hatchery “Lebyazhy” (Astrakhan region, Russian Federation). The aim of the study was an analysis of piscicultural-biological features of the Russian sturgeon brood fish. During the study, which was conducted in April–May 2011, 34  Russian sturgeon females were used in two rounds, 17 individuals each. For stimulating gametes maturation, the Derzhavin’s physiological method was used. Caviar was obtained by stripping the eggs under strict <b>hygienic</b> and sanitary <b>norms.</b> Eggs fertilization with the semi-dry method used the male milt that bought at the “Raskat” LLC. Egg stickiness elimination was performed with the aid of talc and apparatuses for the egg stickiness elimination. Eggs incubation was performed in the “Osetr” apparatuses until yolk-sac larvae hatching. The domesticated fish were subjected to bonitation for determining their readiness for spawning. As a result of this bonitation, the brood fish were separated into two groups: first round of rearing works: females with mean weight of 34. 8 kg and age of 9 years; second round: females with mean weight of 32. 3 kg and the same age. Among injected females of the first round, 100 % positive reaction for the stimulating injection was observed, but 95 % – among females of the second round. Maturation time of females of both rounds varied from 25 to 30  hours. The maturation state of gametes of sturgeon females or males was determined based on samples obtained. 90. 2 kg of eggs were obtained from females of the first round. At the same time, the maximum quantity was observed in the female of 50. 5  kg – 9. 2 kg of caviar, and the least quantity was obtained from the 27. 8 kg female – 2. 8 kg. On average, 5. 3 kg of eggs were obtained per one female of the first round. The obtained quantity of eggs in one gram did not exceed 48 eggs that are considered to be within normal limits. 79. 8 kg of eggs were obtained from females of the second round of rearing works that is 10. 4 kg less in comparison with the results of the first round. On average, 5. 0 kg of eggs were obtained from one female that is related to less mature fish used in the second tour. At the same time, the maximum quantity of eggs, 7. 9 kg, was obtained from a 32. 5 kg female, while the minimum quantity, 2. 6 kg, from a 20. 7 kg female. The obtained quantity of eggs in one gram did not exceed 44 eggs. Mean working fecundity of females of the first round was 198. 2 thousand eggs, while it was somewhat less in the second round – 184. 6 thousand eggs that did not exceed the normative values...|$|R
