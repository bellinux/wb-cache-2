40|$|The article {{describes}} the development of Czech social policy & the issues that have surrounded it since 1989. The author begins by describing {{the character of the}} communist welfare state & outlining its theoretical alternatives. Despite the introduction of energetic changes {{during the early years of}} transition, since the mid- 1990 s the area of social policy has been dominated by stagnation, & instead of any real & specific efforts in this area there are only debates. Despite all the problems that plague the current social policy, at present the system performs satisfactorily, as is evident in the very low rate of poverty. However, in the long run, concerns may arise over inadequate family situations, a <b>frozen</b> <b>pension</b> system, & poor work motivation. The 'reform' year of 2005 has seen the emergence of many different efforts relating to social policy, but it has not heralded any substantial changes aimed at a more efficient functioning of the system...|$|E

5000|$|A <b>frozen</b> {{occupational}} <b>pension</b> (or a preserved pension) is {{one which}} has been left behind in an occupational pension scheme by people no longer employed by the sponsoring employer. These pensions are [...] "frozen" [...] until retirement age.|$|R
50|$|Corbyn {{has long}} championed {{the rights of}} frozen {{overseas}} British pensioners who are excluded from annual up-rating adjustments to their State Pensions because {{of the country that}} they live in. He became a founder member of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on <b>Frozen</b> British <b>Pensions</b> in 2013.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{lifestyle}} mobilities of British retirees in Thailand, drawing on empirical research conducted in 2012. Thailand is a host {{to a significant}} number of British retirees motivated by a search for a better lifestyle in Asia. This pursuit of mobility for lifestyle reasons, rather than economic gain or work, implies a relative privilege involving a range of choices and opportunities. For many, the lifestyle achieved in Thailand is perceived as mediating negative effects of ageing and enhancing well-being. However, the material challenges of lifestyle mobility in Thailand, such as <b>frozen</b> <b>pensions,</b> healthcare costs and property insecurity, destabilise an initial optimism and lead to feelings of entrapment and immobility in relation to state policy and practice. The paper argues for a relational framing of lifestyle mobility as a means of understanding and analysing the differential experience of privilege and precarity in semi-colonial or post-colonial locations...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Frozen</b> state <b>pensions</b> {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of the British government of [...] "freezing" [...] state pensions for pensioners who live in the majority of overseas countries. There are many anomalies. Most Commonwealth countries are included in the frozen list, and some non-Commonwealth, non-European countries are in the list where UK pensioners get the same indexation as pensioners resident in Britain.|$|R
50|$|Bottomley {{has been}} a {{supporter}} of British pensioners living overseas, mainly in Commonwealth countries (47 out of 54) who have had their British state <b>pensions</b> <b>frozen</b> at the rates at which they were first paid or as at the dates of migration. British pensioners living in the remaining seven Commonwealth countries and those living {{in a number of}} non-Commonwealth countries have their British state pensions uprated each year, just as if they were living in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|The Basic State Pension is {{increased}} in April {{each year to}} pensioners living in the UK and in certain overseas countries which have a Social Security Agreement with the UK that includes British pension uprating. [...] Pensioners living in other overseas countries without a current agreement have their <b>pensions</b> <b>frozen</b> at the rate in effect on the date {{when they left the}} UK, or on the date when they applied for a pension, whichever is later.|$|R
5000|$|The Social Security Administration {{reported}} in 2009 {{that there is}} a long-term trend of pensions switching from defined benefit (DB) (i.e., a lifetime annuity typically based on years of service and final salary) to defined contribution (DC) (e.g., 401(k) plans, where the worker invests a certain amount, often with a match from the employer, and can access the money upon retirement or under special conditions.) The report concluded that: [...] "On balance, there would be more losers than winners and average family incomes would decline. The decline in family income is expected to be much larger for last-wave boomers born from 1961 to 1965 than for first-wave boomers born from 1946 to 1950, because last-wave boomers {{are more likely to have}} their DB <b>pensions</b> <b>frozen</b> with relatively little job tenure." ...|$|R
40|$|The {{long-term}} {{shift in}} coverage from defined benefit (DB) pensions to defined contribution (DC) plans may accelerate rapidly as more large companies freeze their DB pensions {{and replace them}} with new or enhanced DC plans. This paper uses the Model of Income in the Near Term to simulate the impact of an accelerated transition from DB to DC pensions on the distribution of retirement income among boomers. A scenario in which employers freeze all remaining private sector DB plans and a third of all state and local plans {{over the next five years}} will on balance produce more losers than winners among boomers and reduce their average incomes at age 67. Income changes will be largest among higher-income boomers, who have the highest DB coverage rates and projected pension incomes. Furthermore, the numbers of winners and losers and net income changes are much greater for the last wave of boomers (born between 1961 and 1965) than for earlier boomers. Younger boomers are most likely to have their DB <b>pensions</b> <b>frozen</b> with relatively little job tenure and to lose their high accrual years for DB pension wealth, but also to have relatively more years to accumulate DC pension wealth before retirement [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|The American {{conception}} of retirement {{has received a}} number of significantly jarring assaults in recent years. Employers have increasingly shifted the investment risk of funding retirement to their employees by switching from so-called 2 ̆ 2 traditional 2 ̆ 2 defined benefit plans that promise retirees a predictable paycheck for life to defined contribution arrangements that provide no such assurances. Other employers have <b>frozen</b> their traditional <b>pension</b> plans or otherwise terminated their employees 2 ̆ 7 ability to accumulate further credits toward retirement. Even President George W. Bush added to the general anxiety about income in retirement by an extended campaign in 2005 that suggested {{that the federal government}} 2 ̆ 7 s venerable program for funding retirement-Social Security-was hopelessly outmoded and headed toward bankruptcy. This Article examines a source of retirement anxiety that has received far less attention but is of paramount importance for prospective and current retirees alike-namely, health insurance in retirement. Indeed, the presence of retiree health insurance {{is one of the most}} significant factors determining when people choose to leave the compensated workforce, especially if declining health is one of the reasons that they are considering retirement. As an important recent study concluded, without such insurance, 2 ̆ 2 current employees will have strong financial incentives to work longer and retire later. 2 ̆ 2 Such incentives might therefore impact employment prospects for younger workers if older workers delay their retirement. Thus, this issue is enormously important to anyone connected to the U. S. workplace, regardless of age...|$|R
