5|$|Garfield Sobers, {{captain of}} the West Indies cricket team {{and one of the}} most {{prominent}} cricketers in the world, outraged many in the Caribbean in September 1970 when he took part in a friendly double-wicket tournament at Salisbury Sports Club in Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980), a country in southern Africa that was unrecognised internationally because of its mostly white minority government. The resulting furore nearly caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> the captaincy, and threatened the unity of the West Indies team itself.|$|E

5|$|The administration's {{response}} to racial violence was minimal, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> black support. When black postmasters at Hogansville, Georgia in 1897, and at Lake City, South Carolina the following year, were assaulted, McKinley issued no statement of condemnation. Although black leaders criticized McKinley for inaction, supporters responded by {{saying there was}} little the president could do to intervene. Critics replied by saying that he could at least publicly condemn such events, as Harrison had done.|$|E
5|$|Arjuna, {{one of the}} Pandavas, recollects a curse {{which could}} help him stay incognito for one year. In the past, Arjuna was felicitated by Indra, the king of deities for gaining the divine weapon, Pashupatastra, from Lord Shiva through {{dedicated}} devotion. The celestial dancer Urvashi {{falls in love with}} Arjuna but he rejects her advances as he considered her a motherly figure. Feeling insulted, Urvashi cursed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his masculinity and turn into an eunuch. Indra arrived and asked Arjuna to treat this curse as a blessing in disguise as the 13th year is arriving. Taking this into account, Arjuna turns into a transgender dance teacher Brihannala.|$|E

5|$|At a church, {{the killer}} is searching through files {{when he is}} interrupted, and flees, leaving bloodied {{fingerprints}} at the scene. Black constructs {{a profile of the}} man, and deduces that his actions are attacks on faith, believing that the killer has suffered a devastating loss which has caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his own faith. As the manhunt for the killer tightens, another cleric is tortured and killed; however, Black senses that the killer has returned to where his life fell apart. He and the police are able to identify the killer as Galen Calloway (Michael Zelniker), whose wife and daughter had been killed in a house fire several years earlier. Black knows the killer's next target will be the church that held the family's funeral.|$|E
5|$|Bam Bam Bigelow {{challenged}} Lawrence Taylor to a match, which Taylor accepted after initially refusing. Diesel trained Taylor, {{who beat}} Bigelow at WrestleMania XI. Embarrassed, Bigelow challenged Diesel to {{a match for}} the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Tatanka was at ringside for the match; he turned on Bigelow and caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> Bigelow attacked Tatanka after the match, which led to Sid, a new addition to the Corporation, to come to Tatanka's defense. This led to a tag team match at King of the Ring 1995, where Diesel and Bigelow defeated Tatanka and Sid.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} concerns, Aflaq kept quiet. But to his astonishment, keeping quiet caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his post as Secretary General â€“ Aflaq was succeeded as Secretary General of the National Command by Munif al-Razzaz, a Jordanian of Syrian origin. However, the power {{between the two}} camps was {{unexpectedly}} reshuffled when Amin al-Hafiz defected to Aflaq's camp. In contrast to other military officers al-Hafiz had very little influence within or outside the party. Al-Hafiz's defection led to a resurgence of activity within Aflaq's faction, al-Bitar and Umran were brought back from Spain {{to form a new}} government.|$|E

5|$|Crush's {{rivalry with}} Vega ended {{when he joined}} the Nation in early 1997. Crush aided Faarooq in his feud with Ahmed Johnson. After his loss to Goldust at King of the Ring, Crush argued with Savio Vega, during Faarooq's WWF Championship title shot, which distracted Faarooq, causing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> the match. The {{following}} night on Raw is War, Crush and Vega, {{along with the rest of}} Nation were fired by Faarooq. As a result, Crush began feuding with Faarooq and formed his own biker faction called Disciples of Apocalypse, which was introduced on the June 23 episode of Raw is War.|$|E
5|$|England won the toss {{and elected}} to bat on an ideal batting pitch. Hutton and Washbrook {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 168, the best by England in the series. Washbrook refrained from the hook shot, which had caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his wicket on earlier occasions in the series. The partnership was ended when Hutton was bowled by Lindwall. Washbrook reached his century and joined by Edrich, the pair batted {{until late in the}} first day, when Washbrook was dismissed by Johnston for 143 in the last over of the day. His innings had included 22 boundaries and ended a second-wicket partnership that yielded exactly 100 runs. Bedser was sent in as the nightwatchman and survived as England closed at 268/2, with Edrich on 41.|$|E

However, he was sacked after the Battle of Britain after political intrigue caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> Churchill's confidence. In 1941 he was appointed Governor-General of New Zealand, holding office until 1946.|$|E

5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the BEA's {{preliminary}} report, the investigation into Lubitz found he had been treated for suicidal tendencies prior to his training as a commercial pilot and had been temporarily denied a US pilot's license because of these treatments for depression. The final report of the BEA confirmed the preliminary report's findings, saying the co-pilot began showing symptoms of psychotic depression. For five years, Lubitz had frequently been unable to sleep {{because of what he}} believed were vision problems; he consulted over forty doctors and feared he was going blind. Motivated by the fear that blindness would cause <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his pilot's licence, he began conducting online research about methods of committing suicide before deciding to crash Flight 9525.|$|E
5|$|Kesler's {{success as}} a player has been {{attributed}} to his competitiveness and desire to outwork opposing players. Kesler has recognized, however, that his competitive drive has often caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his composure. In the 2010 off-season, Canucks management encouraged him to play with more focus, maintaining his emotions and decreasing physical and verbal confrontation with opposing players. During the subsequent 2010â€“11 campaign, he gained media attention for changing his play accordingly while enjoying the best season of his career. Kesler has also credited the change with his role as a father, wanting to set a mature example for his children when they watch him play.|$|E

The restored King Louis XVIII made SÃ©rurier a Peer of France, but he joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, when the former emperor briefly returned to power.

5|$|Secretariat {{was widely}} viewed as the {{favorite}} to win by most sportswriters and people; however, the added distance {{and the possibility of}} running too slow for a distance or running too fast too soon could potentially cause <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose.</b> Out of the starting gate, Secretariat and Sham traded the lead. Around the three-quarters mile marker Sham began to fade and Secretariat began to extend an advantage. Twice a Prince and Our Native overtook Sham to take second and third, respectively. Sham finished last, behind Pvt. Smiles, who was in last before Sham slowed severely.|$|E
5|$|The Achaeans were {{demoralized}} by this battle; Aratus {{declined the}} generalship, and when both Athens and the Aetolian League turned down their appeals, they sued Cleomenes for peace. Initially, Cleomenes advanced only minor requests, {{but as the}} talks continued, his demands became greater and he eventually insisted that leadership of the League be surrendered to him. In exchange, {{he would return to}} the Achaeans the prisoners and strongholds he had seized. The Achaeans invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where they were holding council. While marching there, Cleomenes drank too much water, which caused <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> his voice and cough up bloodâ€”a situation that forced him to return to Sparta.|$|E
