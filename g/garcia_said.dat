5|$|Immediately after Luna's death, {{confusion}} reigned on both sides. The Americans {{even thought}} Luna {{had taken over}} to replace Aguinaldo. Luna's death was publicly declared only by 8 June, and a circular providing details of the event released by 13 June. While investigations were supposedly made concerning Luna's death, not one person was convicted. Later, General Pantaleon <b>García</b> <b>said</b> that {{it was he who}} was verbally ordered by Aguinaldo to conduct the assassination of Luna at Cabanatuan. His sickness at the time prevented his participation in the assassination. Aguinaldo would be firm in his stand that {{he had nothing to do}} with the assassination of Luna.|$|E
25|$|Constitutional law expert Mario Amoretti, while {{agreeing that}} the ruling should be final, remarked {{that the state}} conceivably could file a challenge, {{claiming}} some constitutional violation, {{but he said he}} didn't see grounds for such an appeal. Berenson was required to remain in Peru on supervised parole until her 20-year sentence ended in 2015, unless the sentence was commuted by the President. When he was President, Alan <b>Garcia</b> <b>said</b> he would consider a commutation only after the legal case had run its course.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, {{the office}} of the New York County District Attorney (Manhattan) {{initiated}} a probe into her affairs managed by her accountant, Irving Kamsler, and her attorney, Wallace Bock. Then a former paralegal for Bock's law firm, Cynthia <b>Garcia,</b> <b>said</b> that Bock received many lavish gifts from Clark, including a $1.5 million gift after the September 11 attacks in 2001, to build a bomb shelter in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank near the homes of his daughters. According to Garcia, Bock tried many times to get Clark to sign a will, including versions that included him as a beneficiary. Bock's spokesperson acknowledged that she had a will. In September 2010, in a one-paragraph ruling, Judge Laura Visitacion-Lewis turned down a request from a grand-half-nephew and two grand-half-niecesIan Devine, Carla Hall Friedman and Karine McCallto appoint an independent guardian to manage Clark's affairs.|$|E

25|$|When he was 37, {{he married}} his 22-year-old backup singer and dancer Mayte Garcia, on Valentine's Day 1996. Mayte Garcia {{wrote in her}} memoir, The Most Beautiful: My Life with Prince that she was 16 when she first met Prince {{backstage}} at a concert in Germany after submitting a tape of her belly dancing. When Garcia turned 17 she moved to Prince's home, Paisley Park and he became her legal guardian. At 19, Prince {{told her it was}} time to go on birth control and took her virginity just one week later. They had a son named Amiir Gregory Nelson on October 16, 1996; he was born with Pfeiffer syndrome and died a week later. In a later interview, she stated that she and Prince also lost a pregnancy early on to a miscarriage in late 1997. The couple eventually divorced in June 2000. <b>Garcia</b> <b>said</b> that all she wanted to take from the union was the urn with their son's ashes. She eventually learned from a friend that Prince had burned everything in their son's nursery, including the boy's crib and the urn with his ashes.|$|E
25|$|Mydland {{died of a}} {{speedball}} overdose in July 1990. His death greatly affected Garcia, {{leading him}} {{to believe that the}} band's chemistry would never be the same. Before beginning the fall tour, the band acquired keyboardists Vince Welnick and Bruce Hornsby. The power of Hornsby's keys musically drove Garcia to new heights on stage. As the band continued through 1991, Garcia became concerned with the band's future. He was exhausted from five straight years of touring. He thought a break was necessary, mainly so that the band could come back with fresh material. The idea was put off by the pressures of management, and the touring continued. Garcia's decrease in both stamina and interest to continue touring caused him to use heroin again after several years of intermittent prescription opiate use. Though his relapse was brief, the band was quick to react. Soon after the last show of the tour in Denver, Garcia was confronted by the band with another intervention. After a disastrous meeting, Garcia invited Phil Lesh over to his home in San Rafael, California, where he explained that after the meeting he would start attending a methadone clinic. <b>Garcia</b> <b>said</b> that he wanted to clean up in his own way, and return to making music.|$|E
500|$|After taking {{private lessons}} from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music {{at the age of}} seventeen, {{studying}} harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren. It is not clear whether {{he was a member of}} Manuel Garcia's singing class, but it is certain that he became its accompanist and was greatly influenced by Garcia. Wood also accompanied the opera class, taught by Garcia's son Gustave. Wood's ambition at the time was to become a teacher of singing, and he gave singing lessons throughout his life. He attended the classes of as many singing teachers as he could, although by his own account, [...] "I possess a terrible voice. <b>Garcia</b> <b>said</b> it would go through a brick wall. In fact, a real conductor's voice." ...|$|E

6000|$|The cavalcade was now {{in motion}} again, and wound {{gradually}} up into the hills. Presently {{they came to a}} point where four roads met. A clump of trees grew hard by, and the boys gave a start of horror at seeing the bodies of six French soldiers swinging from them. [...] "Ay, that's Nunez's work, I expect," [...] <b>Garcias</b> <b>said</b> coolly. [...] "There were three of his men swinging there last week, so as a lesson he has hung up six of the French. He is a rough boy to play with, is Nunez." ...|$|R

500|$|Nicknamed [...] "The Big Bear" [...] by {{teammate}} Joe Gordon for {{his large}} frame, Garcia was listed at , 200lb (91kg) during his career. <b>Garcia</b> <b>said</b> that his actual playing weight was between 215–220lb (97–100kg). Garcia also acquired the nickname [...] "Mexican Mike" [...] in the press. However, Garcia's minority status {{was not a}} novelty. The Indians had signed Larry Doby, the first black player in the American League, in 1947. The 1951 team would add manager Al López and Latino players Minnie Miñoso and Jesse Flores to a squad that already included Garcia and Mexican player Bobby Ávila. Early on, Garcia was paired to room with Avila, who had just signed with the team and did not speak English. Garcia served as a translator for Avila well beyond their first season together.|$|E
500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and {{he is wearing a}} pink shirt with the name of the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were not going to allow the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and I went home and did it again. We did not want to leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio <b>García</b> <b>said</b> in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; we came out with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E
500|$|Lancaster {{left the}} band in March 2007 citing {{a lack of}} writing credit on the band's releases. Lenzo and Bundrick filled in for Lancaster's vocals, while Garcia and Betts {{performed}} Lancaster's guitar parts. <b>Garcia</b> <b>said</b> this change made the guitars [...] "sound more clear" [...] and not [...] "clutter"; on the other hand, the group found it hard working out who should sing Lancaster's parts. Lancaster's departure hurt Sanders personally as [...] "he was a good friend". Later that month, the band supported Plain White T's on their U.S. tour. On April 4, [...] "Black Cat" [...] was made available for streaming via Hot Topic's Myspace profile. On April 13, the release of A Lesson in Romantics was announced. Between early May and late June, the band went on tour with support from Bedlight for Blue Eyes, Driver Side Impact, and Sick City. The track listing was revealed on May 18. On June 6, the band made [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] available for streaming via their Myspace profile.

500|$|Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center is {{a maximum}} {{security}} prison in Cebu, in the Cebu Province of the Philippines. The center {{is run by}} [...] Byron F. Garcia, and its inmates are either facing trial or are serving sentences for crimes ranging from shoplifting to murder and rape. In 2007, more than 300 of the inmates were facing murder charges. Garcia initiated the idea of exercising as an enjoyable way of keeping the prisoners mentally and physically fit. [...] "While {{the goal is to}} keep the body fit {{in order to keep the}} mind fit, such may not happen if it is done in a manner deemed unpleasurable", <b>Garcia</b> <b>said.</b> Considering music to be [...] "the language of the soul", Garcia added it to the prisoner's workout regime. Garcia also wanted the music workouts to be a way in which to break down gang factions amongst prison inmates. Melita Thomeczeck, the Philippine's deputy consulate general in New York, suspected that the warden added the music in order to take detainee's minds off of other matters. One of the first songs the prisoners worked with was Pink Floyd's [...] "Another Brick in the Wall". Garcia [...] had them march to the music as a bid to increase participation in exercise. Other early musical choices included [...] "In the Navy" [...] and [...] "Y.M.C.A." [...] by the Village People. The Village People songs were chosen so that macho inmates [...] "wouldn't be offended by being asked to dance".|$|E

Exiting the gate, Bayern veered sharply to the left, badly hampering Shared Belief and Moreno before taking the early lead. He was tracked throughout the race by the British-trained Toast of New York with California Chrome close behind and maintained his advantage into the straight. In a closely contested three-way finish, Bayern prevailed by a nose from Toast of New York and a neck from third-place California Chrome. Next to finish were Shared Belief, Tonalist, and Candy Boy, meaning that the first six places were filled by three-year-olds. The racecourse stewards conducted an inquiry into the interference caused by Bayern at the start but allowed the result to stand. After the race, <b>Garcia</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's an amazing feeling, a dream come true... We let him run, and if anything happens, you make adjustments.
