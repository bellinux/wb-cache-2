25|$|The Victorian Railways H {{class was}} an express {{passenger}} steam locomotive {{operated by the}} Victorian Railways from 1941 to 1958. Intended to eliminate the use of <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> A2 class locomotives on The Overland services on the steeply graded Western line to Adelaide, wartime restrictions led to only one locomotive being built. Nicknamed Heavy Harry, H220 was the largest locomotive ever built in Australia and the largest non-articulated steam locomotive to run on Australian railways.|$|E
25|$|After {{a lengthy}} absence, R711 is now {{operational}} and accredited {{to operate on}} the mainline. Now wearing a special Victorian Railways royal blue and gold livery reminiscent of the Spirit of Progress days. R711 returned to the mainline in the later half of 2011 conducting mainline trials. Whilst remaining oil fired, the engine has reverted to a single blast pipe set up as standard on the R class fleet as well as reverting to standard screw reverser. R711 {{is owned by the}} City of Bendigo. On 22 July 2012, R711 operated its first mainline tour open to the public, <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> with R761 to Traralgon as trailing engine, as part of the annual Snow Train.|$|E
25|$|While the B class {{locomotives}} {{were highly}} successful on the expensively-engineered 1860s mainlines {{for which they}} were designed, they were less suited for the more cheaply built extensions to the VR system. Future VR express passenger locomotives were to use a four-wheel leading bogie to steer the locomotive, and from 1884 a class of 4-4-0 locomotives (later classed 'Old A') began to supplement, and eventually supersede the B class. Despite the delivery of the Old A, and the later and increasingly larger 'New A' and AA class 4-4-0s of 1889 and 1900 respectively, the entire B class (other than a couple of accident write-offs) lasted into the Twentieth century, with their roles ranging from <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> on express passenger trains down to shunting duties.|$|E

25|$|At the Limebank Quarry near Loerie, quarried {{limestone}} {{was crushed}} and loaded into buckets carried on an overhead ropeway from the quarry to bunkers at Loerie. In 1954, the cement company doubled its quarry output capacity when a second parallel ropeway {{was placed in}} service. A limitation in {{the capacity of the}} limestone trains throughout the steam haulage era was that <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> by Garratt locomotives was not permitted to protect their pivots from excessive stresses. It therefore became common practice to run heavier Garratt-headed trains of up to 14 wagons with a Class NG10 helper cut in to the train some eight to ten wagons back. From a passing loop at Summit, the Garratt would continue to Chelsea unassisted whilst the helper returned down the hill to Loerie.|$|E
25|$|Diesel {{locomotives}} offer significant operating {{advantages over}} steam locomotives. They can safely be operated by one person, making them ideal for switching/shunting duties in yards (although for safety reasons many main-line diesel locomotives {{continue to have}} 2-man crews: an engineer and a conductor/switchman) and the operating environment is much more attractive, being much quieter, fully weatherproof and without the dirt and heat that is an inevitable part of operating a steam locomotive. Diesel locomotives can be worked in multiple with a single crew controlling multiple locomotives throughout a single train—something not practical with steam locomotives. This brought greater efficiencies to the operator, as individual locomotives could be relatively low-powered {{for use as a}} single unit on light duties but marshaled together to provide the power needed on a heavy train still under the control of a single crew. With steam traction a single very powerful and expensive locomotive was required for the heaviest trains or the operator resorted to <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> with multiple locomotives and crews, a method which was also expensive and brought with it its own operating difficulties.|$|E

5000|$|The company {{announced}} that on July 19 it would implement {{the practice of}} <b>double</b> <b>heading,</b> joining two trains' worth of cars into one train with two engines, for all trains moving through Pittsburgh. This would {{reduce the number of}} jobs that were available, require more work, and increase the likelihood of accidents. The same day <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> was to go into effect, the superintendent of the Pennsylvania Railroad at Pittsburgh issued an order that, according to strikers, effectively doubled the mileage of what was considered a [...] "day's work," [...] increasing it from 46 mi to 116 mi, without increasing the size of the crews. In total, the company would be able to discharge fully half of their workforce.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Double</b> <b>heading</b> is {{a useful}} {{practice}} on single lines {{even in the absence}} of a need for more power, as to double-head a train saves making a separate path for a spare engine; it can be repositioned using the traffic path occupied by the service train.|$|E

50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>heading</b> is {{most common}} with steam locomotives, {{but is also}} practised with diesel locomotives.

5000|$|As <b>double</b> <b>heading</b> {{has become}} {{increasingly}} uncommon railway companies may advertise specially double-headed services as an attraction to enthusiasts; this occurs regularly but infrequently on the British mainline, whilst the Romney, Hythe & Dymchurch Railway in England advertises an annual day when all of its passenger trains are double-headed all day, both steam and diesel.|$|E
