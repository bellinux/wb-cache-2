5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to <b>examine</b> various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, <b>examine</b> evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to <b>examine</b> evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to <b>examine</b> on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow into the microphone to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E

5|$|Often feminist economists use country-level {{or smaller}} case studies focused on {{developing}} and often understudied countries or populations. For example, Michael Kevane and Leslie C. Gray <b>examine</b> how gendered social norms {{are central to}} understanding agricultural activities in Burkina Faso. Cristina Carrasco and Arantxa Rodriquez <b>examine</b> the care economy in Spain to suggest that women's entrance into the labor market requires more equitable caregiving responsibilities. Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E
5|$|Select {{committees}} are temporary committees, {{established by the}} Senate to deal with particular issues.

Australian Senate select committees have included ones set up to <b>examine</b> the Administration of Indigenous Affairs, and Mental Health. Select committees usually cease to exist upon reporting back to the chamber. One exception to this was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation which in various forms existed for a decade.|$|E

5000|$|The typical {{criminal}} proceeding {{in the civil}} law world {{can be thought of}} as divided into three basic parts: the investigative phase, the <b>examining</b> phase (the instruction), and the trial. The investigative phase comes under the direction of the public prosecutor, who also participates actively in the <b>examining</b> phase, which is supervised by the <b>examining</b> judge. The <b>examining</b> phase is primarily written and is not public. The <b>examining</b> judge controls the nature and scope of this phase of the proceeding. The <b>examining</b> judge is expected to investigate the matter thoroughly and to prepare a complete written record, so that by the time the <b>examining</b> stage is complete, all the relevant evidence is in the record. If the <b>examining</b> judge concludes that a crime was committed and that the accused is the perpetrator, the case then goes to trial. If the judge decides that no crime was committed or was that the crime was not committed by the accused, the matter does not go to trial.|$|R

5|$|Sub-disciplines {{of biology}} {{are defined by}} the scale at which life is studied, the kinds of organisms studied, and the methods used to study them: {{biochemistry}} <b>examines</b> the rudimentary chemistry of life; molecular biology studies the complex interactions among biological molecules; cellular biology <b>examines</b> the basic building-block of all life, the cell; physiology <b>examines</b> the physical and chemical functions of tissues, organs, and organ systems; ecology <b>examines</b> how organisms interact in their environment; and evolutionary biology <b>examines</b> the processes that produced the diversity of life.|$|R
