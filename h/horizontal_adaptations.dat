5000|$|Daniel Ogden {{speaks of}} three ways {{to explain the}} origins of Greek dragon myths: as {{vertical}} evolution from (reconstructed) Proto-Indo-European mythology, as <b>horizontal</b> <b>adaptation</b> from Ancient Near Eastern mythology, or as sitting within [...] "the cloud of international folktale". Regarding theories of vertical transmission, Ogden argues that they carry [...] "an unspoken assumption that prior to such a transfer the Greeks' own myth-world was a tabula rasa", which he calls absurd; only Typhon's Near Eastern origins are, in his view, plausible.|$|R
5000|$|In IMM methodology, a city {{consists}} of the superimposition of {{an enormous number of}} interrelated components, categorized in different layers or 'subsystems', which through their inner arrangement and the architecture of their ligands provide a certain physical and provisional arrangement. The constituents of the CAS adapt themselves to react to the newly imposed constraints, in order to improve upon the entire system's performance. The complex adaptive system is composed of heterogeneous elements, linked together either directly or indirectly, and the final system performance emerges from all of the elements as a whole. This adaptation occurs within or on members of a single subsystem, known as <b>horizontal</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and between the different subsystems, termed Vertical Adaptation. In other words, the adaptation of existing members in a subsystem, or <b>horizontal</b> <b>adaptation,</b> {{as a response to the}} newly imposed conditions and constraints, changes the subsystem's performance, which will be the cause of the entire system's transformation over time.IMM is a design methodology with the aim to improve the performance of the CAS; the main characteristics of the IMM are based on three fundamental approaches: holistic, multi-layer and multi-scale. The complex adaptive system is composed of heterogeneous elements, linked together either directly or indirectly, and the final system performance emerges from all of the elements as a whole. This adaptation occurs within or on members of a single subsystem, hereafter known as <b>horizontal</b> <b>adaptation,</b> and between the different subsystems, hereafter termed vertical adaptation. In other words, the adaptation of existing members in a subsystem, or <b>horizontal</b> <b>adaptation,</b> as a response to the newly imposed conditions and constraints, changes the subsystem's performance, which will be the cause of the entire system's transformation over time. They define a dynamic networks of interactions, and their relationships are not aggregations of the individual static entities.One can sharpen the performances of the entire complex system, utilizing the adaptive behaviors of the CAS, both horizontal and vertical. The entire complex system will be transformed by the mentioned symbiotic adaptive behaviors between the elements and subsystems, modification and integration, over time. By boosting the performance of one subsystem through the assistance of the transformation of another subsystem, one creates a collaborative relation, which ultimately leads to transformation of the complex system in an optimal way. To reiterate, modification happens when the members of one layer are optimized, in order to improve their own layer's performances. On the other hand, integration is a symbiotic relation between different layers, for better performance, which ultimately improves the entire system's performance. Due to the fact that the IMM investigates on the relationships between urban morphology and energy consumption, the theory focus mostly on the ‘Subsystems’ characterized by physical characters and arrangement: ...|$|R

40|$|Powerful ideas {{recently}} {{appeared in}} the literature are adjusted and combined to design improved samplers for Bayesian exponential random graph models. Different forms of adaptive Metropolis-Hastings proposals (vertical, horizontal and rectangular) are tested and combined with the Delayed rejection (DR) strategy {{with the aim of}} reducing the variance of the resulting Markov chain Monte Carlo estimators for a given computational time. In the examples treated in this paper the best combination, namely <b>horizontal</b> <b>adaptation</b> with delayed rejection, leads to a variance reduction that varies between 92 % and 144 % relative to the adaptive direction sampling approximate exchange algorithm of Caimo and Friel (2011). These results correspond to an increased performance which varies from 10 % to 94 % if we take simulation time into account. The highest improvements are obtained when highly correlated posterior distributions are considered. Comment: 23 pages, 8 figures. Accepted to appear in Statistics and Computin...|$|R
50|$|The curve {{illustrates}} {{the relationship between}} intelligence (vertical axis) and <b>adaptation</b> (<b>horizontal</b> axis), where <b>adaptation</b> means {{the ability to use}} for one's own purposes the resources of the universe. It starts with animals and ends with the optimal form, the Ultimate Inclusion, able to utilize most efficiently all resources of the universe, both by perfecting their use of the resources and by adapting their form to the most efficient in their use. Named after the fictional scientist, Remy, this curve is supposed to be universal for all intelligent species throughout the multiverse.|$|R
30|$|Most importantly, {{rectangular}} or cubic arrays enable {{not only}} <b>horizontal</b> beam pattern <b>adaptation</b> but also vertical beam pattern adaptation, that is, they enable three-dimensional (3 D) beamforming, which provides an additional degree-of-freedom for interference suppression [10]. Therefore, exploitation of 2 D antenna array configurations such as uniform circular array (UCA) or URA in mmWave MIMO systems is desirable.|$|R
40|$|For {{two reasons}} infinite-span swept wing flow is of interest: 1) the {{three-dimensional}} {{nature of the}} boundary layer can be investigated in its most simple form and 2) the quasi-two-dimensional flow field {{is representative of the}} mid-section of modern transport aircraft wings. Swept wing wind tunnel tests are affected by strong sidewall interference effects which can be reduced by a contoured lining. The design of such a coutour requires the application of numerical methods. A design process is described and the effectiveness of one contour is investigated at different flow conditons. Interferences of the swept wing model with the horizontal walls are present due to a technical restriction of most adaptive test sections, which allow only two-dimensional adaptation. The influence of different <b>horizontal</b> wall <b>adaptation</b> strategies on the wing flow field is show...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{spatial and}} color coding of the {{monophasic}} horizontal cells were studied in light- and dark-adapted retinae. Slit displacement experiments revealed differences in integration {{area for the}} different cone inputs of the monophasic horizontal cells. The integration area measured with a 670 -nm stimulus was larger than that measured with a 570 -nm stimulus. Experiments in which {{the diameter of the}} test spot was varied, however, revealed at high stimulus intensities a larger summation area for 520 -nm stimuli than for 670 -nm stimuli. The reverse was found for low stimulus intensities. To investigate whether these differences were due to interaction between the various cone inputs to the monophasic <b>horizontal</b> cell, <b>adaptation</b> experiments were performed. It was found that the various cone inputs were not independent. Finally, some mechanisms for the spatial and color coding will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a detailed visual cortical circuit which exhibits robust contrast adaptation properties, consistent with physiological observations in V 1. The adaptation mechanism we employ is activity-dependent synaptic depression at thalamocortical and local intra-cortical synapses. Model contrast response functions (CRF) shift so that cells remain maximally responsive to changes around the recent average stimulus contrast level. Hysteresis effects for both stimulus contrast and orientation are achieved; orientation hysteresis is weaker, and depends exclusively on intracortical adaptation. Following {{stimulation of the}} receptive field (RF) surround, RFs dynamically expand to "fill in" for the missing stimulation in the RF center; in our model this expansion results from adaptation of local inhibitory synapses, triggered by excitation from long range <b>horizontal</b> projections. All <b>adaptation</b> effects are achieved using the same synaptic depression mechanism at both thalamocortical and intra [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{decay of}} several visual aftereffects may be {{prolonged}} by interposing {{a period of}} light-free or pattern-free viewing between adaptation and testing. We demonstrate that this storage phenomenon can be observed using the threshold elevation aftereffect that follows inspection of a high-contrast grating pattern. Control experiments comparing thresholds for vertical and <b>horizontal</b> gratings after <b>adaptation</b> to a vertical grating reveal that the stored aftereffect, like its unstored counterpart, is pattern-selective. Storage is equally pronounced with stimuli that are detected by pattern-analyzing or movement-analyzing visual channels. Unlike other aftereffects, the threshold-elevation aftereffect requires that the storage period be light-free; no storage is seen if a blank field is inspected between adaptation and testing. The results are discussed {{with respect to the}} nature of visual aftereffects, and possible cognitive or physiological models of storage. ...|$|R
40|$|Since {{numerous}} {{countries have}} already initiated {{a process of}} {{adaptation to climate change}} by drafting strategies or catalogues of measures, it is of particular importance to identify and overcome potential barriers to efficient public adap-tation from the beginning. A major source of barriers is given by self-interest driven behaviour of actors involved in the adaptation policy process. This is for the reason that several features of the adaptation option and the surrounding policy framework, such as the lacking of a clear-cut success-metric, are likely to boost such behaviour since they facilitate both the manipulation of the adaptation output and the exertion of influence through the various actor groups shaping the political system. Against this background, this paper provides a broad conceptual Public Choice theory framework serving both for raising the consciousness of potential barriers to efficient public adaptation and creating a sound basis for further in-depth research. Concerning the efficiency of public adaptation policies, we distinguish three dimensions, namely extent, structure (form and timing) and organisation (vertical and <b>horizontal)</b> of public <b>adaptation.</b> For either case, potential political biases are investigated taking into consideration the self-interests and influence of voters, pressure groups, bureaucrats and politi-cians in a representative democracy framework...|$|R
40|$|Neurons in {{the visual}} cortex are {{responsive}} to the presentation of oriented and curved line segments, which are thought to act as primitives for the visual processing of shapes and objects. Prolonged adaptation to such stimuli gives rise to two related perceptual effects: a slow change in {{the appearance of the}} adapting stimulus (perceptual drift), and the distortion of subsequently presented test stimuli (adaptational aftereffects). Here we used a psychophysical nulling technique to dissociate and quantify these two classical observations in order to examine their underlying mechanisms and their relationship to one another. In agreement with previous work, we found that during <b>adaptation</b> <b>horizontal</b> and vertical straight lines serve as attractors for perceived orientation and curvature. However, the rate of perceptual drift for different stimuli was not predictive of the corresponding aftereffect magnitudes, indicating that the two perceptual effects are governed by distinct neural processes. Finally, the rate of perceptual drift for curved line segments did not depend on the spatial scale of the stimulus, suggesting that its mechanisms lie outside strictly retinotopic processing stages. These findings provide new evidence that the visual system relies on statistically salient intrinsic reference stimuli for the processing of visual patterns, and point to perceptual drift as an experimental window for studying the mechanisms of visual perception...|$|R
40|$|The human motor system {{controls}} a {{large number}} of independent degrees of freedom simultaneously, and is capable of learning a seemingly infinite amount of movement skills, vastly surpassing such abilities of any man-made robot. The computational and neuronal mechanisms of human dexterity and adaptation abilities remain elusive. It has been recently suggested that one of the computational brain mechanisms allowing such a rich movement repertoire might be “structure learning” (Braun et al., 2009 b). After extensive practice with motor tasks sharing structural similarities (e. g. different dancing movements, or different sword techniques), new tasks of the same type can be learnt faster. According to the structure learning hypothesis, such rapid generalisation of related motor skills relies on learning the dynamic and kinematic relationships shared by this set of skills. As a consequence, motor adaptation becomes constrained, effectively leading to a dimensionality reduction of the learning problem; at the same time, adaptation to tasks lying outside the structure becomes biased towards the structure. We tested these predictions by investigating how previously learnt structures influence subsequent motor adaptation and found that after extensive training with both kinematic or dynamic perturbations, adaptation to unpractised, diagonal, perturbations happened along the previously learnt structure (vertical or <b>horizontal),</b> and resulting <b>adaptation</b> trajectories were curved. We further present several computational models that can account for this behaviour: correlated distribution of motor primitives, changed Bayesian prior or Bayesian network with a hidden variable. These models make different predictions with respect to structure extrapolation; in a series of experiments we did not observe any evidence for structure extrapolation and conclude that the observed effects are probably explained by the changed Bayesian priors. Finally, we present a series of experiments on path tracking, where subjects develop a skill of path tracking {{in the absence of any}} external perturbations. Relationship with structure learning is discussed. Imperial Users Onl...|$|R
40|$|Vertical {{handover}} {{has emerged}} as a key component in the development of seamless connectivity framework for todayï¿½€™s heterogeneous wireless network environment with diverse access technologies. This work aims at enhancing the vertical handover experience for a multi-interface mobile node in a heterogeneous network environment and involves optimization of both handover execution and pre-execution preparation. In this endeavor, we have (i) come-up with a new technique for handover execution, (ii) developed a new handover necessity estimation method for a mobile node moving into a WLAN cell, (iii) mathematically modeled handover triggering condition estimation for a mobile node moving out of aWLAN coverage area, (iv) surveyed various techniques used for target network selection in a heterogeneous network environment, (v) surveyed and categorized handover execution techniques, (vi) suggested a criteria metrics for evaluation of handover execution techniques and (vii) analyzed the proposed handover execution technique against some of the parameters of the evaluation criteria metrics using NCTUns simulator. Finally, we have looked into some bleeding-edge vertical handover optimization techniques; particularly the utilization of RF coverage maps in handover decision process. The proposed vertical handover execution technique is an end-to-end, self-reliant scheme for a multi-interface mobile node, roaming in a heterogeneous network environment. The scheme neither requires rerouting nor the tunneling. Despite end-to-end signaling, the service disruption time is few milli-seconds as compared to hundreds of milli-seconds for existing techniques. The designed handover necessity estimation model, based on angle of arrival with respect to tangent, for limiting the unnecessary handovers and handover failures provides much better control than the existing model. Even at higher velocities, the deviation from the desired level is five times lower than the existing model. The suggested analytical model for handover triggering condition estimation for maximizing the connectivity with the preferred network, as opposed to existing models, does not make assumptions about the shape of the exit region and thus makes it more general. Performance of this model is identical to the existing model, which reveals that the choice of pdf of exit angle does not affect the performance of handover triggering condition estimation algorithm. The study of target network selection schemes considers traditional <b>horizontal</b> schemes, their <b>adaptation</b> in a heterogeneous network environment, more sophisticated schemes and also the fuzzy logic and neural network based schemes. The information required for each of the handover pre-execution decisions is identified and the methods for information collection are also studied. The detailed survey of vertical handover execution techniques is used for classification and identification of pros and cons associated with these diverse approaches. Use of RF coverage maps in handover decisions is a novel idea. Timely execution of the vertical handover with the help of RF coverage maps can ensure an uninterrupted communication for a multi-interface mobile node traversing the black spots. It has been demonstrated that this can help improve communication and optimize the handover process...|$|R
