25|$|In the new Uzbek Latin {{alphabet}} {{adopted in}} 2000, the apostrophe {{serves as a}} <b>diacritical</b> <b>mark</b> to distinguish different phonemes written with the same letter: it differentiates o (corresponding to Cyrillic ў) from o, and g (Cyrillic ғ) from g. This avoids the use of special characters, allowing Uzbek to be typed with ease in ordinary ASCII on any Latin keyboard. In addition, a postvocalic apostrophe in Uzbek represents the glottal stop phoneme derived from Arabic hamzah or ‘ayn, replacing Cyrillic ъ.|$|E

2500|$|A diacritic – also <b>diacritical</b> <b>mark,</b> diacritical point, or diacritical sign – is a glyph {{added to}} a letter, or basic glyph. The term derives from the Ancient Greek [...] (diakritikós, [...] "distinguishing"), from [...] (diakrī́nō, [...] "to distinguish"). Diacritic is {{primarily}} an adjective, though sometimes used as a noun, whereas diacritical is only ever an adjective. Some diacritical marks, such as the acute (´) and grave (`), are often called accents. Diacritical marks may appear above or below a letter, or in some other position such as within the letter or between two letters.|$|E

2500|$|The name Haiti (or Hayti) {{comes from}} the {{indigenous}} Taíno language which was the native name given to the entire island of Hispaniola to mean, [...] "land of high mountains." [...] The h is silent in French and the ï in Haïti, is a <b>diacritical</b> <b>mark</b> used {{to show that the}} second vowel is pronounced separately, as in the word naïve. In English, this rule for the pronunciation is often disregarded, thus the spelling Haiti is used. There are different anglicizations for its pronunciation such as HIGH-ti, high-EE-ti and haa-EE-ti, which are still in use, but HAY-ti is the most widespread and established.|$|E
2500|$|On April 3, 1979, the San Jose City Council adopted San José, {{with the}} <b>diacritical</b> <b>mark</b> on the [...] "e", as the {{spelling}} {{of the city}} name on the city seal, official stationery, office titles and department names. Also, by city council convention, this spelling of San José is used when the name is stated in mixed upper- and lower-case letters, but not when the name is stated only in upper-case letters. The accent reflects the Spanish version of the name, and the dropping of accents in all-capital writing was typical in Spanish. While San José is commonly spelled both with and without the acute accent over the [...] "e," [...] the city's official guidelines indicate {{that it should be}} spelled with the accent most of the time and sets forth narrow exceptions, such as when the spelling is in URLs, when the name appears in all-capital letters, when the name is used on social media sites where the <b>diacritical</b> <b>mark</b> does not render properly, and where San Jose is part of the proper name of another organization or business, such as San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce, that has chosen not to use the accent-marked name. The city's name without the accent can still be found in its 1965 Charter document, as amended, which formally chartered the municipality as City of San Jose. Similarly, the city's website appears to use a mixture of both; for example, the [...] "City of San José" [...] in the text uses the mark but the [...] "City of San Jose" [...] logo image does not.|$|E

2500|$|The parliament, per the 1980 constitution, {{changed the}} flag and seal of state insofar as the Lion and Sun were {{replaced}} by the red emblem in {{the centre of the}} flag. Designed by Hamid Nadimi, and officially approved by Parliament and the Leader Grand Ayatollah Khomeini on 9 May 1980, this emblem is a highly stylised composite of various Islamic elements: a geometrically symmetric form of the word Allah ("God") and overlapping parts of the phrase lā ʾilāha ʾillā l-Lāh, (There is no God Except Allah), forming a monogram {{in the form of a}} tulip it consists of four crescents and a line. The four crescents read from right to left; the first crescent is the letter aleph, the second crescent is the first laam; the vertical line is the second laam, and the third and fourth crescents together form the heh. Above the central stroke is a tashdid (a <b>diacritical</b> <b>mark</b> indicating gemination) resembling [...] "W". The tulip shape of the emblem as a whole memorialises those who have died for Iran and symbolises the values of patriotism and self-sacrifice, building on a legend that red tulips grow from the shed blood of martyrs. This emblem is somewhat similar to the Khanda but has no relation to Sikhism and its meaning to that religious community.|$|E
