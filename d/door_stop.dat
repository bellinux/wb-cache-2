5|$|Clemmons {{was accused}} {{multiple}} times of displaying violent behavior during court appearances. In one incident, he dismantled a metal <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> and hid {{it in his}} sock {{to use as a}} weapon. It was discovered and confiscated by a court bailiff. In another incident, he took a lock from his holding cell and threw it at a bailiff, but missed and accidentally hit his mother instead. Clemmons was once accused of reaching for a guard's pistol while being transported to court. During one trial, he was shackled in leg irons and seated next to a uniformed officer because the presiding judge ordered extra security, claiming Clemmons had threatened him. At age 16, Clemmons' charges were committed from juvenile court to adult court due to the extremely violent nature of his crimes and demeanor.|$|E

2500|$|Doorstops {{are simple}} devices {{used to prevent}} a door from coming into contact with another object (typically a wall).

2500|$|The other façade {{is marked}} by the style of Louis XII, and {{is a mixture of}} the end of the Gothic and the {{beginning}} of the Renaissance. [...] The stone pediments of the attic windows and bases of windows with linenfold panels remain still completely Gothic. The most beautiful example of this mixture is on the door of the tower, the old principal door of the château moved from the façade of François I by Louis de la Saussaye because of its small size. One finds linenfold there too, a Gothic motif par excellence, but also, on the <b>door</b> <b>stop,</b> a salamander, an emblem of François I. Above, Louis de la Saussaye had engraved, in Greek, this sentence ascribed to the general Themistocles: [...] "Small is the house, but oh how much happiness, if it is filled with friends." ...|$|E

6000|$|She {{repeated}} the question. For once Fortune favored us. A timely {{knock at the}} <b>door</b> <b>stopped</b> her {{just as she was}} trying to release herself from me. [...] "Somebody coming in," [...] I said. The servant entered, as I spoke, with a letter from the rectory.|$|R
60|$|He {{went to the}} <b>door,</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{opened his}} lips as if to speak, said nothing, and moved on. He passed through the wicket, and mounted his horse. In a second he had flung himself from his saddle again, {{transferred}} the reins to Murgatroyd, and re-entered the cottage.|$|R

50|$|On {{machines}} with manually swung doors, one trivial yet important detail is a <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> to prevent banging when opening. If a large autoclave is installed on a slightly off level floor, then the door, once opened, swings rapidly {{to the end}} of its travel. With no snubber of any sort installed, it will slowly accumulate damage and wear.|$|E
50|$|Wedges {{can also}} be used to hold objects in place, such as engine parts (poppet valves), bicycle parts (stems and {{eccentric}} bottom brackets), and doors. A wedge-type <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> (door wedge) functions largely because of the friction generated between the bottom of the door and the wedge, and the wedge and the floor (or other surface).|$|E

5000|$|In 1896, a cargo officer (supercargo) for the Pacific Islands Company on the Lady M, Henry Denson, found a strange-looking rock on Nauru {{during a}} brief {{stop on the}} island. He {{originally}} believed {{it to be a}} piece of petrified wood. Denson, according to legend, had planned on making children's marbles from it but fate would have it end up as a <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> in the company's Sydney office.|$|E
50|$|Pre-weatherstripped {{doors for}} private homes are usually made of {{fiberglass}} {{or a similar}} material and are shipped from the factory weatherstripped. The doors have a kerf in the <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> so that a foam, rubber, or vinyl strip can be placed inside for the door to rest against when closed. These doors also have the threshold — usually a molded piece of plastic — nailed to the frame in the factory. These units are not difficult to install and require only very little skill.|$|E
50|$|A {{doorstop}} (also door stopper, <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> or door wedge) is {{an object}} or device {{used to hold}} a door open or closed, or to prevent a door from opening too widely. Alternatively, a doorstop can be a thin slat built inside a door frame to prevent a door from swinging through when closed. A doorstop (applied) {{may also be a}} small bracket or 90 degree piece of metal applied to the frame of a door to stop the door from swinging (bi-directional) and converting that door to a single direction (in-swing push or out-swing pull).|$|E

50|$|The current {{station has}} been in place since 1908, with only little {{renovation}} to the station since then, most notably a 90-foot extension of the platform in 1997 so that a motorman in the front car could see all <b>doors</b> <b>stopped</b> at the station (the platform had curved at one end previously). Main is one of the stations on the CTA's 2004-2008 Capital Improvement Plan.|$|R
5000|$|The Carolina Gold Rush, {{the first}} gold rush in the United States, {{followed}} {{the discovery of}} a large gold nugget in North Carolina in 1799, by a 12-year-old boy named Conrad Reed. He spotted the nugget while playing in Meadow Creek on his family's farm in Cabarrus County, North Carolina. [...] Conrad took the 17 lb gold nugget home to show his father, however gold was not commonly seen in their community and the value of the nugget was not understood. The nugget was used as a <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> in the family's home for several years. In 1802, Conrad's father, John Reed, showed the rock to a jeweler, who recognized it as gold and offered to buy it. Reed, still unaware of the real value of his [...] "doorstop," [...] sold it to the jeweler for $3.50 (approximately one week's pay for a farm laborer at that time).|$|E
5000|$|Animal {{furniture}} also {{refers to}} furniture made from animals. Such furniture became popular during the Victorian era. In 1896, William G. Fitzgerald {{wrote an article}} titled [...] "Animal Furniture" [...] in The Strand Magazine. The article included a photographic gallery of unusual pieces from the era, including a liquor stand made from an elephant's foot, a <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> made from an ostrich foot, a candelabra made from a monkey, lamps made from a black swan, an emu, monkeys, and a black bear, a chair made from a baby giraffe (with neck and head rising from the back, a porter's chair made out of a baby elephant, and a [...] "tiger chair" [...] with the seat covered in the animal's skin, the tail coiled around the edge, and [...] "the head and paws ... arranged so as {{to give the impression}} that the terrible animal is about to spring." [...] In a 1907 book on big game hunting in Ceylon, Harry Storey described his practices of making furniture out of elephant parts:"Of trophies to be secured from our elephants the feet rank first [...] [...] [...] They make fine footstools, liquor stands, or, if cut long in the leg, umbrella stands.|$|E
5000|$|Howard's Rock In {{the early}} 1960s, the rock {{was given to}} then head coach Frank Howard by a friend, Samuel Columbus Jones (Clemson Class of 1919). It was {{presented}} to Howard by Jones, saying [...] "Here's a rock from Death Valley, California, to Death Valley, South Carolina." [...] Howard didn't think anything else about the rock and it {{was used as a}} <b>door</b> <b>stop</b> in his office for several years. In September 1966, while cleaning out his office, Howard noticed the rock and told IPTAY executive director Gene Willimon, [...] "Take this rock and throw it over the fence or out in the ditch...do something with it, but get it out of my office." [...] Willimon had the rock placed on a pedestal {{at the top of the}} east endzone hill that the team ran down to enter the field for games. On September 24, 1966, the first time Clemson players ran by the rock, they beat conference rival Virginia, 40-35. Howard, seizing on the motivational potential of [...] "The Rock", told his players, [...] "Give me 110% or keep your filthy hands off of my rock." [...] The team started rubbing the Rock for the first game of 1967, which was a 23-6 waxing of ACC foe Wake Forest.|$|E
