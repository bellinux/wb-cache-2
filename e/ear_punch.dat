40|$|An <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy {{method for}} the {{detection}} and isolation of Borrelia burgdorferi from rodents was developed. The <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy proved to be extremely sensitive, detecting spirochetes in 100 % (11 of 11) of laboratory hamsters infected by tick bite and 95. 8 % (23 of 24) of hamsters infected by intraperitoneal inoculation. When cultured at 4 to 6 weeks postinfection, 92 to 100 % of the ear punches taken from individual hamsters yielded viable spirochetes. B. burgdorferi was detected in sequential cultures from animals as early as 4 days postinfection and as late as 20 weeks postinfection. A total of 86 % (6 of 7) of field-collected white-footed mice (Peromyscus leucopus) which were positive for B. burgdorferi as determined by xenodiagnosis were also positive by the <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> method. The <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy method allows individual rodents to be sampled for B. burgdorferi serially {{over a long period}} and thus should prove useful for both field and laboratory experiments...|$|E
40|$|Therapeutic {{angiogenesis}} is a {{major goal}} ofregenerative medicine, but no clinically approved small molecule exists that enhancesnew blood vessel formation. Here we show, using a phenotype-driven high-content imaging screen of an annotated chemical library of 1280 bioactive small molecules, that the retinoid agonist Tazarotene, enhances in vitroangiogenesis, promoting branching morphogenesis, and tubule remodeling. The pro-angiogenic phenotype is mediated by Retinoic Acid Receptor (RAR) but not Retinoic X Receptor(RXR) activation, and is characterized by secretion of the pro-angiogenic factors Hepatocyte Growth Factor (HGF), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGFA), Plasminogen Activator, Urokinase (PLAU) and Placental Growth Factor (PGF), and reduced secretion of the antiangiogenic factor Pentraxin- 3 (PTX 3) from adjacent fibroblasts. In vivo, Tazarotene enhanced the growth of mature and functional microvessels in Matrigel implants and wound healing models, and increased blood flow. Notably, in <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> wound healing model, Tazarotene promoted tissue repair characterized by rapid <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> closure with normal-appearing skin containing new hair follicles, and maturing collagen fibers. Our study suggests that Tazarotene, an FDA-approved small molecule, could be potentially exploited for therapeutic applications in neovascularization and wound healing...|$|E
40|$|The adult MRL/MpJ mouse regenerates all {{differentiated}} structures after through-and-through <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> wounding in a scar-free process. We investigated {{whether this}} regenerative capacity was also shown by skin wounds. Dorsal skin wounds were created, harvested and archived {{from the same}} animals (MRL/MpJ and C 57 BL/ 6 mice) that received through-and-through <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> wounds. Re-epithelialization was complete in dorsal wounds in both strains by day 5 and extensive granulation tissue was present by day 14 post-wounding. By day 21, wounds from both strains contained dense amounts of collagen that healed with a scar. The average wound area, as well as alpha-smooth muscle actin expression and macrophage influx were investigated during dorsal skin wound healing and did not significantly differ between strains. Thus, MRL/MpJ mice regenerate ear wounds in a scar-free manner, but heal dorsal skin wounds by simple repair with scar formation. A significant conclusion {{can be drawn from}} these data; mechanisms of regeneration and repair can occur within the same animal, potentially utilizing similar molecules and signalling pathways that subtly diverge dependent upon the microenvironment of the injury...|$|E

40|$|The {{specific}} genetic {{identification of}} genetically engineered animals in a litter {{is critical to the}} efficient pursuit of research and in reducing the number of animals involved in a research project. The genotype is most often determined by analysis of DNA extracted from tissues of young rodents. Analysis by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) requires the least amount of DNA. DNA for PCR analysis can be obtained from tail biopsies, <b>ear</b> <b>punches,</b> hair, blood, fecal or oral samples 1 - 12. Larger amounts of DNA are required for Southern Blot determination of the genotype. Obtaining tissue from a mouse or rat for DNA analysis via tail biopsy is a safe, effective and humane procedure. Pain perception of tail clamping in rats does not start to develop until 12 to 14 days of age 13, so performing tail biopsy earlier in rodents may cause less pain. When performed properly in adult mice it causes only minimal or transient pain and distress, and induces no more “physiological impact ” (change in heart rate, body temperature, or activity level) than restraint of the animal for the procedure 14. DNA prepared from tail biopsies is suitable for analysis by either Southern Blot or PCR. Depending on the requirements of the study, investigators are urged to consider less invasive alternatives such as <b>ear</b> <b>punches</b> and noninvasive alternatives such as hair, fecal or oral samples...|$|R

Methods A 50 % (wt:vol) ethanolic solution of commercial 200 : 1 PCE was applied to both ears of female Swiss mice (n = 8) at 0. 075, 0. 15, 0. 3, 1. 25 and 2. 5 mg/ear 30 min after TPA administration (2 μg/ear). For comparison, 3 other groups were treated with TPA and either 1) the vehicle (50 % ethanol) alone, 2) indomethacin (0. 5 mg/ear), or 3) trans -resveratrol (0. 62 mg/ear). Ear thickness was measured before TPA and at 4 and 24 h post-TPA administration to assess ear edema. <b>Ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies were collected at 24 h and weighed as a second index of edema. Myeloperoxidase activity was measured in each <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy to assess neutrophil infiltration. Results PCE treatment at all doses significantly reduced ear edema compared to the TPA control. The PCE response was dose-dependent and 2. 5 mg PCE significantly inhibited all markers of inflammation {{to a greater extent than}} indomethacin (0. 5 mg). MPO activity was inhibited at PCE doses ≥ 1. 25 mg/ear. Trans- resveratrol inhibited inflammation at comparable doses.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionLittle {{evidence}} {{is available on}} the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) development and the genes that protect and predispose individuals to it. This study was designed to compare strain-dependent development of OA and its association with tissue regeneration in mice. Two recombinant inbred lines LGXSM- 6 and LGXSM- 33 generated from LG/J and SM/J intercross were used. Previous studies indicated that LGXSM- 6 can regenerate both articular cartilage and <b>ear</b> hole <b>punch</b> while LGXSM- 33 cannot. MethodsTransection of the medial meniscotibial ligament was performed on 10 -week-old male mice to induce OA. Cartilage damage was analyzed by histology and bone morphology was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (CT). <b>Ear</b> <b>punches</b> were performed and evaluated by measurement of residual hole diameter. ResultsCartilage analysis showed that LGXSM- 33 developed a significantly higher grade of OA than LGXSM- 6. Bone analysis showed that LGXSM- 33 had substantial subchondral bone and trabecular bone thickening 8 weeks post-surgery, while LGXSM- 6 showed bone loss over time. We also confirmed that LGXSM- 6 can heal ear tissues significantly better than LGXSM- 33. ConclusionsOA was found to be negatively correlated with the degree of tissue regeneration. LGXSM- 33, a poor healer of ear tissues (and articular cartilage), developed more OA compared to LGXSM- 6, which had better regenerative ability for ear tissues and articular cartilage. The phenotypic differences observed here are due to genetic differences further suggesting that similar sets of physiological processes and gene variants may mediate variation in OA development and tissue regeneration...|$|R

Spirochetes were detected in biopsy specimens from individuals of all three host species that had been inoculated with four isolates (CA 3, CA 4, CA 7, and CA 8). <b>Ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsy specimens taken from Swiss Webster mice at 12 weeks p. i. yielded an additional reisolate (CA 2), even though these animals did not seroconvert. The remaining isolate (CA 9) was not recovered from any host. However, two deer mice and all hamsters and Swiss Webster mice inoculated with CA 9 seroconverted. All six isolates were of low infectivity to ticks when inoculated intramuscularly into hosts. Only 4 (1. 6 %) of 250 Ixodes pacificus larvae acquired and transstadially maintained infection from hosts inoculated intramuscularly. Infectivity of three isolates for ticks also was tested in Swiss Webster mice injected intradermally. The mean prevalences of infection in xenodiagnostic ticks fed on these mice at 4 weeks p. i. were 47. 9, 1. 2, and 2. 2 % for isolates CA 4, CA 7, and CA 8, respectively.

40|$|The mouse is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used laboratory animal, accounting for up to 80 % of all mammals used in research studies. Because rodents generally are group-housed, an efficient system of uniquely identifying individual animals for use in research studies, breeding, and proper colony management is required. Several temporary and permanent methods (for example, <b>ear</b> <b>punching</b> and toe clipping) are available for labeling research mice and other small animals, each with advantages and disadvantages. This report describes a new radiofrequency identification tagging method that uses 500 -µm, light-activated microtransponders implanted subcutaneously into the ear or tail of mice. The preferred location for implanting is {{in the side of the}} tail, because implantation at this site was simple to perform and was associated with shorter implantation times (average, 53 versus 325 s) and a higher success rate (98 % versus 50 %) compared with the ear. The main benefits of using light-activated microtransponders over other identification methods, including other radiofrequency identification tags, is their small size, which minimizes stress to the animals during implantation and low cost due to their one-piece (monolithic) design. In addition, the implantation procedure uses a custom-designed 21 -gauge needle injector and does not require anesthetization of the mice.

40|$|Skin wounds {{comprise}} a serious medical issue for which few pharmacological interventions are available. Moreover, the inflammatory, angiogenic, and proliferative facets {{of a typical}} response to a wound each have broader relevance in other pathological conditions. Here we describe a genomics-driven approach to identify secreted proteins that modulate wound healing in a mouse <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> model. We show that adiponectin, when injected into the wound edge, accelerates wound healing. Notably, adiponectin injection causes upregulation of keratin gene transcripts within hours of treatment, and subsequently promotes collagen organization, formation of pilosebaceous units, and proliferation of cells in the basal epithelial cell layer and pilosebaceous units of healing tissue. The globular domain of adiponectin is sufficient to mediate accelerated dorsal skin wound closure, and the effects are lost in mice that are homozygous null for the adiponectin receptor 1 gene. These findings extend recent observations of a protective role of adiponectin in other tissue injury settings, suggest modulation of AdipoR 1 for the clinical management of wounds, and demonstrate {{a new approach to}} the identification of regulators of a wound healing response...|$|E
40|$|The {{replacement}} {{and restoration}} of tissue mass after organ damage or injury in adult higher vertebrates {{is critical to}} the architecture and function of the organ. If replacement occurs with scar tissue, this often results in adverse effects on function and growth as well as an undesirable cosmetic appearance. However, certain mammals, such as the MRL/MpJ mouse, have shown a restricted capacity for regeneration, rather than scar tissue formation, after an excisional <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> wound. To investigate the changes in tissue architecture leading to ear wound closure, initial ear wounding studies with a 2 -mm clinical biopsy punch were performed on MRL/MpJ mice, by using C 57 BL/ 6 mice as a nonregenerative control strain. In contrast to previously reported studies on mouse ear regeneration, we observed that C 57 BL/ 6 mice in fact showed a limited regenerative capacity. One explanation for this difference could be attributed to the method of wounding used; both previous studies on mouse ear regeneration used a thumb punch, whereas our approach was to use a clinical biopsy punch. This approach led us to further investigate whether the severity of trauma applied influenced the rate of wound healing. We, therefore, compared the effects of the sharp clinical biopsy punch with that of a cruder thumb punch, and introduced a third strain of mouse, Balb/c, known to be a slow-healing strain. A new method to quantify <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> hole closure was developed and a histologic investigation conducted up to 4 months after wounding. Image analysis data showed a reduction in original ear wound area of 85 % in MRL/MpJ mice at 4 weeks and of 91. 7 % over 4 months by using a biopsy punch. In contrast, the crude thumb punch methodology resulted in an increase in wound area of up to 58 % in Balb/c ears; thought to be due to increased necrosis of the wound site. All biopsy-punched wound areas plateaued in healing between days 28 and 112. Only 5 of 80 MRL/MpJ mouse ears showed no residual holes macroscopically after 28 days. Histologically, all strains of mice healed their ear wounds in a similar manner involving re-epithelialization, blastema-like formation, dermal extension, blood vessel formation, chondrogenesis, folliculogenesis, and skeletal muscle and fat differentiation. However, all regenerative features were more pronounced and accelerated in MRL/MpJ mice when compared with C 57 BL/ 6 and Balb/c biopsy-punched mouse ears...|$|E

Upon comparison with standard DNA purification methods using a commercially available kit, we demonstrate that Chelex® efficiently and consistently purifies high-quality DNA from hair roots, minimizing pain, shortening time and reducing costs associated with the determination of accurate genotypes.

However, {{the extent of}} their endothelial differentiation highly varies according to the angiogenic models used. Wound healing is an intricate process in which the skin repairs itself after injury. As a process also observed in cancer progression, neoangiogenesis into wound tissues is profoundly involved in this healing process, suggesting the contribution of BMDCs. However, the extent of the differentiation of BMDCs to endothelial cells in wound healing is unclear. In this study, using the green fluorescent protein-bone marrow chim-eric experiment and high resolution confocal microscopy at a single cell level, we observed no endothelial differentiation of BMDCs in 2 acute wound healing models (dorsal excisional wound and <b>ear</b> <b>punch)</b> and a chronic wound healing model (decubitus ulcer). Instead, a major proportion of BMDCs were macrophages. Indeed, colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF- 1) inhibition depleted approximately 80 % of the BMDCs at the wound healing site. CSF- 1 –mutant (CSF- 1 op/op) mice showed significantly reduced neoangiogenesis into the wound site, supporting the substantial role of BMDCs as macrophages.

The MRL/MpJ strain of mice has the remarkable ability to regenerate <b>ear</b> hole <b>punch</b> wounds seamlessly including the scarless replacement of multiple tissues. The {{objective of this}} study was to assess whether articular cartilage defects repair or regenerate in the MRL/MpJ ‘healer’ strain of mice. MethodFull thickness and partial thickness lesions were introduced into trochlear groove articular cartilage of MRL/MpJ and C 57 Bl/ 6 mice, a control strain that does not undergo ear hole regeneration. The wound sites were assessed 6 weeks and 12 weeks post-surgery using a histological scoring scheme and immunohistochemistry for markers of articular cartilage including proteoglycan, collagen II and collagen VI. ResultsThe partial thickness lesions did not repair in either strain. However, at both 6 weeks and 12 weeks timepoints the MRL/MpJ mice had a superior healing response of full thickness lesions with abundant chondrocytes and an extracellular matrix rich in proteoglycan, collagen II and collagen VI at the wound site. At the 12 week timepoint the enhanced cartilage healing was restricted to male MRL/MpJ mice. In contrast, the C 57 Bl/ 6 control strain produced an extracellular matrix at the wound site that, overall, had significantly less matrix proteoglycan and collagen II.

Surprisingly, we found that common strains of mice are able to regenerate all of the tissues necessary to completely fill experimentally <b>punched</b> <b>ear</b> holes, but only if punched at middle age. Although young postweaning mice regrew the epithelium without typical pre-scar granulation tissue, they showed only minimal regeneration of connective tissues. In contrast, mice punched at 5 – 11 months of age showed true amphibian-like blastema formation and regrowth of cartilage, fat, and dermis, with blood vessels, sebaceous glands, hair follicles, and, in black mice, melanocytes. These data suggest that at least partial appendage regeneration may be more common in adult mammals than previously thought and {{call into question the}} common view that regenerative ability is lost with age. The data suggest that the age at which various inbred mouse strains become capable of epimorphic regeneration may be correlated with adult body weight...|$|R
40|$|The MRL/MpJ mouse {{displays}} {{an accelerated}} ability to heal <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> wounds without scar formation (whereas wounds on the dorsal {{surface of the}} trunk heal with scar formation), offering a rare opportunity for studying tissue regeneration in adult mammals. A blastema-like structure develops and subsequently {{the structure of the}} wounded ear is restored, including cartilage, skin, hair follicles and adipose tissue. We sought to assess if the MRL/MpJ strain also possessed an enhanced capacity for peripheral nerve regeneration. Female MRL/MpJ and C 57 BL/ 6 mice were wounded with a 2 -mm excisional biopsy punch to the centre of each ear and two 4 -mm excisional biopsy punches to the dorsal skin. Immunohistochemical dual staining of pan-neurofilament and CD 31 markers was used to investigate reinnervation and vascularisation of both the dorsal surface of the trunk and ear wounds. The MRL/MpJ mouse ear exhibited a significantly (P > 0. 01) higher density of regenerated nerves than C 57 BL/ 6 between 10 and 21 days post-wounding when the blastema-like structure was forming. Unlike dorsal skin wounds, nerve regeneration in the ear wound preceded vascularisation, recapitulating early mammalian development. Immunohistochemical data suggest that factors within the blastemal mesenchyme, such as aggrecan, may direct nerve regrowth in the regenerating ear tissu...|$|E
40|$|Why {{regeneration}} {{does not}} occur in mammals remains elusive. In lower vertebrates, epimorphic regeneration of the limb is directed by the wound epidermis, which controls blastema formation to promote regrowth of the appendage. Herein, we report that knockout (KO) or inhibition of Apoptosis Signal-regulated Kinase- 1 (ASK 1), also known as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5 (MAP 3 K 5), after full thickness <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> in mice prolongs keratinocyte activation within the wound epidermis and promotes regeneration of auricular cartilage. Histological analysis showed the ASK 1 KO ears displayed enhanced protein markers associated with blastema formation, hole closure and regeneration of auricular cartilage. At seven days after punch, the wound epidermis morphology was markedly different in the KO, showing a thickened stratum corneum with rounded cell morphology and a reduction of both the granular cell layer and decreased expression of filament aggregating protein. In addition, cytokeratin 6 was expressed in the stratum spinosum and granulosum. Topical application of inhibitors of ASK 1 (NQDI- 1), the upstream ASK 1 activator, calcium activated mitogen kinase 2 (KN 93), or the downstream target, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SP 600125) also resulted in enhanced regeneration; whereas inhibition of the other downstream target, the p 38 α/β isoforms, (SB 203580) had no effect. The results of this investigation indicate ASK 1 inhibition prolongs keratinocyte and blastemal cell activation leading to ear regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Dusky-footed wood rats (Neotoma fuscipes Baird) and {{two species}} of Peromyscus mice (P. maniculatus Wagner and P. truei Shufeldt) were {{collected}} over a 16 -month period from three sites in Sonoma County, California. Blood was collected from 93 wood rats and 177 mice and serum or plasma was tested for seroreactivity with Ehrlichia phagocytophila sensu lato (also known as the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent). Thirty-five (37. 6 %) wood rats and 15 (8. 5 %) mice were seropositive. Positive Neotoma serology by site ranged from 9. 4 % to 62. 1 %. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for the Ehrlichia groESL heat shock operon was performed on all the seropositive and selected seronegative wood rats; 24 (68. 6 %) seropositive animals were PCR positive. Two seroconversions and no seroreversions were detected among 18 of the seropositive wood rats that were recaptured and tested multiple times (range 26). Fourteen (77. 8 %) of the 18 were also PCR positive with six of these positive at every testing point (range 26). One wood rat remained serologically and PCR positive in six specimens collected over a 14 -month period. One male of 84 questing adult Ixodes pacificus Cooley & Kohls collected was PCR-positive for E. phago-cytophila. Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, was cultured from <b>ear</b> <b>punch</b> biopsies from six of seven E. phagocytophila seropositive and one of four seronegative wood rats...|$|E
5000|$|The comic {{centers around}} an unnamed police officer whose partner is a {{specially}} trained police dog named Greg. The duo are professionals at catching criminals. One day, the cop and Greg spot a bomb, but they arrive {{too late to}} defuse it. The duo is critically injured by the bomb's explosion and are taken to the hospital. The doctor announces that Greg's body is dying and the Cop's head is dying. Fortunately, the nurse has a great idea: the surgical crew will cut off Greg's head and sew it on the Cop's body. The doctor accepts the idea and the hospital crew hold a big operation. The operation is successful and everyone calls the new dog/man hybrid [...] "Dog Man." [...] Dog Man catches criminals with his sensitive nose, hears crimes with his <b>ears,</b> and <b>punches</b> criminals with his fists. But Dog Man has one mortal fear: vacuum cleaners. Petey (of The Adventures of Super Diaper Baby 2), Rip Van Tinkle's former feline minion, sees Dog Man's weakness so he invents an evil vacuum robot. The vacuum robot steals all {{the money from the}} bank and Dog Man comes to stop it but the vacuum chases him. The robot chases Dog Man until he is cornered. Dog Man is certain he will die but fortunately, the vacuum robot, which is plugged in, unplugs, and shuts down. Dog Man then destroys the robot and follows the robot's cord, which leads to Petey's hideout and Dog Man arrests him. Dog Man celebrates his victory by drinking some alcohol-free wine with his fellow cops. This comic was then made into a book in 2016 with lots of other Dog Man comics, with a sequel planned to come out either that same year or in 2017.|$|R
2500|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF in 1988, {{in part due}} to {{backstage}} problems between the Bulldogs, specifically the Dynamite Kid, and the Rougeau Brothers over a prank pulled by Curt Hennig. The Bulldogs, noted ribbers (pranksters) in their own right, were blamed for the prank, leading to a series of confrontations that culminated in Jacques Rougeau knocking out four of the Dynamite Kid's teeth with a fist filled with a roll of quarters. Though there are various accounts of this situation, many suggest that Billington drew first blood by bullying Rougeau (among many others including The Honky Tonk Man, whom Dynamite, allegedly, brought to tears) in Miami. While Rougeau was playing cards backstage, from behind, Billington smacked Jacques in the <b>ear</b> and then <b>punched</b> and kicked him in the face several times and also struck Raymond, who was on crutches at the time. It was weeks before Jacques responded. Bret Hart wrote about the incident, in his book HITMAN: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling: [...] "At first I was upset, and contemplated getting involved. But the more I thought about it the more I realized that Tom had been asking for this for years and that everyone who'd been bullied by him would rejoice at the news." [...] After no disciplinary action was taken against Jacques, Billington quit the WWF, and Smith followed suit.|$|R
40|$|BackgroundLocalized {{cutaneous}} argyria {{is a rare}} {{skin condition}} caused by direct contact with silver or silver particles. It presents as asymptomatic gray or blue-gray macules that appear similar to blue nevi. Histologic features include brown-colored or black-colored silver granules in the basement membrane and dermis, most commonly surrounding eccrine glands, elastic fibers, and collagen fibrils. The condition is most frequently observed in individuals who are regularly exposed to small silver particles, such as silversmiths and welders. However, localized cutaneous argyria has also been associated with acupuncture needles, silver earrings, and topical medications containing silver nitrate. Although the condition is benign, patients {{who are concerned about}} the cosmetic features of localized cutaneous argyria may benefit from laser therapy. PurposeWe describe the clinical and pathologic findings of two women who developed localized cutaneous argyria. We also review the characteristics of other patients with localized cutaneous argyria and summarize the differential diagnosis and treatment options for this condition. Materials and methodsThe features of two women with localized cutaneous argyria are presented. Using PubMed, the following terms were searched and relevant citations assessed: acquired localized argyria, acupuncture, argyria, argyrosis, colloidal silver, cutaneous argyria, and localized cutaneous argyria. In addition, the literature on localized cutaneous argyria is reviewed. ResultsTwo women presented with small, asymptomatic blue-gray macules appearing at sites directly adjacent to <b>ear</b> piercings. A <b>punch</b> biopsy was performed on one woman. Microscopic examination revealed a yellowish-brown colored granular material found adjacent to elastic fibers. Based on correlation of the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, a diagnosis of localized cutaneous argyria was established. The second woman did not undergo a biopsy. However, the clinical presentation was highly suggestive of localized cutaneous argyria. Both women were reassured of the benign nature of the condition and agreed to return for clinical follow-up if they observed any changes in the appearance of the lesions...|$|R
