5|$|Corvus is {{associated}} with the myth of Apollo and his lover Coronis the Lapith. Coronis had been unfaithful to Apollo; when he learned this information from a pure white crow, he turned its feathers black in a fit of rage. Another legend associated with Corvus is that a crow stopped on his way to fetch water for Apollo, to eat figs. Instead of telling the truth to Apollo, he lied and said that a snake, Hydra, kept him from the water, while holding a snake in his talons as proof. Apollo, realizing this was a lie, flung the crow (Corvus), cup (Crater), and snake (Hydra) into the sky. He further punished the wayward bird by ensuring it would forever be thirsty, both in real life and in the heavens, where the Cup is <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pressure high up {{the pitch}} from Barcelona kept Manchester United {{in their own}} half, forcing them into {{attempting}} long balls downfield. A scrappy few moments {{in and around the}} centre circle followed, but Manchester United eventually came away with the ball. However, a lapse in communication between Giggs and Evra on the left wing allowed Eto'o to steal in and advance on the Manchester United goal. He cut in from the right wing and played a through-ball <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> of Messi, who went to ground after O'Shea had put his hand on Messi's shoulder. A period of sustained pressure from Barcelona followed, culminating with a run from Iniesta, who could only be stopped by a foul from Tevez {{on the edge of the}} Manchester United penalty area. The consequent free kick was taken by Xavi, who curled the ball around the defensive wall and onto the post with Van der Sar beaten.|$|E
25|$|Three minutes later, Cristiano Ronaldo {{played a}} short corner to Ryan Giggs, who evaded {{challenges}} from two Europe XI players before playing the ball across the goal area, where Wes Brown {{was on hand}} to poke it home. After a couple more chances for the home side, the Europe XI got themselves back into the game midway through the first half, via Florent Malouda's low, long-range strike, which passed <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> of Tomasz Kuszczak's outstretched hand.|$|E

25|$|Expected to {{challenge}} for the title the next year, the now traditional slow start to the season had left Blackburn off the pace, behind the previous years champions Whitley Warriors and the runaway leaders Billingham Stars. However boosted by the signing of Finnish import Sami Narkia, the Hawks finished with an impressive run of results, and although the gap {{at the top of}} the league would prove <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach,</b> there was a real belief that the squad was now capable of winning the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The Magic then hired Chuck Daly to be {{head coach}} for the 1997–98 season. In addition, Hall of Famer Julius Erving joined the Magic's front office, giving Orlando hope for a {{successful}} season.

Anderson, combined with newly acquired free agent Bo Outlaw, led the team to a 41–41 record, <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach</b> of the NBA playoffs.

The same day he was joined by the 28th Regiment of Foot and the 42nd Highland Regiment who had marched from the camp before Alexandria in twelve days. Meanwhile, the 320 troops under Stewart and Lloyd with the Grand Vizier moved to a parallel position and arrived on the 20th June at Imbaba a village {{a few miles from the}} fortress of Giza opposite Cairo on the banks of the Nile. Here they lay directly opposite to Cairo and in which Belliard had stationed his large garrison.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{biography}} of the comic, scholar of Mexican culture Jeffrey M.

2500|$|Sloths are {{classified}} as folivores, as {{the bulk of their}} diets consist of buds, tender shoots, and leaves, mainly of Cecropia trees. Some two-toed sloths have been documented as eating insects, small reptiles, and birds as a small supplement to their diets. Linnaeus's two-toed sloth has recently been documented eating human faeces from open latrines. They have made extraordinary adaptations to an arboreal browsing lifestyle. Leaves, their main food source, provide very little energy or nutrients, and do not digest easily. Sloths, therefore, have large, specialized, slow-acting stomachs with multiple compartments in which symbiotic bacteria break down the tough leaves. Sloths have the unique ability to protrude their tongues from their mouths , an ability that is useful for collecting leaves <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach.</b> [...] As much as two-thirds of a well-fed sloth's body weight consists of the contents of its stomach, and the digestive process can take a month or more to complete.|$|E

2500|$|Solomon Northup's Odyssey first {{aired on}} PBS on , 1984. It aired again {{as part of}} the PBS {{anthology}} television series American Playhouse on , 1985. The film was released on video in 1985 as Half Slave, Half Free. Ebony said the film had the second-largest [...] "Black viewership of any PBS show", following Denmark Vesey's Rebellion. The magazine said Solomon Northup's Odyssey at the time of airing [...] "has been praised by critics who are calling for a theater release as well". John Corry of The New York Times said of the film, [...] "It gives us an earnest and intelligent depiction, although its real subject—the moral effect of slavery—stays <b>just</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>reach.</b> It is almost as if the drama's good taste is keeping it at bay." [...] Corry said the direction obeying the [...] "fidelity of history" [...] made the setting and the society less harsh: [...] "It is not meant this way, but an intolerable institution is made to look almost benign." [...] He commended the performances of Brooks, Green, Saxon, and Seneca and concluded, [...] "'Solomon Northrup's Odyssey' [...] is informative, but whatever else it is, it is not dull." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scorpion {{was played}} by Chris Casamassa in the 1995 Mortal Kombat film.

The fight continues in Scorpion's lair until Cage finally wounds Scorpion with several discarded weapons right after Scorpion performs his [...] "Fire Breath" [...] Fatality as an offensive move, causing Scorpion {{to burst into flames}} as he bleeds a glowing lava-like blood before exploding entirely. Scorpion's lair was constructed inside an airplane hangar and {{was not included in the}} script nor the movie novelization, in which Cage merely knocks Scorpion out in the forest with his Shadow Kick.|$|E
