500|$|Following {{experience}} of occasional cracks {{appearing in the}} frame plates near the spring brackets, had the second batch of Class 6 Standard Pacifics been built, the chassis would have been rearranged {{to be similar to}} that used on the solitary Class 8 Pacific. This would have resulted in the locomotive riding on three cast steel Combined <b>Frame</b> <b>Stretcher</b> & Spring Brackets carrying the 10 front-most spring brackets and lengthened spring brackets behind the rear driven axle. These Combined <b>Frame</b> <b>Stretcher</b> & Spring Brackets are often referred to as [...] "sub-frames".

5000|$|In 1942 the LMS rebuilt two LMS Jubilee Class {{locomotives}} with Type 2A boilers, {{but later}} {{turned to the}} parallel-boilered Royal Scots whose boilers and cylinders were life-expired, and whose smokeboxes were difficult to keep airtight. Between 1943 and 1955 the whole class was rebuilt. The rebuild was quite substantial, requiring new boiler, frames and cylinders. But {{in most cases the}} original <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers,</b> wheels, cab and fittings were retained. The usual procedure carried out was that as each locomotive arrived for rebuilding, it was stripped and the identity transferred to a fresh frameset prepared using the parts recovered from the locomotive that had previously been re-built. The new frames were slightly shorter than the originals. Thus, most rebuilt examples retained their own cab, wheels etc., but most of the <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers,</b> and other integral parts of the frame were from the previously re-built loco.|$|R
5000|$|Contemporary Henschel {{publicity}} appropriately {{referred to}} them as the [...] "Henschel Giants". They were larger in most respects than Deutsche Reichsbahn's new Standard gauge Class 44 three-cylinder 2-10-0 locomotives. Although their all-up locomotive weight was almost the same, when {{considering the fact that}} the SAR's Cape gauge Class 18 had shorter axles and <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers,</b> saving weight that could then be built into other items such as the firebox, the Class 18 was the larger locomotive.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stretcher</b> <b>frames</b> {{in sizes}} {{appropriate}} to the theme.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had 4 {{in thick}} wooden buffer beams and used wooden brake blocks {{on all four}} wheels. The engine's brakes were hand-operated from the footplate. The feedwater pump {{was attached to the}} centre <b>frame</b> <b>stretcher</b> and was driven by an eccentric, mounted on the driving wheel axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{feedwater}} pump {{was fitted}} {{to the front}} <b>frame</b> <b>stretcher</b> and was driven by an eccentric on the driver axle. The locomotive was also equipped with a small feedwater injector, invented by the French engineer Henri Giffard in 1852, for use in cases of emergency. The pump and the injector feed had separate clack boxes.|$|E
50|$|As built, the {{locomotive}} {{had a single}} feedwater pump, fitted to the centre <b>frame</b> <b>stretcher</b> and driven by an eccentric on {{the centre of the}} driving axle. The buffing and drawgear were centrally arranged, with Johnston link-and-pin couplers without buffers instead of the buffers-and-chain which had been used on the three broad gauge Natal Railway Company locomotives.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} was {{a standard}} Sirdar class engine, {{similar to the}} two Class NG1 0-4-0T locomotives which were to enter service on the Bezuidenhout Light Railway a year later during the Second Boer War, but with leading and trailing pony wheels added and a tropical cab roof. Kerr, Stuart was a supplier of contractor's engines and often built locomotives to standard designs, but without <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers</b> and axles. These semi-completed locomotives were kept in stock until an order was placed. This allowed them to be delivered {{with a minimum of}} delay.|$|R
50|$|On 31 March 2009, two frame {{plates were}} cut at Corus Group plc Steel, Cradley Heath in the West Midlands. Measuring 39 ft in length 4 ft high and 1 1/8 in thick (28 mm), the frame plates were then {{taken to the}} Boro Foundry, at Lye, West Midlands, for {{machining}} and drilling, before being taken to the Llangollen Railway Works where assembly is in progress. The dragbox has been fitted to the frames, the front buffer beam fitted, the bogie bolster has been cast and has been fitted, all five of the five <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers</b> have been cast and are fitted to the frames.|$|R
5000|$|By {{diverting}} two of {{the three}} locomotives which were ready to be shipped out to the Nile Barrage construction works in Egypt, the locomotive builders were actually able to supply the engines within four days. The standard Sirdar class engines were similar to the single [...] gauge 2-4-2T engine Hope which had entered service in Walvis Bay in 1899, but without the leading and trailing pony wheels. Kerr, Stuart was a supplier of contractor's engines and often built locomotives to standard designs, but without <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers</b> and axles, and kept them in stock until an order was placed. This allowed them to be delivered with a minimum of delay.|$|R
50|$|A {{feature in}} the design of the leading bogie was that the bogie frame was a single steel casting to which the cast steel horns were bolted to take the axle boxes. An {{innovation}} was the arrangement of the laminated side control springs in combination with two point swing links, which would be part of all Hendrie's subsequent designs. To prevent trouble which had been experienced earlier owing to the fracture of the smokebox saddle and <b>frame</b> <b>stretcher</b> castings which contained steam chest passages, and also leakage at exhaust joints, the blast pipe breeches were made separate castings and not integral with the centre stretcher casting.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} locomotives {{were built}} with straight throatplate boilers, but were later {{fitted with a}} sloping throatplate boiler (date in brackets). Conversion was done by relocating the <b>frame</b> <b>stretcher</b> immediately {{in front of the}} firebox. Some of them reverted to straight throatplate at a later date, and these are also shown where known. Those marked with an asterisk were fitted with a boiler which had the top feed on the front ring on the date shown. In the case of no. 45087 it had previously been converted. The first conversion was carried out on no. 5022, and the last known was on no. 45163, which has been preserved.|$|E
50|$|Corner Key {{is a small}} wedge or {{block of}} board, timber or plastic, {{inserted}} into the slotted inside corners of a canvas <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame</b> to prevent or adjust sagging.|$|R
500|$|The Southern Railway {{placed an}} order for ten of the new {{locomotives}} to be built at Eastleigh Works, although the boilers had to be supplied from private industry and the tenders were built at Ashford. [...] The prototype was completed in February 1941, numbered 21C1, and named Channel Packet at a ceremony at Eastleigh works on 10 March 1941. [...] It underwent extensive trials and minor modifications before joining Southern Railway stock 4 June 1941. [...] A second prototype, 21C2 Union Castle was completed in June and named at Victoria railway station 4 July. [...] Both prototypes {{were found to be}} seven tons over the specified weight, and, at the insistence of the Southern Railway Civil Engineer, production of the remainder was halted until steps were taken to remedy this. [...] This was achieved by using thinner steel plates for the <b>frame</b> <b>stretchers</b> and covering the boiler cladding, and enlarging the existing lightening holes in the main frames. [...] The remaining eight locomotives in the batch were delivered between September 1941 and July 1942.|$|R
50|$|When a {{photographer}} takes a picture then digitally transfers this onto a canvas via inkjet printing, he then stretches this over a <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame.</b> By wrapping the canvas {{all the way}} around the frame, known as gallery wrap, the photographer can then hang his picture on the wall, already framed.|$|R
5000|$|Anicka Yi (born 1971 in Seoul, South Korea) is a {{conceptual}} artist {{who works in}} fragrances. Her works include boiling shredded Teva sandals in recalled powdered milk, <b>stretcher</b> <b>frames</b> of soap, and mixtures of stainless steel shower heads and fish-oil pills “arranged into something elegantly allegorical about the various industries that constitute our identity.“Anicka Yi {{lives and works in}} New York.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame</b> {{constructed}} from strainer bars {{should not be}} confused with one {{constructed from}} stretcher bars. Strainer bars are fixed to one another with wood glue, nails or staples, often in conjunction. Strainer bar frames are often reinforced with other fixed elements such as corner and cross braces. These frames are not built to accommodate the insertion of tightening keys into their corners to further tighten the canvas stretched upon them as a <b>stretcher</b> bar <b>frame</b> would.|$|R
50|$|After {{the image}} is printed, the canvas is trimmed to size and glued, or stapled to {{traditional}} stretcher bars, or a wooden panel and displayed in a frame, or as a gallery wrap. The frames are usually constructed from solid pine and underpinned for added strength. A print {{that is designed to}} continue round the edges of a <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame</b> once gallery-wrapped is referred to as full-bleed. This can be used to enhance the three-dimensional effect of the mounted print.|$|R
50|$|Canvas, {{typically}} {{made from}} Linen, hemp, jute, burlap, and cotton, is often stretched onto a wooden <b>frame</b> called a <b>stretcher.</b> Canvas can also {{come in the}} form of canvas board. As with all parts of a painting, deterioration is inevitable. Re-lining or lining treatments was used to added support to the original canvas until it was determined that it created more damage. Strip-lining is now used instead. Strip-lining involves reinforcing tacking that has weakened. Tears in the canvas are repaired with adhesive or sewing.|$|R
50|$|A {{strainer}} bar is used {{to construct}} a wooden <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame</b> used by artists to mount their canvases. They are traditionally a wooden framework support on which an artist fastens a piece of canvas. They are also used for small-scale embroidery to provide steady tension, affixing {{the edges of the}} fabric with push-pins or a staple gun before beginning to sew, and then removing it from the frame when the work is complete. Strainer bar frames are usually {{in the shape of a}} rectangle, although shaped canvases are also possible.|$|R
40|$|The {{accelerations}} {{due to a}} fast ambulance journey {{may cause}} dangerous trauma to the patient. The use of an active suspension system for the ambulance stretcher could significantly {{reduce the risk of}} trauma. A special-purpose parallel robot, interposed between the ambulance <b>frame</b> and the <b>stretcher,</b> and a possible control strategy have been designed in order to compensate the road unevenness and the accelerations due to the ambulance trajectory. The system performance has been assessed using the multibody simulation package Pro/Mechanica by PTC integrated with extensions in C language. The main results of the simulations are reported, showing the feasibility of the project...|$|R
5000|$|As {{a result}} of its travels, the picture had {{deteriorated}} considerably and required major restoration work. The picture had long been unprotected from changes in temperature and humidity, it had been constantly rolled and unrolled and untacked from its <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame.</b> At one stage it was even folded in half for transport. All this seriously affected the canvas. It gradually sagged, undulated and malformed and was in danger of becoming completely dilapidated. Katrina Rumley [...] The School of Materials Conservation at the Canberra College of Advanced Education started restoration work in 1980. The work included infra-red and ultra-violet photography to determine the condition of the painting followed by removal of old varnish and grime, repairs to the tacking margin and restoration of some small areas of paint. The work was completed in time for it to be taken to the new High Court of Australia building for its official opening by the Queen in 1981.|$|R
5000|$|The Red Room is full {{of curious}} details: the flowers {{that appear to be}} {{sprouting}} from the floor, the tiny grotesque head with a protruding pin-filled tongue, the <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame</b> through which we see both {{the corner of the room}} and a surprising out-of-scale head. It is impossible to decide which objects are [...] "real" [...] and which are products of Tulipanov's imagination. (One notably [...] "surreal" [...] touch is the severed arm with a metal [...] "bone" [...] projecting from it—presumably this is a prosthesis.) Many of the objects Tulipanov depicts are deliberately confusing. The convoluted gray mass on the seat of the chair is organic in shape but metallic in texture; its folds seem almost ready to coalesce into something recognizable (an animal's face perhaps), but never do so. There is even something unsettling in the combination of textures it presents—a pitted metal object resting on a delicate lace-edged cloth.|$|R
50|$|Canvas is {{typically}} stretched across a wooden <b>frame</b> called a <b>stretcher</b> {{and may be}} coated with gesso before {{it is to be}} used; this is to prevent oil paint from coming into direct contact with the canvas fibres, which will eventually cause the canvas to decay. A traditional and flexible chalk gesso is composed of lead carbonate and linseed oil, applied over a rabbit skin glue ground; a variation using titanium white pigment and calcium carbonate is rather brittle and susceptible to cracking. As lead-based paint is poisonous, care has to be taken in using it. Various alternative and more flexible canvas primers are commercially available, the most popular being a synthetic latex paint composed of titanium dioxide and calcium carbonate, bound with a thermo-plastic emulsion. Many artists have painted onto unprimed canvas, such as Jackson Pollock, Kenneth Noland, Francis Bacon, Helen Frankenthaler, Dan Christensen, Larry Zox, Ronnie Landfield, Color Field painters, Lyrical Abstractionists and others. Staining acrylic paint into the fabric of cotton duck canvas was more benign and less damaging to the fabric of the canvas than the use of oil paint.In 1970 artist Helen Frankenthaler commented about her use of staining:When I first started doing the stain paintings, I left large areas of canvas unpainted, I think, because the canvas itself acted as forcefully and as positively as paint or line or color. In other words, the very ground was part of the medium, so that instead of thinking of it as background or negative space or an empty spot, that area did not need paint because it had paint next to it. The thing was to decide where to leave it and where to fill it and where to say this doesn't need another line or another pail of colors. Its saying it in space.|$|R
40|$|U tekstu se donose rezultati istraživanja provedenih tijekom konzervator-sko-restauratorskih radova na dosad neobjavljenoj kopiji znamenite slike Paola Vero-nesea Otmica Europeiz Duždeve palače u Veneciji. Slika se danas čuva u Povijesnom i pomorskom muzeju Hrvatskog primorja u Rijeci, no muzejski inventari bilježe da potječe iz zbirke baruna Georga Hütterotta koja je bila smještena na otoku Sv. Andrije kod Rovinja. Multidisciplinarnost tima kemičara-analitičara, povjesničara umjetnosti i konzervatora-restauratora omogućila je pouzdanije odgovore na pitanja o tehnologiji i vremenu nastanke slike, odnosu kopije prema izvorniku i drugim kopijama iz 18. i 19. stoljeća te optimalan odabir restauratorskih postupaka i materijala. The paper brings forth {{results of}} a {{multidisciplinary}} research {{carried out in the}} course of conservation work on a copy of the painting by Paolo Veronese, The Rape of Europafrom the Doge’s Palace in Venice. The as yet unpublished copy is nowadays kept at the Maritime and History Museum of the Croatian Littoral in Rijeka. Mu-seum inventory books, however, reveal that it originated from the collection of Baron Georg Hütterottt, which used to be housed on the islet of St. Andrew, just off Rovinj. Laboratory investigations of the painting were carried out as part of the conservation procedure, aimed at exa-mining the chemical composition of the materials used, identifying the pigments and determining the sequence of paint coats in the painted layer of the original, as well as the relation of a subsequently added and painted piece of canvas {{to the rest of the}} composition. The information obtained was most valuable in establishing the time-frame from when the painting had originated to when its format was enlarged. We were able to identify: gypsum and traces of chalk in the preparation, lead white, barium white, Prussian blue and red ochre as well as dark earth pigments in the painted layers. A description is given of the laboratory, analytical methods: microanalysis of the chemical compounds using a scanning electron micros-cope, SEM/EDS and FT-IR micro-spectroscopy. By corre-lating the visual characteristics of the copy from Rijeka with the information on the pigments used, obtained by laboratory analyses, it was possible to date the paintingfrom the end of the 19 th to the first decades of the 19 th century, to the time when Veronese’s original was returned from Paris, reviving the public’s interest in this renowned piece of the Venetian cinquecentoart. The enlarging of the right-hand portion of the composition, albeit later in date and inferior in execution, followed soon after the painting had originated. The added portion was now folded and preserved, using a specially constructed <b>stretcher</b> <b>frame,</b> but only the original copy of the composition was presen-ted, matching the Veronese’s original. The multidisciplinary character of the team, made up of analytical chemists, art historians and conservators, pro-vided us with more reliable answers as to the technology and dating of the painting, the relation of the copy to the original and other 18 th- and 19 th-century copies, as well as the most favourable choice of conservation procedures and materials. The copy from Rijeka was put in the context of European artistic practice of repeating and citing notable paintings, and questions were raised as to the relation between the original, the copy and the facsimile, which is an ongoing issue to this day...|$|R
