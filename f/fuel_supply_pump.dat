40|$|Marine {{systems are}} complex and through the {{analysis}} of their reliability {{it is necessary to}} observe the reliability of their subsystems and components. With regard {{to the fact that the}} reliability is functionally dependent on faults, for the purpose of this study special attention has been given to possible faults on the heavy <b>fuel</b> oil <b>supply</b> <b>pump</b> of a two-stroke marine diesel engine MAN B&W 5 L 90 MC. A deductive approach to reliability analysis, i. e. fault tree analysis method (FTA), has been used. By the use of this method it is simpler to identify the system’s weak link and it is shown that the method gives the basis for the ship’s system reliability analysis. Based on FTA analysis this paper suggests system parameters that require continuous monitoring in order to achieve reliability. The results show the behavior of the components in case of faults and this approach can help to create a plan of action in order to enforce timely corrective and preventive action and, accordingly, increase the rate of reliability of the entire ship’s systems...|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} self-contained, {{independent}} Hydraulic Power Units (HPUs) on each SRB. Each HPU consisted of an {{auxiliary power unit}} (APU), <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> module, hydraulic <b>pump,</b> hydraulic reservoir and hydraulic fluid manifold assembly. The APUs were fueled by hydrazine and generated mechanical shaft power to drive a hydraulic pump that produced hydraulic pressure for the SRB hydraulic system. The two separate HPUs and two hydraulic systems were located on the aft end of each SRB between the SRB nozzle and aft skirt. The HPU components were mounted on the aft skirt between the rock and tilt actuators. The two systems operated from T minus 28 seconds until SRB separation from the orbiter and external tank. The two independent hydraulic systems were connected to the rock and tilt servoactuators.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the buildings and}} balance of plant systems required to support the Fusion Ignition Research Experiment (FIRE) Project. Facilities and systems are developed {{on the basis of}} a “greenfield ” site, with no benefit for existing facilities, but also without any constraints on the potential arrangement. Because FIRE will operate deuterium-tritium plasmas for pulse lengths on the order of 20 seconds, FIRE will require a moderate on-site tritium inventory. FIRE buildings and systems must be designed and licensed to comply with regulations for nuclear facilities. They must also include systems to manage tritium and tritiated water, activated dust, and radioactive waste material. Maintenance activities on FIRE will require the use of remote handling systems to remove and transport tokamak parts to hot cell facilities. Major tokamak service connections will be required to feed power to the copper magnet system and deliver plasma-heating energy to ICRF antennae. Competition for access to the tokamak for service connections and repair activities will constrain the overall arrangement and routing of services. This paper examines the design implications for the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply,</b> vacuum <b>pumping,</b> <b>fuel</b> recovery, cooling, and other balance of plant systems that contribute to the control of radioactive materials. It also examines the design implications for the tokamak test cell, hot cells, structures to house key services, and routing of service connections to the tokamak.

The selected application that the thesis deals with is an electrically driven and electronically controlled <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> <b>supplying</b> <b>fuel</b> to an aviation motor of the APU type. The thesis gives a comprehensive description of the design cycle of the unit and demonstrates implementing all the required critical functions. In {{the course of the}} design of the unit modern techniques in mathematical modelling, simulation, verification, monitoring and prediction of the operation status of airborne equipment were uses to the utmost extent. The purpose of these was to show the suitability of their application with regard to decreasing design time and cost, increasing lifetime and servicing intervals, as well as increasing user comfort and decreasing price. At the same time the required reliability was to be kept. The thesis also aims to prove and verify the suitability of using electronically commutated dc motors in critical applications in civil aviation. To reach this goal, it is necessary to design a robust drive control which would meet the given reliability requirements...|$|R

But because sprinkler system and automatic fire alarm system related to linkage control of water <b>supply</b> <b>pump</b> are designed by different manufacturers and installed by skillful staffs in different fields, there are accident potentials existing in the low reliability linkage control. The failure probability of extinguishment system is higher. In this paper, research on reliability and linkage control of automatic sprinkling pump system has been carried out.

40|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> {{of forest}} chips has {{to adapt to}} the annual {{fluctuations}} of power and heat generation. This creates inefficiency and unbalances the capacity utilization of the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet in the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> from roadside storages to power and heat generation. Terminals can offer an alternative approach for the fleet management of <b>fuel</b> <b>supplies</b> in terms of smoothing the unbalanced fleet use towards more even year-round operations. The aim {{of the study was to}} compare the supply costs of a conventional direct forest chip supply to an alternative <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> with the use of a feed-in terminal using the discrete-event simulation method. The influences of the terminal location, terminal investment cost, outbound terminal transport method, terminal truck utilization and quality changes of terminal-stored forest chips for the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> cost were studied in the case environment. By introducing a feed-in terminal and a shuttle truck for the transports of terminal-stored forest chips, the total supply cost was 1. 4 % higher than the direct <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> scenario. In terminal scenarios, the supply costs increased 1 – 2 % if the cost of the terminal investment increased 30 %, the distance to the terminal increased from 5 to 30 km or the total annual use of a terminal truck decreased 1500 h. Moreover, a 1 per cent point per month increase in the dry matter loss of terminal stored chips increased the total supply cost 1 %. The study revealed that with the relatively low additional cost, the feed-in terminal can be introduced to the conventional forest chip supply. Cost compensation can be gained through the higher annual use of a <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> fleet and more secured <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> to power plants by decreasing the need for supplement fuel, which can be more expensive at a time of the highest fuel demand...|$|R

As the <b>fuel</b> <b>supply</b> advance angle is 20 °CA, the brake specific fuel consumption {{is the best of}} the butanol diesel engine. When the supply advance angle becomes larger, the smoke and CO emissions can be reduced on the medium and high loads, but NOX emissions are significantly increased on a variety of load conditions.
