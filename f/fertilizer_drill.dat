40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to systemize the data contained {{in a set of}} technical catalogues referring to models of <b>fertilizer</b> and seed <b>drills</b> of precision to analyze the available information in order to prepare a database with technical characteristics and to propose a classification index for the models based on these characteristics. 93 catalogues of <b>fertilizer</b> and seed <b>drills</b> of precision supplied by Brazilian manufacturers were analyzed for generating information to characterize 250 models. On the basis of 31 technical characteristics available in catalogues, a database was prepared in which 9 of these characteristics were used in the formulation of an index number, called "Index of Adequacy" (IA). The application of IA allowed to classify the 250 models in five different categories (A, B, C, D and E), where 73 % of the analyzed models composed the categories A and B, indicated for small and medium farms; 19 % composed the category C, indicated for medium and large farms; and 8 % of the models composed the categories D and E, indicated for large farms. It may be concluded that the adequacy index is a tool that could be used by producers in the decision-making to select most adequate <b>fertilizer</b> and seed <b>drill</b> for farm characteristics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A simple two-wheel tractor (Chinese Dongfeng type) {{operated}} zero till {{seed and}} <b>fertilizer</b> <b>drill</b> attachment {{has been developed}} jointly by the Wheat Research Centre of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) and the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) Without prior land preparation, this machine places seed and fertilizer directly into the soil in one operation. There is tremendous scope for such tools for conserving agriculture attachments as there are over 200, 000 Chinese two-wheel tractors currently in Bangladesh. This prototype version of the zero till seed drill {{is made up of}} four major components, namely, a toolbar frame, a furrow opener, a seed delivery unit and a fertilizer delivery unit. The performance of the machine has been tested in 180 farmers ’ fields in different parts of Bangladesh for wheat and maize in 1999 - 2004. The crop yields are similar compared to the conventional methods. The effective field capacity of the machine was found to be 0. 18 ha per hr for simultaneous seeding and fertilizer application. Planting cost of wheat and maize were 83 % and 89 % less than that of conventional method. The two-wheel tractor operated zero till seed drill, thus, has a good potential as a resource conserving crop establishment technology for the Bangladeshi farmers...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Corn {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agricultural products withhigh consumption different forms of usage asfood and fodder. Corn yield and its cultivation needs improvement especially in developing countries. In conventional fertilizing methods with centrifuge machines or hand fertilization, parts of the fertilizer lost through volatilization, leaching and weeds absorption. Leaf burning is also reported in this method. Fertilizer placement in bands is a method that does not show these disadvantages and improves fertilizer use efficiency for the crop. Therefore using new machines and new methods for fertilizing the crop,the cultivation area and mean of yield productioncan improved, for example the yield of corn in this research. Material and Methods: This research was conducted in Lak Lak research farm in Asadabad district. Moldboard plowing plus disking was used for bed preparing the seeds anda 4 rows crop planter was used for planting the seeds. For treatments conducting Combination machine that had designed in thisresearch station workshop was used. This machine was able to place Urea fertilizer with different methods (<b>fertilizer</b> <b>drilling</b> in the rills, fertilizer placement in one side and two sides of plants). The variety of corn that used for this experiment was SC 704 with 65000 plants in one hectareas plant density. After soil sampling nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium fertilizers and other fertilizers demands by means of soil testwere determined. Half of the nitrogen was used at planting time from source of urea and the other half was used as top dressing duringgrowth season due to treatments as follow: 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as broad costing 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as drilling in the rills 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in one side of the plants 90 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants 60 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants 30 kgha- 1 nitrogen as band placement in two sides of the plants The treatments were conducted through 7 - 9 leaf bearing stage of corn growth. After harvesting, the mean yield of each plot and other data of plant attributes were collected through growth season and leaf samples were collected for nitrogen analysis. All data were analyzed usingmeans of Duncan's test. Result and Discussion: The results of experiment showed that, fertilizing method had no significant effect on plant height, maize height and percentage of corn cob at 1...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY – There are {{changes in}} the physical, {{chemical}} and biological properties of the soil, when direct drilling is adopted. This presentation reports experimental results for soil fertility and the response of crops to <b>fertilizers</b> under direct <b>drilling</b> {{in the south of}} Portugal. The increase of soil organic matter content, that usually occurs under no tillage, seems to be the only effective way to overcome the poor nitrogen-use efficiency of winter cereals under Mediterranean conditions. The normal organic matter content of the soil in the region is only about 1 %. For this level of organic matter, the results indicate that the most economical nitrogen application would be 160 kg N/ha and the correspondent yield would be 3063 kg wheat/ha. However, for an organic matter content of 3 % the most economical nitrogen level would be only 37 kg N/ha and the corresponding yield 3862 kg/ha. The application of fertilizers to the soil surface under direct drilling can increase soil acidity of the top-most layer. However, the experimental results show that this effect is temporary and the increase in soil organic matter offsets this effect on pH. The soils under direct drilling develop a very steep gradient in the concentration of nutrient, especially those less mobile in the soil, such as phosphorus. Experimental results suggest that this is one beneficial effect of direct drilling. Another significant interaction between tillage and fertilization is the importance of the timing of the first nitrogen topdressing application (at tillering stage) especially during wet winters. Under conventional tillage systems this can be delayed because of the inability to get onto the land with farm machinery under wet conditions. Experimental results will be presented that quantify this effect...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic problem}} {{associated}} with no-till and minimum tillage seeding operations {{is the presence}} of crop residue on fields which does not get cut with the existing seeding machines. This failure to cut crop residue results in improper placement of seed. Special seeding machines have been designed, (e. g., Haybuster 1206 grain and <b>fertilizer</b> <b>drill)</b> to overcome these problems. These machines re­quire extra investment for farmers already having conventional seeding machines if they want to practice minimum and no-tilling farming. The study was, therefore, undertaken to determine the perfor­mance of disc coulters under zero-till practice in the soil bin under different soil conditions and to provide design criteria for modification of existing seed drills so that they could be used under no till conditions. Cone index data on soil penetration resistance and soil moisture content were obtained from no-tilled and fall tilled fields at seeding time to simulate field conditions in the soil bin. Three sizes of disc coulters were evaluated for their cutting ability of the crop-residue in the soil bin. The data of cone index of packed soil, its moisture content, straw moisture content and straw density were also measured. Draft and vertical forces on coulters were reported for each test. Observations and analysis of data indicated a varying degree of crop residue being cut by the coulters under different soil conditions. The disc coulter 460 mm diameter performed satisfactorily and cut the straw at densities up to 5000 kg/ha at 50 mm depth of penetration and deeper...|$|E
