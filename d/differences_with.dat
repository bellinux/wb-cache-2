5|$|A second {{competing}} {{theory for}} extratropical cyclone development over the oceans is the Shapiro-Keyser model, developed in 1990. Its main <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> the Norwegian Cyclone Model are the fracture {{of the cold}} front, treating warm-type occlusions and warm fronts as the same, and allowing the cold front to progress through the warm sector perpendicular to the warm front. This model was based on oceanic cyclones and their frontal structure, as seen in surface observations and in previous projects which used aircraft to determine the vertical structure of fronts across the northwest Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|Argentina was {{the first}} Latin American country with a gay rights group, Nuestro Mundo (NM, or Our World), created in 1969. Six mostly secret {{organizations}} concentrating on gay or lesbian issues were founded around this time, but persecution and harassment were continuous and grew worse with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla in 1976, when all groups were dissolved in the Dirty War. Lesbian rights groups have gradually formed since 1986 to build a cohesive community that works to overcome philosophical <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> heterosexual women.|$|E
5|$|Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson {{pointed out}} {{additional}} <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less {{directed to the}} outside than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from {{other members of the}} Centrosaurinae.|$|E
5|$|By 1877, <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> the Republican party {{leadership}} on the money question led him to consider other options. After initially supporting the Republican candidate for governor that year, Weaver joined the Greenback Party in August. In 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for Iowa's 6th congressional district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district considered that endorsing him was likely {{the only way to}} defeat Ezekiel S. Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Despite objections from some hard-money Democrats, the Greenback-Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.|$|E

5|$|In 1847 a small {{political}} crisis occurred which removed Bentinck from {{the leadership and}} highlighted Disraeli's <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> his own party. In that year's general election, Lionel de Rothschild had been returned for the City of London. As a practising Jew he could not take the oath of allegiance in the prescribed Christian form, and therefore could not take his seat. Lord John Russell, the Whig leader who had succeeded Peel as Prime Minister and like Rothschild was a member for the City of London, proposed in the Commons that the oath should be amended to permit Jews to enter Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Friedman {{accepted}} {{a position at}} the University of Wisconsin–Madison, but left because of <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> faculty regarding United States involvement in World War II.

Allen Wallis and Harold Hotelling), where he {{spent the rest of}} World War II working as a mathematical statistician, focusing on problems of weapons design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> the Spector-produced version was the {{omission}} of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl {{at the time of}} the music's original American release.|$|E
5|$|In April 2001, Rise Against {{released}} {{their debut}} studio album The Unraveling through Fat Wreck Chords.

After the release of The Unraveling, guitarist Dan Wleklinski left the band due to personal <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> lead vocalist Tim McIlrath; he was eventually replaced by Todd Mohney, McIlrath's roommate and former bandmate.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, May {{confirmed}} that pre-production work was continuing.

May said they had parted on good terms and said that the band had felt Cohen's presence would have been distracting.|$|E

5|$|In a later match, against Essex, Miller was {{involved}} in a famous incident that is frequently cited when his character is discussed; it also spotlighted his <b>differences</b> <b>with</b> Bradman. On a day when the Australians set a world-record of 721runs in a single day, Miller came to the crease with his side already dominating, with the score 2/364. He deliberately allowed himself to be bowled first ball, much to Bradman's displeasure, in a protest against the one-sided nature of the contest.|$|E
