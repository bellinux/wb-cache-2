50|$|Centrifugal superchargers are {{typically}} mounted {{off to the}} side {{on the front of the}} engine. Distancing the supercharger from the engine via a mounting bracket greatly reduces heat transfer from the engine to the supercharger during operation.

Elevated temperature levels in the supercharger directly influence discharge <b>air</b> <b>temperatures</b> that next enter the engine.
