2500|$|Henry VIII of England (ruled 1509–1547) and Francis I of France (ruled 1515–1547) {{strove to}} host the most {{glittering}} renaissance court, culminating in <b>the</b> <b>festivities</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Field of Cloth of Gold (1520). But the rising power was Charles V, king of Spain, Naples, and Sicily from 1516, heir to the style {{as well as the}} riches of Burgundy, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1530. [...] The inflow of gold and silver from the New World into recently united Spain changed the dynamics of trade throughout Western Europe, ushering in a period of increased opulence in clothing that was tempered by the Spanish taste for sombre richness of dress that would dominate {{the second half of the}} century.

2500|$|This caused confusion, since <b>the</b> new <b>year</b> now fell {{five days}} earlier than before, {{and some people}} {{continued}} to observe the old date. After 46 years (AD 226–272), with 1 Frawardin now on 19 September, another calendar reform was implemented by Ardashir's grandson Hormazd I (AD 272–273). During <b>the</b> first <b>years</b> after implementation of the new Gatha days, the population had not universally adopted the new dates for religious festivals, resulting in [...] "official" [...] celebrations takings place five days earlier than popular celebrations. In later <b>years</b> <b>the</b> population had observed the Gatha days, but the original five-day discrepancy persisted. Hormazd's reform was to link the popular and official observance dates to form continual six-day feasts. Nawruz was an exception: {{the first and the}} sixth days of the month were celebrated as different occasions. Lesser Nawruz was observed on 1 Frawardin. 6 Frawardin became Greater Nawruz, a day of special <b>festivity.</b> <b>Around</b> <b>the</b> 10th century AD, the Greater Nawruz was associated with the return of the legendary king, Jamsed; in contemporary practice it is kept as the symbolic observance of Zoroaster's birthday, or Khordad Sal.|$|R
