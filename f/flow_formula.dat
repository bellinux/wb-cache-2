40|$|Much {{research}} has been dedicated to the interaction between flow and vegetation, however, this knowledge is only to a limited extend incorporated in models that are being used for river management practices. This may be {{partly due to the}} unknown reliability of the developed <b>flow</b> <b>formulas.</b> This contribution evaluates five different <b>flow</b> <b>formulas</b> derived for submerged vegetation: Klopstra et al. (1997); Stone and Shen (2002); Baptist et al. (2007); Huthoff et al. (2007); and Yang and Choi (2010). Each of these models is based on measurable vegetation characteristics to account for flow resistance by the vegetation. The evaluation of the <b>flow</b> <b>formulas</b> is based on the agreement with experimental data from literature, on their behaviour with respect to submergence ratio and on predicted water levels for different vegetation types. All models showed reasonable correlation to experimental data for rigid and flexible vegetation, however, average relative deviations were quite significant in the range of 24 to 43 %. Some models showed unexpected behaviour in the ratio of the flow velocities in the surface and vegetation layer and deduced roughness parameters as function of submergence ratio. Predicted water levels for a given velocity varied up to several meters for some vegetation types. This shows that a particular choice for a model may have huge consequences when being used to predict water levels during flood conditions. The <b>flow</b> <b>formulas</b> proposed by Klopstra et al.

Then the formula says that the spectral flow is a sum of two spectral flows on {{each part of the}} separated manifold with naturally introduced elliptic boundary conditions.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The semi-topological {{nature of}} the eta-invariant of a self-adjoint {{elliptic}} differential operator derives from a relative identification with a Chern character. This remarkable semi-locality property of the eta-invariant {{can be seen in}} spectral <b>flow</b> <b>formulae</b> and many other applications [APS 2, APS 3, BC 1, DZ 1, L 1]. In this paper we prove two geometric index theorems for a family of first-order elliptic operators over a manifold with boundary by computing eta form representatives for the Chern character classes of the index bundle. The eta forms occur as relative and regularized traces on infinite-dimensional vector bundles realized as the limiting values of superconnection character forms. The formulas are non-local and general, they do not require spin structures, compatibility with Clifford actions, or dimensional restrictions. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{discounted}} cash flow valuation methods. We start the paper with the simplest case: no-growth, perpetual-life companies. Then we will study the continuous growth case and, finally, the general case. The different concepts of cash flow used in company valuation are defined: equity cash flow (ECF), free cash flow (FCF), and capital cash flow (CCF). Then the appropriate discount rate is determined for each cash flow, depending on the valuation method used. Our starting point will be the principle by which {{the value of a}} company's equity is the same, whichever of the four traditional discounted cash <b>flow</b> <b>formulae</b> is used. This is logical: given the same expected cash flows, it would not be reasonable for the equity's value to depend on the valuation method. {{discounted cash flow}} valuation; cash flow valuation; value of tax shields; required return to equity;...|$|R

For injectors with their threshold pressures greater than their formation in-situ pressures, the effective radius for waterflooding is derived for a given injection pressure and then {{it is used to}} evaluate waterflooding effect and well pattern suitability, and guide the oilfield production. This method can also be applied to other waterflooding oilfields with similar geological conditions.

40|$|Index theory {{revealed}} its outstanding role in {{the study}} of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems and the dynamical consequences of this theory are enormous. Although the index theory in the periodic case is well-established, very few results are known in the case of homoclinic orbits of Hamiltonian systems. Moreover, to the authors' knowledge, no results have been yet proved in the case of heteroclinic and halfclinic (i. e. parametrised by a half-line) orbits. Motivated by the importance played by these motions in understanding several challenging problems in Classical Mechanics, we develop a new index theory and we prove at once a general spectral <b>flow</b> <b>formula</b> for heteroclinic, homoclinic and halfclinic trajectories. Finally we show how this index theory can be used to recover all the (classical) existing results on orbits parametrised by bounded intervals. Comment: 24 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} a curve of Fredholm pairs of Lagrangian subspaces in a fixed Banach space with continuously varying weak symplectic structures. Assuming vanishing index, we obtain intrin-sically a continuously varying splitting {{of the total}} Banach space into pairs of symplectic subspaces. Using such decompositions we define the curve’s Maslov index by symplectic reduction to the clas-sical finite-dimensional case. We prove the transitivity of repeated symplectic reductions and obtain the invariance of the Maslov in-dex under symplectic reduction, while recovering all the standard properties of the Maslov index. As an application, we consider curves of elliptic operators which have varying principal symbol, varying maximal domain and are not necessarily of Dirac type. For this class of operator curves, we derive a desuspension spectral <b>flow</b> <b>formula</b> for varying well-posed boundary conditions on manifolds with boundary and obtain th...|$|E

40|$|The {{analytic}} {{approach to}} spectral flow is {{about ten years}} old. In that time it has evolved to cover an ever wider range of examples. The most critical extension was to replace Fredholm operators in the classical sense by Breuer-Fredholm operators in a semifinite von Neumann algebra. The {{first part of this}} paper gives a brief account of this theory extending and refining earlier results. It is then applied in the latter parts of the paper to a series of examples. One of the most powerful tools is an integral <b>formula</b> for spectral <b>flow.</b> This integral <b>formula</b> was known for Dirac operators in a variety of forms ever since the fundamental papers of Atiyah, Patodi and Singer. One of the purposes of this exposition is to make contact with this early work so that one can understand the recent developments in a proper historical context. In addition we show how to derive these spectral <b>flow</b> <b>formulae</b> in the setting of Dirac operators on (non-compact) covering spaces of a compact spin manifold using the adiabatic method. Finally we relate our work to that of Coburn, Douglas, Schaeffer and Singer on Toeplitz operators with almost periodic symbol. We generalise their work to cover the case of matrix valued almost periodic symbols on ^N using some ideas of Shubin.

At first, in this paper the most applied drain flow formulas in steady-state conditions are reviewed and compared using as dependent variable the ratio between the maximum water table height and the distance between two lines of parallel drains. These equation are also tested using experimental field data measured in three plot drained by surface pipe drains having different value of drain spacing. Then, applying the dimensional analysis and the self-similarity theory, a new drain spacing formula is theoretically deduced and compared with the solutions available in literature. Finally, the analysis shows that the most applied drain flow formulas have the general mathematical shape deduced by dimensional analysis and self-similarity condition...|$|E

The river and land regions were separated by the constructed levee in the bend flume. Results showed that the levee breaching process can be subdivided into a slope erosion stage, a headcut retreat stage and a breach widening stage. Mechanisms such as flow shear erosion, impinging jet erosion, side slope erosion and cantilever collapse were discovered in the breaching process. The erosion characteristics were determined by both flow and soil properties. Finally, a depth-averaged 2 -D flow model was used to simulate the levee breaching flow rates, which is well expressed by the broad-crested weir <b>flow</b> <b>formula.</b> The deduced discharge coefficient was smaller than that of common broad-crested rectangular weirs because of the shape and roughness of the breach...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the recent}} years, {{a great deal}} of effort has been devoted towards the {{development}} of analytical models for wormhole-routed networks. However, most of these models employ routers with negligible flit buffers. As a consequence, they do not adequately capture the performance behaviour of actual routers, which are often equipped with extended buffers which can hold more than one message flit. In this paper, an open queueing network model (QNM) is proposed for a wormhole-routed torus with finite buffers subject to a compound Poisson process (CPP) with geometrically distributed batches. The GE/G/ 1 /K queue and appropriate GE-type <b>flow</b> <b>formulae</b> are adopted, as cost-effective building blocks, in the solution process of the entire network.
