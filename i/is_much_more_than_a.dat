2500|$|Regarding {{the unusual}} {{combination}} of cello and guitar in Prague String Duo, Večtomov commented that a piano absorbs some of a cello's gentler shades of tone, which thus become superfluous; that the guitar can respond more sensitively than the harpsichord to {{the means of}} expression of the solo cello; and that it can differentiate all tones and produce vibrato and glissando transitions. Moreover, the cello/guitar combination, he said, is more tender, more sensitive, and better integrated than any other, as the two instruments are also much alike in the technical respect. According to the music historian Ludomír Česenek, [...] "The 'string duet' combination <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> novelty in scoring musical compositions. It constitutes an experiment rooted {{in the tradition of}} the technique of music, an endeavor to discover the sources of musical expression, a renaissance of an approach which, while overtaken by the past development, has lost nothing of its aesthetic validity or of the potential to ressurect it and develop it in the modern spirit." ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{the secret}} was worse; {{not only was}} such a family founded on {{stealing}}, but the family was stealing still. It is a grim truth that all through the eighteenth century, all through the great Whig speeches about liberty, all through the great Tory speeches about patriotism, through the period of Wandewash and Plassy, through the period of Trafalgar and Waterloo, one process was steadily {{going on in the}} central senate of the nation. Parliament was passing bill after bill for the enclosure, by the great landlords, of such of the common lands as had survived out of the great communal system of the Middle Ages. It <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> pun, it is the prime political irony of our history, that the Commons were destroying the commons. The very word [...] "common," [...] as we have before noted, lost its great moral meaning, and became a mere topographical term for some remaining scrap of scrub or heath that was not worth stealing. In the eighteenth century these last and lingering commons were connected only with stories about highwaymen, which still linger in our literature. The romance of them was a romance of robbers; but not of the real robbers.|$|E
6000|$|I {{read this}} {{sentence}} {{a few days}} ago, or one like it, in an obituary of Ibsen: 'Let nobody again {{go back to the}} old ballad material of Shakespeare, to murders, and ghosts, for what interests us on the stage is modern experience and the discussion of our interests;' and {{in another part of the}} article Ibsen was blamed because he had written of suicides and in other ways made use of 'the morbid terror of death.' Dramatic literature has for a long time been left to the criticism of journalists, and all these, the old stupid ones and the new clever ones, have tried to impress upon it their absorption in the life of the moment, their delight in obvious originality & in obvious logic, their shrinking from the ancient and insoluble. The writer I have quoted <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> journalist, but he has lived their hurried life, and instinctively turns to them for judgement. He is not thinking of the great poets and painters, of the cloud of witnesses, who are there that we may become, through our understanding of their minds, spectators of the ages, but of this age. Drama is a means of expression, not a special subject matter, and the dramatist is as free to choose, where he has a mind to, as the poet of 'Endymion' or as the painter of Mary Magdalene at the door of Simon the Pharisee. So far from the discussion of our interests and the immediate circumstance of our life being the most moving to the imagination, it is what is old and far off that stirs us the most deeply. There is a sentence in 'The Marriage of Heaven and Hell' that is meaningless until we understand Blake's system of correspondences. 'The best wine is the oldest, the best water the newest.' ...|$|E

60|$|The {{activities}} of a cult which set itself {{to bring about}} the world state would at first be propagandist, they would be intellectual and educational, and only as a sufficient mass of opinion and will had accumulated would they become to a predominant extent politically constructive. Such a cult must direct itself particularly to the teaching of the young. So far the propaganda for a world law, the League of Nations propaganda, since it has sought immediate political results, has been addressed almost entirely to adults; and as a consequence it has had to adapt itself as far as possible to their preconceptions about the history and outlook of their own nationality, and to the general absence as yet in the world of any vision of the welfare of mankind as one whole. It is because of this acceptance of current adult ideas about patriotism and nationality that the movement has adopted the unsatisfactory phrase, a League of Nations, when what is contemplated <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> league and a very considerable subordination of national sovereignty. And a large share in the current ineffectiveness of the League of Nations is evidently {{due to the fact that}} men interpret the phrase and the proposition of the League of Nations differently in accordance with the different fundamental historical ideas they possess, ideas that propaganda has hitherto left unassailed. The worker for the world state will look further and plough deeper. It is these fundamental ideas which are the vitally important objective of a world-unifying movement, and they can only be brought into that world-wide uniformity which is essential to the enduring peace of mankind, by teaching children throughout all the earth the common history of their kind, and so directing their attention to the common future of their descendants. The driving force that makes either war or peace is engendered where the young are taught. The teacher, whether mother, priest, or schoolmaster, is the real maker of history; rulers, statesmen and soldiers do but work out the possibilities of co-operation or conflict the teacher creates. This is no rhetorical flourish; it is a sober fact. The politicians and masses of our time dance on the wires of their early education.|$|E
