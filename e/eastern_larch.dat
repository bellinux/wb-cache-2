The latent heat flux accounted for 38 ¿ 67 % of the sum of turbulent heat fluxes in June, July, and August, a relatively moderate fraction was compared to values measured at mid- and low latitudes. More than 70 % of the annual precipitation evaporated during May to September. Annual evapotranspiration, including interception loss, was relatively steady at 169 ¿ 220 mm compared with the wide range in annual precipitation (111 ¿ 347 mm year¿ 1). The evapotranspiration rate was 1. 49 ¿ 2. 30 mm day¿ 1 {{on a daily basis}} from May to September above a dry canopy. This feature is one of the remarkable characteristics of the water balance in eastern Siberian forests. The thawing depth of the permafrost has been rapidly deepening since 2004, such that the maximal thawing depth varied from 127 cm before 2003 to over 200 cm after 2004. At the same time, there was a very large increase in the moisture content of the surface soil. This increase could not be explained by the amount of annual precipitation alone and may have been due to inflow from the deeper thawing layer. The IAV of evapotranspiration was small, but the yearly evapotranspiration coefficient (the ratio of evapotranspiration to potential evaporation) ranged from 0. 30 to 0. 45. These results indicate that the IAV of evapotranspiration is controlled by regulation of the land surface rather than by atmospheric demand. Soil-moisture content was the most important variable among the factors determining the evapotranspiration coefficient at an interannual temporal scale. This result differs somewhat from previous satellite-based findings that air temperature was a major variable for plant activity. This difference might result {{from the fact that the}} IAV of soil water content did not correspond to that of the precipitation amount because of the presence of the permafrost.

The {{range of the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> beetle, Dendroctonus simplex LeConte (Coleoptera: Scolytinae), is concomitant with its primary host, <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> (tamarack), Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch, throughout the North American boreal forest. Since 2000, an ongoing outbreak of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> beetles in the south-central part of tamarack’s range throughout the Great Lakes region has caused extensive mortality to mature tamaracks, affecting over 86, 500 hectares of tamarack forest in Minnesota. Extended outbreaks in live trees are atypical of this insect, so the <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> beetle’s biology and ecology were studied under laboratory and field conditions in Minnesota from 2011 – 2014 to decipher the factors contributing to this ongoing outbreak. In the laboratory, the minimum and optimal developmental temperatures for <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> beetles were determined to be 7. 5 and 27. 9 °C, respectively. Some progeny were able to reproduce {{in the absence of}} an overwintering period, suggesting that a reproductive diapause may not be obligate in all individuals. This was confirmed by field studies, which found that a second generation of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> beetles successfully completed development during the summer and fall of 2012. Confirmation of two generations instead of three sibling broods established by re-emerging parents in one year was established by detailed phenological and physiological methods. As beetle infestations progressed through tamarack stands, beetles initially preferred to attack the largest tamaracks before killing smaller hosts at random in successive years. Reproductive success of females increased in larger and older tamaracks, and those “challenged” by unsuccessful attacks in the recent past. Higher concentrations of resin pockets within the phloem consistently reduced beetle reproduction. The size of male and female beetle offspring, as well as the total lipid content of female offspring, increased with tamarack size and phloem thickness. Development within “challenged” tamaracks reduced both the total and proportional lipid contents of all beetle offspring. New understandings of the population dynamics of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> beetles are discussed. Expanding growing seasons, for example, may facilitate fractional voltinism, or, two generations in one year, among a portion of the population. Synchronous beetle emergence the following spring – shown in phenological studies – would enhance host procurement, especially of the largest and most preferred hosts that produce the most vigorous offspring, thus exacerbating the outbreak...|$|E
40|$|<b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> (Larix laricina) {{and black}} spruce (Picea mariana) {{are the most}} {{dominant}} tree species in peatlands in Canada, however interactions between peatland hydrology and species-specific radial growth are poorly understood. This study investigates {{the relationships between the}} growth/hydrological response of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> and black spruce across a topographical gradient within a peatland in Saskatchewan. Tree-ring analysis revealed that peatland hydrology is the main factor driving radial-tree growth. Black spruce {{on the edge of the}} fen showed a positive relationship to increased water-table level, while <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> in the fen revealed a negative correlation to water-table level rise. Further analysis illustrated that radial-tree growth response to hydrology is dependent on specific water-table levels according to species and micro-site. Identified thresholds indicated that only 8 cm of variability in water-table level can greatly affect the fen forest dynamics. Once the relationship between tree ring and hydrology was established, a multiple- species regression equation was derived from tree-ring data to reconstruct past water-table levels. Results indicated that <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> and black spruce are suitable proxies to reconstruct hydrological variability at the site. <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> ring widths are not only subjected to change by hydrology, but they can also be altered by exposure to larch sawfly outbreaks (Pristiphora erichsonii). Researchers have often been limited in their ability to draw accurate conclusions regarding the history of sawfly outbreaks in peatlands. Water-table level suppressions result in similar radial-growth patterns as when trees are defoliated by larch sawfly, making accurate diagnoses of larch sawfly outbreak a challenge. In this study I investigated the relationship between sawfly outbreaks and peatland hydrology. Five outbreaks where identified using traditional dendroecological analysis. The last outbreak identified was found to be a result of hydrological growth suppression and not sawfly defoliation. Observations indicated that periods of low water-table level may lead to increased populations of larch sawfly in northern Saskatchewan. I stress the necessity of using long-term hydrological analyses to accurately infer outbreak periods to distinguish them from water-table suppression...|$|E
30|$|Tree drought-response {{is partly}} plastic and {{phenotypic}} plasticity results from environmental factors should be another explanation of our findings. <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> is from NB, {{where it is}} characterised by mixture of continental climate and maritime climate. Species from these areas are likely to have high tolerance to changing weather conditions (Islam and Macdonald 2004; Lukkarinen et al. 2009; Dufour-Tremblay et al. 2012). Effective spring drought avoidance by <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> partially explains why it dominates eastern Siberian forests with their cold, dry continental winter climate (Berg and Chapin 1994). Larger natural range of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> contributes to its higher adaptation to the temporally and spatially variable soil conditions, including water availability. Prince Rupprecht’s larch is native to the mountainous regions of 1400 – 2800  m elevation, distributed in a scattered manner, with a smaller area in Shanxi and Hebei provinces of northern China. It has been well known that temperature and water supply (especially precipitation) were critical drivers for seedling germination (Walck et al. 2011; Xiang et al. 2016). So, we deduced that frequently occurring spring drought in northern China is the limiting factor to the tree recruitment, which in turn resulted in the narrower distribution of Prince Rupprecht’s larch, and lower adaptation to water deficits compared to <b>eastern</b> <b>larch.</b> Similarly, paper birch has a wide range. It is found in interior and south-central Alaska and in all provinces and territories of Canada, as well as the northern continental USA, south to Pennsylvania and Washington. White birch is mainly distributed in East Asia, native to China, Korea and Japan. Wider distribution of paper birch also resulted in higher adaptation to water deficits compared to white birch.|$|E
30|$|Larches are {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} tree genus in China, accounting for 6.5 % {{of the forest}} area and 6.8 % of the forest volume in this country (Lei et al. 2016). Prince Rupprecht’s larch (L. gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii (Mayr) Pilg.) is one of dominant species of cold temperate coniferous forests in northern China, mainly distributed at mountainous regions with elevations of 1400 — 2800  m (Di et al. 2014). The species plays significant ecological roles in water conservation, ecotourism and biodiversity, {{and it is also}} relatively fast growing with good-quality timber (Li et al. 1997; Zhang and Meng 2004). <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> is native to North America. It has a continuous distribution in Canada from the Yukon in the west to Newfoundland in the east and south to the northern and north-eastern USA (Berg and Chapin 1994). It is a commercial species, particularly for short-rotation pulpwood plantations. Prince Rupprecht’s larch and <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> are both of ecological and commercial importance but responses of seedlings of these species to water deficits are still unknown. Populations of Prince Rupprecht’s larch have experienced serious drought since the 1990 s (Qian and Zhu 2001). <b>Eastern</b> <b>larch</b> is mainly confined to hydric sites in Canada, so is tolerant to spring flooding in wetlands (Islam and Macdonald 2004).|$|E
30|$|We {{found that}} reduced {{photosynthetic}} rate, transpiration rate and increased water-use efficiency were physiological {{responses of the}} four species to drought, and the responses varied among the species. All larch seedlings appeared no leaf shedding, survived through the drought treatment and showed a longer duration and high tolerance to drought. In low-watered conditions, survival rate, biomass, shoot height, root collar diameter, total leaf area, total root area and chlorophyll concentration of birch seedlings were significantly decreased. The response of seedlings to water deficits also differed according to the seed origins. Xeric origin of Prince Rupprecht’s larch was more affected than mesic origin of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch,</b> mainly because Prince Rupprecht’s larch originated in a narrower range of mountainous regions, resulting in lower adaptation of this species to water deficits, whereas <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> was distributed widely along coastal regions, contributing to higher phenotypic plasticity to variable soil conditions. Similarly, higher plasticity of paper birch {{may be responsible for}} its better performance in the low-watered treatment than white birch.|$|E

In our study, seed origin of <b>eastern</b> <b>larch</b> and paper birch was of mesic conditions with a mean annual precipitation sum of 1144  mm, being distributed rather uniformly over the year (Fig.  2 a); seed origin of Prince Rupprecht’s larch and white birch was characteristic of xeric conditions with a mean annual precipitation sum of 427  mm (Fig.  2 b).
