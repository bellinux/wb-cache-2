5|$|Aspirin is an {{effective}} analgesic for acute pain, but is generally considered inferior to ibuprofen for the alleviation of pain because aspirin {{is more likely to}} cause gastrointestinal bleeding. Aspirin is generally ineffective for those pains caused by muscle cramps, bloating, gastric <b>distension,</b> or acute skin irritation. As with other NSAIDs, combinations of aspirin and caffeine provide slightly greater pain relief than aspirin alone. Effervescent formulations of aspirin, such as Alka-Seltzer or Blowfish, relieve pain faster than aspirin in tablets, which makes them useful for the treatment of migraines. Topical aspirin may be effective for treating some types of neuropathic pain.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{mechanisms}} of interindividual variations in visceral pain sensitivity remain poorly understood. We characterized the neuroendocrine responses to rectal <b>distensions</b> in healthy individuals with high vs. low rectal pain sensitivity. Methods: Rectal sensory and pain thresholds were determined, {{and a series}} of random painful <b>distensions</b> was carried out. Eighteen subjects were stratified into groups with a low rectal pain threshold (“High Sensitivity” group) vs. a high rectal pain threshold (“Low Sensitivity” group) by median split, and were compared with regard to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, cardiovascular, and emotional responses. Results: <b>Distensions</b> led to an anticipatory stress response, reflected by elevated baseline anxiety, and increased baseline ACTH and cortisol in both groups. In response to <b>distensions,</b> the “Low Sensitivity” group showed significantly greater ACTH and cortisol concentrations analysis of variance (ANOVA time×group for ACTH: p<. 05; for cortisol: p<. 01), and elevated diastolic blood pressures (BP) (ANOVA group: p<. 01) when compared to the “High Sensitivity” group. Conclusions: Painful rectal <b>distensions</b> are associated with a pronounced anticipatory stress response, reflected by elevated anxiety and elevated stress hormones. Individuals with high rectal pain sensitivity differ from those with low pain sensitivity in distension-induced hormonal and blood pressure responses, suggesting that neuroendocrine responses may be relevant to the pathophysiology of visceral hyperalgesia.

5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in the counts each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the possible role of apoptosis on brief <b>distensions</b> of human saphenous veins at different pressures. METHODS: Fresh isolated grafts of human saphenous vein were assigned as control or distended (D) for fifteen seconds at 100, 200 and 300 mmHg. The degree of apoptotic caspases 3, 8, 9 and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl- 2 expression were assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Fresh isolated segments of distended human saphenous veins presented similar apoptotic protein expression {{when compared with}} control veins. However, the Bcl- 2 expression was significantly higher in the 300 mmHg distended segments compared with the control vein. CONCLUSION: These findings show that intact segments of human saphenous veins submitted to <b>distensions</b> at different pressures have similar apoptotic proteins expression when compared with non-distended control veins. Therefore, brief <b>distensions</b> commonly performed during surgical harvesting do not trigger apoptosis, and probably are not involved on the physiopathological mechanisms that lead to graft failur...|$|R

Light microscopic study of bone growth areas showed that procollagen I antigenicity {{was present in}} osteoblasts and prebone (osteoid), but not bone tissue; neither procollagen III nor collagen IV antigenicity were detected. The localization of procollagen I antigenicity within osteoblasts was then attempted in the electron microscope. Chopper slices of formaldehyde-fixed tibia from day-old rats were incubated with affinity-purified anti-procollagen I antibodies linked to peroxidase and were treated with hydrogen peroxide {{in the presence of}} 3, 3 '-diaminobenzidine. The dot-like reaction indicative of procollagen I antigenicity was found to be moderate in rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) cisternae, strong in spherical and cylindrical Golgi <b>distensions,</b> and intense in prosecretory and secretory granules. Reactivity was also observed within the matrix of multivesicular bodies Thus an increasing gradient of procollagen I antigenicity occurs from rER cisternae through Golgi <b>distensions</b> to secretory granules, that is, along the presumed pathway of procollagen synthesis. The antigenicity present within rER cisternae is attributed to the precursor pro alpha (I) chains, while that in the cylindrical Golgi <b>distensions,</b> secretory granules, and prebone is attributed to procollagen itself. The antigenicity of multivesicular bodies suggests some degradation of pro alpha chains or procollagen...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Gastric {{barostat}} {{studies are}} increasingly being performed, but their reproducibility and the most suitable study protocol have not been determined. The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the reproducibility of gastric sensitivity and accommodation testing in healthy and in dyspeptic subjects, and to compare stepwise and double random staircase <b>distensions.</b> METHODS: A total of 13 dyspeptic patients and 25 healthy control subjects underwent two successive studies. Sensory thresholds were assessed on a same-day/different-days protocol, using a stepwise (11 / 14 healthy subjects and 11 / 13 patients) or a double random staircase inflation (11 / 21 healthy subjects). In 10 healthy subjects, both methods were compared. Gastric accommodation was measured on different days in 13 patients and nine healthy subjects. Data (mean +/- SEM) were compared using the paired t test, and individual variability was expressed as the percent coefficient of variation. RESULTS: In healthy subjects, the thresholds for first perception and for discomfort were highly reproducible (p > 0. 05) and the pressure thresholds showed a lower degree of variability than the volumes. Pressure thresholds quantified by stepwise showed lower variability than double random staircase inflation. In the patients, the sensory thresholds were unchanged between the sessions on the same and on different days (p > 0. 05). Gastric accommodation also showed excellent reproducibility for both dyspeptic patients and healthy control subjects (p > 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Both in dyspeptic patients and in healthy control subjects, gastric sensitivity and accommodation quantified by isobaric <b>distensions</b> show excellent reproducibility. Pressure and volume thresholds both are well reproducible, but the former shows less variability. Finally, the simplest stepwise protocol is better than the double random staircase to assess the gastric sensitivity to distensio...|$|R
40|$|The role of NK 3 receptors in rabbit colonic {{propulsion}} {{has been}} investigated in vitro with the selective agonist, senktide, and two selective antagonists, SR 142801 and SB 222200. Peristalsis was elicited by distending a rubber balloon with 0. 3 and 1. 0 mL of water leading to a velocity of 2. 2 and 2. 8 mm s(- 1), respectively. At concentrations of 1 nM, senktide inhibited propulsion evoked by both <b>distensions</b> (range 25 - 40 %), whereas at 6 and 60 nmol L- 1 facilitated 'submaximal' propulsion by 30 %. In the presence of N omega -nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA, 200 mu mol L- 1), which per se caused a slight prokinetic effect, 1 nmol L- 1 senktide markedly accelerated propulsion (range 35 - 50 %). Hexamethonium (200 mu mol L- 1) had minor effects on propulsion. In its presence, 60 nmol L- 1 senktide significantly inhibited propulsion induced by both stimuli (range 20 - 50 %). SR 142801 (0. 3, 3 nmol L- 1) and SB 222200 (30, 300 nmol L- 1) facilitated 'submaximal' propulsion (range 20 - 40 %). Conversely, higher antagonist concentrations (SR 142801 : 30, 300 nM; SB 222200 : 1, 10 mu mol L- 1) inhibited propulsion to both <b>distensions</b> by 20 %. A combination of SR 142801 (300 nmol L- 1) plus hexamethonium (200 mu mol L- 1) induced an approximately four-fold greater inhibition of propulsion than that induced by SR 142801 alone. In conclusion, in the rabbit-isolated distal colon, a subset of NK 3 receptors located on descending pathways mediates an inhibitory effect on propulsion by activating a NO-dependent mechanism. Another subset of NK 3 receptors, located on ascen ding pathways mediates a facilitative effect involving a synergistic interaction with cholinergic nicotinic receptors...|$|R

40|$|A {{primary goal}} in volcano {{seismology}} is to characterize source motions internal to a volcano {{in terms of}} their representative forces. In a similar manner, much volcano infrasound research strives to recover eruptive force time histories corresponding to material accelerations occurring at Earth’s free surface. These motions may correspond to explosive emission of gas and pyroclasts (e. g., Banister, 1984), rapid ground <b>distensions</b> of a volcanic dome (e. g., Johnson and Lees, 2010), and/or gravity driven rock fall or pyroclastic flows (e. g., Yamasato, 1997). When free surface motion is unsteady it imposes stresses upon the surrounding atmosphere, which are propagated as acoustic airwaves. Typically, the sounds produced by volcanic phenomena are recorded with low-frequency infrasound sensitive microphones. The intervening atmosphere is relatively homogeneous and nonattenuating for infrasound propagation of a few kilometers, therefore the recorded excess pressures closely represent volcano source time functions. Such force time histories are equivalent to volumetric accelerations of the atmosphere at or near to the source...|$|R
