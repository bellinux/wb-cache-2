5|$|Adding a {{multiple}} of any row to another row, or {{a multiple}} of any column to another column, {{does not change the}} <b>determinant.</b> Interchanging two rows or two columns affects the <b>determinant</b> by multiplying it by âˆ’1. Using these operations, any matrix can be transformed to a lower (or upper) triangular matrix, and for such matrices the <b>determinant</b> equals the product of the entries on the main diagonal; this provides a method to calculate the <b>determinant</b> of any matrix. Finally, the Laplace expansion expresses the <b>determinant</b> in terms of minors, that is, determinants of smaller matrices. This expansion can be used for a recursive definition of determinants (taking as starting case the <b>determinant</b> of a 1-by-1 matrix, which is its unique entry, or even the <b>determinant</b> of a 0-by-0 matrix, which is 1), that can be seen to be equivalent to the Leibniz formula. Determinants can be used to solve linear systems using Cramer's rule, where the division of the determinants of two related square matrices equates to the value of each of the system's variables.|$|E

5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The <b>determinant</b> of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the <b>determinant</b> as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The <b>determinant</b> of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its <b>determinant</b> is invertible in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is invertible. Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E

40|$|Data {{presented}} here show that locidentify in the I-region of the H- 2 gene complex are selectively expressed in different functional T-cell subpopulations. These loci are closely linked (or possibly identical) to loci that control immune responses.

These <b>determinants</b> are controlled by a locus mapping in the I region of the H- 2 complex. In an accompanying publication we show that this locus (Ia- 4) marks a new I subregion (I- J) and is expressed only on T cells.
