5|$|As before, {{the uniform}} buttons could also {{reflect the state}} loyalties of an individual. All of the Confederate States {{made an effort to}} supply their {{respective}} State buttons to their troops. The states that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> the Confederacy, but had men within its ranks, such as Maryland and Missouri, also made buttons, that have turned up on surviving uniforms.|$|E
5|$|Because Justice Anthony Kennedy <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> Stevens' {{opinion as}} to several parts, {{largely on the}} grounds of {{judicial}} parsimony (that is, having decided that the military commissions had no foundation, the core question of the case was decided and the Court did not need to go further), those sections were without a majority in support.|$|E

5|$|Derrick <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> up {{when war}} broke out in September 1939 but, like many Australians, enlisted {{after the fall of}} France in June 1940. He joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 5 July 1940, and was posted to the 2/48th Battalion, 26th Brigade, as a private. Derrick first joined his unit at the Wayville Showgrounds, before basic {{training}} at Woodside. Derrick thrived on military life, but found discipline difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the plans}} {{did not fully}} work as intended. The native populations that joined Arenales could not resist the royalist counter-attacks, and the slaves <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> the army in the {{expected}} numbers. The Argentine provinces could not send the supporting army that San Martín had requested earlier, and the Army of the North no longer existed. As a result, he wrote to Simón Bolívar, trying to coordinate actions with him.|$|E
5|$|Influenced from {{an early}} age by the Swiss modernist, Le Corbusier, Tange gained {{international}} recognition in 1949 when he won the competition for the design of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park.

He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> the group of younger CIAM architects known as Team X, though his 1960 Tokyo Bay plan was influential for Team 10 in the 1960s, as well as the group that became Metabolism.|$|E

5|$|Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion, which held that §8772 does not infringe on {{the separation of}} powers between the legislative and judicial branches of government, considering also that the law is an exercise of congressional authority regarding foreign affairs. Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E

5|$|Smolarek, Terlecki and {{two other}} Polish players—Zbigniew Boniek and Władysław Żmuda, both of Widzew Łódź—angrily objected and nearly came to blows with Blaut. Grzegorz Lato, one of the team's forwards, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> the protest but later {{said that he had}} not thought Młynarczyk drunk enough to warrant exclusion. The team {{eventually}} left without Terlecki or Młynarczyk. Terlecki, whose own car was to hand, drove himself and Młynarczyk to the airport, where the confrontation continued.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2003, Hsu began {{contributing}} to, {{and collecting}} contributions for, the Democratic Party, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> {{the party and}} was not registered to vote. He also donated to causes such as the Innocence Project and Clinton Global Initiative. He also became a trustee of The New School in New York, to whom he donated $100,000 and provided the money for a scholarship.|$|E
5|$|The League of Nations {{has been}} a disappointing failure.... It {{has been a}} failure, not because the United States <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> it; but because the great powers have been unwilling to apply {{sanctions}} except where it suited their individual national interests to do so, and because Democracy, on which the original concepts of the League rested for support, has collapsed over half the world.|$|E

5|$|This arrangement, however, left Wyoming—the third-most {{powerful}} ship of the division—as {{the spare}} ship because she lacked a matched pair. As a result, Rodman requested that Delaware—the oldest {{ship in the}} division—be replaced with Wyomings sister ship , leaving Florida as the spare. Arkansas, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> Battleship Division Nine until 29 July 1918. Delaware sailed from Scapa Flow for the United States the next day.|$|E
5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} panel that advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Arafat {{left the}} University and, {{along with other}} Arabs, sought to enter Palestine to join Arab forces {{fighting}} against Israeli troops {{and the creation of}} the state of Israel. However, instead of joining the ranks of the Palestinian fedayeen, Arafat fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>join</b> the organization. He took part in combat in the Gaza area (which was the main battleground of Egyptian forces during the conflict). In early 1949, the war was winding down in Israel's favor, and Arafat returned to Cairo from a lack of logistical support.|$|E

In early 2007, Williams was indefinitely suspended from the Wildcats for academic reasons, but his suspension was later lifted {{prior to the start}} of the season.|$|E
