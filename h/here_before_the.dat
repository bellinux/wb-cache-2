Four years after her death, in 1958, Rivera donated the house to the nation of Mexico and set up a {{foundation}} for its preservation. The house was converted to a museum dedicated to the life and works of Kahlo. The first director of the museum was Carlos Pellicer with the mandate to keep the house as it was.|$|E
25|$|From {{the summit}} of Carl Side a system of ridges descends southward towards Millbeck. The main spur runs {{straight}} for a mile, the first half being of gentler gradient and culminating in a large patch of white stones at about 1,600ft. There is a very short rocky arête <b>here,</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> spur falls abruptly to the valley floor. On {{the eastern side of}} this section are the crags of Doups. The southern ridge sends out shorter branches on either side, just above the patch of white stones. On the western side across the rocky col of Long Doors is Dodd, a fell on Forestry Commission land that is largely wooded. To the east is Carlsleddam, a steep sided spur that appears sharply peaked from below: though less inspiring close up it does have a narrow and airy summit ridge.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not known}} exactly how long the Native Americans who {{occupied}} the area that became northwest Arkansas were <b>here</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> westward expansion of European settlers arrived. But {{it is known that}} the Osage Indians were roaming on lands north of the Arkansas River. They were roving bands, very venturesome, and known to delight in making war on their neighbors. The Quapaw tribe also roamed northwest Arkansas. They were a fearless, happy people who were more settled than the Osage. They loved fishing, hunting and a more peaceful way of life, unlike the fighting Indians. From the makeup of the Pea Ridge area, it is thought that it fits the mold of the Quapaw Indian. It is known that the tribes of this area were more settled and were actually farmers in their way. The town's namesake wild peas are believed to be a product of this early farming, since it would have taken many years of preparation and cultivation to produce them.|$|E
25|$|The {{available}} evidence indicates a construction {{date in the}} Antonine or early Severan period (late 2nd or early 3rd century AD). The scaenae frons (stage front) was certainly put up at this time, as the style of both sculpture and architectural ornament suggest. Statue bases terminating the retaining walls of the auditorium bore the names of two brothers, senators in the early Severan period, and two inscribed bases placed symmetrically against the exterior facade held statues of Aphrodisian benefactors, Claudia Antonia Tatiana and her uncle Lucius Antonius Dometinus, who were active {{at the end of}} the 2nd century. Tatiana is known to have had close ties with Ephesus, and it is possible that the striking similarities between this building and the bouleuterion on the civic agora there, dated by inscription to the mid-2nd century, are due to some initiative on her part. We do not know what stood <b>here</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 2nd century AD, but it is likely that the present building replaced a smaller one contemporary with the laying out of the agora in the late 1st century BC.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, President Bush {{dismissed}} Arafat as {{a negotiating}} partner, {{saying he had}} [...] "failed as a leader" [...] and accused him of undercutting Abbas when he was prime minister (Abbas resigned the same year {{he was given the}} position). Arafat had a mixed relationship with the leaders of other Arab nations. His support from Arab leaders tended to increase whenever he was pressured by Israel; for example, when Israel declared in 2003 it had made the decision, in principle, to remove him from the Israeli-controlled West Bank. In an interview with the Arabic news network Al Jazeera, Arafat responded to Ariel Sharon's suggestion that he be exiled from the Palestinian territories permanently, by stating, [...] "Is it his [...] homeland or ours? We were planted <b>here</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Prophet Abraham came, but it looks like they [...] don't understand history or geography." ...|$|E

500|$|According to the 19th-century Anglesey {{historian}} Angharad Llwyd, {{the first}} church was established here by St Cynfarwy in about 630. The {{date of the}} present structure is uncertain, although one 19th-century historian suggested {{that it might be}} from the 15th century. There was a church <b>here</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 15th century, however, since the font is from the 12th century and a church was recorded in this location in the Norwich Taxation of 1254. On 5 November 1349, the possessions of the deceased clergyman who had been the incumbent priest of Llechgynfarwy were dealt with by an inquisition at Beaumaris, Anglesey – one of several dead clergymen whose goods were considered that day. [...] According to the historian Antony Carr, the timing suggests that the priests had been victims of the Black Death, and he notes that [...] "the clergy as a class were hit particularly hard" [...] by it.|$|E
500|$|Below Imperial Dam, only a {{small portion}} of the Colorado River makes it beyond Yuma, Arizona, and the {{confluence}} with the intermittent Gila River – which carries runoff from western New Mexico and most of Arizona – before defining about [...] of the Mexico–United States border. At Morelos Dam, the entire remaining flow of the Colorado is diverted to irrigate the Mexicali Valley, among Mexico's most fertile agricultural lands. Below San Luis Río Colorado, the Colorado passes entirely into Mexico, defining the Baja California–Sonora border; in most years, the stretch of the Colorado between here and the Gulf of California is dry or a trickle formed by irrigation return flows. The Hardy River provides most of the flow into the Colorado River Delta, a vast alluvial floodplain covering about [...] of northwestern Mexico. A large estuary is formed <b>here</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Colorado empties into the Gulf about [...] south of Yuma. Before 20th-century development dewatered the lower Colorado, a major tidal bore was present in the delta and estuary; the first historical record was made by the Croatian missionary in Spanish service Father Ferdinand Konščak on July18, 1746. During spring tide conditions, the tidal bore – locally called El Burro – formed in the estuary about Montague Island in Baja California and propagated upstream.|$|E
500|$|Following Pakistan, Boycott and the England team {{travelled}} to New Zealand. England {{were defeated}} in the opening Test {{for the first time}} in 48 years. Boycott took seven hours and 22 minutes to score 77 runs, and England were bowled out for 64 when chasing 137 to win. In the second match, Botham's first Test century took England to 418, but by the end of the match England needed to score quickly to force a win. Boycott, however, told his team that he would play the way he always had, and proceeded to accumulate runs very slowly. Derek Randall was run out, and Botham went out to bat with his captain, informing the dressing room that [...] "Boycs will be back in <b>here</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> end of the over." [...] Botham then ran Boycott out, later claiming in his autobiography that he had done it deliberately. Indeed, some have suggested that this was a team order. Boycott disputes the suggestion that the run-out was deliberate in his autobiography, referring to Botham's account as [...] "a story that gets bigger and more fanciful with every telling". The tale does nevertheless remain a renowned story. Boycott then delayed his declaration, much to the frustration of England bowler Bob Willis. England did eventually declare, and Willis took 4/14. New Zealand were bowled out for 105 and England won by 174 runs. Boycott suffered a scratch on his cornea and missed the last two days of the final match, and by the start of the 1978 season, Brearley had taken the captaincy back from Boycott.|$|E

[...] He claims that he was given a source for this period by Archdeacon Walter of Oxford, who presented him with a [...] "certain very ancient book written in the British language" [...] from which he has translated his history. He also cites Gildas and Bede as sources. Then follows a dedication to Robert, earl of Gloucester and Waleran, count of Meulan, whom he enjoins to use their knowledge and wisdom to improve his tale.|$|E
