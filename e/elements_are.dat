5|$|A popular {{alternative}} {{structure is}} that of Theodor Benfey (1960). The <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> arranged in a continuous spiral, with hydrogen at the centre and the transition metals, lanthanides, and actinides occupying peninsulas.|$|E

5|$|Essential {{structural}} elements. Artificial circularly permuted proteins {{can allow}} {{parts of a}} protein to be selectively deleted. This gives insight into which structural <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> essential or not.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, {{astronomer}} Paul W. Merrill in California {{detected the}} spectral signature of technetium (specifically wavelengths of 403.1nm, 423.8nm, 426.2nm, and 429.7nm) in light from S-type red giants. The stars were {{near the end}} of their lives, yet were rich in this short-lived element, indicating that it was being produced in the stars by nuclear reactions. This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E

50|$|The Norse form of {{the name}} was Kolabú. The first <b>element</b> <b>is</b> the genitive plural case of kol n 'coal', the last <b>element</b> <b>is</b> bú n 'rural district'. The first <b>element</b> <b>is</b> {{referring}} {{to the practice of}} making coal by burning wood.|$|R

5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

5000|$|In UFDs, every {{irreducible}} <b>element</b> <b>is</b> prime. (In any integral domain, every prime <b>element</b> <b>is</b> irreducible, but {{the converse}} {{does not always}} hold. For instance, the <b>element</b> [...] <b>is</b> irreducible, but not prime.) Note that this has a partial converse: a domain satisfying the ACCP is a UFD {{if and only if}} every irreducible <b>element</b> <b>is</b> prime.|$|R

5|$|Again, it is {{required}} that the set of infinite matrices obtained this way stand in one-to-one correspondence with the original -matrices and that the multiplication table is the right one – {{the one of the}} -matrices. It should be emphasized that in the infinite-dimensional case, the concern is rarely the complete matrices. They are exposed here only to highlight the common thread. But individual matrix <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> frequently computed, especially for the Lie algebra (below).|$|E
5|$|Although {{five times}} more <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> metals than nonmetals, two of the nonmetals—hydrogen and helium—make up over 99 per cent of the {{observable}} Universe, and one—oxygen—makes up close to half of the Earth's crust, oceans and atmosphere. Living organisms are also composed almost entirely of nonmetals, and nonmetals form many more compounds than metals.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach it. Both <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
50|$|In a stack, the {{priority}} of each inserted <b>element</b> <b>is</b> monotonically increasing; thus, the last <b>element</b> inserted <b>is</b> always the first retrieved.

5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields nearly as substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E
5|$|<b>Elements</b> <b>are</b> loosely {{structured}} interest groups, where specific {{themes and}} issues are addressed.

5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> common in developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum bleeding, and acute myocardial infarction.

Second, one <b>element</b> <b>is</b> placed upper side spreading out for upward and the other <b>element</b> <b>is</b> placed lower side spreading out for downward. This is unbalanced type.|$|R
30|$|The {{array antenna}} was {{implemented}} using five patch-type elements. The <b>element</b> spacing <b>was</b> a half-wavelength (6.52 [*]cm). Four <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> used for transmitting and receiving signals, {{and the other}} <b>element</b> <b>was</b> used for calibration.|$|R
5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 {{features}} an original score by Lance Hayes, {{also known as}} DJ Drunken Master. Like Forza Motorsport 3, the score consists mainly of ambient electronica music, although orchestral <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> incorporated into the music.

5|$|Group 3 <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} {{hard metals}} with low aqueous solubility, and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role in living organisms. The radioactivity of the actinides generally makes them highly toxic to living cells, causing radiation poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, chlorine, {{plus the}} noble gases are collectively {{referred}} to as the elemental gases.
