5|$|By 1859, Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's {{health was}} {{worsening}} significantly. Information about the particular conditions she was afflicted with is contradictory. Testimony from Cadron-Jetté's family suggests that Cadron-Jetté had become ill {{when she was}} 36 years old and never fully recovered. Other sources suggest generalised edema, <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as dropsy, while still others diagnose her with chronic nephritis, <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as Bright's disease, which worsened over the following years. Symptoms observed in Cadron-Jetté by her contemporaries included difficulty breathing, almost constant coughing, fits of breathlessness while standing and at rest, and swollen legs displaying open sores.|$|E

5|$|In February 2011 Elba, <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{time for}} playing Stringer Bell in The Wire, {{reportedly}} joined {{the cast of}} Prometheus in an undisclosed role. When the film was released he described Janek's background, and the character's career as a longshoreman and sailor motivate him to maintain the well-being of his crew. Roger Ebert praised Elba's performance, calling Janek's evolution the most interesting in the film.|$|E

Even before their arrival in Odessa, the Vorontsovs started buying up {{lands in the}} southwest of Crimea, which was sparsely populated and little <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Alupka was bought in 1824 from colonel , the owner of Livadia and Oreanda. By that time, the Vorontsovs also had property in Gurzuf, Massandra, Ai-Danil, and Cape Martian.|$|E
5|$|The New York draft riots (July 13–16, 1863), <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as Draft Week, were violent {{disturbances}} in Lower Manhattan, {{widely regarded as}} the culmination of working-class discontent with new laws passed by Congress that year to draft men to fight in the ongoing American Civil War. The riots remain the largest civil and racial insurrection in American history, aside from the Civil War itself.|$|E

Aaron Copland and George Gershwin developed a new synthesis of popular and classical music.|$|E

5|$|Again {{assisted}} by convict laborers and two army sergeants, Dubois began searching along the Solo River near Trinil in August 1891. His team soon excavated a molar (Trinil 1) and a skullcap (Trinil 2). Its characteristics were a long cranium with a sagittal keel and heavy browridge. Dubois first {{gave them the}} name Anthropopithecus ("man-ape"), as the chimpanzee was sometimes <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. He chose this name because a similar tooth found in the Siwalik Hills in India in 1878 had been named Anthropopithecus, and because Dubois first assessed the cranium to have been about , closer to apes than to humans.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1985, a group {{including}} astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner {{published a}} series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of Archaeopteryx were forged. Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig {{and others at the}} Natural History Museum in London. Most of their evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of Archaeopteryx <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichstätt specimens have obvious feathers.|$|E

5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, it is in the process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, Sands {{had become}} {{impatient}} with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, {{at the office of}} Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design.|$|E
5|$|During {{the breakup}} of Yugoslavia, the United States engaged in both combative and {{economic}} conflict, particularly with Serbia, <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (one of socialist Yugoslavia's successor states). The United States imposed sanctions and spearheaded a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999. During this period, another wave of Serbian emigration ensued, and many Serbian refugees moved to the United States. In the 2000s, diplomatic relations between the United States and Yugoslavia were restored, but were changed when Montenegro seceded in 2006, after which Serbia was the successor state to continue relations previously held by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia in February 2008, a move which the US recognized.|$|E

5|$|During the {{campaign}} Shelby's political enemies, notably Humphrey Marshall, criticized {{his response to}} Jefferson's second letter regarding the Genêt affair and questioned his loyalty to the United States. Shelby contended that his noncommittal response to the letter was meant to draw the federal government's attention {{to the situation in}} the west. He cited the agreement between Washington and the Spanish as evidence that his ploy had worked. He also claimed to have <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time he wrote the letter that the French scheme was destined to fail.|$|E
5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of {{scientists}} at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934.

The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E

Southern Rhodesia, as it was <b>known</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, competed under the name of Rhodesia. Two athletes from Southern Rhodesia were selected to compete in the 1928 games, both in boxing; Cecil Bissett in the lightweight and Leonard Hall in the welterweight weight division.
