There should be agencies with the legal power to expose and punish governmental institutions for corruption or other unlawful actions. This ensures that no one branch gains a preponderance of power and is able to unduly influence the policies and governance of the state. This <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> works in tandem with vertical accountability, which is the systems by which citizens check the power of the government elections, the media, or civil society. However, <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> carries more weight in ensuring the internal embeddedness of democracy, as it is more frequently used than vertical accountability and has a more substantial support from the constitution of a state. If it is indeed constitutionally mandated, <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> can [...] "close a central gap of control in the basic democratic structure, one that is not covered by the first three partial regimes" ...|$|E

But {{their games}} differ {{according to the}} structure, behavioral codes, and informal orientations associated with the paths of elite change. Although democratic institutions and procedures are in place just about everywhere, the differing elite power games account for major differences in extra-electoral politics and, thus, for wide variations {{in the quality of}} postcommunist democracies. The extent of the particularisms - clientelism and patronage, blurred functional autonomies and boundaries, violations of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountabilities,</b> manipulations of the media and judiciary, harassment of Opposition elites, personal vendettas, persecutions of minorities - define these power games, and they can be linked systematically to the patterns of elite unity, differentiation, and circulation.

Merkel uses Robert Dahl's definition of political equality, which includes equality [...] "before the law and in the political process."

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{accountability}} enjoys wide and growing appeal, its advocates submitting both normative and functional arguments for institutions limiting discretionary powers {{of political and}} economic elites. This development is seen as facilitative of democratisation, especially in post-authoritarian societies. Yet it has gone almost unnoticed that not all authoritarian regimes have dismissed accountability reform and some are adopting reforms in its name. This article contrasts the patterns in Malaysia and Singapore on a specific accountability institution - human rights commissions - offering explanations for why the former has established one and the latter not. It is argued that intra-state conflicts associated with Malaysian capitalism have created pressures and opportunities for accountability reform not matched in Singapore where there is a more cohesive ruling elite.

[...] The term [...] "embedded democracy" [...] was coined by political scientists Wolfgang Merkel, Hans-Jürgen Puhle, and Aurel Croissant, who identified [...] "five interdependent partial regimes" [...] necessary for an embedded democracy: electoral regime, political participation, civil rights, <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability,</b> {{and the power of the}} elected representatives to govern. The five internal regimes work together to check the power of the government, while external regimes also help to secure and stabilize embedded democracies. Together, all the regimes ensure that an embedded {{democracy is}} guided by the three fundamental principles of freedom, equality, and control.|$|E
50|$|O’Donnell’s {{research}} {{since the}} early 1990s explored {{the question of the}} quality of democracy. His work warns against teleological thinking, that is, the tendency to see countries that democratized in the 1970s and 1980s as following in the tracks, though several steps behind, of the longstanding democratic countries of the West. To highlight the specificity of contemporary Latin American countries and the deficiencies of their democracies, he proposed the concept of delegative democracy, by which he meant a form of democratic rule that concentrated {{power in the hands of}} elected presidents, and the associated concept of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability.</b> Later work centered on the problems faced by most Latin American democracies as a result of deficiencies in the rule of law and the social capabilities of citizens. His key works on the quality of democracy have been published in Counterpoints (1999), The Quality of Democracy (2004), Dissonances (2007), and in his final book, Democracy, Agency, and the State (2010), which makes a case for addressing the importance of the state in conceptualizations of democracy.|$|E

This article frames some of the explicit conceptual choices that are needed to define accountability, distinguishing between the institutionally bounded concept of “political accountability” on the one hand, and the broader, multi–dimensional notion of “accountability politics” on the other. With the goal of identifying the patterns of civil society {{influence on}} the state, the article unpacks accountability relations between and within state and civil society actors, to avoid treating them {{as though they were}} implicitly homogeneous and isolated from each other. It is also necessary to broaden our conceptual frameworks for understanding accountability by taking into account the interaction between local, national and international arenas.

40|$|In the Netherlands, as {{in other}} OECD-countries, many {{executive}} agencies have been granted substantial autonomy in recent years. Central to agentification is that governmental organizations are placed more or less outside of departmental hierarchies. From the outset, the establishment of agencies has induced height-ened political and academic concern regarding their accountability. This is be-cause their partial separation from their parent departments also cuts through the customary mechanisms for accountability. In the Netherlands in particular, but also in other countries, many authors have proclaimed that 'horizontal accountability' is a promising solution for the ac-countability-problems of agencies. The concept broadly focuses upon forms of accountability that address other stakeholders and demands besides those of the hierarchical principal. The research in this book addresses three conceptual and three empirical issues. The first conceptual issue {{is to develop a}} suitable conception of horizontal ac-countability. The second conceptual issue is to arrive at a fuller understanding of the accountability problems of executive agencies. The third and most difficult question is to draft a normative framework from which empirical practices of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> can be evaluated. The empirical contribution of the research focuses upon three issues. The first issue is to identify which arrangements for <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> actually exist. The second empirical issue is to study how a number of cases of horizon-tal accountability operate in practice. The third empirical question is to evaluate this from the developed normative framework. This book is based upon research conducted into thirteen arrangements for hori-zontal accountability of six agencies. In addition, the arrangements of seven other agencies were studied In the literature, accountability arrangements have been categorized on different grounds. The point of departure for the notion of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> is the hierarchical relationship between actor and forum. In order to be categorized as a case of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability,</b> the forum needs to be independent from both the agent and the principal, and is not hierarchically superior to the agent. In this research, arrangements for <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> have been identified for 82 Dutch executive agencies. A substantial minority of these 82 agencies account for their behaviour through one or more arrangements for <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability.</b> In total 60 arrangements were found. They can be found primarily within large autonomous administra-tive authorities. In total there are 14 boards, 15 client councils, 5 boards of ex-perts, 11 independent evaluation committees ('visitation') and 14 internal om-budsmen. The arrangements for <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> have been evaluated from a de-mocratic perspective and a cybernetic (learning) perspective. This results in the unambiguous conclusion that, from a cybernetic perspective, all arrangements render many (albeit modest) positive contributions. From a democratic perspec-tive however, <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> provides little added value. The general conclusion of this research is that the arrangements for <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> operate in a way that clearly corresponds with the cybernetic tradition and has little added value from the democratic perspective. The most captivating finding of this research is that hierarchical accountability strongly influences processes of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability.</b> Horizontal account-ability operates in the 'shadow of hierarchy'...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} the accountability deficit of executive agencies. It {{argues that the}} acclaimed deficit consists of two elements: the inability of democratic principals to hold autonomous agencies accountable and the insufficiency of hierarchical accountability mechanisms on their own. Hori-zontal mechanisms for accountability have been developed in which agencies account for their behavior toward stakeholders, boards of commissioners, and professional visitations. This article {{addresses the}} question whether {{and to what extent}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> mechanisms in practice serve as remedies for the deficit. An evaluative grading system is designed with which 15 <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> mechanisms of Dutch agencies are assessed.

As the analysis of the vertical accountability of CONSEG practice, together with the public security organs in the city of Manaus, it was concluded that there is the use of monitoring and control tools, participation and interaction with accountability and results by the CONSEG. You might also note that the use of these tools is very low for a body of external social control to the state. Among the tools analyzed, presented the best use within the councils was the participation and interaction, then accountability and results, and inspection and control.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} limits and {{possibilities}} for community development practice to maintain dynamism and integrity {{in a professional}} context. There is a particular emphasis upon reflexivity and its relevance in processes of accountability towards both communities and state policy. The study {{was born out of}} dissonance surrounding the researcher’s community development practice mid-way through New Labour’s 1997 to 2010 administration. It argues that New Labour’s social functionalist approach proved to be problematic for the maintenance the reflexive and personal commitment necessary to the central dynamic of community development work. Although not specifically designed to consider feminist community development approaches, the questions emerged from the researcher’s feminist analysis of contemporary practice and the research itself was designed from this perspective. The design of the methods applied to the empirical research for this study are based upon those used in reflexive and transformative community development practice. The empirical work involves a case study surrounding the conditions for community development professional practice in North East England in 2007, ten years into New Labour’s last administration. This consisted of semi-structured interviews with a sample of twenty-four self-defined community development practitioners. Focus groups were conducted in 2009 to share the findings and to assist the researcher to take the analysis further. Aiming to generalize from a particular historical moment when the Government seemed to be supportive of community development work, during New Labour’s 1997 to 2010 administration, the thesis highlights some inherent tensions within the relationship {{between the state and the}} dynamism of community development and illustrates lessons that are widely applicable to its everyday practice. In conclusion this thesis argues that for community development practice to maintain dynamism and integrity in a state policy context it is vital that its personal dynamic is integral to forming future conceptions of professionalism. Moreover that supporting the personal and relational elements of community development practice requires the creation of liminal spaces where self-determination and the agency can be exercised. For, it is only under these practice conditions that the intersubjective relationships necessary for bilateral and <b>horizontal</b> professional <b>accountability</b> can be nurtured and developed. ...|$|R

This type of management has been associated, at an initial moment, with private enterprise in the context of globalization, although gradually being implemented in the public, and consequently in the state-owned broadcasting corporations of the European Union. The three first corporations who have introduced CSR in their management are the BBC in the UK, RTÉ in Ireland, and ZDF in Germany. They develop their strategies in the fields of governance, working conditions, human rights, consumer, good practices in the activity, environment and community involvement.

30|$|One-way {{communication}} – One-way {{power is}} a highly authoritarian model in which those who rule or have authority and power decide what is communicated to others. The recipient has to receive said communication passively. Two-way communication and one-way power could be a situation wherein a scientist or corporate manager may listen to the feedback of the farmers/users but, ultimately exercises his/her authority to decide which feedback to act upon and which to ignore. The possibility of someone having power and not asserting or communicating it is almost zero. If one has power then it will flow through communication mode and meaning. On the other hand, one-way communication with two-way power is possible situation in a democratic election in which the leaders may convey their agenda and the voters may show their power through voting rather than verbally communicating it. Next, one-way communication with no power flow either way represents a tom-tom beater (an announcer on a railway station or any public place) who announces messages to people in a locality, without any power to influence the actual content or its interpretation. Another example of this dynamics is the people who manage propaganda or dissemination, without having the power to influence the content. Two-way communication with two-way power {{is perhaps the most}} sustainable and democratic arrangement. Mao Tse-tung called this the mass-line concept. The brigade was accountable to commune and vice versa. The two-way power makes it democratic and two-way communication makes it humanitarian.

Using principal-agent theory to refer to the basic relation-ship between politicians, media and citizens, I intend to explain why politicians make use of particularism - behaviour aiming at the limitation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> â to force the media into cooperation with politicians (media capture) or to engage in an illicit, mutually agreed deal (collusion). Located in the literatures on democratization, party research and media studies, I aim to connect these fields in arguing that intra-party dynamics such as party leaders' rootedness, contestation and the institutionalization of rules {{play an important role in}} incentivizing executive politicians to capture or collude with media outlets. The empirical outcome of the study showing drastic failures of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> contradicts dominant narratives of Croatia's high level of democratic consolidation between 2000 and 2014 and therefore challenges the suitability of indicators primarily designed to capture the institutionalization of institutions rather than the institutionalization of particularism.

40|$|Over half {{a century}} has passed since the {{publication}} of A. H. Birch’s Representative and Responsible Government (1964), yet it still continues as a seminal source for leading contemporary political scientists (see for example Rhodes 2011 : 280 - 1). Along the way it has been identified as one of the classic analyses of UK constitutional politics (Flinders 2010 : 73) and more broadly as one of the ‘best analytical surveys of representation’ (Wahlke 1971) as well as offering exceptional insights into notions of responsibility (Mair 2009 : 11). Birch’s (1964 : 21) initial linkage of representation and responsibility - ‘a representative system enables a government to be responsible’ {{in a number of different}} ways - has come under sustained and critical reflection by subsequent scholars of both government and governance. This critical political analysis complements Birch’s own recognition of the complexities and ambiguities in his conceptualisation of both representation and responsibility (plus the practical vagaries, tensions and contradictions inherent in their systemic interconnectedness as ‘representative and responsible government’). In the intervening five decades these complexities and ambiguities have multiplied and this is reflected through increased conceptual sophistication, in a ‘rethinking’ of notions of representation and responsibility, and through increased complexity and indeterminacy of government itself, to the extent that the term ‘governance’, with all of its associated adjectives – decentred, multi-level, global, meta – is now seen as a more accurate descriptor of governing practice. In turn, these ideational and empirical challenges have resulted in claims that representative and responsible government has now been displaced by representative versus responsible government (Mair 2009, 2011); or, more dramatically still, that there has been an ‘end to representative politics’ (Tormey 2015) and, simultaneously, the displacement of ‘standard model’ linear forms of responsibility in more complex models reflecting the expansion of lateral or <b>horizontal</b> modes of <b>accountability,</b> captured most vividly in Keane’s (2009, 2011) notion of ‘monitory democracy’.

This paper {{examines}} the roles, responsibilities and {{interactions between the}} various formal and informal institutions and stakeholders involved {{in the management of}} police services in the DRC. It identifies informal networks that influence decision-making processes and policy implementation, and provides an analysis of interactions between the Congolese population and national and international actors. It also aims to highlight both <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>accountability</b> mechanisms within the existing legal framework, setting out to identify any legal gaps and contradictions, which could explain overlapping mandates. The study provides interesting geographical and administrative data on national security systems, and uses a multidimensional governance approach to understand the complexity of the security sector and the interconnectedness between the relevant actors. The study concludes that stakeholders of the security and police sectors of the DRC are linked together in a web of complex and dynamic systems, characterised by discrepancies between theory and practice. It is inaccurate to think of these systems and mechanisms as working either in opposition to one another or in parallel. In fact, these systems intertwine more than they conflict, and there are significant overlaps and confusion with regard to the mandates of the existing institutions, structures and actors involved. All security services in the DRC possess a legal framework within which they must operate. The legal contradictions and loopholes identified in this paper are often the result of dubious interpretations, or even deliberate misinterpretations of existing operational provisions underlying the functioning of security services. The research concludes that there is very poor coordination between the various actors and institutions involved in the management of security services in the DRC.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the results of a {{collaborative}} action research process (2010 - 2012) in which 10 development organisations (nine Dutch and one Belgian), together with their Southern Partners, explore different Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) approaches with the aim of dealing more effectively with complex processes of social change. Some of the PME approaches that were piloted include outcome mapping, most significant change, sense maker and client satisfaction instruments. A major challenge that organisations were trying to address during this action research pertained the demonstration of observable ‘results’ in complex contexts where such results are not always easy to measure or to quantify (e. g. deep cultural change in a gender mainstreaming programme) and where causal links between cause and effect cannot always be predicted in advance (e. g. the results of supporting geographically dispersed informal networks of women groups working around violence against women). We first outline the methodology of the collaborative action research that was used by the participating organisations to make their PME approach more complexity oriented. We also explain the rationale for the organisations to participate in the action research. Drawing from recent literature, we elaborate on the main challenges for PME when dealing with complex processes of social change. At the same time, we highlight how some of the PME approaches that were piloted during the action research, helped organisations to address these challenges. This is done {{with the help of an}} analytic framework to assess the effectiveness of a PME approach in dealing with complex social change. This framework is built around the following four dimensions. How does the PME approach contribute to: 1) Strengthening relationships, roles and expectations of the actors involved in the intervention?; 2) Learning about the progress towards the development objectives (of the programme, partner organisations, partner networks, Northern NGOs) ?; 3) Satisfying downward, <b>horizontal</b> and upward <b>accountability</b> needs?; 4) Strengthening the own internal adaptive capacity of the programme, partner organisations, partner networks, and/or Northern NGOs? Throughout the paper we provide illustrative extracts from the various action research cases. Finally, we explain how a balanced PME approach is more than the PME tools and also involves an agenda, underlying principles and a specific way of implementation. We also describe the main lessons and practical recommendations that can help organisations to develop a more complexity oriented PME practice. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} public sector {{reporting}} is moving from vertical to horizontal accountability: from hierarchical relationships that mediate between public organisations and citizens to directly disclosing available information. IT developments {{play an important}} role in innovative forms of reporting that respond to the growing importance of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability.</b> This paper provides an overview of some of the most important initiatives on the plane of reporting innovations, such as gov. uk and OpenSpending, as well as recent examples in the Netherlands. The examples underline the importance of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> forms, as well as the significance of ‘horizontal integration’: the idea that systems are fully integrated across different functions. However, issues of interoperability, security, and information architecture persist, often pared with the lack of authority to coerce (cross-sectoral) reporting changes. The paper concludes with a discussion of how these initiatives can aid further improvement in public accountability. We argue that the new forms of reporting do not only influence the question how reporting is composed, but that they also affect what is reported and for whom the reporting is compiled...|$|E

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. This collection brings together {{data from the}} Coalitional Presidentialism Project, which ran at the University of Oxford from 2011 - 2015. The dataset contains information on the composition and legislative performance of multiparty coalitions assembled by directly elected minority presidents in nine countries (Armenia, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Kenya, Malawi, Russia, and Ukraine). The dataset also contains data from a survey conducted among 350 members of parliament across the nine countries, as well as transcripts of semi-structured interviews with these same legislators. Project description: The research is motivated by the surprising sustainability of multiparty presidentialism in Africa, Latin America, and postcommunist Europe. Despite predictions to the contrary, presidents have been remarkably successful at winning legislative support from fragmented parliaments. The project aims: (1) to identify the tools that presidents use to govern in concert with multiparty legislatures and (2) to assess {{the effects of these}} tools on <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability</b> in new democracies. Through a comparative analysis of presidential-legislative relations in Armenia, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Ecuador, Kenya, Malawi, Russia and Ukraine, the project examines how strategies of coalition management vary across cases and the impact that this has on the trade-off between policy decisiveness and <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{writing of}} {{contemporary}} history has implications regarding objectivity, subjectivity, {{the idea of}} progress, ecumenical history {{and its relationship to}} world history. Riane Eisler’s dominator and partnership models in her cultural transformation theory provide an appropriate hermeneutical basis for a historical consideration of the concept of partnership in mission (PIM) along with traditional biblical concepts which have guided mission theology for centuries. Partnership in mission is a laudable concept in the furtherance of participation in God’s mission. It has a distinguished history despite the difficulties experienced in making it a functioning reality. It has had the potential to enable sending and receiving churches to experience fellowship, humility and dignity in relationships. However, the issue of power in the ‘older’ sending churches has been an intrusive factor in preventing the theory from becoming a reality. In the case of the Church of Scotland, which stands in the grand ecumenical tradition of the twentieth century, despite great strides being made over the years to develop mutually enriching relations, increasing problems presented the opportunity for partner relationships to become authentically interdependent. Unfortunately, vulnerability {{on the part of the}} Church of Scotland World Mission Council has led to a return to a colonial/dominator approach to partnership. Recent developments in the Church of Scotland indicate that partnership in mission, while still the official model on which mission policy is based, has been challenged in its essence. Attempts to reform the work of the World Mission Council by means of a business consultancy have added no apparent value to the work of the Council or to its worldwide relationships. A lack of flexibility characterises recent developments along with a refusal to examine any other possible models which will enable the maintenance of existing partner church relationships. This has resulted in policy decisions, which affect them deeply, being made without any reference to partner churches. Nor has the Church’s constituency in Scotland been adequately consulted. For the first time in recent history policy decisions of WMC have been the cause of much discussion and deep division within the Church of Scotland. Further, they have ruptured valuable long term relationships and have through differential approaches to partners posed a potential threat to relationships between younger churches and possibly to a diminution of the standing of the Church of Scotland in the ecumenical movement. Opportunities for repentance, self sacrifice and the growth of fellowship in relationships have been spurned to the eventual cost of the Church of Scotland. Authentic partnership in mission is a distinct possibility through the development of relations based on mutuality, where resources must be subject to the norms of <b>accountability,</b> <b>horizontal</b> relations and management of the gifts of God for the people of God.

40|$|En español: La Responsabilidad Social Corporativa es un concepto que define el modelo de gobernanza empresarial basado en la gestión responsable, {{horizontal}} e interactiva, en oposición a los sistemas de control cerrados y férreos. Las tres primeras corporaciones de radiotelevisión pública de la UE en implantar la RSC son British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) del Reino Unido, Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) de Irlanda y Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) de Alemania. Sus estrategias se desarrollan en los ámbitos de gobernanza, condiciones laborales, derechos humanos, aspectos vinculados al consumidor, buenas prácticas en la actividad, {{medio ambiente}} y compromiso con la comunidad. Anualmente las tres corporaciones presentan memorias de resumen y evaluación del de sus acciones de RSC, con el objetivo de informar detalladamente a sus stakeholders, es decir, audiencia, directivos, proveedores, empleados, colaboradores, y comunidades locales e internacionales. El objeto de esta comunicación es analizar cómo las tres corporaciones utilizan la web 2. 0. a través de sus páginas web corporativas con la finalidad de difundir sus acciones de RSC y propiciar la interactividad. Para ello, se identifica el espacio dedicado a RSC, se especifica la categoría en la que es incluida y la importancia que se le otorga en medio del resto de contenidos recogidos en las páginas webs corporativas. In english: Corporate Social Responsibility {{is a concept}} that defines the model of corporate governance based on responsible, <b>horizontal</b> and interactive <b>accountability</b> as opposed to closed and rail control systems. This type of management has been associated, at an initial moment, with private enterprise in the context of globalization, although gradually being implemented in the public, and consequently in the state-owned broadcasting corporations of the European Union. The three first corporations who have introduced CSR in their management are the BBC in the UK, RTÉ in Ireland, and ZDF in Germany. They develop their strategies in the fields of governance, working conditions, human rights, consumer, good practices in the activity, environment and community involvement. Annually these three corporations publish memories to evaluate {{the success or failure of}} their CSR activities, in order to provide detailed information to its stakeholders or interest groups: managers, suppliers, employees, partners, local communities and international communities. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the way in which the three corporations use Web 2. 0 through their corporate websites in order to spread their CSR activities. Thus, detail the peculiarities and possibilities offered by each of the spaces 2. 0 and how it encourages interaction, understood as a pillar of the `social media 'against excessive elite control prevailing in the traditional media. Also, check if the three public broadcasting corporations use Web 2. 0 share CSR as a management philosophy or whether, on the contrary, does not go beyond simple social marketing. To do this, we will identify the spaces dedicated to Corporate Social Responsibility, specify the category in which it is included and the importance given to it in the middle of other content contained in the corporate websites. Overall, we aim to find out if the web 2. 0. is the method of choice for corporations to communicate their CSR activities...|$|R
40|$|Competitive {{elections}} are becoming institutionalized in Africa. But elections have proven an uncertain mechanism for guaranteeing the accountability of political leaders. One {{reason is that}} political accountability has numerous attitudinal, behavioral and institutional requirements, of which popular participation in open elections is only one. Instead, we propose a framework of four elements that together comprise a holistic system of political accountability: (a) demand for vertical accountability; (b) supply of vertical accountability; (c) demand for horizontal accountability; and (d) supply of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability.</b> The article measures each of these elements using data from Afrobarometer Round 5 (2011 – 13). On one hand, {{we find that the}} weakest link in the chain of accountability remains the vertical one between largely passive electors and evasive legislative agents. On the other hand, we find that the African citizens surveyed think that elections strengthen the institutional autonomy of parliament, thus enabling a greater measure of <b>horizontal</b> <b>accountability.</b> But this pattern of accountability begs several lingering concerns. We wonder whether citizens have sufficient information to accurately monitor the relationship between president and parliament under a democratic constitution, and we find that the quality of elections, along with the partisan predispositions of electoral winners, condition the effect of elections on popular perceptions of accountability...|$|E
