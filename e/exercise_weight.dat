25|$|The goal of Sher's NIH {{grant was}} to {{determine}} if improvement in a couple's interpersonal relationship would result in sustained changes in health behavior, improvement in the couple's quality of life, and health benefits specific to the cardiac patient. Working out of labs at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and Rush University Hospital, Sher's team recruited 160 participants (approximately 35% minorities, 30% women) in which one member suffered from a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, bypass graft surgery, angioplasty). Using a short term couples intervention strategy designed to optimize relationships and reduce interpersonal stress, the team focused on three areas of change: <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> management, and compliance with lipid-lowering medication. These areas were targeted because of the difficulty many cardiac patients face in maintaining long-term commitments to change.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To examine {{changes in}} mobility-related self {{efficacy}} following <b>exercise</b> and dietary <b>weight</b> loss interventions in overweight and obese {{older adults with}} knee osteoarthritis (OA), and to determine if self efficacy and pain mediate {{the effects of the}} interventions on mobility task performance. Methods. The Arthritis, Diet, and Activity Promotion Trial was an 18 -month, single-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing the effects of <b>exercise</b> alone, dietary <b>weight</b> loss alone, a combination of <b>exercise</b> plus dietary <b>weight</b> loss, and a healthy lifestyle control intervention in the treatment of 316 overweight or obese older adults with symptomatic knee OA. Participants completed measures of stair-climb time and 6 -minute walk distance, self efficacy for completing each mobility task, and self-reported pain at baseline, 6 months, and 18 months during the trial. Results. Mixed model analyses of covariance of baseline adjusted change in the outcomes demonstrated that the <b>exercise</b> dietary <b>weight</b> loss intervention produced greater improvements in mobility-related self efficacy (P 0. 0035), stair climb (P 0. 0249) and 6 -minute walk performance (P 0. 00031), and pain (P 0. 09) when compared with the healthy lifestyle control intervention. Mediation analyses revealed that self efficacy and pain served as partial mediators of the beneficial effect of <b>exercise</b> dietary <b>weight</b> loss on stair-climb time. Conclusion. <b>Exercise</b> dietary <b>weight</b> loss results in improved mobility-related self efficacy; changes in these task-specific control beliefs and self-reported pain serve as independent partial mediators of the beneficial effect of <b>exercise</b> dietary <b>weight</b> loss on stair-climb performance...|$|R

50|$|A new and {{promising}} indication {{for the use}} of radiofrequency technology has made news in the last few years. Hypertension is a very common condition, with about 1 billion people over the world, nearly 75 million in the US alone. Complications of inadequately controlled hypertension are many and have both individual and global impact. Treatment options include medications, diet, <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> reduction and meditation. Inhibition of the neural impulses that are believed to cause or worsen hypertension has been tried for a few decades. Surgical sympathectomy has helped but not without significant side effects. Therefore, the introduction of non-surgical means of renal denervation with radiofrequency ablation catheter was enthusiastically welcomed. Although, the initial use of radiofrequency-generated heat to ablate nerve endings in the renal arteries to aid in management of 'resistant hypertension' were encouraging, the most recent phase 3 studying looking at catheter-based renal denervation for the treatment of resistant hypertension failed to show any significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to measure attitudes of {{hospital}} employees towards health and healthy behaviors and provide exploratory research that will guide stakeholders in strategically planning a worksite wellness (WW) program at a Catholic hospital. Methods used included a cross-sectional study with census data from a population of employees in a hospital utilizing Prochaska’s Stages of Change to assess their readiness. Participants (N= 705) were also asked to identify 1) meaningful WW incentives, 2) job stressors encountered and 3) if spirituality/religiosity played a role in their health. Using frequency and Chi-square distributions, this census survey revealed a readiness to engage in <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> control and stress management. A higher engagement in positive health behaviors was seen in those who reported spirituality/religiosity, especially when involved in a spiritual/religious community. Major themes suggested that this hospital would benefit from WW incentives that target <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> control and stress management and that allow employees to pursue these health goals in supportive relationships with each other. A unique holistic approach to worksite wellness, incorporating “body”, “mind”, and “spirit ” is discussed and ultimately guided the interpretation and application of the survey data...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionSeveral {{organizations}} representing {{pharmacy and}} other health professions {{stress the importance of}} teaching public health topics as part of training future practitioners. The objective of our study was to assess the number of U. S. pharmacy schools that incorporate lifestyle modification topics into their curricula. MethodsWe developed an electronic survey on lifestyle modification topics and sent it to each of the 89 pharmacy schools in the United States. The survey defined lifestyle modification topics as topics that address nutrition, <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> loss, smoking cessation, and alcohol use. ResultsOf 89 pharmacy schools contacted, 50 (56 %) responded to the survey. Of the 50, four offer at least one required course in a lifestyle modification topic, seven offer at least one elective course, and one offers a required course that incorporates more than one lifestyle modification topic. Five required and nine elective courses were identified from the responses. Nutrition was the most commonly offered required course topic, followed by smoking cessation, <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> loss, and alcohol use. ConclusionFew pharmacy schools are addressing recommendations to promote public health education through formalized didactic courses. More courses on lifestyle modification topics should be offered to pharmacy students, who will be highly accessible to the public as pharmacists and will be able to offer education to enhance public health focused on the prevention of chronic diseases...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. This study {{examined}} the association between self-reported weight change and quality of life, and <b>exercise</b> and <b>weight</b> management behaviors among individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). Methods. In the US SHIELD study, respondents reported whether they had lost or gained weight compared with 1 year earlier and completed the SHIELD-WQ- 9 quality of life questionnaire as well as provided information on their <b>exercise</b> and <b>weight</b> management behaviors in the past 12 months. Results. Sixteen {{percent of the respondents}} reported gaining weight (n = 460), and 30 % reported losing weight (n = 895). More respondents who reported losing <b>weight</b> <b>exercised</b> regularly, limited calorie and fat intake, and increased fiber, fruit, and vegetable intake compared with respondents who reported gaining weight (P < 0. 01).

40|$|Background and Objectives: Today, chronic {{diseases}} such as high blood pressure are increasing; this disease is closely associated with lifestyle. Therefore, {{the current study was}} conducted to assess the effect of lifestyle modifying educational intervention on blood pressure control in patients with hypertension. Materials and Methods: This Quasi-experimental study was conducted on 210 patients with hypertension, referring to health centers of Shabestar County, Iran in 2016. Patients were assigned into two groups of intervention (n = 105) and control (n = 105) using random multi-stage sampling method. The data was collected using standard life style questionnaire (LSQ) in four dimensions of <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> control, nutrition, and mental and spiritual health, before and two months after the educational intervention. Data were analyzed in SPSS- 21 using descriptive and inferential statistics, such as chi-squared, paired t-test and independent t-test. Results: The results showed that the mean scores of <b>exercise,</b> <b>weight</b> control, nutrition and mental health in the intervention group increased significantly after the intervention (P 0. 05). Also, the educational intervention had a significant effect on reducing blood pressure in the intervention group compared with the control group (P< 0. 05). Conclusions: According to the findings of the study, educational intervention is effective in promoting physical activity, improving weight management, nutrition and mental health in patients with hypertension.
