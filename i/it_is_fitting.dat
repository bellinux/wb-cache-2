500|$|The plan {{to rebuild}} the synagogue in its {{original}} 19th-century style received approval by the Israeli government in 2000. Jerusalem architect Nahum Meltzer, who proposed rebuilding the synagogue in its original Ottoman format, was given the commission. Meltzer stated that [...] "both {{out of respect for}} the historical memory of the Jewish people and out of respect for the built-up area of the Old City, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> for us to restore the lost glory and rebuild the Hurva Synagogue the way it was." [...] The state-funded Jewish Quarter Development Corporation under the leadership of Dov Kalmanovich convinced the Israeli government to allocate $6.2million (NIS24m), about 85% of the cost, for the reconstruction, with private donors contributing the remainder. In the end, the government only gave NIS11m, with the remainder being donated by a Ukrainian Jewish businessman and philanthropist, Vadim Rabinovitch.|$|E

500|$|According to critic Martha P. Nochimson, {{the film}} is an {{exploration}} of the place of anonymous breakdowns of social order in personal life. For the most part, questions of justice operate in the background of The Man From London, which foregrounds the perceptions and point of view of an accidental witness to the murder, who, like the viewer, has no connection with anyone involved. The film principally concerns the texture of the world of the protagonist Maloin as he experiences it ﬁrst hand: fog, light, shadow, skin, walls, ﬂoors, windows, sounds. These are much closer to Maloin than any broken laws involving strangers as in the killing at the dock. As distinct from the trope of crime functioning as a break from the boredom of the mundane for the Hitchcockian ordinary man [...] "excitingly" [...] caught up in it, the interjection of crime {{in the lives of the}} characters of The Man from London is a phantom occurrence for those burrowed into the center of the mundane details of their lives. In other words, Tarr's ﬁlm suggests the possibility that it is only on an abstract plane that murder committed by and on strangers causes a stir and demands an investigation. In this context, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> that the investigation must be undertaken by a stranger, the man from London, since abstraction entails distancing from an enveloping context. Only the appearance of the man from London, Brown, impels Maloin to struggle with his de facto alienation, as an ordinary man, from moral principle, an alienation linked, counterintuitively, to the absence of desire in his daily grind.|$|E

The different battlefields and their environments were praised by IGN, with ActionTrip agreeing that [...] "Medieval: Total War looks better than Shogun", adding that the terrain and units are more detailed than those in Shogun: Total War. GameSpot praised the realistic battles, mentioning that the real-world battlefield considerations like fatigue, ammunition, facing, and morale included in the game was a [...] "welcome change". GameSpy also stated the [...] "chaotic" [...] battles were appropriate to the era, but criticised the siege aspect, claiming it to be [...] "too plain and underwhelming", with a lack of detail compared to the other 3D elements. The soundtrack to the game was well received by IGN, [...] "The soundtrack is full of rousing context-sensitive orchestra moments which get you in the mood for bloody slaughter" [...] commenting <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>fitting</b> for a game that [...] "delivers body counts like no other" [...] ActionTrip also admired how the game's music changed pace as the battle commenced, praising The Creative Assembly for its [...] "masterfully placed audio and visual effects". The artificial intelligence for Medieval: Total War was thought to be much improved over its predecessor, CGW mentioning the AI was intelligent enough to prevent brute force alone from winning fights. Criticism was received on the larger battles giving low frame rates and performance, while ActionTrip also noted several unit management issues with path-finding and unit facing, stating [...] "it's demoralising to see archers facing the wrong way".|$|E
