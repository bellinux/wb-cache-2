2500|$|In April 2008, Yon {{published}} his second book, Moment of Truth in Iraq, through Richard Vigilante Books. The book describes how U.S. counterinsurgency methods are creating what Yon {{sees as a}} foundation of success in Iraq. Within two weeks of its release date, Moment of Truth entered into Amazon.com's list of Top 10 bestsellers. Yon was quoted by fellow blogger Glenn Reynolds as saying, [...] "That's just wild. Folks really did want that book after all. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> many people even cared. It's great to know {{that people want to}} really know what's going on." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It was {{scarcely}} worth mentioning. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{it was that}} the only times we have crossed the bridge we met Mr. Grant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've {{just come}} on a visit, you know," [...] said Ozma. [...] "Both Dorothy and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> we should pass the day when we {{happened}} to think we'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the Sawhorse and rode straight here." ...|$|R
6000|$|Speaking aloud, he said: [...] "Miss Moore {{travels the}} trail with all known accessories, and I've {{no doubt she}} thinks she is a grand campaigner; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> she would stand such a trip as that you took last night. I don't believe she could have done as well as I. She's the imitation--you're the real thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{it came to}} pass, {{that this}} {{diminutive}} letter to Mr. Churchill should understand the business of introducing better than the Introduction itself; or why the Bishop did not take it into his head to send the former into the world some months before the latter; {{which would have been}} a greater improvement upon the solemnity of the procession? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will step}} inside?" [...] I asked awkwardly, and while I spoke <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{long it would}} be before the earl's {{excitement}} broke out.|$|E
60|$|While <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> I {{could find}} out the truth, Hans, who was squatted behind a bush, {{suddenly}} rose and gave the rifle he was carrying to the remaining Zulu.|$|E
6000|$|Wilfrid laughed. [...] "It {{will be a}} great {{advantage}} to {{us to be able to}} get our things so close at hand. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> people did in the back settlements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am thinking, doctor--that <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> Herbert Harmer {{came to know}} of {{that secret}} hiding-place. Of course his sisters may have told him of it, but I should doubt if they did. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering</b> if he found it {{described}} in any old family documents, and if so, where they are now. There are no longer any papers in my possession, as at Miss Harmer's request I gave them all up {{a week after the}} funeral to their new solicitor." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{walked with}} him to the Serpentine. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> it <b>was</b> he had grown stout so suddenly. He had a bath towel round him {{underneath}} his coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, [...] "now we {{are getting}} to the point. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{long it would take}} you to see it, Allan, but if you are slow, you are sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, oh, no," [...] replied Peter Rabbit in disgust. [...] "I {{was talking}} to myself, just {{thinking}} out loud. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> many nuts a Jay could steal {{if he had the}} chance." ...|$|E
60|$|But I {{found no}} answer. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> long Ortheris, {{in the bank}} of the river, would hold out, and whether I should be forced to help him to desert, as I had given my word.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have seldom heard pleasanter news," [...] Caretto said; [...] "for just as I {{fell asleep}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{we were to}} rid {{ourselves}} of the corpses of the infidels. By tomorrow the place would have become unbearable; and though, living, the Turks could not turn {{us out of the}} tower, they would when dead speedily have rid the place of us." ...|$|E
60|$|Italian. Ah, that {{explained}} it. <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> Bavaria could have produced this thin-faced creature {{with the big}} dark eyes, the finely modelled nose and chin, and the fleshy lips so royally and sensually curved.|$|R

6000|$|... "I thank you, indeed," [...] Malcolm replied. [...] "It will of {{all things}} be the most pleasant; the doctor has told me that <b>I</b> shall not <b>be</b> fit for duty until the spring, and <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> ever <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> able {{to pass the time}} until then." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before {{you can go}} out on {{the road}} and learn the more {{complicated}} and higher details of the profession," [...] he said, [...] "you will, of course, have to work in the car-house with the men who install and repair the motors. (By this time I was sure that it was his daughter, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> much stock he might own in the company.) ...|$|E
60|$|Twice {{they had}} given up the attempt, only to return after hunting {{diligently}} elsewhere. Good material was scarce that season. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> long their patience would last, when the female suddenly seized the cloth by a corner and flew along close to the ground, dragging it after her, chirping loudly the while. She disappeared into a crab-apple tree {{in a corner of}} the garden, whither the male followed her a moment later.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Kennedy {{greeted me}} cordially {{and told me}} {{significantly}} that she had granted my request. This meant, as my card had already informed me, that I was to take Miss Harvey out. Of course {{there would be no}} introduction since Clark Oliver was already acquainted with the lady. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> I was to locate her when I got a shock that made me dizzy. Jane was over in a corner looking at me.|$|E
5000|$|... “We were in {{the worst}} {{physical}} condition {{we have been in}} the season and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> still <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> some of them stayed in there as well as they did. These boys certainly are fighters and they’ve got plenty of guts. It’s hard to beat that kind of team.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{so much as}} you do," [...] {{answered}} Geoffrey. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{some of the men}} {{earned their}} money. I understand that they have sense enough to be proud of their small beginnings, but they do not furnish instructive details as to the precise manner in which they achieved their success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll scarce turn up here, {{in these}} wilds," [...] Mr. Riddle repeated, [...] "and what <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>wondering,</b> Sarah, <b>is</b> <b>how</b> the devil {{we are to}} live here." ...|$|R
6000|$|MARCHBANKS. Oh, {{that was}} nothing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> much I {{ought to give}} the cabman. I know it's utterly silly; but you don't know how dreadful such things are to me--how I shrink from {{having to deal with}} strange people. (Quickly and reassuringly.) But it's all right. He beamed all over and touched his hat when Morell gave him two shillings. I was on the point of {{offering}} him ten. (Candida laughs heartily. Morell comes back with a few letters and newspapers which have come by the midday post.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{nice and}} {{thoughtful}} {{on the part}} of the cardinal," [...] Hector said, [...] "and, moreover, very seasonable, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> I should pay the retainers at the castle and my four troopers until the rents began to come in. By the time I had paid the usual fees to the servants here, and the expenses of the journey to Poitou and back, I should have been almost penniless, and should have been obliged to borrow from someone on the strength of my coming rents, which would have been a very bad beginning." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> long his hunger would {{battle with}} his caution, when I saw the moss near my bait stir from beneath. A little waving of the moss blossoms, and Tookhees' nose and eyes {{appeared}} {{out of the ground}} for an instant, sniffing in all directions. His little scheme was evident enough now; he was tunneling for the morsel that he dared not take openly. I watched with breathless interest as a faint quiver nearer my bait showed where he was pushing his works. Then the moss stirred cautiously close beside his objective; a hole opened; the morsel tumbled in, and Tookhees was gone with his prize.|$|E
6000|$|... "To speak truth, Dolly," [...] said <b>I,</b> [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> the {{commodore}} <b>is</b> to {{get away}} from the Texel, with half the British navy lying in wait outside." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "My {{very dear}} Clive," [...] Alice wrote. [...] "I am feeling awfully low {{spirited}} dearest since hearing such very terrible news relating to this fearful war. It just feels {{too heavy to}} bear. Whenever will it end and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> you <b>are,</b> my poor dear Clive away over in that wretched place..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{table was}} a long one, and Henry and me sat {{at the end of}} it next the wall. The {{governor}} sat at the other end. Homer P. Mellinger stood at the side of it. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> just <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> Mellinger <b>was</b> going to handle his crowd, when the home talent suddenly opened the services.|$|R
60|$|Upon inquiry I {{found the}} lawyer was but just disbarred for some malpractice, and the {{discovery}} added excessively to my disquiet. Here was a rascal without money or the means of making it, thrust out of the doors of his own trade, publicly shamed, and doubtless in a deuce of a bad temper with the universe. Here, on the other hand, {{was a man with}} a secret--rich, terrified, practically in hiding--who had been willing to pay ten thousand pounds for the bones of the Flying Scud. I slipped insensibly into a mental alliance with the victim. The business weighed on me all day long; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> much the lawyer knew, how much he guessed, and when he would open his attack.|$|E
60|$|When we {{had been}} married {{something}} over two years my wife found herself expecting to become a mother. As the event drew near she expressed great anxiety that I should attend upon her. To this, however, I objected strenuously--first, because I cannot bear to see any one to whom I am attached suffer pain, and, secondly, because I knew that my affection and personal anxiety would certainly unnerve me. Except in cases of the utmost necessity no man, in my opinion, should doctor himself or his family. Whilst <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> to arrange matters I chanced to meet Sir John Bell in consultation. After our business was over, developing an unusual geniality of manner, he proposed to walk a little way with me.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was mere chance; {{the subject}} {{on which we}} had been reading had {{interested}} me. This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown. If he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how {{what they call the}} spirit of the age was tending! Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered king! Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed. How dared they kill him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] he replied, [...] "but I feel uncommonly hungry, and <b>I</b> {{have just}} <b>been</b> <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> {{you manage to}} feed when at sea in so small a craft." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Son, that's made {{me think}} some," [...] replied Belding, with keen eyes fast upon the young man. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kind of <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> you'd take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} <b>I</b> should never <b>be</b> done {{with all the}} {{tiresome}} business which seems to devolve upon kings," [...] he said, laughing. [...] "All the while that <b>I</b> should have <b>been</b> bending my royal intellect to matters of state, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>wondering</b> just <b>how</b> a king might {{find a way to}} see the woman he loves without interruptions from the horde that dogs his footsteps." ...|$|R
