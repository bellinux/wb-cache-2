5|$|A weather {{phenomenon}} known as the föhn (with an identical effect to the chinook wind) can occur at all {{times of the year}} and is characterised by an unexpectedly warm wind, bringing air of very low relative humidity {{to the north of the}} Alps during rainfall periods on the southern face of the Alps. This works both ways across the alps but <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> if blowing from the south due to the steeper step for oncoming wind from the south. Valleys running south to north trigger the best effect.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, the Marine Racecar Board of the National Academy of Science {{conducted}} a survey of industry experts regarding {{the pros and cons}} of double-hull design. Some of the advantages of the double-hull design that were mentioned include ease of ballasting in emergency situations, reduced practice of saltwater ballasting in cargo tanks decreases corrosion, increased environmental protection, cargo discharge is quicker, more complete and easier, tank washing <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient,</b> and better protection in low-impact collisions and grounding.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could {{have played a role}} in respiration as it does in birds.|$|E

2500|$|Power-split hybrids {{have the}} {{benefits}} of a combination of series and parallel characteristics. As a result, they <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> overall, because series hybrids tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> at lower speeds and parallel tend to <b>be</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> at high speeds; however, the cost of power-split hybrid is higher than a pure parallel. Examples of power-split (referred to by some as [...] "series-parallel") hybrid powertrains include current models of Ford, General Motors, Lexus, Nissan, and Toyota.|$|R

5|$|Insects are {{the only}} {{invertebrates}} to have developed active flight capability, and this has {{played an important role}} in their success. Their muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible. Having their muscles attached to their exoskeletons <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> and allows more muscle connections; crustaceans also use the same method, though all spiders use hydraulic pressure to extend their legs, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. Unlike insects, though, most aquatic crustaceans are biomineralized with calcium carbonate extracted from the water.|$|E
5|$|The second chapter, Metamorphosis, {{focuses on}} the {{evolutionary}} origins of humans around 5 million years ago in equatorial Africa. Wade suggests that the last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees lived in forests. Some of them, due to a global climate change between 5 and 10 million years ago, left the shrinking forests and moved to open woodland, and this new ecological niche {{gave rise to the}} human lineage. A change in food availability led to an adaptation for the ability to eat meat, and this nutrition facilitated the evolution of a larger brain. The knuckle-walking of the common ancestor gave way to bipedalism, which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> over longer distances. A larger brain in combination with freed-up hands culminated in the evolution of Homo habilis and the first use of tools around 2.5 million years ago, and the more humanlike and larger brained Homo ergaster about 1.7 million years ago. The adaptations of H.ergaster to hot, dry climates included an external nose to condense air and minimise water loss, and the loss of body hair to allow sweating to cool the body and larger brain. Wade writes that a mutation in the melanocortin receptor gene created an advantageous darkening of the pale, hairless skin. The close descendants of H.ergaster, Homo erectus and Homo heidelbergensis, migrated out of Africa and to Asia (around 1 to 1.66 million years ago) and Europe (around 500,000 years ago), respectively. In Europe, the glacial conditions around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago pressured H.heidelbergensis to evolve into Neanderthals.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{extraction}} is {{the first}} important step in molecular study. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare DNA extraction protocols, PCE and extraction kit for each genetic material sources (blood and feathers). For PCE method, we used three different extraction buffer. This study suggested that PCE method <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> than the extraction kit method. Meanwhile, extraction buffer 2 <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> for extracting feather DNA, while extraction buffer 3 <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>efficient</b> for extracting blood DNA.
