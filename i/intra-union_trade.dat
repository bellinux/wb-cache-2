40|$|This paper {{begins by}} {{systematically}} developing the "static" theory of preferential trade areas (PTAs) and showing that neither a {{large volume of}} initial <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> nor geographical proximity {{can serve as a}} guide to welfare enhancing PTAs. The paper then discusses the modern literature addressing welfare effects of simultaneous division of the world into many PTAs, the impact of the decision to form a PTA on external tariffs and the "dynamic" time-path question of whether PTAs are building blocks or stumbling blocks towards multilateral freeing of trade. A final section discusses key theoretical considerations in the empirical evaluation of PTAs. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of heterogeneity {{in the type of}} downward wage rigidity (nominal or real) for optimal monetary policy in a monetary union with asymmetric wage adjustment costs. Indexation in one region of the union reduces optimal grease inflation in the presence of common productivity shocks. Large common shocks may have sizeable and persistent effects on the <b>intra-union</b> terms of <b>trade,</b> whereby the region characterized by downward real wage rigidity adjusts with a persistent loss of competitiveness. In response to asymmetric productivity shocks, there is no role for grease inflation because relative price changes facilitating the real wage changes dominate the adjustment mechanism.

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} various extensions {{and applications}} of applied general equilibrium modelling techniques. Essay I {{deals with the}} modelling of labour migration and builds on the regional numerical general equilibrium model of Canada developed by Jones and Whalley (forthcoming). Their limited migration decision rule is extended to involve a comparison of relative utility levels across regions. The major implication for model results is that measured migration responses may be dampened under certain policy simulations; this can result in different conclusions being drawn from simulation exercises.;Essay II considers the application of this model {{to the study of}} the Canadian equalization system and its influence on interregional labour migrations in Canada. While authors such as Courchene (1984) have argued that equalization may result in labour allocation inefficiencies in Canada, Boadway and Flatters (1982) have proposed that due to the existence of regionally concentrated resource rents, properly allocated equalization may result in increased efficiency in the allocation of labour in Canada. Simulations are performed to assess the effects of equalization payments and regional resource rents on labour allocation efficiency in Canada. The results suggest that the interactions required by the Boadway and Flatter 2 ̆ 7 s analysis may not exist; equalization may be reducing gains which could arise from the migration incentives of the regional resource rents.;The analysis of Essay III involves numerical simulations using a pure exchange model with three countries and three goods. Non-cooperative strategies are characterized by Nash retaliatory tariffs and customs union formation is analyzed for the case when the union 2 ̆ 7 s external tariffs are strategically set to benefit the union and lump-sum intra-union transfers are not available. The use of non-zero intra-union tariffs as an alternative transfer mechanism is explored. Results presented here suggest that the presence of non-zero intra-union tariffs may reduce the gains which can arise from union formation. More importantly though, these tariffs can alter the strategic options available to the <b>trading</b> nations. Non-zero <b>intra-union</b> tariffs can allow a union to be the optimal strategy for all its members, whereas in the <b>intra-union</b> free <b>trade</b> case the union is an inferior strategy for some...|$|R

The analysis is based on three recent disintegration episodes involving the firmer Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. The results point to a very strong home bias around the time of disintegration, with <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> exceeding nfirmal trade approximately 43 times in the firmer Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, and 24 times in the firmer Yugoslavia.

40|$|Gravity {{models have}} been shown to be fairly {{effective}} in modelling bilateral trading patterns, explaining more than 50 per cent of the variation in trade. This paper examines bilateral trade patterns using a data set provided by Rose and van Wincoop (2001). Rose (2000) has suggested that forming a currency union has a dramatic effect on the volume of <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade.</b> A number of econometric issues are identified with respect to this claim. There is some evidence that Rose's (2000) empirical results are not entirely robust to the sample of countries used, and to the estimation method. In particular, some of the regressors may be endogenous, which casts doubt on the magnitude of the parameter estimates. ...|$|E

Since the <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> liberalization process spanned a seven-year, multi-stage, adhesion period we employ a model with a smooth transition variable to account fully for its impact. An additional model that uses separate sets of dummy variables captures differences in the regression estimates during the transitional and liberalized periods.

40|$|In a {{modified}} version of the Gravity Model, appropriate dummy variables have been introduced to analyze the effects of both trade creation and trade diversion by the three economic organizations of the EEC (European Economic Community), the LAFTA (Latin American Free Trade Association) and the CMEA (Council of Mutual Economic Assistance), for the period 1960 to 1990, with five year intervals the subject of measurement. Using a similar approach, the situation of non-aligned trade by Japan is analyzed, with particular interest in the effects of such activities by these three institutions upon their trade with Japan, and Japanese commerce in general. The subsequent results show that these economic institutions display the effects on the amount of trade which occurs within their respective organizations, or <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade,</b> while at the same time expanding their volume of trade with non-member countries, despite being commercial activity taking place outside their respective unions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Customs unions {{constitute}} {{agreements to}} engage in free <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> and to levy common external tariffs on trade with non-members. Existing theoretical models do not agree on how the common external tariffs are chosen; different, somewhat ad hoc choice rules have been employed. In this paper, a model of customs union formation is developed in which the Pareto principle and the assumption of unanimity are used to construct a mechanism for the choice of common external tariffs. The model is structured as a three-stage game in which union members select common external tariffs that yield utility outcomes that are Pareto optimal and dominate the stand-alone alternative. Numerical examples are use to demonstrate the wide range {{in the nature of}} these outcomes. Our results are discussed in relation to the delegation principle developed by Gatsios and Karp and to modeling approaches reported in the customs unions literature. The paper emphasizes the importance of modeling the formation of the customs union agreement...|$|E
40|$|Two {{seemingly}} unconnected empirical {{results suggest}} an intriguing mechanism. First, economic integration helps harmonize prices internationally, with trade being the primary channel (Rogoff 1996, Goldberg and Knetter 1997). Second, monetary union may greatly {{increase the amount}} of trade among members (Rose 2001). Putting these together, we see that formation of a monetary union may induce changes that help harmonise inflation rates. The effect might be large if the elimination of exchange rate volatility simultaneously leads to a large increase in <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> and a big increase in the speed at which price shocks are transmitted across members' goods markets. This paper investigates part of this mechanism and finds that monetary union may indeed result in faster cross-border transmission of price movements via the import and export price channel which, in turn, would tend to homogenise price movements across the member countries of a monetary union.

40|$|In this paper, I explore {{whether the}} two {{existing}} multilateral currency unions – the CFA franc zone in West and Central Africa and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union – have a measurable effect on intraregional trade. I find that {{membership in a}} currency union indeed tends to promote trade, but the pattern of <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> deviates much less from otherwise similar non-union trade than previous estimates of a large trade-multiplying effect of common currencies suggest. I also explore whether the common currency effect differs across country pairings, and find that economically large countries benefit most strongly from sharing a common currency. (JEL F 15, F 33) Recent empirical {{findings suggest that the}} adoption of a common currency has a large positive effect on bilateral trade. Analyzing trade flows between 186 countries, Andrew K. Rose (2000) estimates that membership in a currency union triples trade; two countries that share a common currency trade about three times as much with each other than two otherwise similar countries using different currencies. In a similar fashion, Reuven Glick and Rose (2002) examine changes in exchange rate regimes and find that bilateral trade approximately doubles/halves as a pair of countries forms/dissolves a currency union...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a simple three-country, multi-commodity trade {{model in which}} two custom union members that have successfully coordinated their external tariff policies {{are in the process}} of deepening the integration of their internal markets through the removal of tariffs on <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade.</b> Union and non-union countries cannot sign binding trade agreements. Owing to repeated interactions, however, they can sustain cooperative outcomes with the use of history-dependent strategies. The goal of this paper is to examine how the deepening of integration affects the set of incentive-compatible tariff agreements these parties can support. We derive conditions under which Kemp-Wan (1976) adjustments in the external tariffs of union members are sustainable and we use these adjustments as a frame of reference to evaluate the actual tariff-setting incentives of trading partners. Our analysis reveals that the deepening of integration may enlarge the set of sustainable tariff agreements with the outside country, and that this possibility crucially depends on the degree of substitutability in consumption. We also investigate the effects of integration on sustainable levels of welfare and extend our analysis to consider the effects of political economy factors.

40|$|Overlapping {{bilateral}} {{free trade}} agreements (FTAs) are proliferating in East Asia. Quite a few economists {{worry about the}} spaghetti bowl phenomenon expected from the proliferating East Asian regional trade agreements (RTAs). The complicated web of hub-and-spoke type of FTAs can result in high costs for verifying rules of origin (RoO). As an alternative policy option to avoid the negative effect of trade deflection, customs unions (CUs) should be examined. Most of the theoretical analyses on the formation of CUs highlight stronger positive welfare effects compared to FTAs. However, {{there is a lack}} of empirical evidence to support the second best theory of customs unions. This paper is an attempt to fill this gap by applying two methodologies, an ex-ante simulation approach and an ex-post econometric approach. In particular, we quantitatively estimate the trade effect of CUs and FTAs by adopting a Gravity regression analysis.

Overall, we find that the ASEAN+ 3 CU with the minimum CET is the most desirable type of RTA for both East Asian member countries and the world economy as a whole. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{central issue}} in this paper is the {{creation}} of an internal market for audit services within the European Union (EU). It provides an analysis of the impact of differences between national auditing regulations on intra-EU trade in audit services. To that end, the paper distinguishes three forms of intra-Union crossborder trade in audit services: (1) cross-border establishment as an auditor; (2) cross-border provision of audit services; and (3) cross-border control of an audit firm. The paper also distinguishes four categories of regulation of auditing: (I) regulation of the qualification as an auditor; (II) regulation of competition between auditors or audit firms; (III) regulation of control of audit firms; and (IV) other regulations. For each of the three forms of <b>intra-Union</b> <b>trade</b> the paper indicates the importance of each of the four categories of regulation as trade barriers. For each of the three forms of trade the current level of intra-EU trade is then discussed. The paper shows that there is little such trade and argues that given the intra-EU auditor regulation differences, audit markets within the EU are still separate markets. This is of course remarkable against the background of the drive towards more market integration in the EU in general. The paper then uses insights from audit market research to suggest which forms of national audit market regulations in EU Member States should be removed to increase intra-EU trade in audit services. The paper identifies existing national regulations of the control of audit firms as the most important barrier. The paper argues that removing these (strict) regulations is the most promising route towards more intra-EU trade in audit services. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{procedures}} for gaining, maintaining, suspending, withdrawing or re-gaining official bovine tuberculosis free herd status and for certification for <b>intra-Union</b> <b>trade</b> {{are based on}} the results of tuberculin skin tests. The skin test has a number of drawbacks, therefore the suitability of the gamma interferon test and other tests to be included by EU legislation was assessed. Suitability means that the test has a sensitivity equivalent or superior to the standard test currently used in the European Union and specificity not lower than that of the standard test with the lowest specificity used in the EU. Furthermore, there should be no foreseeable practical difficulties that could compromise test performance. It was concluded that purified protein derivative based gamma interferon tests can be included amongst the official tests for the purpose of demonstrating freedom. However, some results suggest that the specificity of the purified protein derivative based gamma interferon tests may not always be as high as the single intradermal tuberculin test. In case the test is included, the protocols for its use for this purpose should be harmonised in the EU. Based on the reviewed information, other tests should not yet be considered for inclusion in the official tests for the purpose of granting and retaining official tuberculosis free herd status. Further evaluation of the suitability of the gamma interferon tests test should study the influence of factors such as the presence of environmental mycobacteria, prevalence of bovine tuberculosis in the herd, the age type and bovine tuberculosis test history of the animals all of which may affect test specificity and hence the suitability of the test for demonstrating freedom from bovine tuberculosis in different situations...|$|E

First, economic integration helps harmonize prices internationally, with trade being the primary channel (Rogoff 1996, Goldberg and Knetter 1997). Second, monetary union may greatly {{increase the amount}} of trade among members (Rose 2001). Putting these together, we see that formation of a monetary union may induce changes that help harmonise inflation rates. The effect might be large if the elimination of exchange rate volatility simultaneously leads to a large increase in <b>intra-union</b> <b>trade</b> and a big increase in the speed at which price shocks are transmitted across members ’ goods markets. The problem is that standard estimates of price transmission speed suggest that trade’s price-homogenising effect operates too slowly to matter much. Some new empirical evidence, however, suggests that a reduction in exchange rate variability reduces the variability of international price differences. Moreover, the effect seems to be highly nonlinear, and monetary union seems to have an effect even controlling for exchange rate volatility. This paper is a first attempt to piece together part of this mechanism, namely the impact of monetary union (and exchange rate volatility more generally) on the international transmission of price shocks via the imported/exported inflation channel. In doing this we generate specific testable hypotheses and confront these with a number of data sets on European trade prices. * In September 2002, this paper was presented at the ECB’s Working Group on Econometric Modelling (“Second Pillar Seminar”) and at the European Trade Study Group Annual Conference, Kiel, Germany.
