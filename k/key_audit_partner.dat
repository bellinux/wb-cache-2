40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to examine}} the effect of <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> tenure (PARTEN) on client managers' {{accounting}} discretion. Design/methodology/approach – The authors contend that, when a new <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is from the same audit firm as the outgoing <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> (<b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation), <b>audit</b> quality increases because the new <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> brings “fresh eyes” to the engagement. Findings – The results confirm this conjecture. The authors find that, in the initial years of tenure of a new <b>audit</b> <b>partner,</b> client managers' accounting discretion decreases when the new partner is from the same audit firm as the outgoing partner. However, when the new <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is from a different audit firm as the outgoing <b>partner</b> (<b>audit</b> firm rotation), it is found that client managers' accounting discretion increases in those initial years.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide evidence on the differences in audit quality amongst <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> I attribute these dissimilarities to (i) differences in the audit risk perception and the risk appetite of individual <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> and (ii) to differences in the personal business case of <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> As a result, three <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> archetypes have been identified: liberal, high quality and conservative. This paper will provide evidence that 50 % of the <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> (53 % of the local offices) deliver, on average, an audit quality that is biased towards conservatism or liberalism. Moreover, the results indicate that 51 % of the <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> (49 % of the local offices) deliver a level of audit quality that differs significantly from the audit firm’s average level of <b>audit</b> quality. This <b>partner</b> effect is observed in all large audit firms included in the sample. In addition, the results suggest that the local office of the audit firm has a significant effect on the level of audit quality delivered by the local <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> Nevertheless, even at the local office level, 30 % of the local <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> deliver a significantly different level of audit quality...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} have implemented rules that require an <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> to rotate off the audit {{of a specific}} client after {{a certain period of}} time in the belief that rotation will improve independence and will allow for a fresh look at the audit. The rules are either silent on whether or when a partner can rotate back or else they specify a cooling-off period after which the rotated-off partner can resume the audit. Using archival data from China, a country with a 2 -year cooling-off period, this paper explores the determinants of whether the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotates back or not when the cooling-off period expires, and whether audit quality is weakened by the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation-back practice. We find that the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation-back practice can be explained by factors relating to switching costs, agency conflicts, client desirability, and the <b>audit</b> <b>partner’s</b> capacity constraint considerations. Interestingly, we find that clients suffering greater audit adjustments immediately prior to the expiration of the cooling-off period are more likely to be associated with subsequent <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation-back. Furthermore, we find that rotation-back partners tend to treat former clients more favorably than non-rotation-back cases using modified audit opinions as our proxy for audit quality. Overall, our findings offer preliminary explanations for and shed light on the consequences of rotation-back practice arising from mandatory <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation requirements and lend support to regulatory concerns on rotation-back practice among <b>audit</b> <b>partners...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis is about whether auditing is ‘static and mechanic’ of nature or the opposite: ‘dynamic and organic’. If auditing is considered ‘static and mechanic’ of nature, {{this implies that}} standard audit solutions are available and can uniformly be applied by the <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> Moreover, it suggests {{that the level of}} audit quality can be guaranteed to a large extent by the audit firm’s control and governance structures. In such an environment, audit firm size and the actual audit quality delivered may be highly correlated and form a reliable measure for capital markets to assess audit quality (DeAngelo, 1981 b). However, if auditing is considered to be ‘dynamic and organic’ of nature, this suggests that no standard audit solutions are available, and that the level of audit quality delivered depends on the capabilities, motivation and effort of the individual <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> and their <b>audit</b> teams. In this study, two fundamental questions are examined. First, do differences in audit quality amongst <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> matter? Second, are differences in audit quality influenced by strategic choices of <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> to develop their own business cases? If the answer to both questions is affirmative, the nature of auditing is considered to be ‘dynamic and organic’. The benchmark for audit quality is in this study the level of usefulness of audited financial statements for economic decision-making. To ascertain the external validity of the results, the empirical research is performed on a dataset of 378 Dutch municipalities (period 1999 - 2005) and 743 European listed companies (period 1997 - 2005). The results presented below are consistent for both datasets. The answer to the first question is found by examining whether large audit firms – which are assumed to be a uniform group of high quality auditors– deliver a homogenous level of audit quality. The results show that statistically significant audit quality differences are observed amongst the large audit firms. These results imply that audit firm size is not a very reliable proxy for audit quality. To examine whether these differences in audit quality amongst large audit firms is due to differences in internal control and governance, I tested the degree of homogeneity of audit quality within large audit firms. The results suggest that 23 % (Dutch municipalities) to 49 % (European listed companies) of the <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> deliver a level of audit quality which is of statistically significant difference compared to the audit firm’s average level of audit quality. These results do not support the assumption that large audit firms are very successful in governing their audit quality. On the contrary, I conclude that the average level of audit quality delivered by an audit firm is the bottom-up aggregation of audit quality delivered by individual <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> The second question deals with whether the <b>audit</b> <b>partner’s</b> business case affects the level of audit quality delivered. <b>Audit</b> <b>partners</b> are expected to develop an <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> business case in order to survive the highly competitive audit markets, and to meet the audit firm’s profit and revenue targets. I assume three principal <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> business cases, resulting in three <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> archetypes, namely the liberal, conservative and the high quality <b>audit</b> <b>partner.</b> The liberal <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is expected to specialize in the auditing of financial statements with a relatively high risk profile and charges the highest audit fees {{in order to reduce the}} audit risk to an acceptable low level. Second, the high quality <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is expected to specialize in high quality audits that maximize the usefulness of financial statements. High quality <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> are expected to charge relatively high audit fees in order to guarantee the high level of audit quality delivered. The third <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> archetype is the conservative <b>audit</b> <b>partner,</b> who is expected to specialize in low budget auditing which can be achieved by minimizing risks in the financial statements in order to reduce the audit risk. Hence the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> is able to reduce audit effort and charge relatively low audit fees. However, I suppose that the extent of achieving the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> business case –and the corresponding extent of commercial success– depends on the <b>audit</b> <b>partner’s</b> technical and communication capabilities. The existence of the three <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> archetypes and the corresponding business cases is supported by empirical evidence. Therefore, I conclude that the level of audit quality is systematically affected by the business case of an <b>audit</b> <b>partner.</b> Based on these results, I conclude that the nature of auditing is primarily ‘dynamic and organic’, indifferent to variables such as country, audit firm or the applied setting of Dutch municipalities and European listed companies. This study shows that the very nature of auditing is primarily dictated by ‘humaneness’; human capabilities and human behavior...|$|R

40|$|A {{key part}} of the auditor {{independence}} reforms in Australia, as represented by Corporate Law Economic Reform Program (Audit Reform and Corporate Disclosure) Act 2004 (Cth) (CLERP 9), mandates <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation. The change was criticised predominantly due to the costs imposed on both the audit firms and the audit clients. This study examines the Australian experience post-CLERP 9 with mandated auditor rotation. Based on data of <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation over 2003 – 2009 (on average 1200 listed Australian companies over the sample period), we show that <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> tenure sat at a median of 2 – 3 years, but that the maximum <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> tenure was as high as 20 years in the pre-CLERP 9 period.

Further, our results also show that the market penalizes client firms susceptible to aggressive <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> reporting decisions. In particular, we find that our proxies for aggressive audit reporting are related to higher interest rates, worse credit ratings and less favorable forecasts of insolvency for private client companies, and a lower Tobin's Q for publicly listed client companies.

Using tax and financial data for individual <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> and clients, our empirical findings indicate that there is significant variation in the implicit determinants {{that are associated with}} compensation across the Big 4. We find that audit partners’ compensation is positively associated with the size of their clientele or the number of publicly traded clients, both of which represent revenue-generating opportunities. Similarly, compensation and developing an industry specialization are positively related. In three firms, gaining clients is clearly related to an increase in compensation, while losing a client is associated with a reduction in partner income in only one firm. We find that <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> income is more sensitive to performance-related incentives, such as attracting new clients, as partners progress in their career. Finally, we find evidence that audit failures, proxied by reporting errors related to issuing a going concern opinion, are associated with lower compensation.

40|$|Auditor-Client {{negotiation}} about difficult client {{accounting issues}} involves the auditor, the client, {{and various other}} parties on both the client and auditor side. On the auditor side, the Professional Practice Department {{has been reported to}} {{play a significant role in}} the financial reporting process, yet is rarely the focus of academic study. In this study, I investigate how communicating the involvement of the Professional Practice Department (PPD) to top management using different influence techniques impacts negotiated outcomes between <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> and top management. I examine the impact of communicating the involvement of the PPD in the context of two other variables found in prior auditing literature to be important in the negotiation process, auditor type and CFO (Chief Financial Officer) preferred auditor-type. While auditors must attest that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, they also must ensure they foster a functional working relationship with the client. The auditor-client context is unique, and takes place within an on-going relationship where expectations and preferences have been established. Therefore, I examine these negotiation outcomes while incorporating a key contextual variable, auditor-type, in the negotiations. Both the CFO's preference for auditor-type, as well as actual auditor-type will be examined in addition to the specific influence tactic. I use a 3 x 2 x 2 fully factorial design to experimentally analyze the impact of two manipulated variable (influence tactic and auditor-type) and one measured variable (CFO preference for auditor-type) on two dependent variables. The two dependent variables are the CFO's willingness to post an adjustment to the financial statements and the CFO's satisfaction with the <b>audit</b> <b>partner.</b> I report the results of an audit negotiation experiment in which 154 highly experienced CFOs responded to a case scenario that incorporated or measured the three key variables (influence tactic communicating PPD involvement, auditor-type and CFO preference for auditor type). My results indicate that using the most aggressive influence tactic to communicate the Professional Practice Department's involvement had a mixed effect on the CFOs willingness to post adjustments to the financial statements. The CFOs in this influence condition that were paired with an accommodating auditor-type reported a higher willingness to adjust the financial statements while CFOs paired with a proactive and advising auditor-type reported a lower willingness to post adjustments. All CFOs reported less satisfaction with the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> when the most aggressive influence tactic was used to communicate the Professional Practice Department's inyolvement. Furthermore, the CFO's preference for an auditor-type significantly affects negotiation outcomes. CFOs that prefer more proactive and advising <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> are more likely to post adjustments to the financial statements, regardless of whether or not. they are informed of the Professional Practice Department's involvement. These same CFOs report a high level of satisfaction with the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> and their satisfaction is not impacted by the type of <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> they are paired with. CFOs that prefer more reactive and accommodating <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> are less willing to adjust the financial statements and report less satisfaction (dissatisfaction), when paired with proactive and advising <b>audit</b> <b>partners.</b> These results highlight the importance of the existing relationship within the auditor-client dyads and help support findings from auditor-client negotiation research which show that prevailing expectations of the CFO are a contextually important feature of audit negotiation and should be incorporated into more research. I also show that aggressive tactics can help persuade some CFOs to adjust the financial statements; however, consistently pushing too aggressively results in reduced cooperation. Furthermore, there are large costs in terms of the CFO's satisfaction with the <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> in using aggressive tactics, and therefore, practically speaking the tactic that could potentially be the most effective may result in a lost client...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{we argue}} that an {{increased}} economic bonding may develop between an <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> and the clients when the auditor switches to a new audit firm because the auditor’s incremental payoff expected from switching to the new firm (e. g., promotion, larger share of firm profits, more perks, and more authority and peer respect) is often enhanced {{by the number of}} clients he can bring to the new firm. The auditor and the client can use audit quality as a bargaining tool to divide the incremental payoff generated from the joint auditor-client switch. We thus hypothesize that the turnover <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> treat follower clients more favorably (by making less downward audit adjustments to pre-audit earnings or allowing greater discretionary accruals) than they treat other clients around the joint auditor-client switches. Using the data in China where engagement-specific <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> information is available, we find evidence that supports our hypothesis under the condition that both of the signing auditors for the follower client switch to the same successor firm (or come from the same predecessor firm). Our partner-level evidence is consistent with the widespread concern that audit quality is lower when there is a greater level of auditor-client economic bonding. postprintAnnual Meeting of the American Accounting Association (AAA) and Conference on Teaching and Learning in Accounting, New York, N.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of <b>audit</b> firm versus <b>partner</b> {{rotation}} on non-professional investors' independence-related perceptions, extending prior research on auditor rotation and independence in fact. Arguments for mandatory audit firm rotation continue to be made by regulators and investor groups based, in part, on the idea that firm rotation will incrementally strengthen independence in appearance relative to <b>audit</b> <b>partner</b> rotation. We report the results of two experiments. The first examines 5 -year <b>audit</b> firm versus <b>partner</b> rotation under relatively weak or strong audit committees. We find no statistically significant difference in beliefs about how much of an income reducing audit difference management will record, or in beliefs about auditor independence, between the two auditor rotation conditions. On the other hand, we find that non-professional investors do believe more of the audit difference will be recorded, and the auditors will be more independent, under a strong audit committee than a relatively weak audit committee. The second experiment provides further evidence on <b>audit</b> firm versus <b>partner</b> rotation by examining a setting involving a 26 -year audit firm-client relationship. Again, no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} auditor rotation conditions were found.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops {{and tests}} {{a model of}} the client acceptance decision that involves two phases: a diagnostic reasoning/risk evaluation phase and an adversarial problem solving/strategic risk adaptation phase. The model proposes causal linkages between the two phases such that changes in the risk evaluation phase are linked to changes in strategic risk adaptation behavior, which then affects the client acceptance decision outcome. Structural equation modeling is used to statistically estimate the proposed client acceptance model. ^ There are three main findings. First, <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of various client acceptance risks impact each other during the diagnostic process of risk evaluation. Second, <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> use adversarial problem solving when making the client acceptance decision since they link their mental model of the client developed during the diagnostic phase to their suggestions for strategic risk adaptation behavior. Third, strategic risk adaptation behavior is not used to moderate the inverse relationship between client acceptance risks and the client acceptance decision as expected. Instead, <b>audit</b> <b>partners</b> distinguish between two client acceptance sub-tasks: deciding whether to accept the client and determining the terms of the client acceptance proposal that would make accepting the client reasonable. ^ There are two primary contributions of this dissertation. First, the client acceptance model illustrates both the structure of the relationship between risk evaluation and strategic risk adaptation behavior (e. g., audit fee, audit evidence, personnel expertise allocation, amount of information collected during the client acceptance process) and also provides a cognitive characterization of that relationship.
