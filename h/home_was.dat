40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if selected students whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> called, using a computer-assisted telecommunications device, on days when they were not in school would show an expected difference in school attendance, compared with selected students whose <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> not called.
