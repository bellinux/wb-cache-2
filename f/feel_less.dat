5|$|Survival horror is a subgenre {{of video}} games {{inspired}} by horror fiction {{that focuses on}} survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience. Although combat {{can be part of}} the gameplay, the player is made to <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition, health, speed and vision, or through various obstructions of the player's interaction with the game mechanics. The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game. Games make use of strong horror themes, like dark maze-like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies.|$|E
5|$|To Ann's surprise, Chris (Rob Lowe) {{has also}} been {{admitted}} to the hospital with the flu. The two have been dating and, although Ann really likes Chris, she fears he is too perfect. However, because the extremely health-conscious Chris has a poor immune system and nearly no body fat, he suffers a complete physical breakdown, which makes Ann <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> intimidated about dating him. Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which have agreed to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess of flu medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben. She is immediately brought back to the hospital, where Ben tells her 110 businesses have agreed to help with the festival, surpassing the minimum 80 needed.|$|E

25|$|Antidepressants {{can cause}} {{emotional}} blunting, or numbness. This is {{a reduction in}} extremes of emotion, both positive and negative. While the patient may <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> depressed, they may also <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> happiness or empathy in some situations. This may be cause for a dose reduction or medication change. The exact mechanism is unknown.|$|E
25|$|People <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> anxious when {{close to}} their {{attachments}} because their attachments can provide support during difficult situations. Support includes the comfort, assistance, and information people receive from their attachments.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{interest}} in international mobility, there is little permanency in the nursing positions in the Philippines. Most RNs choose to sign short-term contracts that will allow for more flexibility to work overseas. Filipino nurses <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> committed to the hospitals as they are temporary staff members. This lack of attachment and minimal responsibility worsens the health of Filipino patients.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{students}} believe that PBL increases the educational effect of self study and their clinical inference ability, and although studies are conflicting, one showed that UK PRHO graduates {{believed that they were}} better at dealing with uncertainty and knowing their personal limits. Students <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> detached from clinical medicine through PBL and thus this may increase their enthusiasm for learning.|$|E

25|$|The {{effect of}} ground {{elevation}} {{depends on the}} density of the ground (see Slab correction section). A person flying at 30 000ft above sea level over mountains will feel more gravity than someone at the same elevation but over the sea.

25|$|Counselors serving ACOAs {{can also}} help by working on {{building}} coping mechanisms such as creating meaningful relationships with other non-alcoholic family members. Having other family members who are supportive can help the ACOA feel like they are not alone.

Research shows that ACOAs <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> like blaming their parents for their alcoholism after learning that alcoholism is a disease, rather than a behavior.|$|E
25|$|Even though humans derive many {{benefits}} from nature, our modern lifestyles {{have created a}} disconnect from the natural environment wherein we spend significantly more time indoors. Some researchers estimate that humans spend up to 90% of their lives indoors. This disconnection from nature can {{have a negative impact}} on humans because we are missing out on the beneficial effects of nature. As a result, we are less connected to nature and <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> responsibility to protect this environment.|$|E

The project aims to help schools engage better with bullying and child suicide.|$|E

25|$|Minimize free riding: Free riding {{occurs when}} members do less work {{because some of}} the {{benefits}} accrue to others. As others contribute ideas, individuals may <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> motivated to work hard themselves. They see their own contributions as less necessary or less likely to have much impact. To eliminate these effects, it is important to make group members feel that their contributions are essential for the group’s success. Additionally, it is less likely for someone to free-ride if they are in a small group.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-20th century, {{the rise}} of {{phenomenology}} and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem. Self-esteem then took {{a central role in}} personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders. Psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of a person with high self-esteem as useful to the field. This led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem, including the reasons why people tend to <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves.|$|E
25|$|Including fish as {{a regular}} part of a {{balanced}} diet has been shown to help the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis – a painful condition that causes joints to swell up, reducing strength and mobility. Studies also show that sufferers <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> stiff and sore in the morning if they keep their fish oil intake topped up. Recent research has also found a link between omega-3 fats and a slowing down in the wearing of cartilage that leads to osteoarthritis, opening the door for more research into whether eating more fish could help prevent the disease.|$|E

25|$|After {{researchers}} provoked {{volunteers to}} disbelieve in free will, participants lied, cheated, and stole more. Kathleen Vohs {{has found that}} those whose belief in free will had been eroded {{were more likely to}} cheat. In a study conducted by Roy Baumeister, after participants read an article arguing against free will, {{they were more likely to}} lie about their performance on a test where they would be rewarded with cash. Provoking a rejection of free will has also been associated with increased aggression and less helpful behaviour as well as mindless conformity. Disbelief in free will can even cause people to <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> guilt about transgressions against others.|$|E
25|$|Even when undocumented {{individuals}} are employed, their positions are often precarious. Approximately 40% of immigrant workers in low-wage jobs are undocumented. A lack of formal documentation means {{that many of}} these individuals must find work in the informal economy where {{there is a lack of}} protection for worker rights. Undocumented workers may have difficulty obtaining justice in cases of mistreatment since employers can easily threaten them with deportation. This leaves these immigrant workers vulnerable to exploitation. Exploitation may take many forms, one of these being wage theft. While there are regulations to protect the rights of workers, such as laws that cover private domestic work, these policies are often underutilized since workers may be unaware of their existence. Individuals who lack formal documentation may also <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> empowered to seek legal recourse because of fear of having their undocumented status made known.|$|E
25|$|The album's main {{recording}} sessions {{began in}} September 2012, and lasted for approximately four months. The band decided to record songs at Yamaguchi's home studio, {{as the group}} had grown tired of having to return to recording studios often due to their repeated commercial tie-up offers. They originally intended to re-record some parts of songs at a large recording studio, but instead used the home-recorded takes. The band felt that recording at Yamaguchi's home had a different atmosphere, as the location did not come with the pressure of time limits and recording staff, which made these sessions <b>feel</b> <b>less</b> like work. For the Sakanaction album sessions, the band found that they felt free to record any music that they wanted to, and that the location allowed for the band to develop a different sound, as this was the space where Yamaguchi usually listened to music. Yamaguchi described these home sessions as feeling like an after school club, how everyone worked together {{in front of a}} computer. In addition to the main recording session, additional recordings were held at Alive Recording Studio in Setagaya and Aobadai Studio in Aobadai, Meguro.|$|E
