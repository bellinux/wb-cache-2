50|$|A {{collision}} cascade (also {{known as}} a displacement cascade or a <b>displacement</b> <b>spike)</b> {{is a set of}} nearby adjacent energetic (much higher than ordinary thermal energies) collisions of atoms induced by an energetic particle in a solid or liquid.|$|E
50|$|Based {{on these}} theories, {{there should be}} two {{different}} regions, each retaining a different form of damage, along {{the path of a}} PKA. A thermal spike should occur in the earlier part of the path, and this high-energy region retains vacancy-interstitial pairs. There should be a <b>displacement</b> <b>spike</b> {{towards the end of the}} path, a low-energy region where atoms have been moved to new lattice sites but no vacancy-interstitial pairs are retained.|$|E
50|$|A {{different}} model {{called the}} <b>displacement</b> <b>spike</b> was proposed for fast neutron bombardment of heavy elements. With high energy PKAs, the region affected is heated to temperatures above the material’s melting point, {{and instead of}} considering individual collisions, the entire volume affected could be considered to “melt” {{for a short period}} of time. The words “melt” and “liquid” are used loosely here because it is not clear whether the material at such high temperatures and pressures would be a liquid or a dense gas. Upon melting, former interstitials and vacancies become “density fluctuations,” since the surrounding lattice points no longer exist in liquid. In the case of a thermal spike, the temperature is not high enough to maintain the liquid state long enough for density fluctuations to relax and interatomic exchange to occur. A rapid “quenching” effect results in vacancy-interstitial pairs that persist throughout melting and resolidification. Towards the end of the path of a PKA, the rate of energy loss becomes high enough to heat up the material well above its melting point. While the material is melted, atomic interchange occurs as a result of random motion of the atoms initiated by the relaxation of local strains from the density fluctuations. This releases stored energy from these strains that raises the temperature even higher, maintaining the liquid state briefly after most of the density fluctuations disappear. During this time, the turbulent motions continue so that upon resolidification, most of the atoms will occupy new lattice sites. Such regions are called displacement spikes, which, unlike thermal spikes, do not retain Frenkel defects.|$|E
40|$|Mössbauer spectroscopy, {{supplemented}} by resistivity measurements, {{was used to}} follow the effects of thermal aging and fast neutron irradiation on precipitation processes in a Cu- 0. 6 at % Fe alloy. The characterization of spectra of solution annealed and aged alloy samples provides background for interpretation of the complex effects occurring in irradiated alloys. Both irradiation-induced aging and dissolution effects were observed {{as a function of}} pre-irradiation heat treatment. In as-quenched alloys, fast neutrons cause the formation of very small Fe clusters (< 12 atoms). In aged alloys, fast neutron induced <b>displacement</b> <b>spikes</b> disperse Fe atoms existing in clusters and precipitates. The dissolution effect is dependent upon the stage of aging or initial Fe cluster size...|$|R
50|$|The {{infrastructure}} {{of natural gas}} development includes wells, pipelines, roads, and other components that damage wildlife through direct habitat loss, deterioration of habitat and <b>displacement.</b> Population <b>spikes</b> associated with industry growth result in urban sprawl, as demand for living space increases, further reducing habitat available to wildlife. Additionally, road and pipeline construction divide habitat, resulting in greater automobile related fatalities.|$|R
40|$|In {{radiation}} damage cascade <b>displacement</b> <b>spikes</b> ions and electrons can reach very high temperatures and {{be out of}} thermal equilibrium. Correct modelling of cascades with molecular dynamics should allow for the non-adiabatic exchange of energy between ions and electrons using a consistent model for the electronic stopping, electronic temperature rise, and thermal conduction by the electrons. We present a scheme for correcting embedded atom potentials for these non-adiabatic properties {{at the level of}} the second-moment approximation, and parameterize for the bcc transition metals above the Debye temperature. We use here the Finnis-Sinclair and Derlet-Nguyen-Manh-Dudarev potentials as models for the bonding, but the corrections derived from them can be applied to any suitable empirical potential.

40|$|Electron {{microscopic}} {{observations are}} carried out on the secondary defects produced in germanium by fission fragment irradiation and successive annealing. Small spots observed in as-irradiated specimens {{are considered to be}} <b>displacement</b> <b>spike</b> regions produced by primary knock-ons with energies larger than several lOKeV. These defects are found to grow by the annealing at above 300 °C at the expense of smaller defects. From the analysis of fringe patterns appearing on these grown defect regions it is found that these large defect regions are vacancy rich zones and the lattices are contracted by about 3 % within these regions.

40|$|Here, {{we report}} orbital-free density-functional theory (OF DFT) {{molecular}} dynamics simulations of the displacement cascade in aluminum. The electronic effect is our main concern. The displacement threshold energies are calculated using OF DFT and classical molecular dynamics (MD) and the comparison reveals {{the role of}} charge bridge. Compared to MD simulation, the <b>displacement</b> <b>spike</b> from OF DFT has a lower peak and shorter duration time, which is attributed {{to the effect of}} electronic damping. The charge density profiles clearly display the existence of depleted zones, vacancy and interstitial clusters. And it is found that the energy exchanges between ions and electrons are mainly contributed by the kinetic energies. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|For {{nearly two}} decades, {{deviations}} between experimental {{data and the}} nonionizing energy loss (NIEL) have been observed for GaAs devices. In particular, previous data has suggested that electrical parameters associated with GaAs solar cells can follow different energy dependences with NIEL but only at the higher proton energies. In this paper, displacement damage-induced electrical and structural effects in GaAs solar cells were monitored before and after irradiation with various ions. The radiation-induced defects responsible for causing electrical changes were characterized using illuminated current-voltage, deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and electron beam induced current (EBIC) while the structural changes were monitored using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The EBIC images showed the existence of radiation-induced active recombination volumes or defect clusters after irradiation with high energy protons (E ≥ 10 MeV) and 22 MeV silicon ions, which were not produced by lower energy protons. The TEM images revealed strain related defects that correspond to the same irradiation conditions for which the defect clusters were observed, and therefore, the defects in the TEM images are associated with those observed in the EBIC images. These defects were not observed prior to irradiation so the lattice strain in the material is definitely associated with irradiation-induced lattice defects. HRTEM imaging {{has shown that the}} disordered regions are not amorphous but probably most likely a cluster of vacancies and a surrounding region rich in interstitials, which is produced when a large number of neighboring atoms are displaced in collision cascades known as the <b>displacement</b> <b>spike.</b> The formation of the U-band defect as determined by DLTS seems to evolve under the same irradiation conditions as the defects in the images. This very broad U-band peak is consistent with what would be expected from defect clusters. From analyses of the recoil spectra, high energy recoils appear to be responsible for the formation of these disordered regions and these regions are independent of the total displacement damage energy deposited. This study has shown that NIEL scaling is only violated for incident ion energies when the defect clusters are observed...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{observation}} of the transition from an ordered solid-like phase to a disordered liquid-like phase of a lattice of spikes on a ferrofluid surface submitted to horizontal sinusoidal vibrations. The melting transition occurs for a critical <b>spike</b> <b>displacement</b> which is experimentally found to follow the Lindemann criterion, for two different lattice topologies (hexagonal and square) and {{over a wide range}} of lattice wavelengths. An intermediate hexatic-like phase between the solid and isotropic liquid phases is also observed and characterized by standard correlation functions. This dissipative out-of-equilibrium system exhibits strong similarities with 2 D melting in solid-state physics. Comment: to be published in Phys. Rev. Let...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new technique for measurements of piconewton forces and nanometer displacements in the millisecond time range caused by actin-myosin interaction in vitro by manipulating single actin filaments with a glass microneedle. Here, we describe in full {{the details of this}} method. Using this method, the elementary events in energy transduction by the actomyosin motor, driven by ATP hydrolysis, were directly recorded from multiple and single molecules. We found that not only the velocity but also the force greatly depended on the orientations of myosin relative to the actin filament axis. Therefore, to avoid the effects of random orientation of myosin and association of myosin with an artificial substrate in the surface motility assay, we measured forces and displacements by myosin molecules correctly oriented in single synthetic myosin rod cofilaments. At a high myosin-to-rod ratio, large force fluctuations were observed when the actin filament interacted in the correct orientation with a cofilament. The noise analysis of the force fluctuations caused by a small number of heads showed that the myosin head generated a force of 5. 9 +/- 0. 8 pN at peak and 2. 1 +/- 0. 4 pN on average over the whole ATPase cycle. The rate constants for transitions into (k+) and out of (k-) the force generation state and the duty ratio were 12 +/- 2 s- 1, and 22 +/- 4 s- 1, and 0. 36 +/- 0. 07, respectively. The stiffness was 0. 14 pN nm- 1 head- 1 for slow length change (100 Hz), which would be approximately 0. 28 pN nm- 1 head- 1 for rapid length change or in rigor. At a very low myosin-to-rod ratio, distinct actomyosin attachment, force generation (the power stroke), and detachment events were directly detected. At high load, one power stroke generated a force spike with a peak value of 5 - 6 pN and a duration of 50 ms (k(-) - 1), which were compatible with those of individual myosin heads deduced from the force fluctuations. As the load was reduced, the force of the power stroke decreased and the needle displacement increased. At near zero load, the mean size of single <b>displacement</b> <b>spikes,</b> i. e., the unitary steps caused by correctly oriented myosin, which were corrected for the stiffness of the needle-to-myosin linkage and the randomizing effect by the thermal vibration of the needle, was approximately 20 nm...|$|R
40|$|Cholinergic neurons in the basal forebrain, which {{innervate}} all cortical regions [I], modulate neuronal excitability [2, 31 {{and influence}} learning and memory [4, 5, 61. Cholinergic reduction of spike freqiiency adaptation in cortical neurons {{in response to}} a square pulse input is considered an important mechanism for cholinergic control of neuronal excitability [2, 3, 71, the generation of theta rhythms [8, 91, and cholinergic modulation of higher level functions [lo, 111. We used whole cell patch clamp recordings in neocortical slices and computational simulations to show that, in contrast to the strong spike frequency adaptation observed with square pulse inputs, spike frequency adaptation was reduced or absent with fluctuating inputs that resemble in vivo conditions [I,!?]. Furthermore, unlike modulation of responses to square pulse inputs, <b>displacement</b> of <b>spike</b> times in response to fluctuating inputs following cholinergic modulation was less than three milliseconds, comparable to the spike jitter observed during visual stimulation under in vivo conditions [13]. These results suggest that cholinergic modulation is compatible with a neural code based on precise spike timing [la, 15, 161 but not a spike interval code, and that cholinergic mechanisms other than those involvin...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} effect of defects on the {{polarization}} stability and switching of epitaxial nanocapacitor ferroelectric films on tensile substrates using a thermodynamic approach. Defects are either frozen-in dipoles of the p-type or trapped space charges. The retention of the in-plane ferroelectric polarization does not suffer nearly at all from the possible presence of dead layers or polar defects but is dramatically impacted by relatively high densities of space charge. Switching is a strong function of defects {{as well as the}} presence of a bottom electrode. The out-of-plane dielectric <b>displacement</b> exhibits a <b>spike</b> during switching of the in-plane polarization in films with bottom electrodes but nearly disappears otherwise. Such an effect during polarization reorientation along the film plane could be tailored as a sensing signal. The hysteresis and domain characteristics as a function of interface conditions and defects are discussed for BaTiO(3) strained on tensile substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} fishes to detect water flow with the neuromasts of their lateral line system {{depends on the}} {{physiology}} of afferent neurons {{as well as the}} hydrodynamic environment. Using larval zebrafish (Danio rerio), we measured the basic response properties of primary afferent neurons to mechanical deflections of individual superficial neuromasts. We used two types of stimulation protocols. First, we used sine wave stimulation to characterize the response properties of the afferent neurons. The average frequency-response curve was flat across stimulation frequencies between 0 and 100 Hz, matching the filtering properties of a <b>displacement</b> detector. <b>Spike</b> rate increased asymptotically with frequency, and phase locking was maximal between 10 and 60 Hz. Second, we used pulse train stimulation to analyze the maximum spike rate capabilities. We found that afferent neurons could generate up to 80 spikes/s and could follow a pulse train stimulation rate of up to 40 pulses/s in a reliable and precise manner. Both sine wave and pulse stimulation protocols indicate that an afferent neuron can maintain their evoked activity for longer durations at low stimulation frequencies than at high frequencies. We found one type of afferent neuron based on spontaneous activity patterns and discovered a correlation between the level of spontaneous and evoked activity. Overall, our results establish the baseline response properties of lateral line primary afferent neurons in larval zebrafish, which is a crucial step in understanding how vertebrate mechanoreceptive systems sense and subsequently process information from the environmentPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of small helium bubbles in thin gold and aluminum foils has been followed during irradiation with high energy heavy ions (400 keV Ar+ and 200 keV Xe+) using in-situ transmission electron microscopy. Substrate materials were chosen {{in order that}} the heavy ion irradiation would produce dilute (aluminum) and dense (gold) collision cascades. Significant differences in bubble behaviour are observed in the two cases, the major effect of dilute cascades being bubble shrinkage due to helium resolution by direct displacement of the gas out of the bubbles. Effects observed for dense cascades, however, include the disappearance and Brownian motion of bubbles under irradiation. The paper will present recent experimental results as well as simple numerical modelling of the observed behaviour. In particular, our interpretation of the dense cascade effects {{is consistent with the}} type of <b>displacement</b> and thermal <b>spike</b> processes that recent molecular dynamics simulations have indicated may be important in radiation damage in metals...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{recordings}} from neurones {{are generally}} dificult to quantify. Spike patterns and membrane potential cycles are often compared qualitatively and are hence limited by human resolution and judgement. This paper describes a statistical method for quantifying individual spike patterns and membrane potential fluctuations in oscillating systems, allowing quantification of successive 'individual' bursts. The neuronal {{activities of the}} network can therefore be subject to more extensive analyses and comparisons. Principal-component {{analysis was used to}} extract the principal components from a sequence of bursts recorded in vitro from the crayfish (Pacifasticus leniusculus) swimmeret. The principal component coefficients were correlated with intuitive biological concepts such as burst <b>displacement,</b> number of <b>spikes</b> in a burst, and burst width. The bursting of both interneurones and motor neurones were found to be modulated by some unidentified oscillator that displaced the bursts in time. The amplitude of the time displacements was significant i. e. the order of the bursting period (1. 5 s), and the period of the oscillations was approximately 200 bursts. The strength of the method is that this feature was detected without any prior suspicion of its existence...|$|R
40|$|Ion {{implantation}} {{of metals}} {{has been used}} routinely for more than 30 years. In this period {{a great amount of}} information has been collected on the physical processes involved in ion implantation in solids, in which connected topics such as stopping power, radiation damage, sputtering, ion mixing, defects, diffusion are studied. Many models, like the spike model, have been developed to explain these processes, and detailed calculations have been made, for instance, using molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo techniques. In spite of the copious knowledge that has accumulated, new effects are still being observed, partly due to increasing the energy regime, but also to the availability of new more sensitive experimental techniques. Recent results of the formation of a new phase in titanium and the alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V when they are bombarded with different MeV energy ions is discussed, and their relation to various models. The appearance of the new phase does not depend on type of implanted ion (C, Si, Ti, Pt and Au), so chemical effects are ruled out. The amount of the new phase produced does not follow the regular behavior of the nuclear stopping power, which in this energy regime is orders of magnitude stronger for heavy ions than for light ions. The application of the <b>displacement</b> and thermal <b>spike</b> model, the Coulomb explosion as well as the model of “freezing by heating ” in driven mesoscopic systems, are discussed...|$|R
