5|$|In the mid-1920s, three {{sections}} of modern NY63 received posted route {{numbers for the}} first time. From Wayland to Dansville, the road was the westernmost part of NY52. What is now NY63 was unnumbered from Dansville northwest to Hampton Corners, where NY36 entered from the west on current NY408 and followed the path of NY63 to <b>Geneseo.</b> The road was unnumbered again until Pavilion, at which point NY62 joined {{from the south and}} utilized all of current NY63 and CR63-1 to reach the Lake Ontario shoreline in Yates. By 1926, all numbered portions of current NY63 were state-maintained, as were the unnumbered parts from <b>Geneseo</b> to Piffard and from Groveland to Hampton Corners.|$|E
5|$|The highway enters <b>Geneseo</b> {{from the}} south, taking the name Genesee Street {{as it passes}} {{the western edge of}} the campus of SUNY <b>Geneseo.</b> At the edge of the campus, the route crosses the Genesee River and exits <b>Geneseo.</b> Past the river in the town of York, NY63 begins to curve {{northwest}} up and out of the Genesee River valley until it runs east–west once again at the hamlet of Piffard. The major junction in York is the community of Greigsville, where NY63 reconnects with NY36. This next section of highway has become a major shortcut for traffic heading to the Buffalo area, despite remaining a two-lane road through open rural country, since it is both physically shorter than going all the way to the New York State Thruway as well as toll-free. Most of this Buffalo-bound traffic follows NY36 north from Mount Morris and turns on to NY63 here. Signage along this route reflects this use.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north into}} the town of Sparta, NY63 runs along {{the east side of}} a wide, rural valley {{surrounding}} Canaseraga Creek, with NY36 and I-390 following the west side. The route eventually reaches the town of Groveland and hamlet of Groveland Station, where NY258, a connector to NY36, comes in from the west at the town line. Another long, open stretch brings the route to the vicinity of the village of Mount Morris, where it runs much closer to I-390 and indirectly connects to the expressway by way of NY408 at Hampton Corners. From this point north, the road becomes busier as NY63 is the primary route to the village of <b>Geneseo</b> for northbound traffic on I-390 itself, as there is no exit {{at the point where the}} expressway crosses under NY63. I-390 ultimately bypasses <b>Geneseo</b> to the southeast while NY63 heads north toward the village, briefly joining with U.S. Route20A (US20A) and NY39 just outside the village limits.|$|E

English editions invariably give different translations for the two, but the author of Matthew may {{have been trying to}} link the two verses with the second <b>geneseos</b> symbolically beginning the second section of the chapter.|$|R
5|$|NY36 was {{assigned}} in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell {{in the south}} to Avon in the north. The route utilized the routing of legislative Route15 from Hornell to Dansville and from Mount Morris to Shakers Crossing, the modern junction of NY63 and NY408 northeast of Mount Morris. Between Dansville and Mount Morris, NY36 followed its current alignment. Past Shakers Crossing, NY36 continued northward through <b>Geneseo</b> to Avon on modern NY63 and NY39. The Geneseo–Avon segment of NY36 became part of US20 when that route {{was assigned}} in 1927. South of Hornell, what is now NY36 from Hornell to Jasper became part of NY17 when that route was assigned to most of legislative Route4 in 1924. The remaining sections of contemporary NY36—from Jasper to the Pennsylvania state line and north of Mount Morris—were state-maintained but unnumbered.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} NY36 {{date back to}} 1908 when most of modern NY36 between Jasper and Mumford was {{assigned}} a legislative route designation by the New York State Legislature. NY36 was assigned in the mid-1920s to an alignment extending from Hornell north to Avon, utilizing its modern alignment south of Mount Morris and what is now NY63 and NY39 from Mount Morris to Avon. It was truncated in 1927 to end in <b>Geneseo,</b> but was subsequently realigned and extended {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue north from Mount Morris to Ogden. NY36 was extended again, this time southwestward to Andover, in the early 1940s, but was realigned just a decade later to continue southeast from Hornell to the Pennsylvania state line.|$|E

25|$|The modern routing of NY39 between <b>Geneseo</b> and Avon was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY36 in the mid-1920s. Around the same time, the piece between Pine Tavern and <b>Geneseo</b> became part of NY35. In 1927, the portion of NY35 between East Aurora and <b>Geneseo</b> and the segment of NY36 from <b>Geneseo</b> to Avon were incorporated into US20, a new cross-state U.S. Highway that continued east from Avon toward Albany and west from Pine Tavern toward Buffalo. As a result, NY36 was truncated to its junction with US20 in Leicester. In Avon, US20 was routed on Wadsworth Avenue, Spring Street, and Genesee Street.|$|E
25|$|<b>Geneseo</b> was {{the birthplace}} of Eliza Emily Chappell Porter in 1807, who was a nurse, teacher, school builder, and {{underground}} railroad operative during the Civil War. <b>Geneseo</b> was also the birthplace, in 1851, of the swindler Ferdinand Ward.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley of}} the Genesee is wide and fertile, {{with some of the}} best {{agricultural}} land in New York, but it was very prone to flooding, and <b>Geneseo</b> suffered several bad floods until the United States Army Corps of Engineers' construction of the Mount Morris Dam upstream of the community in the 1950s. Agriculture is now a large contributor to Geneseo's economy. <b>Geneseo</b> is also used by many as a bedroom community for jobs in nearby Rochester. The village of <b>Geneseo</b> is governed by a mayor and four trustees.|$|E

25|$|The {{expressway}} continues north through Livingston County to <b>Geneseo,</b> which I-390 skirts to {{the south}} and east. While there is no exit for <b>Geneseo</b> {{on the part of the}} freeway that encroaches the village, exit8, an interchange with US20A east of <b>Geneseo,</b> provides the connection. Also accessible from the junction is the hamlet of Lakeville, situated off to the east at the junction of US20A and NY15. I-390 continues on, encountering NY15 north of Lakeville and southeast of Avon. From here north to Rochester, I-390 and NY15 follow closely parallel alignments. Both highways meet US20 and NY5 east of Avon prior to crossing into Monroe County.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} side of the Genesee River, US20A and NY39 rise in {{elevation}} once more as they head to the northeast, climbing the eastern edge of the gully to meet NY63 at the valley's eastern edge. After a brief concurrency with US20A and NY39, NY63 splits off to the west, running alongside the western edge of the nearby SUNY <b>Geneseo</b> campus. In contrast, US20A and NY39 form a portion of the eastern edge of the campus between NY63 and Mary Jemison Drive in the village of <b>Geneseo.</b> At the latter intersection, US20A and NY39 turn east onto South Street. After just one block, the US20A/ NY39 overlap comes to an end as NY39 follows Main Street north out of <b>Geneseo</b> toward Avon.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} {{established}} in 1789, before the formation of Livingston County. The settlement of <b>Geneseo</b> by the colonists began shortly after the arrival of James and William Wadsworth in 1790. The brothers came to the Genesee Valley from Connecticut as agents of their uncle, Colonel Jeremiah Wadsworth, to care for and sell the land he had purchased. The Wadsworths were participants in the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree between Robert Morris and the Senecas {{at the site of}} <b>Geneseo</b> in 1797.|$|E

25|$|While {{the main}} line of US20 takes a direct path between Hamburg, Buffalo, and East Bloomfield via Avon, US20A veers to the south to serve several villages and hamlets, {{including}} the villages of <b>Geneseo</b> and Warsaw. The town of Attica, famous for the Attica Prison riots of 1971, lies between US20 and US20A. As the route heads east, US20A connects to several north–south freeways, such as NY400 outside of East Aurora and Interstate390 (I-390) between <b>Geneseo</b> and Lakeville. Outside of the communities that dot the highway, US20A is a two-lane, rural highway.|$|E

25|$|NY35 {{was largely}} {{replaced}} by US20 when U.S. Highways were first signed in New York in 1927. At the time, US20 entered the Buffalo area on modern NY5 and followed Big Tree Road and current US20A east to East Aurora, where it overlapped NY16 {{to reach the}} former routing of NY35. From there, it continued east over former NY35 to <b>Geneseo</b> before proceeding to Avon on modern NY39. Meanwhile, NY4 was renumbered to NY2 to eliminate numerical duplication with the new US4 in the Capital District. The portion of former NY35 between <b>Geneseo</b> and Lakeville went unnumbered until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it became the westernmost portion of NY254, an east–west highway that initially extended eastward along modern US20A and CR32 to a junction with NY21 west of Canandaigua. NY254 was truncated westward to NY64 in Bristol by the following year.|$|E
