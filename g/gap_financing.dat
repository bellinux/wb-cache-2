Public debt crisis has harmfully influenced to Eurozone including developed countries and to the most developed {{countries of the world}} such as United States of America, and Japan. Each country has its own reasons for public debt crisis; however, the principle of those crises is too high public expenditure leading to increase in budget deficit over long term - this called structural <b>gaps</b> of public <b>finance.</b> Available data shows that the ratio Public Debt/GDP in these countries increased over long time then rose sharply for several years right before the public debt crisis.

This unbalance has become worse since 2005 when the public debt increases considerably, especially external debt.

5000|$|The film {{features}} a framing device {{not present in}} the novel with a schoolgirl discovering The Little Prince through a reclusive elderly neighbour. Mark Osborne made the film's hero a little girl after research from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media revealed the gender disparity among characters in animated films. She represents [...] "the spirit of adulthood," [...] according to Osborne. [...] "In animation, it always had to be boy-centric. Right now {{there seems to be}} a changing of the tide but these things don't happen overnight. These movies take years to make, so back when I was first pushing to make the little girl the main character, it was seen as quite revolutionary", Osborne recalled in April 2015. The film uses computer animation for the girl's world and stop-motion animation for the world of The Little Prince as she imagines it. Development and storyboarding of the film was completed in Paris. The team then moved to Montreal for the final phases of animation, lighting, colour and production in order to maximise the tax benefits offered to a French-Canadian project, a co-venture between Onyx Entertainment in Paris and Mikros Image Canada in Montreal. One of the film's associate producers is Brice Garnier from Canada's Kaibou Production. Kaibou service rendered Line production and service production (3D animation and stop motion). Studio partners were Studio Mikros Image Canada, Toutenkartoon Canada and Technicolor (picture and sound post-production).

50|$|More specifically, <b>gap</b> <b>financing</b> is subordinated {{temporary}} financing {{paid off}} when the first mortgagee disburses the full amount due under the first mortgage loan. This is normal in a situation involving a permanent “floor-ceiling loan,” where the borrower does not meet a rent-roll requirement, and the first mortgagee funds only a floor amount, agreeing to fund the balance in the event the rent-roll requirement is met within a stated period. In this case, the gap lender is often the construction lender. Where the gap lender has agreed prior to construction to make the gap loan, the document that ties together the construction loan, the gap loan, and the permanent loan is the buy-sell agreement. In this agreement, a special provision is inserted providing that if the permanent lender's rent-roll holdback is not fulfilled at {{the time for the}} permanent closing, the construction lender agrees to disburse, at a concurrent closing date, funds equal to the amount withheld by the permanent lender pursuant to its commitment. These gap funds are normally evidenced by a promissory note secured by a junior mortgage subject and subordinate in all respects to the permanent loan documentation. The gap documents usually state unequivocally that, in the event the rent-roll requirement is not met during the rent-roll period, the permanent lender still retains the right on demand to purchase the gap note and discharge of record any second mortgage held by the construction lender. The borrower normally assigns to the construction lender all funds that would otherwise be payable to the borrower in the event the rent-roll requirement is met, with the construction lender agreeing to reassign to the borrower all funds that would be payable pursuant to the rent-roll requirement at such time as the gap loan note is paid in full. In addition, the permanent lender usually requires that the temporary lender and borrower agree that no funds will be disbursed under the gap documents, except at the closing of the permanent loan.|$|E

40|$|California's Affordable Housing & Sustainable Communities (AHSC) program offers <b>gap</b> <b>financing</b> to {{affordable}} housing developments and infrastructure projects that demonstrate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

However, AHSC requirements in its inaugural year (2014 - 2015) favored projects in California's largest, densest cities, leaving suburban communities skeptical of their ability to tap into the state's largest new pot of funding for affordable housing. One such place is San Mateo County, California, the suburban region on the San Francisco Peninsula that connects San Francisco to San Jose and Silicon Valley. It is {{within the context of the}} AHSC program in San Mateo County that I pose the question: to what extent should affluent suburban communities assume a portion of the region's overall housing needs? I consider three scholarly discussions [...] suburbanization of poverty, spatial mismatch theory, and exclusionary housing policy [...] together to forge an alternative conception of affluent, transit-rich, and diverse inner-ring suburbs and their obligations to steward affordable housing development. To implement this conception on the ground, I consider the opportunities and barriers to affordable housing development in San Mateo County, identify sites that would be competitive for future rounds of AHSC funding, and propose policies and programs to protect critical sites. by Ellen Victoria Morris.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how a <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> for small firms might {{be addressed by}} means of government policy to support informal financing initiatives. A review of both the finance and the government policy literature provides the basis for discussing and conceptualising the financing difficulties faced by small firms, the role of informal financing in alleviating certain of these difficulties and the areas where public policy is currently usefully employed in addressing such financing problems. A questionnaire survey is undertaken to collect data concerning small business awareness and use of informal finance and to identify issues concerning difficulties encountered in gaining access to finance. The results suggest that a debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> may exist for a minority of firms, though an equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> may represent a more significant issue for small firms. Four categories of policy action emerge from the study towards the achievement {{of economic and social}} policy objectives. These are legislation/regulation, information provision, direct funding and network provision. MANAGERIAL AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS •	Over the decades, the presence and nature of a small firm <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> has been an important preoccupation of policy-makers, the finance industry and of course the small firm manager. This gap may be filled by means of quasi-commercial, or QCOM, finance. •	It appears that only a minority of small business managers encounter a debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap,</b> though a more serious problem is presented by the presence of a significant and widespread equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap.</b> •	There exists a range of policy prescriptions to address the debt and equity <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> experienced by small firms. Those initiatives aiming to address the former are aligned to the government’s more recent agenda concerning social inclusion and community development whilst those aiming to address the latter are aligned to existing government economic policy objectives, particularly the continued emphasis on ‘picking winners’. •	Policy action directed at addressing the small firm debt <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> might include legislation to enable the growth of business credit unions; better information provision regarding sources of debt and appropriate support services; direct funding of agencies such as the Princes Trust; and network support for collectivist financing initiatives such as mutual guarantee societies and credit unions. •	Policy action directed at addressing the equity <b>finance</b> <b>gap</b> might include legislation and deregulation to further encourage private equity investment; information to promote informal venture capital opportunities; the establishment of government funds to extend informal equity investment; and enhanced support for new and existing venture capital networks...|$|R

40|$|Inclusionarv zoning (IZ), a {{strategy}} first adopted by municipalities in the 1970 S to create affordable housing, requires private developers of market-rate residential projects to set-aside {{a certain percentage}} of units as affordable. The original intention of IZ was to foster socioeconomic integration in the nation's suburbs - but now, the tool has been adopted in urban areas, where threats of gentrification are more of a concern. Often, developers are able to fulfill the obligations imposed by inclusionary ordinances through alternative means of compliance: namely, off-site construction of affordable units or fee payments in-lieu of construction. Such flexibility is the primary focus of this thesis: how flexible are cities in the ways developers are permitted to fulfill inclusionary requirements? What are the ramifications of flexibility? Should cities be more or less flexible? My research has found good reasons for creating flexible inclusionary ordinances, beyond just protection from legal challenges. In-lieu fees can be used as <b>gap</b> <b>financing</b> for entirely affordable projects, which can be more beneficial to residents and low-income neighborhoods from a holistic community development perspective. Usually, this also results in production of a greater number of affordable units than on-site construction would have yielded. However, flexibility should be subject to certain restrictions, with cities maintaining authority to approve the means of compliance. In-lieu fees must be set at a meaningful level, equivalent to the actual cost to develop a unit of affordable housing. Additionally, imposing geographic restrictions on off-site construction {{is a good way to}} balance the need to produce affordable housing while furthering socioeconomic integration at the neighborhood, rather than building, level. Evidence regarding the benefits of mixed-income developments for lower-income residents is still inconclusive, and the strategy fails to address the underlying structural causes that perpetuate poverty. Thus, IZ ordinances should not rigidly require on-site construction of affordable units. by Rachel Alonso. Thesis (M. C. P.)

40|$|India {{has emerged}} as one of the fastest growing economies even in the {{difficult}} financial downturn era. In coming years, India will be demanding a large number of infrastructure services to match the demand and keep an upward sloping growth curve. Indian infrastructure including both soft (port services, air and telecom) and hard (road, railways and airways) infrastructure is growing at a fast pace at present. The country also has largest road network (3. 34 million km) and second largest rail network of the world. Requirement for investment in infrastructure projects was expected to increase by 145. 6 % from Five Year Plan 2002 - 07 to FYP 2007 - 11. Part of the investment is expected to come from the various resources as public private partnerships and public investments. Indian government is also trying to experiment with different tools of PPP (public private partnerships) financing such as VGF (viability <b>gap</b> <b>financing),</b> SPV (special purpose vehicle) to decrease the deficits on the accounts of infrastructure. This paper studies the evolution of financing needs and consequential innovative methodologies in Indian infrastructure. Government has made various efforts to match the growth in infrastructure with country’s economy growth. However, Indian infrastructure is still lagging behind globally. This study analyzes existing frameworks available for financing and risk involved in them. India has lot of opportunity to grow using public private partnership model, but still the numbers of project financed are very less. We also have studied project financing model and capital financing model which are used by various competitive countries to India. A regression analysis has been conducted on a macroeconomic model of investment in infrastructure which takes into account the exogenous variables interest rate, inflation rate, foreign exchange rate (USD/INR) and nominal gross domestic product based on Indian data from 1987 - 2010. Here we study how changes in any one of the aforementioned factors impact the infrastructure investment. The paper also tries to find out the correlation between and trends followed by CNX Infra and S&P 500 based on daily time series for both. A comparative analysis of two South Asian countries namely South Korea and Malaysia has been carried out with respect to India. The objective of this study is to find out what are the similarities and complementarities between the infrastructure investments of these countries and India. This helps in suggesting which ways India can move forward in order to optimize and align its infrastructure development with its continuously burgeoning needs. Finally, we have made our recommendation to facilitate infrastructure financing optimally by removing the externalities from the existing system. We also suggest a few innovative ways to finance infrastructure in India which might prove successful. ...|$|E

The new forecast <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra <b>financing</b> <b>gaps</b> with additional private capital.

40|$|Focusing on {{the local}} {{financing}} constraint sheds new light on issues of aid, fiscal reform, and the management of public spending. The fungibility of aid need not translate into resource flows to fill the local <b>financing</b> <b>gap.</b> Indeed, project aid can widen the local <b>financing</b> <b>gap.</b> To augment direct local financing of development, aid must be nonproject aid that can generate local currency. In the longer term, project aid's effect on local financing lies in its impact on growth and on expanding the base for tax revenues, seigniorage, and borrowing. When inadequate local financing limits project implementation and effective use of aid, local currency funds are more valuable than project aid, at the margin [...] and it becomes important to reallocate local funds, to leverage project aid, and to raise the quality of investment projects. A persistent <b>gap</b> in local <b>financing</b> complicates programs of fiscal reform. For such programs to be effective, the local <b>financing</b> <b>gap</b> has to be confronted directly by matching planned local fund expenditures against expected local fund receipts. This requires a transparent database to develop indicators and to monitor the allocation and use of local resources.
