5|$|In May 1861, Isham G. Harris, the {{governor}} of Tennessee, appointed the state's attorney, Daniel S. Donelson, as a brigadier general and directed him to build fortifications on the rivers of Middle Tennessee. Donelson found suitable sites, but they were within the borders of Kentucky, still a neutral state at that time. Moving upriver, just inside the Tennessee border, Donelson selected {{the site of the}} fort on the Cumberland River that would bear his name. Colonel Bushrod <b>Johnson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tennessee Corps of Engineers approved of the site.|$|E
5|$|Jim Caviezel's character, Carroll Oerstadt, {{seemed to}} mirror {{in several ways}} the story of Timothy McVeigh, a {{domestic}} terrorist who destroyed the Alfred P.

Because Moses lost the bout, he did not progress to the Round of 16, which took place between 14 and 16 August.|$|E

5|$|Tiananmen Square {{was one of}} {{the main}} venues where Falun Gong {{practitioners}} gathered to protest the persecution, usually by raising banners in defence of the group, or stage peaceful meditation sit-ins.

5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. <b>Johnson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 16 June, Hess rushed his guards and {{attempted}} suicide by jumping over the railing of the staircase at Mytchett Place. He fell onto the stone floor below, fracturing the femur of his left leg. The injury required that the leg be kept in traction for 12 weeks, with a further six weeks bed rest before he was permitted to walk with crutches. Captain Munro <b>Johnson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Army Medical Corps, who assessed Hess, noted that another suicide attempt was likely to occur in the near future. Hess began around this time to complain of amnesia. This symptom and some of his increasingly erratic behaviour may have in part been a ruse, because if he were declared mentally ill, he could be repatriated under the terms of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

Around {{the start of the}} race, weather conditions were sunny, between , and no rain was expected. Gusty winds from the north created strong headwinds on the back straight. Kenny Farmer, chaplain of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Actress Carol Linnae <b>Johnson</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage production Mamma Mia! performed the national anthem, and John Byers, co-director of UAW-Chrysler National Training Center, commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, two drivers moved {{to the rear of the}} field because of unapproved changes: Bowyer had switched to a back-up car, and Kahne had changed his engine.|$|E
