Approach: This study was therefore conducted {{to determine the extent of}} use ISF and NM practices by the farmers for their crop production in Bangladesh. Data were collected from 120 farmers (39 landless, 34 marginal, 19 small, 20 medium and 8 large farmers) from eight villages located in four districts in Bangladesh through face-to-face interviews from December 2005 to January 2006. Results: Most of the farmers were landless, marginal or small <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> who rarely practiced soil fertility management means.

40|$|The article {{attempts}} to quantify determinants influencing {{the dynamics of}} employment decisions on agricultural holdings in Slovenia and to test specific aspects of labor reallocation during the transition period by the application of an agricultural household model. Through {{the use of a}} 1991 - 2000 longitudinal data set for 22, 055 farm households, quantitative analysis of intertemporal employment decisions by <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> is carried out using probit techniques. The determinants tested relate to the personal characteristics of <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> (gender, age, education level, and potential off-farm income), household characteristics (size, structure), characteristics of the agricultural holding (economic size, labor intensity), and local labor market conditions. The model results generally confirm existing empirical evidence on asymmetrical and irreversible participation of holders on the labor market. Despite intensive restructuring of agriculture and profound changes in the nonfarm labor market in the analyzed period, labor supply of <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> remains rigid. The mobility of labor supply is lower than expected, which {{can be attributed to the}} importance of structural problems constraining intersectoral mobility. Low labor mobility reduces the efficiency of labor allocation on agricultural holdings in Slovenia. Elements of this problem emerge on both supply (e. g., low level of educational and professional attainment of reference persons) and demand sides of the labor market (e. g., unfavorable local labor market conditions). A marked tendency toward maintaining the same employment status is more distinct in the case of holders employed on-farm only.

40|$|South Africa has the {{potential}} to serve as a bridge between large scale farming in developed nations and the small scale operations of subsistence farmers in developing nations. It has a mix of both large-scale modern farms and small farms, which use a range of different farming practices and products. There is a gap between the tractors used by large scale South African farmers and the equipment available to the small <b>farm</b> <b>holders.</b> This research effort aims to fill a portion of that gap. There is a particular need for implements that take advantage of newer conservation methods, such as no-till, and make that technology available for small <b>farm</b> <b>holders.</b> International shipping tends to be costly, increasing the end cost of planters manufactured in other countries, making in-country manufacturing desirable. The objectives of this work included designing, building, and testing a small animal-drawn no-till planter that could be manufactured in a rural town in South Africa and is simple and easy for men, women and older children to use. A prototype was manufactured with basic machine shop equipment and skills. The prototype was then refined and tested. Measurements included draft, seed depth, and seed spacing, with cowpeas used as a representative crop. The average draft for the prototype was 796 N (179 lbf), low enough to be pulled by two draft animals weighing 816. 5 kg (1800 lbs) total. The target seed placement depth for cowpeas of 2 cm was achieved within 25 % most of the time, and the target seed spacing of 10 cm was achieved within 50 %. The residue managers for moving straw from the row, and the press wheels for covering the seed with soil, both performed their intended functions. The planter was also found to be easy to lift at the tongue with one hand and easily operated from the side from which animals are typically driven.

The number of family members, as well as the experience of farm operator, is also significantly related to the succession behaviour. The probabilities of succession, and of having a successor, first increase with age and then decline again. Furthermore, timing of succession is delayed as the <b>farm</b> <b>holder</b> ages, suggesting most farm operator's succession plans to be inconsistent over time. In addition, we find a significant interrelationship between the different aspects of succession indicating that decisions on family succession, the designation of a successor, as well as the timing of succession, are not separable.

40|$|The Teagasc National Farm Survey (NFS) is {{undertaken}} annually {{to determine the}} financial situation on Irish farms. The principal measure of the income arising from farming activities is Family Farm Income (FFI) per farm. In addition to analysing farm income by system and size of farm, NFS data can also be analysed for Full-time and Part-time farms to determine the variation in income that occurs. In this paper the variation in FFI on Part-time and Full-time farms is analysed by system of farming. In the NFS Full-time farms are defined as those which require at least 0. 75 Standard Labour Units to operate, as calculated on a Standard Man Day (SMD) basis. Farms are therefore divided into Full-time and Part-time {{on the basis of}} the estimated labour required to operate their farms as distinct from labour available, which is often in excess of that required. The total number of farms represented nationally is 111, 115. Full-time farms represent the larger more commercial sector of farming and in 2005 accounted for 38 % (or 42, 300) of all farms represented by the NFS. Fifty five percent of Full-time farms were in the two dairying systems with 34 % in the drystock systems with the remaining 11 % in the Tillage systems. Of the 62 % of farms which were Part-time, 88 % were in the drystock systems. The average FFI on all Part-time farms in 2005 was € 11, 372, ranging from € 16, 933 on Dairy farms to € 9, 995 on Sheep farms.

40|$|Organic farming {{follows the}} {{principle}} of circular causation and has emerged {{in response to questions}} on health, environment and sustainability issues. In this review, we assess the status, opportunities and C- sequestration potentials of OF in India. We identify constraints that impede adoption of OF especially for small <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> who constitute over 70 % of farming community in India. With large land area and climate diversity, India has a considerable potential to contribute to C-sequestration. The soil organic carbon (SOC) in cultivated soils is less than 5 mg g- 1 compared to 15 - 20 mg g- 1 in uncultivated soils. This available potential of 10 - 15 mg g- 1 soil–C sink could balance net emission from fossil fuel combustion. Although India occupies second position in terms of number of certified organic farms (44, 926), it is 13 th in terms of area under OF representing only 0. 3 % of total agricultural lands. This scenario appears poor compared to many other countries. Farmers apprehension towards OF in India is rooted in non-availability of sufficient organic supplements, bio fertilizers and local market for organic produce and poor access to guidelines, certification and input costs. Capital-driven regulation by contracting firms further discourages small <b>farm</b> <b>holders.</b> An integrated effort is needed from government and non-government agencies to encourage farmers to adopt OF as a solution to climate change, health and sustainability issue...|$|R

Therefore the paper deals with the factors constraining development plans of small <b>farm</b> <b>holders,</b> the current possibilities for improving small farm market capability, the possible development strategies to choose, and proposals {{for the improvement of}} small farm market capability in Latvia. The most significant barriers to implement the development plans for Latvian small farms are the lack of the production assets and also the difficulties to attract funding for long-term investments and current assets, as well as poor market infrastructure. The existing support measures have had a positive impact on the structural changes in Latvian agriculture; however, these measures have not been sufficient to solve the problems of the market capability of small farms and to contribute to their economic growth sufficiently. In order to improve the market capability of small farms of Latvia, programmatic approach is proposed consisting of four components: 1) training, 2) development of a business plan, 3) evaluation of a business plan, and 4) implementation of the business idea. Different instruments for the implementation of business ideas are attractable depending on whether the owner has selected the implementation of full-time agricultural strategies, part-time agricultural strategies or business diversification strategies...|$|R

Average milk production per cow is extremely low, thus, it amounted to 2, 278 l/cow in 1998. Croatia milk marketability is 41. 3 % that is low compared to European Union where marketability amounts to 94 %. Import of milk and dairy products represents high item of 128239 t, i. e. 28 % compared to total produced milk amount in the Republic of Croatia...|$|R
40|$|Albania is {{considered}} an advantegous country for agriculture (possesing a rich land and water resources), but still its contribution to national GDP is relatively low compared to other sectors, thus implying a low relevance given from the government. This paper tries to analyse the budgetary expenditures in support to agriculture sector in Albania and its aim {{is to provide a}} preliminary assessment of these expenditures. For this reason, a first analysis of actual agriculture conditions is realized, related also to reforms undertaken from the government in agriculture support. Furthermore, trends are observed regarding budget funds allocated to agriculture in total and also in terms of composition (six main programmes are analyzed such as planification and management, food safety, rural development etc.). Some key parameters analyzed in the case of Albania are then compared to EU budget practices to reach a comparison with best practices and to signal some directions as where the budget expenditures could move to. This paper gives some conclusions on actions to be taken from the government in increasing efficiency and optimizing agriculture production (not only on the agriculture funds allocation but also on the level of public information access – on budget drafting and realization; advice offered to <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> and better transparency on steps to follow in benefiting from concessional financing) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this report}} it is {{examined}} whether rural {{regions in the}} EU with a relatively high (low) employment growth in the 1980 s and early 1990 s have some common socio-economic characterics, which {{can contribute to the}} explanation of their employment performance. We have grouped the socio-economic characterics around the headings "local resources", "economic activities" and "supply of labour". We base our analysis on 465 regions in the EU 15, which we have divided into three groups: most rural regions, intermediate regions and most urban regions. Within each of these groups we have made a further distinction into leading (i. e. high non-agricultural employment growth) and lagging (i. e. low non-agricultural employment growth) regions. The analysis shows that leading rural regions have both growth of industrial employment and services employment and show a population growth as well, whereas in lagging rural regions population growth stagnates. Besides, leading rural regions tend to have a lower unemployment rate than lagging regions and tend to have a higher infrastructure endowment (highways, railways and waterways). On the other hand for quite a number of socio-economic indicators hardly any differences have been found between leading and lagging rural regions, like participation rates, education level of the population, average firm size, share of female employed in total employment and the share of <b>farm</b> <b>holders</b> with other gainful activities...|$|R
