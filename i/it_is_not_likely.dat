5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after that they still retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Use of an {{automated}} external defibrillator on a patient in a metal underwire bra can cause burns, and the bra should be removed by the first responder before the AED is applied. In their 2007 season, the television program MythBusters tested the possibility of burns resulting from using a defibrillator on a patient who is using an underwire bra, and concluded that while it is possible, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> unless the metal underwire is exposed and paddles of the defibrillator {{are very close to}} it.|$|E
25|$|Gometra and Inchkenneth nearby {{both have}} {{connections}} to Iona so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that Ulva had as well. Ulva {{came under the}} Diocese of Sodor and Man, and then the Diocese of Argyll.|$|E

25|$|Other {{authorities}} {{believe the}} Sator Square was Mithraic or Jewish in origin, because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that Pompeii {{had a large}} Christian population in 79 AD and the symbolism inferred as Christian {{and the use of}} Latin in Christianity is not attested until later.|$|E
25|$|Mechanic's liens {{in their}} modern form were first {{conceived}} by Thomas Jefferson, to encourage {{construction in the}} new capital city of Washington. They were established by the Maryland General Assembly, of which the city of Washington was then a part. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that Jefferson single-handedly dreamed up the idea.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some debate about whether hognoses are venomous. Their saliva meets the {{definition}} of a venom since it is toxic to small prey such as frogs and toads; however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> to cause serious injury to humans, particularly as hognoses are rear-fanged and although they will generally feign a strike they will bite if they feel threatened.|$|E

25|$|Lowe {{describes}} the inflation incident in his official report less dramatically, {{saying that he}} was told by the gas plant supervisor to disconnect and let another balloon go first. Lowe did not name names, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that it was anyone other than Wise. Lowe's report about a new balloon has to be considered over Hoehling's account of the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016, it was {{reported}} that Russell had written letters to all 32 NFL teams asking for a tryout and pledging to play one year for free, although no team responded to this letter. Most professional football experts believe that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> any NFL team would take any interest in Russell, since he had not played a meaningful down in seven years.|$|E
25|$|The prefixes 0141, 0142, 0143, 0145 and 0147 are {{set aside}} for {{satellite}} systems; {{the rest of the}} 014 prefix range is currently not allocated to any other service type. There is not a lot of demand for these services, and many satellite phones now have normal mobile phone numbers (prefix 04), so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> for the entire 014 range to be allocated to satellite services.|$|E

25|$|The {{scientific}} name Gavia was the Latin {{term for the}} smew (Mergellus albellus). This small sea-duck is quite unrelated to loons and {{just happens to be}} another black-and-white seabird which swims and dives for fish. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that the ancient Romans had much knowledge of loons, as these are limited to more northern latitudes and {{since the end of the}} last glacial period seem to have occurred only as rare winter migrants in the Mediterranean region.|$|E
25|$|Because {{there has}} been no Supreme Court {{decision}} on the issue of what exactly constitutes a “Use in Commerce” under the Lanham Act with regard to the incorporation of a trademark into a domain name, it is difficult to say whether the Bucci case is still good law. However, because {{there have been so many}} divergent opinions and fact specific determinations from subsequent cases, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that the case would be strictly followed by other courts.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} many {{interesting}} special cases that are decidable. In particular, {{it is possible to}} reason about the behaviour of a network of finite-state machines. One example is telling whether a given network of interacting (asynchronous and non-deterministic) finite-state machines can reach a deadlock. This problem is PSPACE-complete, i.e., it is decidable, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that there is an efficient (centralised, parallel or distributed) algorithm that solves the problem in the case of large networks.|$|E
5000|$|On June 27, 2011, Jonah Matranga went on theFIVE10 Radio {{and said}} that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> Far would <b>be</b> getting back together. He cited several {{problems}} but mainly that there was just [...] "too much drama." ...|$|R

25|$|It {{is alleged}} by some that the Duke of Brunswick was well-inclined {{to enter into}} the views of the Pope, but that he found he could neither raise men nor money {{sufficient}} to warrant even a probability of success. This we are inclined to doubt, for had Otho been ambitious, he might have obtained the empire without much difficulty; and supported as he was by England and Denmark, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that he could have been at a loss for an army, or for the means of supporting it.|$|E
25|$|The {{taxpayer}} whose residence {{has been}} ‘locked’ into a trust {{has now been}} given another opportunity {{to take advantage of}} these CGT exemptions. The Taxation Law Amendment Act of 30 September 2009 commenced on 1 January 2010 and granted a 2-year window period from 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2011, affording a natural person the opportunity to take transfer of the residence with advantage of no transfer duty being payable or CGT consequences. Whilst taxpayers can take advantage of this opening of a window of opportunity, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that it will ever become available thereafter.|$|E
25|$|No {{data have}} been {{compiled}} showing the susceptibility {{of the sheep}} to disease, although tests have been run on similar species of sheep and the data may be similar. Since Marco Polo sheep are reluctant to approach people, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that they can catch diseases common to domestic flocks, although some domestic sheep are allowed to run wild over the mountains, and it is unknown if they {{come into contact with}} Marco Polo sheep. However, the shepherds in the area do not generally have access to veterinary care for their animals, and it is possible that these could transmit diseases to the wild sheep.|$|E
60|$|There was satisfaction, however, in {{the thought}} that he had escaped from Martin and Toglet. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that they had been able to board the train, even if {{inclined}} to do so, which was decidedly doubtful.|$|R

25|$|A {{flash drive}} {{consists}} of a small printed circuit board carrying the circuit elements and a USB connector, insulated electrically and protected inside a plastic, metal, or rubberised case, which can be carried in a pocket or on a key chain, for example. The USB connector may be protected by a removable cap or by retracting {{into the body of}} the drive, although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> to be damaged if unprotected. Most flash drives use a standard type-A USB connection allowing connection with a port on a personal computer, but drives for other interfaces also exist. USB flash drives draw power from the computer via the USB connection. Some devices combine the functionality of a portable media player with USB flash storage; they require a battery only when used to play music on the go.|$|E
25|$|The {{trochanter}} is the basal {{segment of}} the telopodite; {{it is always a}} small segment in the insect leg, freely movable by a horizontal hinge on the coxa, but more or less fixed {{to the base of the}} femur. When movable on the femur the trochantero femoral hinge is usually vertical or oblique in a vertical plane, giving a slight movement of production and reduction at the joint, though only a reductor muscle is present. In the Odonata, both nymphs and adults, there are two trochanteral segments, but they are not movable on each other; the second contains the reductor muscle of the femur. The usual single trochanteral segment of insects, therefore, probably represents the two trochanters of other arthropods fused into one apparent segment, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that the primary coxotrochanteral hinge has been lost from the leg. In some of the Hymenoptera a basal subdivision of the femur simulates a second trochanter, but the insertion of the reductor muscle on its base attests that it belongs to the femoral segment, since as shown in the odonate leg, the reductor has its origin in the true second trochanter.|$|E
25|$|The Wells Gray-Clearwater {{volcanic}} {{field in}} southeastern British Columbia consists of numerous small, basaltic volcanoes and extensive lava flows. Many individual volcanoes {{in the field}} have been active for the last 3 million years during which time the region was covered by thick glacial ice at least twice, prior to the well known Fraser Glaciation (also known as the Wisconsin Glaciation). The origin of the volcanism is yet unknown but is probably related to crustal thinning. The last eruption in the field was at Kostal Cone in 1500. Volcanism within the field has also created the -high Helmcken Falls, which is the fourth highest waterfall in Canada. It owes its foundation to the deposits of volcanic rock that were placed down in the wide valley of the Murtle River. Layer upon layer of fresh lava created flat areas, over which enormous floods flowed during the last ice age. These floods shaped the upright cliff in the lava flows over which the river now flows. The protection of Helmcken Falls {{was one of the}} major causes for the development of Wells Gray Provincial Park. As a result, {{if it had not been}} for the volcanic eruptions, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> that such a large wilderness region would have been made.|$|E
60|$|For {{the present}} I felt myself {{perfectly}} safe from capture. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>likely</b> {{the police had}} traced me to Brooklyn, and if so, seen me taken on board the Spitfire, which Lowell must have done as slyly as possible.|$|R
