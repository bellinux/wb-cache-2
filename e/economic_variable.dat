25|$|According to a 1996 {{study by}} the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, on 8 of the 10 key {{economic}} variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only <b>economic</b> <b>variable</b> that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.|$|E
2500|$|Rational {{expectations}} theories {{were developed}} in response to perceived flaws in theories based on adaptive expectations. [...] Under adaptive expectations, expectations of the future value of an <b>economic</b> <b>variable</b> are based on past values. [...] For example, people would be assumed to predict inflation by looking at inflation last year and in previous years. [...] Under adaptive expectations, if the economy suffers from constantly rising inflation rates (perhaps due to government policies), people would be assumed to always underestimate inflation. Many economists have regarded this as unrealistic, believing that rational individuals would sooner or later realize the trend and take it into account in forming their expectations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the ability of}} both <b>economic</b> <b>variables</b> and moving-average rules to forecast the monthly U. S. equity premium using out-of-sample tests for 1960 - 2008. Both approaches provide statistically and economically significant out-of-sample forecasting gains, which are concentrated in U. S. business-cycle recessions. Nevertheless, <b>economic</b> <b>variables</b> and moving-average rules capture different sources of equity premium fluctuations: moving average rules detect {{the decline in the}} average equity premium early in recessions, while <b>economic</b> <b>variables</b> more readily pick up the rise in the average equity premium later in recessions.

In addition, utilizing information from both technical indicators and <b>economic</b> <b>variables</b> increases substantially the forecasting performances relative to using just <b>economic</b> <b>variables</b> and results economically significant utility gains. Moreover, we find that the economic value of the bond risk premia forecasts are only comparable to that of the equity risk premium forecasts, despite the out-of-sample R-squares in the bond market are more than 10 times greater than those in the stock market...|$|R

Critics of this analysis (such as Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps) argued that the Phillips curve could not be a fundamental characteristic of economic general equilibrium because it showed a correlation between a real <b>economic</b> <b>variable</b> (the unemployment rate) and a nominal <b>economic</b> <b>variable</b> (the inflation rate). Their counter-analysis was that government macroeconomic policy (primarily monetary policy) was being driven by a low unemployment target and that this caused expectations of inflation to change, so that steadily accelerating inflation rather than reduced unemployment was the result.

A shift-share analysis takes the change over time of an <b>economic</b> <b>variable,</b> such as employment, within industries of a regional economy, and divides that change into various components.

50|$|Elasticity is the {{measurement}} of how responsive an <b>economic</b> <b>variable</b> is {{to a change in}} another variable.

It is a tool for measuring the responsiveness of a variable, or of the function that determines it, to changes in causative variables in unitless ways. Frequently used elasticities include price elasticity of demand, price elasticity of supply, income elasticity of demand, elasticity of substitution or constntelasticity of substitution between factors of production and elasticity of intertemporal substitution.|$|E
