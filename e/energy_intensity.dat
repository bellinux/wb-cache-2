40|$|Embodied <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> {{denote the}} amount of energy (direct and indirect) that is {{required}} to produce one unit of economic output. These embodied <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> should include imports. The <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of imports are in most cases unknown and are therefore often neglected or assumed to be equal to the domestic <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of similar products. Both assumptions introduce errors in the indigenously calculated embodied <b>energy</b> <b>intensities.</b> This certainly applies to countries with a relatively high contribution of imports and a specific economic structure. This article advocates to estimate the <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of imports by means of the average <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of the region in which the country is situated. In this context, different estimation procedures for the embodied <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of imports are presented for a number of countries within OECD-Europe. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.

30|$|Electricity {{requirement}} for household appliances is also disaggregated {{into two categories}} based on dwelling type. This is because of possible duplication of some appliances in many-room households; a many-room household may, for example, {{have more than one}} cooling fan, television or air conditioner, and energy requirements for electric appliances would be different for the two dwelling types. Estimates of <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> are based on average number of electric appliances in each household, average number of hours of use and average energy consumption. On this basis, the <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> for basic household appliances are 285 and 395 kWh/annum respectively for one-room and many-room households. Basic appliances here include pressing iron, radio, television and cooling fan. For refrigeration and air conditioning, the estimated <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> are 402 and 4600 kWh/annum, and respectively. According to a survey of the National Bureau of Statistics (2005), however, only 20 % of households had at least one air conditioner and/or a refrigerator.|$|R

Therefore, to reduce the <b>energy</b> consumption <b>intensity</b> of Jiangsu Province, we suggest that while expanding FDI scale, we should adopt unified energy-saving and emission-reducing requirements to FDI enterprises and domestic ones. Meanwhile, we should increase the foreign investment proportion in the technology-intensive industries and encourage FDI enterprises to use and exchange advanced energy-saving technologies. Moreover, we should adjust the distribution industry structure of FDI to optimize the industrial structure adjustment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of low-level 940 nm laser therapy with <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of 5, 10 and 20 J/cm 2 on bone healing in an animal model. A total of 48 female adult Wistar rats underwent surgery to create bone defects in the right tibias. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) was applied immediately after surgery and on post-operative days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 in three study groups with <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> of 5 J/cm 2, 10 J/cm 2 and 20 J/cm 2 using a 940 nm Gallium-Aluminium-Arsenide (Ga-Al-As) laser, while one control group underwent only the tibia defect surgery. All animals were sacrificed 4 or 8 weeks post-surgery. Fibroblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, osteoclasts and newly formed vessels were evaluated by a histological examination. No significant change was observed in the number of osteocytes, osteoblasts, osteoclasts and newly formed vessels at either time period across all laser groups. Although LLLT with the 10 J/cm 2 energy density increased fibroblast activity at the 4 th week in comparison with the 5 and 20 J/cm 2 groups, no significant change was observed between the laser groups and the control group. These results indicate that low-level 940 nm laser with different <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> may not have marked effects on the bone healing process in both phases of bone formation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{trends in}} the structure and <b>intensity</b> of final <b>energy</b> demand in five OECD nations between 1973 and 1988. Our focus is on primary energy use, which weights fuels by their thermal content and multiplies district heat and electricity by factors of 1. 15 and 3. 24 to approximate the losses {{that occur in the}} conversion and distribution of these energy carriers. Growth in the level of energy-using activities, given 1973 <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> (<b>energy</b> use per unit of activity), would have raised primary energy use by 46 % in the U. S., 42 %, in Norway, 33 % in Denmark, 37 % in West Germany, and 53 % in Japan. Reductions in end-use <b>energy</b> <b>intensities,</b> given 1973 activity levels, would have reduced primary energy use by 19 % in the U. S., 3 % in Norway, 20 % in Denmark, 15 % in West Germany, and 14 % in Japan. Growth in national income paralelled increases in a weighted index of energy-using activities in the U. S., West Germany, and Denmark but substantially outstripped activity growth in Norway and Japan. We conclude that changes in the structure of a nations economy may lead to substantial changes in its energy/GDP ratio that art? unrelated to changes in the technical efficiency of energy utilization. Similarly, changes in <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> may be greater or less than the aggregate change in the energy/GDP ratio of a given country, a further warning that this ratio may be an unreliable indicator of technical efficiency. ...|$|R

In common language equity means [...] "the quality of being impartial" [...] or [...] "something that is fair and just." [...] One example of the relevance of equity to GHG emissions are the different ways in which emissions can be measured. [...] These include the total annual emissions of one country, cumulative emissions measured over long time periods (sometimes measured over more than 100 years), average emissions per person in a country (per capita emissions), as well as measurements of <b>energy</b> <b>intensity</b> of GDP, carbon intensity of GDP, or carbon intensity of energy use (discussed earlier). Different indicators of emissions provide different insights relevant to climate change policy, and have been an important issue in international climate change negotiations (e.g., see Kyoto Protocol#Negotiations).|$|E

40|$|The {{changing}} modal {{composition and}} volume of work travel in London, Birmingham, and Manchester and their resultant energy consumption implications are considered in this research. Essentially, the mechanism is {{to calculate the}} passenger km travelled by mode and then to apply mode-specific energy consumption parameters to calculate energy consumption. By classifying work-travel trips according to their travel mode and their location and orientation (within, out of, and into town) {{it is possible to}} determine where the major forces for commuting change are and, more important, assess the implications of these forces for energy consumption. Average <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> per person trip are not the same everywhere or for every energy-consuming mode; furthermore, the magnitude and direction of change in average <b>energy</b> <b>intensities</b> are not the same either. Many of the trends seem to be moving rapidly away from positions of energy sustainability. The data are derived from the 1981 and 2001 special workplace statistics of the Population Census for small areas, and from fuel consumption technical parameters calibrated by engineers. One important objective of the paper is to understand the relative importance for energy consumption of changing travel modes for work journeys and changing trip orientation caused by urbanisation trends. ...|$|R
