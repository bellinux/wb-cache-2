5000|$|A {{plate and}} frame filter press {{is the most}} {{fundamental}} design, and many now refer it as a [...] "membrane filter plate". This type of filter press consists of many plates and frames assembled alternately with the supports of a pair of rails. The presence of a centrifuge pump ensures the remaining suspended solids do not settle in the system, and its main function is to deliver the suspension into each of the separating chambers in the {{plate and frame filter}}. For each of the individual separating chambers, there is one hollow filter frame separated from two filter plates by filter cloths. The introduced slurry flows through a port in each individual frame, and the filter cakes are accumulated in each hollow frame. As the filter cake becomes thicker, the filter resistance increases as well. So when the separating chamber is full, the filtration process is stopped as the optimum pressure difference is reached. The filtrate that passes through filter cloth is collected through collection pipes and stored in the <b>filter</b> <b>tank.</b> Filter cake (suspended solid) accumulation occurs at the hollow plate frame, then being separated at the filter plates by pulling the plate and frame filter press apart. The cakes then fall off from those plates and are discharged to the final collection point.|$|E

The site {{is located at the}} Nevada Test Site (NTS) Area 25 Test Cell C Complex (Figure 1). The CAU consists of one Corrective Action Site (CAS) 25 - 23 - 12 which includes two aboveground radioactive wastewater <b>filter</b> <b>tanks</b> used during the Nuclear Furnace Testing at Test Cell C. The Test Cell C complex was one of several facilities dedicated to the development of nuclear rocket technology. Test Cell C was designed to test nuclear rocket reactors. Part of the testing program included Nuclear Furnace Tests. The Nuclear Furnace was a water-moderated, hydrogen-cooled, 44 -megawatt reactor used to test fuel elements for the nuclear rocket engine. The Nuclear Furnace in itself was not a nuclear rocket engine. During testing, hydrogen exited the reactor at a temperature of 2, 440 degrees Kelvin. Water was injected into the gas stream to cool the hydrogen and capture the various radiological isotopes. Hydrogen gas effluent was decontaminated through a multistage process before being burned at the Test Cell C flare stack. A by-product of the decontamination process produced water contaminated with mixed fission products. Prior to discharge to a tile drain system (CAU 267) the water was filtered through the two 2271 -liters (600 -gallon) <b>filter</b> <b>tanks</b> (Department of Energy [DOE], 1998). Reactor development, engine testing, and rocket development activities were ended in the early 1970 s. The <b>filter</b> <b>tanks</b> have remained inactive since that time.

This CAU is comprised of 12 Corrective Action Sites (CASs) located at Test Cell C; the Engine Maintenance, Assembly, and Disassembly (E-MAD) Facility; the X-Tunnel in Area 25; the Pluto Disassembly Facility; the Pluto Check Station; and the Port Gaston Training Facility in Area 26. These CASs include: CAS 25 - 01 - 05, Aboveground Storage Tank (AST); CAS 25 - 02 - 02, Underground Storage Tank (UST); CAS 25 - 23 - 11, Contaminated Materials; CAS 25 - 12 - 01, Boiler; CAS 25 - 01 - 06, AST; CAS 25 - 01 - 07, AST; CAS 25 - 02 - 13, UST; CAS 26 - 01 - 01, <b>Filter</b> <b>Tank</b> (Rad) and Piping; CAS 26 - 01 - 02, <b>Filter</b> <b>Tank</b> (Rad); CAS 26 - 99 - 01, Radioactively Contaminated Filters; CAS 26 - 02 - 01, UST; CAS 26 - 23 - 01, Contaminated Liquids Spreader. Based on site history, process knowledge, and previous field efforts, contaminants of potential concern for CAU 127 include radionuclides, metals, total petroleum hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, asbestos, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Additionally, beryllium may be present at some locations. The sources of potential releases are varied, but releases of contaminated liquids may have occurred and may have migrated into and impacted soil below and surrounding storage vessels at some of the CASs. Also, at several CASs, asbestos-containing materials may be present on the aboveground structures and may be friable. Exposure pathways are limited to ingestion, inhalation, and dermal contact (adsorption) of soils/sediments or liquids, or inhalation of contaminants by site workers due to disturbance of contaminated materials. Future land-use scenarios limit subsequent uses of the CASs to various nonresidential (i. e., industrial) activities. Field activities will consist of radiological walkover and screening surveys, and field-screening and collecting of both tank content and soil samples, and further sample testing as appropriate. A two-step data quality objective strategy will be followed: (1) Phase I will be to collect environmental samples for laboratory analysis to confirm {{the presence or absence of}} contaminants at concentrations exceeding preliminary action levels; and (2) Phase II will be to collect additional environmental samples for laboratory analysis to determine the extent of contamination identified in Phase I.

40|$|Funded by the Department of Energy Office of Environmental Management, EM- 31, the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) {{partnered with}} SpinTek Filtration{trademark} {{to develop a}} filter disk that would {{withstand}} a reverse pressure or flow during operation of the rotary microfilter. The ability to withstand a reverse pressure and flow eliminates a potential accident scenario that could have resulted in damage to the filter membranes. While the original welded filter disks {{have been shown to}} withstand and reverse pressure/flow in the static condition, the filter disk design discussed in this report will allow a reverse pressure/flow while the disks are rotating. In addition, the laminated disk increases the flexibility during filter startup and cleaning operations. The new filter disk developed by SRNL and SpinTek is manufactured with a more open structure significantly reducing internal flow restrictions in the disk. The prototype was tested at the University of Maryland and demonstrated to withstand the reverse pressure due to the centrifugal action of the rotary filter. The tested water flux of the disk was demonstrated to be 1. 34 gpm in a single disk test. By comparison, the water flux of the current disk was 0. 49 gpm per disk during a 25 disk test. The disk also demonstrated rejection of solids by filtering a 5 wt % Strontium Carbonate slurry with a filtrate clarity of less the 1. 4 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) throughout the two hour test. The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) has been working with SpinTek Filtration{trademark} to adapt the rotary microfilter for radioactive service in the Department of Energy (DOE) Complex. One potential weakness is the loose nature of the membrane on the filter disks. The current disk is constructed by welding the membrane at {{the outer edge of the}} disk. The seal for the center of the membrane is accomplished by an o-ring in compression for the assembled stack. The remainder of the membrane is free floating on the disk. This construction requires that a positive pressure be applied to the rotary <b>filter</b> <b>tank</b> to prevent the membrane from rising from the disk structure and potentially contacting the filter turbulence promoter. In addition, one accident scenario is a reverse flow through the filtrate line due to mis-alignment of valves resulting in the membrane rising from the disk structure. The structural integrity of the current disk has been investigated, and shown that the disk can withstand a significant reverse pressure in a static condition. However, the disk will likely incur damage if the filter stack is rotated during a reverse pressure. The development of a laminated disk would have several significant benefits for the operation of the rotary filter including the prevention of a compromise in filter disk integrity during a reverse flow accident, increasing operational flexibility, and increasing the self cleaning ability of the filter. A laminated disk would allow the filter rotor operation prior to a positive pressure in the <b>filter</b> <b>tank.</b> This would prevent the initial dead-head of the filter and prevent the resulting initial filter cake buildup. The laminated disk would allow rotor operation with cleaning fluid, eliminating the need for a recirculation pump. Additionally, a laminated disk would allow a reverse flow of fluid through the membrane pores removing trapped particles...|$|E
40|$|The {{remediation}} of aged source zone {{affected by}} residual chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) {{represents one of}} the main challenges in contaminated aquifers. Groundwater Circulation Wells (GCWs) could be considered a strategy for the progressive source zone remediation; this in situ remediation technology is designed to create an in situ vertical groundwater circulation cells by drawing groundwater from an aquifer through one screened section of a multi-screened well and discharging it through another screened section. The pressure gradient between the two hydraulically separated screen sections in the well induces a circulation flow in the aquifer forcing water through less permeable layer where usually CAHs residual source are located. The groundwater moves through the treatment zone both horizontally and vertically and as a consequence the low permeable layer is constantly penetrated by the vertical flow of the GCWs. We tested the possibility to use GCW to enhance in-situ bioremediation (ISB) in an operative industrial site heavily contaminated by different chlorinated solvents (at concentration up to 100 mg/L) in a complex hydrogeological saturated zone. A 30 mts deep GCW, with three screen sections, was designed and installed at the site for a pilot testing. Groundwater is pumped towards two screen sections of the GCW and is reinjected into the aquifer by another screen section after passing through an external unit treatment. External treatment unit is composed of a sand <b>filter</b> <b>tank</b> and two reactors: one reactor was filled with a biodegradable polymer (polyhydroxy-butyrrate, PHB) and the other one with a mixture of zero-valent iron (ZVI) and PHB. Results from the first eight months of operation clearly demonstrated how groundwater recirculation through the PHB reactor allowed delivering continuously electron donors in the contaminated aquifer enhancing the mobilization of CAHs and stimulating Natural Attenuation biological processes. © 2016, AIDIC Servizi S. r. l...|$|E
