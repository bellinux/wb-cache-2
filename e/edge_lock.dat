40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and releasing mechanism. A locking and releasing mechanism is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading <b>edge</b> flap and <b>locking</b> and releasing mechanism. The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade.

40|$|Low power radios enable {{ubiquitous}} sensor {{networks that}} can be used for a variety of applications, such as biomedical monitoring, environmental sensing and intrusion detection. However, existing transceivers have been unable to demonstrate low enough power consumption to fully realize these applications. Low duty cycle impulse radio can offer significant power savings by allowing the transceiver to be turned off between bits. Ensuring that two nodes are sufficiently synchronized to duty-cycle in this fashion is a significant challenge. To solve this problem we used pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) scheme of Mirollo and Strogatz. We performed extensive simulation of the PCO network under a realistic radio parameter space and found synchronization to be robust. We then implemented a low power, aggressively duty-cycled dual-band IR-UWB transceiver in an IBM 90 nm CMOS process based on this synchronization mechanism. The transceiver features an energy-detecting front-end, a relaxation oscillator based PCO and a precise <b>edge</b> <b>locking</b> PLL for time bin generation. The time-bins provide our system with 123 unique channels {{that can be}} used for multiple access [...] We constructed a FPGA based test and measurement setup and implemented a synchronization management finite-state-machine on microprocessor. The PCO network is shown to synchronize nodes robustly with experiments confirming the results of our simulations. We found that the synchronization management scheme allows a four-node system to remain synchronized with duration-of-synchronization iii on the order of one second when using 30 ns RF-on time windows in a 7. 2 frame. As a result of this aggressive-duty cycle of 0. 8 %, the total transceiver power consumption is reduced to 119 uW while actively communicating. We were able to demonstrate functional radio links transmitting packets of upto 1200 bit length over a meter range, proving the viability of the concept. Finally we perform an analysis of a simplified theoretical model of the system which provides fundamental limits to the size of the network that can be supported and the data throughput that can be achieved. The analysis shows that the scheme offers significant power savings benefits for up-to ten nodes if bit-error-rate can be sufficiently controlled. i...|$|R

Consistent with the experiments, two deposition stages have been identified. The docking stage occurs over a wide temperature range, starting {{with the formation of}} the first peptide-fibril interactions at 500 K. Docking is completed when a peptide fully adsorbs on the fibril edge at the temperature of 380 K. The docking transition appears to be continuous, and occurs without free energy barriers or intermediates. During docking, incoming Aβ monomer adopts a disordered structure on the fibril <b>edge.</b> The <b>locking</b> stage occurs at the temperature of ≈ 360  K and is characterized by the rugged free energy landscape. Locking takes place when incoming Aβ peptide forms a parallel β-sheet structure on the fibril edge. Because the β-sheets formed by locked Aβ peptides are typically off-registry, the structure of the locked phase differs from the structure of the fibril interior. The study also reports that binding affinities of two distinct fibril edges with respect to incoming Aβ peptides are different. The peptides bound to the concave edge have significantly lower free energy compared to those bound on the convex edge. Comparison with the available experimental data is discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an improvement {{of a standard}} algorithm for detecting dead-lock potentials in multi-threaded programs, in that it reduces the number of false positives. The standard algorithm works as follows. The multi-threaded program under observation is executed, while lock and unlock events are observed. A graph of locks is built, with <b>edges</b> between <b>locks</b> symbolizing locking orders. Any cycle in the graph signifies a potential for a deadlock. The typical standard example is the group of dining philosophers sharing forks. The algorithm is interesting because it can catch deadlock potentials even though no deadlocks occur in the examined trace, {{and at the same}} time it scales very well in contrast t o more formal approaches to deadlock detection. The algorithm, however, can yield false positives (as well as false negatives). The extension of the algorithm described in this paper reduces the amount of false positives for three particular cases: when a gate lock protects a cycle, when a single thread introduces a cycle, and when the code segments in different threads that cause the cycle can actually not execute in parallel. The paper formalizes a theory for dynamic deadlock detection and compares it to model checking and static analysis techniques.

40|$|At large {{values of}} the {{anisotropy}} Δ, the open-boundary Heisenberg spin- 1 / 2 chain has eigenstates displaying localization at the edges. We present a Bethe ansatz description of this `edge-locking' phenomenon in the entire Δ> 1 region. We focus on the simplest spin sectors, namely the highly polarized sectors with {{only one or two}} overturned spins, i. e., one-particle and two-particle sectors. Edge-locking is associated with pure imaginary solutions of the Bethe equations, which are not commonly encountered in periodic chains. In the one-particle case, at large anisotropies there are two eigenstates with imaginary Bethe momenta, related to localization at the two edges. For any finite chain size, one of the two solutions become real as the anisotropy is lowered below a certain value. For two particles, a richer scenario is observed, with eigenstates having the possibility of both particles locked on the same or different <b>edge,</b> one <b>locked</b> and the other free, and both free either as single magnons or as bound composites corresponding to `string' solutions. For finite chains, some of the edge-locked spins get delocalized at certain {{values of the}} anisotropy (`exceptional points'), corresponding to imaginary solutions becoming real. We characterize these phenomena thoroughly by providing analytic expansions of the Bethe momenta for large chains, large anisotropy, and near the exceptional points.

Our simulations incorporate inertial wave-mediated effects during seismic ruptures (they are thus fully dynamic) and account for all phases of the seismic cycle in a self-consistent way.
