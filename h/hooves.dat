5|$|Equine <b>hooves</b> {{and legs}} have evolved over {{millions}} of years to the form in which they are found today. The original ancestors of horses had shorter legs, terminating in five-toed feet. Over millennia, a single hard hoof evolved from the middle toe, while the other toes gradually disappeared into the tiny vestigial remnants that are found today on the lower leg bones. Prairie-dwelling equine species developed <b>hooves</b> and longer legs that were both sturdy and light weight to help them evade predators and cover longer distances in search of food. Forest-dwelling species retained shorter legs and three toes, which helped them on softer ground. Approximately 35 million years ago, a global drop in temperature created a major habitat change, leading to the transition of many forests to grasslands. This led to a die-out among forest-dwelling equine species, eventually leaving the long-legged, one-toed Equus of today, which includes the horse, as the sole surviving genus of the Equidae family.|$|E
5|$|The network had termini in Henley Beach, Hindmarsh, Prospect, Nailsworth, Paradise, Magill, Burnside, Glen Osmond, Mitcham, Clarence Park, Hyde Park and Walkerville. To {{accommodate}} {{the specific needs}} of horses, most streets were left unsealed. The horses' urine needed an unsealed surface for absorption and their <b>hooves</b> a soft surface for good traction.|$|E
40|$|The <b>hoof</b> wall {{is adapted}} to take most of the {{weight-bearing}} of the foot and is anisotropic and homogeneous. Foals appear to be born with symmetrical paired feet which by maturity are frequently unequal in angle and width. They stand within minutes of birth subjecting the <b>hoof</b> wall to loading. <b>Hoof</b> growth rate and <b>hoof</b> compression may be factors affecting <b>hoof</b> shape. The effect of conformation changes during maturation upon loading and differential <b>hoof</b> growth was unknown. The aims were to; quantify and evaluate the epidermal structure, <b>hoof</b> growth rate, <b>hoof</b> renewal, dorsal <b>hoof</b> wall angle, plastic <b>hoof</b> compression, and <b>hoof</b> loading, during paediatric development. <b>Hoof</b> growth rate, renewal, and <b>hoof</b> angle were recorded in foals (n= 80) and weanlings/yearlings (n= 12) and the <b>hoof</b> wall structure of histological samples of fetuses and paediatric foals (n= 15) was determined. Solar loading, <b>hoof</b> growth, and <b>hoof</b> angle was recorded in healthy foals (n= 18) and compared to a group with acquired flexural deformity (n= 9). Horn tubule size and number increased significantly, and density decreased significantly during maturation. The dorsal <b>hoof</b> wall angle declined with age. <b>Hoof</b> renewal in newborn foals was 145 ± 15 days whereas weaning/yearlings were 283 ± 26 days. A relationship between plastic <b>hoof</b> compression and time was found (r = 0. 46, P = 0. 002). <b>Hoof</b> compression in foals was 0. 039 ± 0. 022 mm per day and in weanling/yearlings 0. 03 ± 0. 016 mm per day. <b>Hoof</b> growth rate, <b>hoof</b> compression, and dorsal <b>hoof</b> wall angle, all correlated to ageing and differed between the healthy and acquired flexural deformity foals. The original findings in this thesis give a broad understanding of the developing equine <b>hoof</b> wall. Knowledge of renewal times allows predictions of healing in cases of partial <b>hoof</b> wall avulsion. Original data recording {{the structure of the}} developing <b>hoof</b> wall may lead to a greater understanding of its response to loading, while improved recognition of the angles of the digit and <b>hoof</b> during maturation will allow a more accurate assessment of conformation. <b>Hoof</b> distortion is affected by loading, <b>hoof</b> compression and <b>hoof</b> growth and comprehending the link between these factors may lead to enhanced treatment strategies for all ages of horse...|$|R
5000|$|A cloven <b>hoof,</b> cleft <b>hoof,</b> divided <b>hoof</b> or split <b>hoof</b> is a <b>hoof</b> {{split into}} two toes. This is found on members of the {{mammalian}} order Artiodactyla.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a computational model developed {{to demonstrate the}} possibility of monitoring <b>hoof</b> structure and health in equestrian sport. This is achieved by employing finite element simulation of threedimensional heat flow from a surface heat source into a <b>hoof</b> structure while simultaneously sensing the surface temperature. The time evolution of the recorded surface temperature, transient curve, is used to investigate <b>hoof</b> structure and predict its intactness by comparing these curves for three different models. We have observed differences between the transient curves obtained from a normal <b>hoof</b> structure, a <b>hoof</b> structure containing a foreign material and <b>hoof</b> capsule subjected to wall separation. An experimental method for probing <b>hoof</b> profile was briefly discussed. It uses temperature sensor/heat source. The method can determine the thermal conductivity of the <b>hoof</b> along the <b>hoof</b> structure from the recorded transient curve. Thus, it displays the <b>hoof</b> structure by utilizing the thermal conductivity variation between the <b>hoof</b> parts...|$|R
5|$|To deter pursuits of marching {{infantry}} or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (barbed iron balls {{with sharp}} spikes sticking {{out in all}} directions) that could be scattered {{on the ground and}} pierce the feet or <b>hooves</b> of those who were unaware of them.|$|E
5|$|Triceratops species {{possessed a}} sturdy build, with strong limbs, short hands with three <b>hooves</b> each, and short feet with four <b>hooves</b> each. Although {{certainly}} quadrupedal, the posture of these dinosaurs {{has long been}} the subject of some debate. Originally, it was believed that the front legs of the animal had to be sprawling at angles from the thorax in order to better bear the weight of the head. This stance can be seen in paintings by Charles Knight and Rudolph Zallinger. Ichnological evidence in the form of trackways from horned dinosaurs and recent reconstructions of skeletons (both physical and digital) seem to show that Triceratops and other ceratopsids maintained an upright stance during normal locomotion, with the elbows flexed and slightly bowed out, in an intermediate state between fully upright and fully sprawling (as in the modern rhinoceros).|$|E

50|$|<b>Hoof</b> cracks are separations or {{breaks in}} {{the wall of a}} <b>hoof.</b> The most common type of <b>hoof</b> cracks are quarter cracks, which occur at the quarter, the {{thinnest}} and most delicate part of the <b>hoof</b> wall.

Quarter cracks originate from the coronet and run down the <b>hoof</b> wall, rather than a sand crack that begins at the ground surface and runs up the <b>hoof</b> wall. <b>Hoof</b> cracks force 2% of racehorses to retire.|$|R
40|$|Many {{performance}} and racehorses cannot perform to their potential because of <b>hoof</b> problems. The old adage “no <b>hoof,</b> no horse ” still applies today and {{this article examines}} some of the nutritional factors that impact the <b>hoof.</b> There are many factors that can influence development of the <b>hoof,</b> and this article will discuss some of these variables that can aid the search for increased <b>hoof</b> growth and improved <b>hoof</b> quality. Unfortunately, rapid <b>hoof</b> wall growth may not be synonymous with top <b>hoof</b> quality.

5|$|Eland herds are {{accompanied}} by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. It is believed that {{the weight of the}} animal causes the two halves of its <b>hooves</b> to splay apart, and the clicking {{is the result of the}} hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Suffolk {{was often}} criticised for its poor feet, having <b>hooves</b> {{that were too}} small for its body mass. This was {{corrected}} {{by the introduction of}} classes at major shows in which hoof conformation and structure were judged. This practice, unique among horse breeds, resulted in such an improvement that the Suffolk Punch is now considered to have excellent foot conformation.|$|E

5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual dimorphism is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the <b>hooves),</b> while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 18th century, the French {{government}} {{tried to}} impose a system of crossing Poitevin horses with lighter-weight Norman and Thoroughbred horses to create cavalry horses. Despite financial incentives, private breeders protested because they felt that the resulting crossbred horses created poor quality mules upon further breeding. The changes also affected the characteristics of the breed that had been developed for work in its marshy homeland, including large <b>hooves</b> and a calm manner. Some sources argue that at this point the breed was employed for agricultural and logging uses. Others state that they were not pulling horses, and were instead used almost solely for the production of mules.|$|E
5|$|General Edward Braddock left Observatory Hill in Georgetown in 1755 on an {{expedition}} to capture the French Fort Duquesne during the French and Indian War. Braddock's expedition was surprised on July 9 {{in the vicinity of}} present-day Braddock, Pennsylvania, in what is now known as the Battle of the Monongahela. Nearly 900 of Braddock's 1,300 men were killed or wounded, and Braddock himself killed. Since before the American Civil War, witnesses say that on the anniversary of Braddock's departure they can hear shouted military orders, horses' <b>hooves</b> on cobblestones, the sound of men marching, and the sound of metal clanking against metal. The sounds can be heard near the old Long Bridge or near the Georgetown bluffs overlooking the Potomac River.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years marked changes in the field of farriery have been noted. In {{addition}} to the classical farrier, many new occupations concerned with <b>hoof</b> care have emerged, such as <b>hoof</b> trimmer, <b>hoof</b> technician, <b>hoof</b> orthopedist and <b>hoof</b> naturopath. Furthermore, a tremendous number of <b>hoof</b> protection systems have been developed, with an ever-increasing application to horses. However, regulations regarding alternative shoeing methods are insufficient and it is not clear, who governs the quality of the work of the individuals involved. Thus, a neutral authority composed of farriers and veterinarians should be formed to develop guidelines for the education of individuals involved with <b>hoof</b> care and for the distribution of various farriery products...|$|R
25|$|Before {{beginning}} to shoe, the farrier removes the old shoe using pincers (shoe pullers) and trims the <b>hoof</b> {{wall to the}} desired length with nippers, a sharp pliers-like tool, and the sole and frog of the <b>hoof</b> with a <b>hoof</b> knife. Shoes do not allow the <b>hoof</b> to wear down as it naturally would in the wild, and it can then become too long. The coffin bone inside the <b>hoof</b> should line up straight with both bones in the pastern. If the excess <b>hoof</b> is not trimmed, the bones will become misaligned, which would place stress on {{the legs of the}} animal.|$|R

5|$|Horse meat {{has been}} used as food for humans and {{carnivorous}} animals throughout the ages. It is eaten {{in many parts of the}} world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather {{has been used}} for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse <b>hooves</b> can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.|$|E
5|$|Horses are {{odd-toed}} ungulates, {{or members}} of the order Perissodactyla. This order also includes the extant species of rhinos and tapirs, and many extinct families and species. Members of this order walk on either one toe (like horses) or three toes (like rhinos and tapirs). This {{is in contrast to}} even-toed ungulates, members of the order Artiodactyla, which walk on cloven <b>hooves,</b> or two toes. This order includes many species associated with livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, cows and camels, as well as species of giraffes, antelopes and deer.|$|E

The other demon is grabbing the reins of the horse and attacking Khandoba with a club as Khandoba is dismounting the horse and attacking the demon with his sword. In other representations, Khandoba is seen seated on a horse with the heads of demons trod under the horse's <b>hooves</b> or their heads under Khandoba's knees.|$|E
40|$|The equine <b>hoof</b> {{wall is a}} hard keratinous {{structure}} which transmits forces generated {{when the}} <b>hoof</b> contacts the ground to the skeleton of the horse. During locomotion, the <b>hoof</b> capsule is known to yield under impact resulting in an inward curvature of the dorsal wall and expansion of the heels. However, whilst researchers have studied the tensile and compressive properties of the <b>hoof</b> wall, {{there is a lack}} of data on the flexural properties in different locations around the <b>hoof</b> capsule. In this study the flexural properties and hydration status of the <b>hoof</b> wall was investigated, in two orthogonal directions, in different locations around the <b>hoof</b> capsule. The <b>hoof</b> was divided into three regions: the dorsal-most aspect (toe); the medial and lateral regions (quarters) and the heels caudally. Beams were cut both perpendicular and parallel to the axis of the tubules, termed transverse and longitudinal beams respectively. Differences in the mechanical properties were then investigated using three-point bending tests. There were considerable differences in the mechanical properties around the <b>hoof</b> capsule; transverse beams from the toe were 81...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are four}} layers within the {{exterior}} {{wall of the}} <b>hoof.</b> From the outside, a <b>hoof</b> {{is made up of}} the stratum externum, the stratum medium, the stratum internum and the dermis parietis. The stratum externum and the stratum medium are difficult to distinguish, the stratum externum is thin and the stratum medium is what makes up the bulk of the <b>hoof</b> wall. [...] Inside the <b>hoof</b> wall is a laminar junction, a soft tissue structure that allows the <b>hoof</b> to withstand the demands of force transmission it undergoes. This tissue structure binds the inner surface of the <b>hoof</b> wall, the dermis parietis and the outer surface of the third phalanx.|$|R
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from drooping. The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore <b>hooves,</b> suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} confer {{stiffness and}} rigidity to otherwise-fluid biological components. Most structural proteins are fibrous proteins; for example, collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin {{is found in}} hard or filamentous structures such as hair, nails, feathers, <b>hooves,</b> and some animal shells. Some globular proteins can also play structural functions, for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerize to form long, stiff fibers {{that make up the}} cytoskeleton, which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size.|$|E
5|$|The Limousin {{is a large}} framed {{breed of}} beef cattle with a bright wheat-coloured coat, not too dark, a little lighter on the belly, {{the rear of the}} thighs, between the legs, on the anus, around the {{testicles}} or udder, and the tail tip. Absence of any spots or pigmentation, with pink mucous membranes. Short head, broad forehead and muzzle, lighter area around the eyes and muzzle, fine horns curved forward and slightly raised at the tip (if present). Short neck. Chest broad and rounded. Side round. Pelvis wide, especially at the pin bones, not too inclined. Bones of lower back and hips slightly protruding. Forequarter well-muscled, wide above and very muscular. Hindquarters thick, deep and rounded. Horns and <b>hooves</b> lighter coloured. Correct limbs. Fine supple hide.|$|E
50|$|Correct <b>hoof</b> balance {{allows for}} even {{distribution}} of forces through the leg and <b>hoof.</b> Poor <b>hoof</b> balance, due to conformational flaws or poor trimming, can cause lameness from musculoskeletal injury, and poor <b>hoof</b> balance {{has been associated}} with increased risk of catastrophic injury in racehorses. Side-to-side (mediolateral) imbalance can cause sheared heals and <b>hoof</b> cracks. The <b>hoof</b> angle, or the angle of the <b>hoof</b> wall relative to the pastern, {{has been associated with}} health of the soft tissues of the lower leg. Long toes force the horse to pivot (break over) further forward over the toe. The toe acts as a lever arm, and its increased length makes it harder for the heels to rotate off the ground. This increases strain on the deep digital flexor tendon and the ligaments of the navicular bone.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hoofed</b> animals walk on {{the tips}} of special toes, the <b>hoofs.</b> Cloven-hoofed animals walk on a central pair of <b>hoofs,</b> but many also have an outer pair of dewclaws on each foot. These are {{somewhat}} farther up the leg than the main <b>hoofs,</b> and similar in structure to them. [...] In some species (such as cattle) the dewclaws are {{much smaller than the}} <b>hoofs</b> and never touch the ground. In others (such as pigs and many deer), they are only a little smaller than the <b>hoofs,</b> and may reach the ground in soft conditions or when jumping. Some <b>hoofed</b> animals (such as giraffes and modern horses) have no dewclaws. Video evidence suggests some animals use dewclaws in grooming or scratching themselves or to have better grasp during mating.|$|R
