5|$|B. Nagi Reddy and Aluri Chakrapani signed L. V. Prasad {{to direct}} a bilingual film for Vijaya Vauhini Studios.

Chakrapani thought the plot of Manmoyee Girls School, about two {{unemployed}} young people who pretend {{to be married to}} gain employment and fall in love, was too limited for a full-length film. He added the basic storyline of <b>Detective,</b> <b>in</b> which an enthusiastic detective finds a missing woman and marries her. Prasad's relationship with Khan, a Muslim tailor near Kohinoor Studios in Bombay (now Mumbai), was the basis of the film's friendship between two men of different religions.
