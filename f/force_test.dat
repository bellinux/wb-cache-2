5|$|FBI Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{has made}} a name for himself working on X-Files—unexplained cases which may be paranormal in origin. He is {{appointed}} a partner in these investigations—Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)—with his superiors hoping that she will be able to debunk and discredit his work. Their first case together is the investigation of possible abductions in Oregon, which falters when their evidence is destroyed in a fire. A later case, involving the disappearance of a United States Air <b>Force</b> <b>test</b> pilot, sees the introduction of secretive informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin), who continues to provide the agents sensitive information. This help is supplemented by conspiracy theorist group The Lone Gunmen, who are contacted for help in a further abduction case. Deep Throat is soon killed, however, when he helps the agents uncover details of a government human cloning program, and the X-Files unit is closed shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Air <b>Force</b> <b>Test</b> Pilot School (TPS) {{graduated}} {{the following}} notable alumni who {{made significant contributions}} to the aerospace field. The school's mission is to produce experimental test pilots, flight test engineers, and flight test navigators to lead and conduct test and evaluation of aerospace weapon systems. The school was established on September 9, 1944 as the Flight Test Training Unit at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (AFB) in Dayton, Ohio. To take advantage of the uncongested skies and superb flying weather, the school was moved on February 4, 1951 to its present location at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of Southern California. Edwards AFB is the home of the Air Force Flight Test Center and has been an integral part of flight testing for over fifty years.|$|E
5|$|Winckel had met {{his future}} wife Yvonne prior to World War II; they were married during the Dutch Politionele acties. The couple fled Indonesia after the country {{achieved}} its independence, {{and returned to the}} Netherlands where Winckel became an Air <b>Force</b> <b>test</b> pilot. The couple emigrated to New Zealand in 1951. Winckel gained his commercial pilot license there and joined the Royal New Zealand Air Force Reserve. He flew de Havilland Tiger Moths out of Wanganui for a time but resigned as he considered the flying too dangerous owing to lax safety standards. The family moved to Nelson and Winckel found work in a flying school. He made his final flight in 1960. Afterwards he ran several businesses and worked as an engineer until 1977. He and his wife moved to Queensland, Australia, three years later. They returned to New Zealand in 2005 and settled down in Pukekohe.|$|E
