The pulses have nearly the same exact waveshape, but are asynchronously repetitive. Physiological evidence indicated that myoelectric pulses are concurrent with the activity of a small unit of organized muscle fibres (motor unit). The electrical activity of the motor unit {{was the basis for}} the design of a simple <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tank</b> electrode system. A set of myoelectric surface potential waveforms derived from multiple-point observations were used to establish geometrical relationships which were incorpo-rated in the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tank</b> analog.

The electrode materials of the cathode electrolysis compartment include Pb (Plumbum), In (Indium) and Cu (Copper) etc, and the cathode liquor is an alkaline aqueous solution; and the electrode materials of the anode electrolysis compartment include Pt (Platioum) and Pd (Palladium) etc, and the anolyte is an acidic aqueous solution containing iodate. The hydroxy radicals in the cathode electrolysis compartment and the protons in the anodic electrolysis compartment are diffused to the bipolar membrane to generate water so as to form a voltage drop, so that the working voltage in the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tank</b> is reduced. Compared with an anodic reaction that water and the electricity are oxidized to generate oxygen, the iodide ions are oxidized to generate an iodine elementary substance with low potential, small overpotential and quick dynamic process, so that the working voltage in the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tank</b> is further reduced. CO 2 is electrically reduced in a cathode compartment so as to generate small molecular fuels, such as formate, methanel, and methane; and the iodide ions are electrically oxidized to generate the elementary substance iodine in an anode compartment. | 本发明涉及一种以双极膜为隔膜的电化学还原CO 2 电解池及其应用，该电解池包括阴极电解室、阴极电解液、阳极电解室、阳极电解液和分隔阴、阳极电解室的双极膜。阴极电解室的电极材料为Pb、In、Cu等，阴极电解液为碱性水溶液；阳极电解室的电极材料为Pt、Pd等，阳极电解液为碘盐的酸性水溶液。阴极电解室中的氢氧根和阳极电解室中的质子扩散至双极膜内生成水，形成一个电压降，降低电解槽的工作电压。与水电氧化生成氧气的阳极反应相比，碘离子氧化生成碘单质的电位低、过电位小、动力学过程快，可进一步降低电解槽的工作电压。二氧化碳在阴极室被电还原，生成甲酸盐、甲醇、甲烷等小分子燃料；碘离子在阳极室被电氧化生成单质碘...|$|E

40|$|Background: A widened QRS {{complex as}} a primary {{indication}} for cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) for heart failure patients {{has been reported to}} be an inconsistent indicator for dyssynchronous ventricular activation. The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct a detailed experimental investigation of total ventricular activation time (TVAT), determine how to measure it accurately, and compare it to the commonly used measure of QRS width. In addition, we investigated a measure of electrical synchrony and determined its relationship to the duration of ventricular activation. Methods: Unipolar electrograms (EGs) were recorded from the myocardial volume using plunge needle electrodes, from the epicardial surface using “sock ” electrode arrays, and from the surface of an <b>electrolytic</b> torso-shaped <b>tank.</b> EGs were analyzed to determine a root mean square (RMS) -based measure of ventricular activation and electrical ventricular synchrony. Results: The RMS-based technique provided an accurate means of measuring TVAT from unipolar EGs recorded from the heart, the entire tank surface, or the precordial leads. In normal canine hearts, a quantification of ventricular electrical synchrony (VES) for normal ventricular activation showed that the ventricles activate, on average, within 3 ms of each other with the left typically activating first. Conclusion: Conclusions from this study are: (1) ventricular activation was reflected accurately by the RMS width obtained from direct cardiac measurements and from precordial leads on the tank surface and (2) VES was not strongly correlated with TVAT.

40|$|As {{a result}} of theoretic {{advances}} made during the past 10 years, it is now feasible to record scalar and vector electrocardiograms in a manner which is independent of body shape and cardiac loca-tion. A similar independence of the body's electric inhomogeneities {{has not yet been}} achieved. On the contrary, the evidence presented here shows that inhomogeneity phases in the body, espe-cially the intracavitary blood mass, exert a powerful influence on the heart-lead relationship. The particular effect of the intmeavitary phase is to augment the manifest strength of normal eompo-ncnts of myocardial doublets, and to reduce the manifest strength of tangential components. This augmentation-reduction effect is quantitatively predictable under conditions of simple idealization, and has been confirmed by experiments on electrocardiographic models. The net effect of the intra-cavitary phase is probably to produce quasi-vectorial registration of the electromotive forces of the heart, at least during the normal depolarization phase.

They are all real, some positive and some negative. To determine the positions of the roots of/(z), the complex plane of z = x-iy is represented on a uniformly conducting sheet (electrolyte) ...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{object of}} the work was to develop {{mathematical}} and other methods for predicting (a) tool shapes to machine defined work shapes, and (b) work shapes machined by defined tool shapes, operating under equilibrium conditions. Existing methods were examined, the essence {{of which was a}} "Cos theta" theory. This theory, based on an analysis of machining between plane parallel electrodes normal to the direction of motion, was found to provide a useful approximate method for designing tool surfaces. However, the theory was shown to be inadequate for curved surfaces whose inclination to the direction of motion of the cathode was less than 350, particularly when used to predict work shapes. Equations relating inter-electrode gap and time, obtained from the plane parallel electrode analysis, were shown also to represent the surface produced by a flat cathode inclined to its direction of motion. Work and tool shape prediction procedures making use of these equations are described and a modification to the equations to allow for overpotential is included. The current and potential distribution in the inter-electrode gap was then studied as a field problem. Two boundary conditions at the workpiece surface were identified and analytical solutions were obtained for tool shapes to produce semi-cylindrical and hemispherical work shapes, including modifications to account for overpotential at the work surface. Solutions were also obtained by an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tank</b> analogue apparatus and by two numerical methods. A finite difference method was used successfully to predict work shapes but was found to be unsuitable for designing tool shapes. A second method was developed specifically for this purpose using a specified work shape and its boundary conditions to build up a field solution step by step. The computations for both methods were performed by digital computer. Experimental work was undertaken to provide shapes to compare with the theoretical predictions and good agreement was obtained. An attempt was made to measure anode overpotential for various metals under actual machining conditions and readings less than 1 volt were recorded. Discussion of the merits of the various methods and their applicability to three dimensional problems, conclusions and suggestions for future studies complete the work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} achieve {{lightning}} protection and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements, a proper grounding system is needed. Furthermore, the Earth Surface Potential (ESP) due to discharging current into grounding system in case of abnormal conditions has to be known. The Main objectives of the grounding system are, I) 	To guarantee {{the integrity of the}} equipments and continuity of the service under the fault conditions (providing means to carry and dissipate electrical currents into ground). II) 	To safeguard those people that working or walking in the surroundings of the grounded installations are not exposed to dangerous electrical shocks. To attain these targets, the equivalent electrical grounding resistance (Rg) of the system must be low enough to assure that fault currents dissipate mainly through the grounding grid into the earth, while maximum potential difference between close points into the earth’s surface must be kept under certain tolerances (step, touch, and mesh voltages). A lot of efforts had been taken to answer the very important question, which is, how the Earth Surface Potential due to discharging current into grounding system can be calculated. Many researches are published to present information about step and touch voltages, some of these publications depend on the experimental works on a scale model and the other depend on some empirical function that depend also on the results from experimental. Scale model in an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tank</b> to simulate the lightning events on earth is presented to measure the Earth Surface Potential (ESP) {{on the surface of the}} water and also to study the transient performance of the grounding grid when it subjects to lightning like (Impulse current), in order to know something about the behaviour of the grid structure, i. e. is there a transient behaviour that needs complex models or is a static model sufficient and also give evidence to computer model. Impulse current tests were performed on 16 (4 x 4) meshes. On the other hand, an old, but still easy to implement technique depend on Charge Simulation Method (CSM) is proposed to calculate the fields with the equivalent charges, the attractiveness of the CSM, when compared with the Finite Element and Finite Difference Method emanates from its simplicity in representing the equipotential surfaces of the electrodes, its application to unbounded arrangements whose boundaries extend to infinity, its direct determination to the electric field and its calculation speed. The results of the method are compared to experimental measurement results, empirical formulas in an IEEE standard and also to the other technique like (Boundary Element Method) that is often used to calculate Earth Surface Potential. In the field of grounding system design, the optimization means to find a grounding system which is able to safeguard those people that working or walking in the surroundings of the grounded installations and on the other hand has minimal cost. A new technique combining Evolutionary Algorithm with CSM field computation is proposed for optimization the design of grounding grids. The basic design quantities of the grounding grids are the ground resistance (Rg), touch voltage (Vt), step voltage (Vs) and the cost of the grounding system design. These mentioned quantities depend on the grid parameters, which are its side lengths, radius of grid conductors and length of vertical rods...|$|E
