40|$|The Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> {{receives}} casks on railcars and legal-weight trucks (LWTs) (transporters) that transport loaded casks {{and empty}} overpacks to the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) from the Carrier/Cask Transport System. Casks {{that come to}} the MGR on heavy-haul trucks (HHTs) are transferred onto railcars before being brought into the Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System.</b> The system is the interfacing system between the railcars and LWTs and the Assembly Transfer System (ATS) and Canister Transfer System (CTS). The Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> removes loaded casks from the cask transporters and transfers the casks to a transfer cart for either the ATS or CTS, as appropriate, based on cask contents. The Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> receives the returned empty casks from the ATS and CTS and mounts the casks back onto the transporters for reshipment. If necessary, the Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> can also mount loaded casks back onto the transporters and remove empty casks from the transporters. The Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> receives overpacks from the ATS loaded with canisters that have been cut open and emptied and mounts the overpacks back onto the transporters for disposal. If necessary, the Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> can also mount empty overpacks back onto the transporters and remove loaded overpacks from them. The Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> is located within the Carrier Bay of the Waste <b>Handling</b> Building <b>System.</b> The system consists of cranes, hoists, manipulators, and supporting equipment. The Carrier/Cask <b>Handling</b> <b>System</b> is designed with the tooling and fixtures necessary for handling a variety of casks.

25|$|The NH90 can be {{equipped}} with various mission-specific systems, including modular armor plating around the cabin area for undertaking high-risk missions and an ice protection system for operations within cold climates. It can also {{make use of the}} In-Hover Flight Refuelling System (HIFR) as well as additional internal and external fuel tanks to conduct extended range missions. Other equipment includes a wire strike protection system, rappelling system, hoist, cargo hook, search light and various seating options, including crashworthy foldable seats. For performing maritime operations, such tasked NH90s are typically equipped with the Harpoon deck-locking system, automatic main rotor blade and tail folding mechanisms, and other deck <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> to conduct all-weather ship-borne operations; it is also typically outfitted with dipping sonar and sonobuoy processing equipment.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} vein, the cold-box process uses a binder that is {{hardened}} {{through the use}} of special gases. The binder coated sand is packed into a core box and then sealed so that a curing gas can be introduced. These gases are often toxic (i.e. amine gas) or odorous (i.e. SO2), so special <b>handling</b> <b>systems</b> must be used. However, because high temperatures are not required the core box can be made from metal, wood, or plastic. An added benefit is that hollow core can be formed if the gas is introduced via holes in the core surface which cause only the surface of the core to harden; the remaining sand is then just dumped out to be used again. For example, a cold-box sand casting core binder is sodium silicate which hardens on exposure to carbon dioxide.|$|E

During this time a number of ICF subsystems were developing, including target manufacturing, cryogenic <b>handling</b> <b>systems,</b> new laser designs (notably the NIKE laser at NRL) and improved diagnostics like time of flight analyzers and Thomson scattering. This work was done at the NOVA laser system, General Atomics, Laser Mégajoule and the GEKKO XII system in Japan.

40|$|Instability in the {{intracellular}} Ca 2 + <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> {{leading to}} Ca 2 + alternans is hypothesized {{to be an}} underlying cause of electrical alternans. The highly coupled nature of membrane voltage and Ca 2 + regulation suggests {{that there should be}} reciprocal effects of membrane voltage on the stability of the Ca 2 + <b>handling</b> <b>system.</b> We investigated such effects using a mathematical model of the cardiac intracellular Ca 2 + <b>handling</b> <b>system.</b> We found that the morphology of the action potential has a significant effect on the stability of the Ca 2 + <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> at any given pacing rate, with small changes in action potential morphology resulting in a transition from stable nonalternating Ca 2 + transients to stable alternating Ca 2 + transients. This bifurcation occurs as the alternans eigenvalue of the system changes from absolute value 1. These results suggest that the stability of the intracellular Ca 2 + <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> and the occurrence of Ca 2 + alternans are not dictated solely by the Ca 2 + <b>handling</b> <b>system</b> itself, but are also modulated to a significant degree by membrane voltage (through its influence on sarcolemmal Ca 2 + currents) and, therefore, by all ionic currents that affect membrane voltage...|$|R
