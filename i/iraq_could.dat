5|$|The League {{resolved}} {{a dispute}} between the Kingdom of Iraq and the Republic of Turkey {{over control of the}} former Ottoman province of Mosul in 1926. According to the British, who had been awarded a League of Nations mandate over Iraq in 1920 and therefore represented Iraq in its foreign affairs, Mosul belonged to Iraq; on the other hand, the new Turkish republic claimed the province as part of its historic heartland. A League of Nations Commission of Inquiry, with Belgian, Hungarian and Swedish members, was sent to the region in 1924; it found that the people of Mosul {{did not want to be}} part of either Turkey or Iraq, but if they had to choose, they would pick Iraq. In 1925, the commission recommended that the region stay part of Iraq, under the condition that the British hold the mandate over Iraq for another 25 years, to ensure the autonomous rights of the Kurdish population. The League Council adopted the recommendation and decided on 16 December 1925 to award Mosul to Iraq. Although Turkey had accepted League of Nations' arbitration in the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, it rejected the decision, questioning the Council's authority. The matter was referred to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which ruled that, when the Council made a unanimous decision, it must be accepted. Nonetheless, Britain, Iraq and Turkey ratified a separate treaty on 5 June 1926 that mostly followed the decision of the League Council and also assigned Mosul to Iraq. It was agreed that <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> still apply for League membership within 25 years and that the mandate would end upon its admittance.|$|E

25|$|Nothing more {{happened}} in the south, until Iraq liberated the Al-Faw Peninsula while also re-capturing all land lost in the central front. <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> attack Iranian oil platforms and oil tankers while their own oil was transported via Kuwait and other Arab countries. Iran got frustrated and started attacking Kuwait, and later any tanker from pro-Iraq Arab countries, which ended in the US starting Operation Earnest Will to protect the ships, Iran kept on attacking and, after a US ship was heavily damaged by an Iranian mine the US launched Operation Praying Mantis. In this operation they first destroyed 2 Iranian oil-platforms, followed by the largest naval battle since World War II. The Iranian navy lost a frigate, a gunboat and several speedboats during the battle. In the north Iran continued advancing and Saddam started gassing the Kurdish population. Following this Ayatollah Khomeini finally accepted peace. But by this time Saddam didn't want peace anymore and together with the MEK conducted a joint attack to capture the town of Mehran in the Iranian province of Ilam {{as well as providing}} air support for the MEK advance in the province of Kermanshah. Saddam came under heavy international pressure which prompted him to withdraw his troops back across the border from Mehran, leaving the MEK army in occupation of the town. However the Iranian armed forces were able to defeat the MEK army which was largely destroyed in Operation Mersad. Now Saddam also accepted peace and the 8-year war was finally over.|$|E

2500|$|In his 2007 speech {{announcing that}} he would run for {{president}} in 2008, Romney said, [...] "so long as there is a reasonable prospect of success, our wisest course is to seek stability in Iraq, with additional troops endeavoring to secure the civilian population." [...] He stated that instability in <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> lead to civil war and that [...] "Iraq's Sunni region could become a base for al-Qaeda; that its Shia region could be seized by Iran; that Kurd tension could destabilize Turkey" [...] and that the broader Middle East and the United States could be drawn into conflict.|$|E

On February 25, Bush called seven Iraqi political leaders in an extraordinary round of telephone diplomacy aimed at getting talks restarted about forming a permanent government. On February 28, Bush decried the latest surge in sectarian violence and said that for Iraqis [...] "the choice is chaos or unity." [...] In congressional testimony, National Intelligence Director John Negroponte said a civil war in <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> lead to a broader conflict in the Middle East, pitting the region's Sunni and Shiite powers against one another.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 September 2002, Netanyahu testified (under oath as {{a private}} citizen) before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform {{regarding}} the nuclear threat posed by the Iraqi régime: [...] "There is no question whatsoever that Saddam is seeking and is working and is advancing towards the development of nuclear weapons – no question whatsoever," [...] he said. [...] "And {{there is no question}} that once he acquires it, history shifts immediately." [...] Netanyahu and other high rank officials from different countries had suspected that <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> develop a nuclear capability, as the country began building a nuclear power plant program in 1959 with the USSR, but Israeli airstrikes had destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor in 1981 (see Operation Opera).|$|E
50|$|Iran did {{not have}} the {{financial}} capability to purchase arms to the same extent as <b>Iraq.</b> Iran <b>could</b> count on China, North Korea, Libya, Syria and Japan for supplying anything from weapons and munitions to logistical and engineering equipment.

5000|$|Since <b>Iraq's</b> future <b>could</b> {{affect the}} {{strategic}} {{balance in the}} Middle East profoundly, it would be understandable that Israel {{has an interest in}} supporting the Hashemites in their efforts to redefine Iraq, including such measures as: visiting Jordan as the first official state visit, even before a visit to the United States, of the new Netanyahu government; supporting King Hussein by providing him with some tangible security measures to protect his regime against Syrian subversion; encouraging—through influence in the U.S. business community—investment in Jordan to structurally shift Jordan's economy away from dependence on Iraq; and diverting Syria's attention by using Lebanese opposition elements to destabilize Syrian control of Lebanon. ... Were the Hashemites to control <b>Iraq,</b> they <b>could</b> use their influence over Najf to help Israel wean the south Lebanese Shia away from Hizballah, Iran, and Syria.

[...] According to the article, Sirota's main weapons were computer emails. Sirota was described as the [...] "Internet child of the Clinton War Room generation." [...] Former Clinton White House chief of staff John Podesta said of Sirota: [...] "I just saw he had an eye for critique and the instinct for the jugular." [...] For example, Sirota unearthed a two-year-old comment which Colin Powell had made to the effect that [...] "Iraq posed no threat to its neighbors, and possessed no 'significant capability' in weapons of mass destruction." [...] Sirota made Powell's statements more widely known. Reporters pounced, and it became a public relations blow to the Bush administration. Sirota was credited with having revealed that $87 billion for <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> have been used to erase huge state deficits at home, a fact that was repeated by Democrats nationwide.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006 {{or early}} 2007, in what {{journalist}} Seymour Hersh called The Redirection, the United States changed its {{policy in the}} Muslim world, shifting its support from the Shia to the Sunni, {{with the goal of}} [...] "containing" [...] Iran and as a by-product bolstering Sunni extremist groups. Richard Engel, who is an NBC News Chief Foreign Correspondent, wrote an article in late 2011 alleging that the United States Government is pro-Sunni and anti-Shia. During the Iraq War, the United States feared that a Shiite-led, Iran-friendly <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> have major consequences for American national security. However, nothing can be done about this as Iraq's Shiite government were democratically elected. Shadi Bushra of Stanford University wrote that the United States’ support of the Sunni monarchy during the Bahraini uprising {{is the latest in a}} long history of US support to keep the Shiites in check. The United States fears that Shiite rule in the Persian Gulf will lead to anti-US and anti-Western sentiment as well as Iranian influence in the Arab majority states. One analyst told CNN that the US strategy on putting pressure on Iran by arming its Sunni neighbors is not a new strategy for the United States.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2007, Petraeus {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that there were [...] "astonishing signs of normalcy" [...] in Baghdad, and this comment drew criticism from Senate majority leader Harry Reid. In the same interview, however, Petraeus stated that [...] "many problems remain" [...] and he noted the need to help the Iraqis [...] "stitch back together the fabric of society that was torn during the height of sectarian violence" [...] in late 2006. Petraeus also warned that he expected that the situation in Iraq would require the continued deployment of the elevated troop level of more than 150,000 beyond September 2007; he also stated that U.S. involvement in <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> last years afterward. These statements are representative of the fact that throughout their time in Iraq, Petraeus and Crocker remained circumspect and refused to classify themselves as optimists or pessimists, noting, instead, that they were realists and that the reality in Iraq was very hard. They also repeatedly emphasized the importance of forthright reports and an unvarnished approach. [...] "Indeed, Petraeus's realistic approach and assessments were lauded during the McLaughlin Group's 2008 Year-End Awards, when Monica Crowley nominated Petraeus for the most honest person of the year, stating, [...] "... e spoke about the great successes of the surge in Iraq, but he always tempered it, never sugar-coated it." ...|$|E

2500|$|United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), a {{coalition}} of more than 1,300 international and U.S.-based organizations opposed to what they describe as [...] "our government's policy of permanent warfare and empire-building" [...] organized the March 19 actions. The events – involving up to 1000 people – took place throughout the downtown with protesters marching on 12th street to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building on Constitution Avenue declaring {{that they do not}} want any more tax money being used to wage war. Led, in part, by the War Resisters League and Code Pink, 31 people were arrested for crossing police lines at the IRS and blocking three entrances. [...] Demonstrators also gathered in front of institutions which profit from the war, such as the American Petroleum Institute – where they staged a sit-in blocking traffic – and at military recruitment offices. The protesters, including war veterans, demanded the arrests of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as war criminals. Students for a Democratic Society protesters marched up and down K Street as part of their [...] "Funk the War" [...] protest to [...] "put on the map all the people who profited from the war". Other protesters hurled balloons full of red paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on buildings of defense contractors Bechtel and Lockheed Martin. Many protesters marched to beating drums, and chanted, [...] "No blood for oil!" [...] Traffic in many areas was disrupted, and interruptions at the IRS were evident as workers inside were seen peering out windows at the protesters. At least thirty demonstrators were arrested around the IRS headquarters for crossing a police barricade. Two blocks from the Whitehouse, in McPherson Square, over two hundred protesters declared victory in shutting down traffic with some engaging the police while others chained their hands together inside school desks while demanding cuts in war spending and more money for education. [...] According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report published in October 2007, the U.S. war in <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> cost taxpayers $1.9 trillion by 2017 when counting the huge interest costs because combat is being financed with borrowed money.|$|E
2500|$|Cole {{was asked}} to address {{the pros and cons}} of the {{building}} war against Iraq in January 2003 for the journal of the University of Michigan International Institute. He warned that any invasion of Iraq would inevitably be rejected by Iraqis and the Arab world as a form of neocolonialism. He wrote, [...] "The Sunnis of <b>Iraq</b> <b>could</b> well turn to groups like al-Qaida, having lost the ideals of the Baath. Iraqi Shi'ites might become easier to recruit into Khomeinism of the Iranian sort, and become a bulwark for the shaky regime in Shi'ite Iran." [...] Considering the problem of ethnic politics, he said, [...] "A post-war Iraq may well be riven with factionalism that impedes the development of a well-ensconced new government." [...] He rejected the argument that Baathist Iraq's [...] "weapons of mass destruction" [...] or backing of terrorism posed threats to the United States. [...] Cole admitted that he had had [...] "mixed feelings" [...] on the issue—i.e., he opposed Saddam Hussein's regime, but feared disaster and opposed international illegality. He was insistent that any war would be illegal without a UN Security Council resolution (which was not obtained by the Bush administration). His position on the war resembled that of the French government, which is generally held to have opposed it. By January 2003, he said he had become [...] "cynical" [...] about the Bush administration motives for the war. On the day of the U.S. invasion Cole wrote that [...] "for all the concerns one might have about the aftermath, the removal of Saddam Hussein and the murderous Baath regime from power will be worth the sacrifices that are about to be made on all sides." [...] He has explained that this posting was not intended to show support for the invasion: [...] "The passage quoted ... was not about whether the war was legal or not. Being from a military family, it mattered to me as an ethical issue whether troops lives were being lost for no good reason, in an illegal boondoggle. I decided on careful deliberation that even though the war was wrong, the lives lost would not be in vain, since a tyrannical regime would have fallen. To say that some good could come of an illegal act is not to endorse the illegal act." ...|$|E
