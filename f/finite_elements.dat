50|$|In {{numerical}} analysis, {{the mixed}} <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method, {{also known as}} the hybrid <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method, is a type of <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method in which extra independent variables are introduced as nodal variables during the discretization of a partial differential equation problem. The extra independent variables are constrained by using Lagrange multipliers. To be distinguished from the mixed <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method, usual <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> methods that do not introduce such extra independent variables are also called irreducible <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> methods. The mixed <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method is efficient for some problems that would be numerically ill-posed if discretized by using the irreducible <b>finite</b> <b>element</b> method; one example of such problems is to compute the stress and strain fields in an almost incompressible elastic body.|$|R

500|$|Another design approach, {{particularly}} {{suitable for}} CAD {{because it is}} a numerical method, is to decompose the filter into a number of <b>finite</b> <b>elements.</b> [...] These elements are a large number of simple steps and ridges. [...] A number of methods are available to analyse the individual elements. [...] The mode matching technique expands the field equations of the element into a series of eigenfunctions and then for each mode matches the field at the interface between elements. [...] The Galerkin method expands the field equations into polynomial functions such as Gegenbauer polynomials or Chebyshev polynomials. [...] These methods can be mixed according to what is convenient for a particular type of element. [...] Whichever analysis method is used, the final output needed is the scattering parameters matrix for each element.
