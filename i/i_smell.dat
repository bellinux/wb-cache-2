After a {{distinguished}} career in North America with the British Army, Roche {{became a member}} of the Irish House of Commons in 1775, generally acting in support of the viceregal government. He is better remembered for the language of his speeches than his politicsthey were riddled with mixed metaphors ("Mr Speaker, <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> a rat; I see him forming in the air and darkening the sky; but I'll nip him in the bud"), malapropisms and other unfortunate turns of phrase ("Why we should put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?"). Roche may have been Richard Brinsley Sheridan's model for Mrs Malaprop.|$|E

500|$|Mahone {{is often}} {{referred}} to by critics as Michael's nemesis. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette found Mahone to be [...] "a far more worthy adversary for Michael than prison guard Brad Bellick... who's still after the convicts but seems like a cartoon compared to the Inspector Javert-like Mahone." [...] Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that [...] "William Fichtner {{is going to be the}} best actor on any show this season. He's brooding, sexy, enigmatic and a little scary as the FBI man waiting for the clan to cross state lines and make this a federal case. Add in the reliance on those pills he's hiding in that pen and I think <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> Emmy!" [...] Brian Zoromski of IGN believes that the [...] "strongest portions of 'Manhunt' deal with the introduction of a new character, an FBI agent named Alexander Mahone, played by the great character actor William Fichtner." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} to Earth and sharing his experiences to an audience, Kornienko said [...] "The thing you miss there {{most of all}} is the Earth itself, <b>I</b> missed <b>smells.</b> <b>I</b> missed trees, I even dreamt of them.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, the Simpsons {{walk out}} of the church and notice that the Apocalypse has begun. While the other family members are left on earth, Lisa at first starts {{ascending}} into Heaven, but Homer stops her by grabbing her leg and says [...] "Where do you think you're going, missy?" [...] The gag was written by staff writer George Meyer, and is series creator Matt Groening's favorite joke of the series. While the episode's ending is one of Groening's favorites, fans were uneasy with it. Selman stated that the ending [...] "drives them [...] crazy", since they do not know whether or not the episode is canonical. In 2007, Homer's line [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> barbeque!" [...] was included in Bobby Bryant of The States list [...] "20 Essential Things I've Learned From Homer Simpson". The same year, the Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma, unveiled a new exhibit which galleried Biblical images in art and pop culture, including a promotional poster for [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories".|$|E
2500|$|In 1426, two {{successive}} {{kings of}} Ava (Thihathu and his 7-year-old son Minhlange) were assassinated by {{the designs of}} Queen Shin Bo-Me, who put her lover Kale Kyetaungnyo, the Saopha of Kale, on the throne.

Queen Bo-Me, a dashing beauty who had already been queen of four kings Tarabya, Minkhaung I, Thihathu and Kale Kyetaungnyo, was brought back and made a junior queen of Mohnyin Thado.

6000|$|... 'No I don't,' {{said the}} little creature, resting one arm upon the elbow of her chair, resting her chin upon that hand, and looking vacantly before her; 'this {{is not a}} flowery neighbourhood. It's {{anything}} but that. And yet as I sit at work, <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> miles of flowers. <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> roses, till I think I see the rose-leaves lying in heaps, bushels, on the floor. <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> fallen leaves, till I put down my hand--so--and expect to make them rustle. <b>I</b> <b>smell</b> the white and the pink May in the hedges, {{and all sorts of}} flowers that I never was among.

60|$|We {{went down}} the road between the growths of young fir that bordered it. <b>I</b> <b>smelled</b> their balsam as we passed, and noticed how clearly and darkly their pointed tops came out against the sky.

60|$|And then it {{was that}} I became {{conscious}} of a warm, sly, youthful hand in mine, and turned, half in dread, to see only happy Sleep laughing under his glistening hair into my eyes.
