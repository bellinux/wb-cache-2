50|$|Condition {{monitoring}} (or, colloquially, CM) is {{the process}} of monitoring a parameter of condition in machinery (vibration, temperature etc.), in order to identify a significant change which is indicative of a <b>developing</b> <b>fault.</b> It is a major component of predictive maintenance. The use of condition monitoring allows maintenance to be scheduled, or other actions to be taken to prevent failure and avoid its consequences. Condition monitoring has a unique benefit in that conditions that would shorten normal lifespan can be addressed before they develop into a major failure. Condition monitoring techniques are normally used on rotating equipment and other machinery (pumps, electric motors, internal combustion engines, presses), while periodic inspection using non-destructive testing techniques and fit for service (FFS) evaluation are used for stationary plant equipment such as steam boilers, piping and heat exchangers.|$|E
50|$|Another {{application}} of {{machine to machine}} network is in the health management for a fleet of similar machines using clustering approach. This method was introduced to address the challenge of <b>developing</b> <b>fault</b> detection models for applications with non-stationary operating regimes or with incomplete data. The overall methodology consists of two stages: 1) Fleet Clustering to group similar machines for sound comparison; 2) Local Cluster Fault Detection to evaluate the similarity of individual machines to the fleet features. The purpose of fleet clustering is to aggregate working units with similar configurations or working conditions into a group for sound comparison and subsequently create local fault detection models when global models cannot be established. Within the framework of peer to peer comparison methodology, the machine to machine network is crucial to ensure the instantaneous information share between different working units and thus {{form the basis of}} fleet level health management technology.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} the design and the application of nonlinear filtering techniques for the fault detection and isolation of aircraft model actuators. In particular, a nonlinear geometric approach is presented for both the design of nonlinear residual generators and the implementation of particle filters. The simulation results are obtained from the application of the designed diagnosis filters to a flight simulator. The <b>developed</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis strategies rely on the nonlinear geometric approach for critical disturbance decoupling. Thus, using aircraft simulator data in a flight condition characterised by tight [...] coupled longitudinal and lateral dynamics validates the proposed fault diagnosis schemes. Finally, in order to analyse and compare the performance capabilities of the <b>developed</b> <b>fault</b> diagnosis strategies, extensive simulations are performed in the presence of turbulence, measurement noise and modelling errors...|$|R

They include applying initial conditions that the hardware mitigation was not designed to address such as slower <b>developing</b> <b>faults,</b> or off nominal grid frequencies.

40|$|Modern {{enterprise}} web applications {{need to have}} reliable functionality. Fault tolerance is one of {{the reliability}} factors which can be achieved using modern structuring techniques blended with design patterns. In this paper we improve our architectural pattern XWADF to incorporate fault tolerant strategies in terms of design patterns to make web applications fault tolerant besides achieving scalability and high availability. We proposed two Fault Tolerant (FT) design patterns and incorporated into XWADF so as to make design level decisions that help in <b>developing</b> <b>fault</b> tolerant web applications. We implemented two FT design patterns namely Fault Tolerant Exception Handling Pattern (FTEHP) and Fault Tolerant Security Pattern (FTSP) using Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP) which separates cross cutting concerns from pure business logic thus getting rid of code pollution. The first Design Pattern takes care of faults pertaining to common runtime errors while the second Design Patterns takes care of security related faults. The FTSP is implemented on top of Secure Socket Layer (SSL). We applied the enhanced XWADF to two existing web applications namely Hospital Management System (HMS) and Library Management System (LMS).

40|$|An {{automated}} {{predictive maintenance}} {{system has been}} developed based on the Hough Transform. The Hough Transform, used in image processing to extract geome-trical primitives from image data, has been adapted to extract linear trend features from monitored data. The predictive maintenance system uses the extracted trend features to diagnose incipient fault conditions. It then predicts {{the time for the}} system to reach a critical fault condition. The transform provides an early warning of a <b>developing</b> <b>fault</b> allowing operating staff to anticipate the types of maintenance required before secondary damage and complete breakdown occurs. It can also deal robustly with noisy data, including impulsive noise. It is proposed that logistic curves may be useful for the empirical description of wear failure. A multi-point generalisation of the Hough Transform (Flint et al, 1992) was developed for extracting logistic features from <b>developing</b> <b>fault</b> signatures. The new generalisation of the Hough Transform differs from earlier generalisations by incorporating early data fusion {{to reduce the size of}} previously large cumbersome arrays. A brief description is given of the Hough Transform’s application to two predictive maintenance case studies. The first case study is the uni-feature problem of providing predictive maintenance decisions for a diesel-engine lubricating oil system. The subject of the second case study is a pneumatic sliding-door system. Here a multivariate generalisation of the Hough Transform is required.
