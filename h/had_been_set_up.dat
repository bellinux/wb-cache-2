5|$|As {{a result}} of timely {{warnings}} issued by the IMD, the Indian government was able to launch an evacuation campaign and order that all fisherman return to shore. This led to more than 150,000 people being evacuated to relief camps which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> on higher ground. Due to the thorough preparations, there was fewer deaths than in the 1977 Andhra Pradesh cyclone.|$|E

5|$|A.V. Roe Canada Limited <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> as a {{subsidiary}} of the Hawker Siddeley Group in 1945, initially handling repair and maintenance work for aircraft at Malton, Ontario Airport, today known as Toronto Pearson International Airport. The next year the company began the design of Canada's first jet fighter for the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), the Avro CF-100 Canuck all-weather interceptor. The Canuck underwent a lengthy and troubled prototype stage before entering service seven years later in 1953. Nevertheless, it went on {{to become one of the}} most enduring aircraft of its class, serving in a variety of roles until 1981.|$|E
5|$|As growth {{continued}} The Churchill Machine Tool Co's {{share capital}} was increased to £70,000, and in 1911 the four directors, {{who had not}} drawn a salary since its inception, were voted £25 each as remuneration. By 1913 the businesses had attained such a position with in-house manufacturing of grinding machinery that Charles Churchill was able to ignore a threat to withdraw from him, {{on the grounds of}} conflict of interest, the agency agreement with US company Brown & Sharpe which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in 1872 before his bankruptcy.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the non-militant {{elements}} of the suffrage movement had built up a steady presence and, although damaged by the bad press violent action brought, they also gained from the publicity. A summer school <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by the NUWSS in the Conwy Valley the previous year and now their members were benefitting from the training in public speaking that was given. In south Wales signs of working-class involvement in the suffrage cause took shape through the Women's Co-operative Guild, with a branch opening in Ton Pentre in the Rhondda in 1914 run by Elizabeth Andrews.|$|E

5|$|No further {{constitutional}} {{reforms were}} enacted during the Principate. The only development of any significance was the continuing slide towards monarchy, as the constitutional distinctions that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by Augustus lost whatever {{meaning that they}} still had. Starting in 235, with {{the reign of the}} barbarian Emperor Maximinus Thrax, the Empire was put through a period of severe military, civil, and economic stress. The crisis arguably reached its height during the reign of Gallienus, from 260 to 268. The crisis ended with the accession of Diocletian in 284, and the abolishment of the Principate.|$|E
5|$|The £5,000 left in {{his estate}} was quickly taken up by expenses, mostly on his funeral. His will stipulated that £100,000 {{should be left to}} Whitby and £25,000 each to his butler, Thomas Foley, and his chauffeur; however it is unknown whether they were ever paid. A trust fund <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> for Frederick, but his half-sisters {{received}} nothing. The House of Lords Act 1999 abolished most hereditary peers' rights; consequently, as well as having no residence at Ickworth, the 8th Marquess does not have a seat in the House.|$|E
5|$|Three roads with {{residential}} housing—Manor Way, Windmill Way, and Park Way—were completed {{before the}} outbreak of the First World War. All construction work was halted, and did not resume until 1919. The Ruislip Manor Cottage Society <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in 1911 to facilitate the construction of cottages and small housing in the area, though it did not manage to build as much as had been planned. As the council took on several plots in Eastcote, only four houses could be built by the society there. In Northwood, eighteen cottages were later built in 1926.|$|E

5|$|About 200 free {{wireless}} access points {{were set up}} around the city to aid with the city's goal of increasing access to the internet. US Internet paid $500,000 up front and agreed to pay five percent of its yearly revenues for seven years to maintain them, totaling about $10 million. By 2010, 44 such points <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> at community centers around Minneapolis, {{out of a total}} of 117 which had also gone up in parks and on street corners around the city.

5|$|Conscription for the Army, {{but not for}} {{civilian}} industry, had been brought in {{during the first half}} of 1916. Towards the end of Asquith’s Government in 1916 a Manpower Distribution Board <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> under Neville’s brother Austen, but it had no executive powers. After Edwin Montagu had refused the new position of Director of National Service, as he thought the task of building up a new ministry was beyond him, Chamberlain, who was already nationally known, was proposed for the job by his brother Austen. In December 1916, the new Prime Minister David Lloyd George offered him the job, with responsibility for co-ordinating conscription and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces. Though reluctant to leave his post in Birmingham, Chamberlain accepted and resigned as Lord Mayor.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, {{but those were}} unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented from carrying out their work by the local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still under constant guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994. She used the occasion to stress U.S. support for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in 1993.|$|E

5|$|Eichmann {{was taken}} to one of several Mossad safe houses that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by the team. He was held there for nine days, during which time his {{identity}} was double-checked and confirmed. During these days, Harel tried to locate Josef Mengele, the notorious Nazi doctor from Auschwitz, as the Mossad had information that he was also living in Buenos Aires. He was hoping to bring Mengele back to Israel on the same flight. However, Mengele had already left his last known residence in the city, and Harel was unable to get any leads on where he had gone, so the plans for his capture had to be abandoned. Eitan told Haaretz in 2008 that they intentionally made {{the decision not to}} pursue Mengele, reasoning that to do so might jeopardize the Eichmann operation.|$|E
5|$|Hess died on 17 August 1987 {{at the age}} of 93 in {{a summer}} house that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in the prison garden as a reading room. He took an {{extension}} cord from one of the lamps, strung it over a window latch, and hanged himself. Death occurred by asphyxiation. A short note to his family, thanking them for all they had done, was found in his pocket. The Four Powers released a statement on 17 September ruling the death a suicide. Initially buried at a secret location to avoid media attention or demonstrations by Nazi sympathisers, Hess was re-interred in a family plot at Wunsiedel on 17 March 1988, and his wife was buried beside him when she died in 1995. Spandau Prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E
5|$|Later, the Australian Minister for External Affairs, Dr. H. V. Evatt, {{commissioned}} {{a report by}} William Webb on war crimes committed by the Japanese. Webb took depositions about the Milne Bay incident {{from members of the}} Allied forces who had been present, and used them to form part of his report. In 1944 this was submitted to the United Nations War Crimes Commission, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> by the Allies following the Moscow Declaration. Evidence about the crimes was presented to the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal on 2 January 1947, but no Japanese personnel were prosecuted for actions during the fighting at Milne Bay.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{planning}} for Bodyguard and Ironside rested with John Bevan and the London Controlling Section (LCS). The LCS <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> in 1942 following successes in deception in the Middle East by Dudley Clarke. After initial attempts at deception planning {{the department was}} tasked with bringing Bodyguard to fruition. One of their most useful deception channels was through double agents. During {{the early stages of}} the war, the Abwehr (German intelligence) had sent spies to Britain, but all of them either surrendered or were captured. Some, along with other volunteers, were used as an extensive misinformation network under the control of the Twenty Committee.|$|E
5|$|The Bucknill Committee, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> to {{investigate}} the loss of major warships, also produced a report. This report said {{that the lack of}} backup power sources was a major design failure, which contributed to the loss: Ark Royal depended on electricity for much of her operation, and once the boilers and steam-driven dynamos were knocked out, the loss of power made damage control difficult. The committee recommended the design of the bulkheads and boiler intakes be improved to decrease the risk of widespread flooding in boiler rooms and machine spaces, while the uninterrupted boiler room flat was criticised. The design flaws were rectified in the Illustrious- and Implacable-class carriers, under construction at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} Arbeideren went defunct, the Communist Party gave {{its name to}} a new {{newspaper}}, which was set up as the new main newspaper of the Communist Party in 1930. This new paper was based in Oslo as the replacement of Norges Kommunistblad, which had been liquidated as well. Olav Larssen and Evald Solbakken found a new outlet in Hamar Arbeiderblad, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> as the new Hamar organ of the Labour Party in 1925. The Communist Party later tried to create a weekly newspaper in Hamar, Rød Front, but it was short-lived and existed only between 1932 and 1933. The Oslo version of Arbeideren went defunct in 1940, and many years after that, the name was used from 1951 to 1953 for a third newspaper, published in Brumunddal, not far from Hamar city.|$|E
