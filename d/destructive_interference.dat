5|$|In the {{particular}} {{version of the}} experiment shown here, Hoek used a prism P to disperse light from a slit into a spectrum which passed through a collimator C before entering the apparatus. With the apparatus oriented parallel to the hypothetical aether wind, Hoek expected the light in one circuit to be retarded 7/600mm {{with respect to the}} other. Where this retardation represented an integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see constructive interference; where this retardation represented a half-integral number of wavelengths, he expected to see <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> In the absence of dragging, his expectation was for the observed spectrum to be continuous with the apparatus oriented transversely to the aether wind, and to be banded with the apparatus oriented parallel to the aether wind. His actual experimental results were completely negative.|$|E
5|$|Interferometry {{makes use}} of the {{principle}} of superposition to combine waves {{in a way that will}} cause the result of their combination to have some meaningful property that is diagnostic of the original state of the waves. This works because when two waves with the same frequency combine, the resulting intensity pattern is determined by the phase difference between the two waves—waves that are in phase will undergo constructive interference while waves that are out of phase will undergo <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> Waves which are not completely in phase nor completely out of phase will have an intermediate intensity pattern, which can be used to determine their relative phase difference. Most interferometers use light or some other form of electromagnetic wave.|$|E
25|$|If {{only two}} planes of atoms were diffracting, {{as shown in}} the pictures, then the {{transition}} from constructive to <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> would be gradual as a function of angle, with gentle maxima at the Bragg angles. However, since many atomic planes are interfering in real materials, very sharp peaks surrounded by mostly <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> result.|$|E

25|$|Further {{reduction}} is possible by using multiple coating layers, designed such that reflections from the surfaces undergo maximal <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> One {{way to do}} this is to add a second quarter-wave thick higher-index layer between the low-index layer and the substrate. The reflection from all three interfaces produces <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> and anti-reflection. Other techniques use varying thicknesses of the coatings. By using two or more layers, each of a material chosen to give the best possible match of the desired refractive index and dispersion, broadband anti-reflection coatings covering the visible range (400–700nm) with maximal reflectivities of less than 0.5% are commonly achievable.|$|E

50|$|Interference {{is nothing}} more than the addition, in the {{mathematical}} sense, of wave functions. A single wave can interfere with itself, but this is still an addition of two waves (see Young's slits experiment). Constructive or <b>destructive</b> <b>interferences</b> are limit cases, and two waves always interfere, even if the result of the addition is complicated or not remarkable.|$|R
3000|$|The {{excellent}} broad antireflection {{properties of}} as-fabricated Si inverted nanocone arrays {{can be attributed}} the following two reasons.

25|$|Sensory dissonance and its two perceptual manifestations (beating and roughness) {{are both}} {{closely related to}} a sound signal's {{amplitude}} fluctuations. Amplitude fluctuations describe variations in the maximum value (amplitude) of sound signals relative to a reference point and {{are the result of}} wave interference. The interference principle states that the combined amplitude of two or more vibrations (waves) at any given time may be larger (constructive interference) or smaller (<b>destructive</b> <b>interference)</b> than the amplitude of the individual vibrations (waves), depending on their phase relationship. In the case of two or more waves with different frequencies, their periodically changing phase relationship results in periodic alterations between constructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>interference,</b> giving rise to the phenomenon of amplitude fluctuations.|$|E
25|$|In signal processing, a {{comb filter}} is a filter {{implemented}} {{by adding a}} delayed version of a signal to itself, causing constructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> The frequency response of a comb filter consists {{of a series of}} regularly spaced notches, giving the appearance of a comb.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of thin films and coatings is {{directly affected by}} interference effects. Antireflective coatings use <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> to reduce the reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, {{and can be used}} to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a single layer with thickness one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The reflected wave {{from the top of the}} film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out of phase, causing <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> The waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near the centre of the visible spectrum, around 550nm. More complex designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a broad band, or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength.|$|E

Mud pulse technology step-change improvement demonstrates data transmission performance records, wide range operating environments and low operating cost.

40|$|We {{investigate}} both experimentally and theoretically how {{to generate}} the acoustical analogue of the Electromagnetically Induced Transparency. This phenomenon arises from Fano resonances originating from constructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>interferences</b> of a narrow discrete resonance with a broad spectral line or continuum.

30|$|In {{wireless}} systems, {{the propagation}} environment {{has a great}} impact on smart antenna performance. Indeed, the multipath phenomenon produces the fading of signal strength due to constructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>interferences.</b> It also induces multiple angles of arrival (AoA) and angular spreads (AS), which reduces signal quality and hence degrades the performance of smart antennas. The estimation of those parameters is crucial and would improve the potential of smart antennas.|$|R
25|$|The {{notion of}} path {{difference}} and constructive or <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> used above for the double-slit experiment applies {{as well to}} the display of a single slit of light intercepted on a screen. The main result of this interference is to spread out {{the light from the}} narrow slit into a broader image on the screen. This distribution of wave energy is called diffraction.|$|E
25|$|Although {{equivalent}} in classical mechanics with Newton's laws, the action principle is {{better suited for}} generalizations and {{plays an important role}} in modern physics. Indeed, this principle is one of the great generalizations in physical science. It is best understood within quantum mechanics. In particular, in Richard Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, where it arises out of <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> of quantum amplitudes.|$|E
25|$|For {{context of}} comparison, in {{supersonic}} flows, additional increased expansion may {{be achieved through}} an expansion fan, {{also known as a}} Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan. Moreover, the accompanying expansion wave may approach and eventually collide and recombine with the shock wave, which is a process of <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> Thus the sonic boom associated with the passage of a supersonic aircraft is a type of sound wave produced by constructive interference.|$|E

It is precisely this cancellation which differentiates the hyperfine interaction from an anisotropic magnetic field which mixes the triplet and the singlet eigenstates.

Observation of source fields and associated radiation patterns leads to 3 main observations: 1) the amplitude of subterms in the source field do not scale with the associated acoustic contributions; 2) balances and <b>destructives</b> <b>interferences</b> are present between subterms; 3) source behaviour associated with convection and sound-flow effects are high-lighted. ...|$|R
25|$|Light {{confined}} in a resonator will reflect multiple times from the mirrors, {{and due to}} the effects of interference, only certain patterns and frequencies of radiation will be sustained by the resonator, with the others being suppressed by <b>destructive</b> <b>interference.</b> In general, radiation patterns which are reproduced on every round-trip of the light through the resonator are the most stable, and these are the eigenmodes, known as the modes, of the resonator.|$|E
25|$|But now {{suppose that}} the {{electrons}} in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed {{on one side of}} the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −eV added to it, where −e is the charge of the electron and V the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Proper {{choice of}} plasmatic metal nano-particles {{is crucial for}} the maximum light {{absorption}} in the active layer. Front surface located nano-particles Ag and Au are {{the most widely used}} materials due to their surface plasmon resonances located in the visible range and therefore interact more strongly with the peak solar intensity. However, such noble metal nano-particles always introduce reduced light coupling into Si at the short wavelengths below the surface plasmon resonance due to the detrimental Fano effect, i.e. the <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> between the scattered and unscattered light. Moreover, the noble metal nano-particles are impractical to implement for large-scale solar cell manufacture due to their high cost and scarcity in the earth's crust. Recently, Zhang et al. have demonstrated the low cost and earth abundant materials Al nano-particles to be able to outperform the widely used Ag and Au nano-particles. Al nano-particles, with their surface plasmon resonances located in the UV region below the desired solar spectrum edge at 300nm, can avoid the reduction and introduce extra enhancement in the shorter wavelength range.|$|E

By direct analogy with Fresnel zone lenses, we then conceive highly phase-amplitude modulated pulse shapes that slice <b>destructive</b> <b>interferences</b> out of the excitation time structure and enhance the final population...|$|R
25|$|The device he designed, later {{known as}} a Michelson interferometer, sent yellow light from a sodium flame (for alignment), or white light (for the actual observations), through a half-silvered mirror {{that was used to}} split it into two beams {{traveling}} at right angles to one another. After leaving the splitter, the beams traveled out to the ends of long arms where they were reflected back into the middle by small mirrors. They then recombined {{on the far side of}} the splitter in an eyepiece, producing a pattern of constructive and <b>destructive</b> <b>interference</b> whose transverse displacement would depend on the relative time it takes light to transit the longitudinal vs. the transverse arms. If the Earth is traveling through an aether medium, a beam reflecting back and forth parallel to the flow of aether would take longer than a beam reflecting perpendicular to the aether because the time gained from traveling downwind is less than that lost traveling upwind. Michelson expected that the Earth's motion would produce a fringe shift equal to 0.04 fringes—that is, of the separation between areas of the same intensity. He did not observe the expected shift; the greatest average deviation that he measured (in the northwest direction) was only 0.018 fringes; most of his measurements were much less. His conclusion was that Fresnel's hypothesis of a stationary aether with partial aether dragging would have to be rejected, and thus he confirmed Stokes' hypothesis of complete aether dragging.|$|E
500|$|Crystals are regular {{arrays of}} atoms, and X-rays can be {{considered}} waves of electromagnetic radiation. Atoms scatter X-ray waves, primarily through the atoms' electrons.
