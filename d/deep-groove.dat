It {{was the product of}} placing the 283 cu in 3.00 in stroke crankshaft into a [...] bore 327 cu in cylinder-block. The 1967 302 used the same nodular cast-iron crankshaft as the 283, with a forged-steel crank that was also produced. This block is one of three displacements, 302/327/350, that underwent a crankshaft bearing diameter transformation for 1968 when the rod-journal size was increased from the [...] diameter small-journal to a [...] large-journal and a main-journal size that was increased from [...] to [...] The large-journal connecting rods were thicker (heavier) and used 3/8 in diameter cap-bolts to replace the small-journal's 11/32. 1968 blocks were made in 2-bolt and 4-bolt versions with the 4-bolt center-three main caps each fastened by two additional bolts which were supported by the addition of heavier crankcase main-web bulkheads. When the journal size increased to the standard large-journal size, the crankshaft for the 302 was specially built of tufftride-hardened forged 1053-steel and fitted with a high-rpm [...] diameter harmonic balancer. It had a 3/4-length semi-circular windage tray, heat-treated, magnafluxed, shot-peened forged 1038-steel 'pink' connecting rods, floating-pin in `69, forged-aluminum pistons with higher scuff-resistance and better sealing single-moly rings.

It used the '202' / valve diameter high-performance 327 double-hump `461 heads, pushrod guide plates, hardened 'blue-stripe' pushrods, edge-orifice lifters to keep more valvetrain oil in the crankcase for high-rpm lubrication, and stiffer valvesprings. In 1967, a new design high-rise cast-aluminum dual-plane intake manifold with larger smoother turn runners was introduced for the Z/28 that the LT-1 350 cu in 1969 Corvette and 1970 Z/28 engines were equipped with until the Q-jet carburetor returned in 1973. Unlike the Corvette, the exhaust manifolds were the more restrictive rear outlet 'log' design to clear the Camaro chassis's front cross-member. It had a chrome oil filler tube {{in the front of the}} intake manifold next to the thermostat housing from 1967 to 1968. The first year had unique chrome valve covers with Chevrolet stamped into them without an engine displacement decal pad. In 1968, the engine had the chrome covers, but without the Chevrolet name, connected to a PCV valve and a chrome [...] drop-base open-element air cleaner assembly fitted with a crankcase breather on a [...] vacuum secondary Holley 4-Bbl carburetor. A 'divorced' exhaust crossover port heated well-choke thermostat coil was used to provide cleaner and faster engine warm-up.

Many {{of the findings}} were revolutionary and are still considered quite modem. The method used by Stribeck to calculate load distribution between the balls within a ball bearing is still used today, otherwise, a full finite element analysis would be required. His measurements and analysis of bearing friction is also astonishingly accurate. Most of the ball-bearing types studied by Stribeck are not in use any more, but the <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearings he investigated were similar enough to be compared with modern <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearings. Stribeck measured the friction coefficient 0. 0015 and SKF gives the friction coefficient 0. 0015 for <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearings in the catalogue from 1989. For the first time, in the SKF catalogue from 1989, the life calculation method took into account contamination also. Stribeck had stated already 100 years ago that cleanliness was very important for bearing life and function. Stribeck's investigation of journal bearing friction, {{as a function of}} load and speed, was also extremely important, as he showed the possibility of finding a point of minimum friction for lubricated applications. He also showed that the friction for sliding bearings started at high friction at low speeds, decreased to a minimum friction when metal to metal contact stopped, and then increased again at higher speeds, which is the well known 'Stribeck curve'.

40|$|Three {{decades have}} passed since the {{introduction}} of silicon nitride rollers and balls into conventional rolling-element bearings. For a given applied load, the contact (Hertz) stress in a hybrid bearing will be higher than an all-steel rolling-element bearing.

Life factors were determined and reported for hybrid bearings.

40|$|Radial load is {{of great}} {{significant}} influence on friction characteristic and fatigue life of rolling bearings. A frictional torque analysis {{was performed on the}} radially loaded SKF- 6205 <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearings. The frictional torque formula was proposed as the sum of the frictional torques caused by elastic hysteresis, elastic hydrodynamic lubrication, differential slip, spinning friction of balls, friction between the balls and the cage pockets, and friction between the cages and the guiding lands. The experiments were carried out with the bearing with lubrication and the other one without lubrication under different radial loads and rotational speeds. In order to avoid the frictional torque measurement errors caused by the unequal length of arms, a positive–negative test method is employed to test bearing frictional torque. The experimental results showed that the frictional torque caused by radial loads played a leading role in all the frictional torque components of the bearing. Ultimately, a special theoretical model of frictional torque for <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearings was verified through comparing with the experimental results and SKF torque model.

40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} pulse {{striking a}} thin layer of liquid trapped between solid bodies will be partially reflected. The proportion reflected {{is a function of the}} layer stiffness, which in turn depends on the film thickness and its bulk modulus. In this work, measurements of reflection have been used to determine the thickness of oil films in elastohydrodynamic lubricated (EHL) contacts. A very thin liquid layer behaves like a spring when struck by an ultrasonic pulse. A simple quasi-static spring model can be used to determine the proportion of the ultrasonic waves reflected. Experiments have been performed on a model EHL contact between a ball and a flat surface. A transducer is mounted above the contact such that the ultrasonic wave is focused onto the oil film. The reflected signals are captured and passed to a PC for processing. Fourier analysis gives the reflection spectrum that is then used to determine the stiffness of the liquid layer and hence its thickness. In further testing, an ultrasonic transducer has been mounted in the housing of a <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearing to measure the film generated at the outer raceway as each ball passes. Results from both the ball-flat and ball bearing measurements agree well with steady-state theoretical EHL predictions.

This report summarizes the crack growth rate results and related metallography for field and laboratory-procured Alloy 600 and its weld alloys tested in pressurized water reactor (PWR) environments. The report also presents crack growth rate (CGR) results for a shielded-metal-arc weld of Alloy 182 in a simulated PWR environment {{as a function of}} temperature between 290 °C and 350 °C. These data were used to determine the activation energy for crack growth in Alloy 182 welds. The tests were performed by measuring the changes in the stress corrosion CGR as the temperatures were varied during the test. The difference in electrochemical potential between the specimen and the Ni/NiO line was maintained constant at each temperature by adjusting the hydrogen overpressure on the water supply tank. The CGR data as a function of temperature yielded activation energies of 252 kJ/mol for a double-J weld and 189 kJ/mol for a <b>deep-groove</b> weld. These values are in good agreement with the data reported in the literature. The data reported here and those in the literature suggest that the average activation energy for Alloy 182 welds is on the order of 220 - 230 kJ/mol, higher than the 130 kJ/mol commonly used for Alloy 600. The consequences of using a larger value of activation energy for SCC CGR data analysi...|$|E

The bearings and their oilfilms are approximated {{to a set of}} non-linear elastic springs and dampers rotating relative to the shaft when it is subjected to a rotating unbalance or inner race surface waviness. Under gravity load, the shaft’s initial vibration is damped down to a limit cycle operating at a quasi-simple harmonic frequency of small amplitude. Rotating unbalance and surface features introduce further signijjcantfrequencies which influence the output response.

40|$|Ultrasound is {{reflected}} from a liquid layer between two solid bodies. This reflection {{depends on the}} ultrasonic frequency, the acoustic properties of the liquid and solid, and the layer thickness. If the wavelength {{is much greater than}} the liquid-layer thickness, then the response is governed by the stiffness of the layer. If the wavelength and layer thickness are similar, then the interaction of ultrasound with the layer is controlled by its resonant behaviour. This stiffness governed response and resonant response can be used to determine the thickness of the liquid layer, if the other parameters are known. In this paper, ultrasound has been developed as a method to determine the thickness of lubricating films in bearing systems. An ultrasonic transducer is positioned on the outside of a bearing shell such that the wave is focused on the lubricant-film layer. The transducer is used to both emit and receive wide-band ultrasonic pulses. For a particular lubricant film, the reflected pulse is processed to give a reflection-coefficient spectrum. The lubricant-film thickness is then obtained from either the layer stiffness or the resonant frequency. The method has been validated using fluid wedges at ambient pressure between flat and curved surfaces. Experiments on the elastohydrodynamic film formed between a sliding ball and a flat surface were performed. Film-thickness values in the range 50 - 500 nm were recorded, which agreed well with theoretical film-formation predictions. Similar measurements have been made on the oil film between the balls and outer raceway of a <b>deep-groove</b> ball bearing. ...|$|E
