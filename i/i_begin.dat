25|$|So at this moment, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> my {{tenure in}} this Chamber, {{uncertain}} of what history will say of my tenure here. I come here green {{with only a}} desire to make our great country even greater. We have much work to do. In that spirit, I pledge to each of you that any disagreements we may have are just that and no more. Walking in each other's shoes takes effort and pause; however, it is my sincere hope that I never lose the patience to view each of you as human beings first, God's creatures, and foremost. I deeply appreciate this opportunity to serve with each of you. I very much look forward to getting to know you better.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was forced}} to write the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events. Upon {{completing}} the work, she wrote to her friend William Roscoe: [...] "I am dissatisfied with myself for not having done justice to the subject.– Do not suspect me of false modesty– I {{mean to say that}} had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, {{in every sense of the}} word... I intend to finish the next volume before <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E

And when it's all over, everyone's going to press rewind and relive it again. [...] It's going to be as if you're walking into New York circa 1974: There's an art installation in the lobby, a DJ spinning your favorite records in the main room, and then the most haunting performance that you've ever seen on the stage. [...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important. I want so much to make every depression dollar that everyone spends on my show worth it. And, yeah, I'm paying a lot for it— out of my own pocket. But that's OK. I just don't care about money." ...|$|E
500|$|Lowell {{returned}} to the United States and began his duties at Harvard {{in the summer of}} 1856. Still grieving the loss of his wife, however, he avoided Elmwood, lodging instead in an area known as Professors' Row on Kirkland Street in Cambridge along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap. Lowell and Dunlap married in 1857. After the death of Lowell's father in January 1861 due to a heart attack, he moved back to Elmwood with his family. Despite avoiding the home for so long, he was pleased to be back. He wrote to his friend Charles Frederick Briggs: [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years". However, Elmwood's expenses drained him, with taxes at $1,000 a year. As early as 1867, he considered renting out Elmwood and moving into a smaller home elsewhere but never did. Instead, to ease his financial plight, he began to sell off land in 1870 until only two and a half acres remained.|$|E

500|$|On May 25, {{during a}} game against the Florida Marlins, Posey was injured during a {{collision}} with Scott Cousins at home plate as Cousins scored the eventual-winning run on a sac fly in the 12th inning of a 7–6 Giants' loss. In the aftermath, Posey suffered a fractured fibula and torn ligaments in his ankle, requiring season-ending surgery. Cousins, who was not disciplined, said he collided with Posey intentionally in order to score. [...] "If you hit them, you punish them and you punish yourself, but you have a chance of that ball coming out." [...] He expressed regret over injuring Posey, saying [...] "I certainly didn’t want him to get hurt." [...] Cousins received threats from fans, but Posey denounced them: [...] "I appreciate the continued support of Giants fans and others as <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> the process of working my way back ... But in no way do I condone threats of any kind against Scott Cousins or his family. As I said last week, I'm not out to vilify Scott." [...] In 45 games, Posey batted [...]284 with 17 runs scored, 46 hits, five doubles, four home runs, and 21 RBI.|$|E
500|$|The song {{begins with}} a {{keyboard}} before turning into an '80s-inspired dance-pop number. Reminiscent of Solveig's hit single [...] "Hello", the song has a [...] "pulsating" [...] French house composition, and a [...] "catchy" [...] hook and chorus, inline with Madonna's 2006 single, [...] "Get Together". According to Brad O'Mancey from Popjustice, following the introduction on the keyboard, the music continues to grow as Madonna sings the line, [...] "you feel the wind on your face and your skin and it's here that <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> my story", and crashes following it. John Mitchell from MTV News described {{that there was a}} [...] "propulsive" [...] energy in the track that felt [...] "authentic and alive". He went on to add that [...] "the calculated perfectionism" [...] of other club tracks by Madonna might appear to be chilly, but the composition of [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] instead was [...] "effervescent" [...] and [...] "happy". According to the sheet music of the song published by Guitar Tabs, [...] "Turn Up the Radio" [...] is set in the time signature of common time, with a moderate tempo of 127 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of D major with Madonna's vocals ranging from C to A. The song follows a sequence of D–B–Amin–G in the verses and D–G–B–Emin during the chorus.|$|E
500|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857, The Atlantic Monthly was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the {{magazine}} the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell's father {{died of a heart}} attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, [...] "I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe... <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years." [...] Shortly thereafter, in May, he left The Atlantic Monthly when James Thomas Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose {{for the rest of his}} life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the North American Review during the years 1862–1872. For the Review, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell's reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems.|$|E

500|$|Five {{years ago}} today, the song [...] "Otis" [...] was released. It's {{one of my}} {{favorite}} songs, tracks and Lyrics from the classic album, Watch The Throne by Jay Z & Kanye West. This record stands out to me cause I vividly remember the day of its inception. We were in the Mercer Hotel, NYC, where a lot of the album was made. The day or rather session for that day was coming to an end. Kanye had to catch a flight if I'm not mistaken. We were almost {{towards the end of the}} album and he was telling everyone in the room that as soon as he returns, he wanted to fuck with this Otis Redding sample idea he had. As he was being reminded that he had to leave to catch his flight, he sort of brushed that off and was like, fuck it, let me just play y'all a piece of the song so you could see how dope it is. He then approached the MPC and Keyboard and plays it. Everyone in the room does the ugly face like when you hear some dope shit or see the sickest slam dunk at a contest. Lol. He then begins to chop the sample lil by lil (But fast) and actually starts creating the track. Ye being {{one of my favorite}} producers, I'm literally hype as Fuck and in awe. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> to snap the Canon cam like an Uzi. Lol. This is 1 of the pictures captured here of course. 15 or 20min later before he runs off to catch his flight, he creates the phenomenal track known to us as [...] "OTIS".|$|E
