2500|$|At around 3.40 p.m., {{they crossed}} the Northern Ireland border at Border Check Point 10 on the Edenappa Road. It was a dark, {{overcast}} wintry day. Yards up ahead, {{at the top of}} a hill on a tree-lined section of the road just south of Jonesborough, armed members of the Provisional IRA South Armagh Brigade waited to carry out the ambush. The site the IRA chose was in [...] "dead ground", meaning that they could not be seen by the nearby British Army observation post. The secluded back road was considered to be one of the most dangerous in south Armagh and as such, a [...] "no-go area" [...] for the security forces as it was regularly patrolled by the local IRA. According to the Cory Collusion Inquiry Report, as Buchanan reached the hilltop he was flagged down by an armed IRA man standing in the middle of the road wearing Army battle fatigues and camouflage paint on his face. Another armed man, dressed likewise, stood in a ditch by the roadside by four cars he ordered to stop and their drivers to position so only one car could pass the road at a time and slowly at that. Buchanan, because of the location and dress of the two armed men would have had difficulty in ascertaining if it was an ambush or a British Army checkpoint, slowed down and stopped. At that moment, a stolen cream-coloured Litace van, which had been following behind his car, overtook and pulled into the laneway of an empty house opposite. Four more armed IRA men wearing battle fatigues and balaclavas leapt out of the van. They approached the Cavalier and immediately began shooting, mainly at the driver's side, hitting the two officers. Buchanan made two frantic attempts to reverse and escape but his car stalled on each attempt and he was likely already dead before his car came to a rest. Examination of the car the following day found it still to be in reverse gear with Buchanan's foot <b>fully</b> <b>pressed</b> against the accelerator. Breen, despite his gunshot wounds, managed to stumble out of the car, waving a white handkerchief at the gunmen in an apparent gesture of surrender. According to eyewitnesses, one of the gunmen walked over to him, told him to lie on the ground and fired a shot into the back of his head, killing him instantly. Another gunman then approached Buchanan's already dead body in the car and shot him again in the side of the head at point-blank range.|$|E

Most mechanical organs, and some electrically actuated organs, are displacement-sensitive, i.e., when a key is partially pressed, the corresponding note (pipe, reed, etc.) in the organ produces a different, quieter sound {{than when the}} key is <b>fully</b> <b>pressed.</b> In some organs, the pitch or tone colour may also be altered. Small tabletop organs and accordions often respond similarly, with sound output increasing as keys are pressed further down.

5000|$|Despite {{the sophistication}} of the concept, the {{mechanism}} of capacitive switching is physically simple.

When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings {{to the surface of the}} PCB, forming a daisy chain of two capacitors between contact pads and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus [...] "shorting" [...] the contact pads with an easily detectable drop of capacitive reactance between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary.

5000|$|The {{figures for}} the revised turbo engine for the FG XR6 Turbo mimic the old FPV turbo I6, {{but this is an}} {{incorrect}} assumption and the motors are not the same. Firstly, it has a redesigned low-profile intake plenum, as opposed to the circa 1994 broadband manifold intake which originated in the naturally aspirated EF Falcon. The engine employs a new turbocharger and intercooler in conjunction with the Barra 195s hardware and software updates. The result is that the FG XR6 Turbo is actually faster than both FPV's BF Typhoon and the FG XR8. The FG XR6 Turbo uses a smaller turbo than the BA/BF XR6 Turbo so it can spool faster, make more usable power, and make less noise than the larger turbo. This engine also features a 53 Nm overboost feature. The feature can engage depending on the driving style, and when the accelerator pedal is <b>fully</b> <b>pressed</b> to the floor, it can call the computer to overboost and add an additional 53 Nm on top of the 533 Nm, making it a total of 586 Nm of torque for a maximum of 10 seconds. However, depending on the ambient temperature and conditions, this figure is significantly higher than 586Nm. Some sources claim over 640Nm is achieved for 10 seconds. Ford also under-quoted Barra 270T FG's power figures, Ford Engineers claim that the actual power output is close to or over 305kw. Numerous dynamometer printouts from various standard XR6s with the Turbo engine, as well as standard high 12 second passes at drag racing events from various owners Australia wide, help to back up Ford Engineers' claims.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was, to compare the {{fracture}} strength of fully anatomical pressed non-precious alloy restorations with the fracture strength of non-precious alloy crowns made {{with the help of}} the combined press/build-up technique at different temperatures of the first opaque firing. Three different, in dentistry applicable alloys were used, two of them belonging to the group of cobalt-chrome alloys (WIROBOND A, WIROBOND C) and the other to the group of nickel-chrome alloys (WIRON LIGHT). The ceramic BeCePress by BEGO was chosen for the tested veneering material. All control series were conventionally veneered with the ceramic VM 13 by VITA. A total of 198 test specimens were produced and divided into 11 series of 6 crowns. The series 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 formed the fully anatomical pressed test specimens and the series 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 comprised the partly pressed crowns. The firing temperature of the first opaque firing varied between 900 - 1150 °C in each series. Series 11 showed the control series for each alloy. It was veneered in the conventional build-up technique. The fracture-strength was determined using the VOSS-test. The stain technique showed twice as many higher results for the breaking strength values comparing both veneering techniques (10 series in the stain technique to 5 series in the combined press/build-up technique). According to the firing temperature of the first opaque firing, the series fired at a temperature of 950 °C of both veneering techniques measured in 4 of 6 cases the lowest values. The tested crowns fired at a temperature of 1150 °C showed high to highest fracture strength values in 4 of 6 series. The series 1 and 2 (fully anatomical pressed and partly pressed/build-up; 900 °C) achieved in 3 of 6 series high to highest values compared to the other series with different firing temperatures. Using the U-test by MANN-WHITNEY the series 4 (partly pressed/build-up 950 °C) in the group of the alloy Wiron Light showed significant lower values compared to the series 9 and 10 (fully pressed; partly pressed/build-up 1150 °C) and the series 1 (<b>fully</b> <b>pressed</b> 900 °C). The series 3 (<b>fully</b> <b>pressed</b> 950 °C) of Wiron Light and the series 4 (partly pressed/build-up 950 °C) of Wirobond 280 showed only occasionally significant differences whereas no significant differences were found comparing the values of the series made of the alloy Wirobond C and firing temperatures of 900 °C, 950 °C and 1150 °C. Due to the unsteady occurring of significant differences a statement describing the reason for variation of fracture strength values cannot be assigned unequivocally. The higher fracture strength values of series 1 and 2 (fully pressed; partly pressed/build-up 900 °C) or series 9 and 10 (fully pressed; partly pressed/build-up 1150 °C) due to different temperatures of the first opaque firing can only be surmised as the cause. The improvement of fracture strength values whether by reducing the firing temperature of the 1 st opaque firing by 50 °C or increasing it by 200 °C as the recommended temperature of 950 °C remains to be clarified in further studies. Furthermore, this should also be examined in relation to the bond strength between ceramic and alloy. After being tested by the method of VOSS, each crown was visually assessed and graded, regarding the ceramic break gap course, in different classes. Comparing each alloy and veneering method, the appearance of adhesive fractures was predominant. This suggests that both veneering methods whether the stain or the combined press/ build-up technique work out due to good adhesion of the ceramic material. Applying the results to daily dentistry work, the median values of fracture strength of all series in both veneering techniques measured higher values than the bite force values of 300 N occurring in the front. This supports the functioning of the tested veneering techniques in clinical use regarding the breaking strength of the restoration. This is a positive result for the user, due to the unique design of highly aesthetic anterior crowns using the combined press/build-up technique. According to the constantly occurring higher values of fracture strength (with the exception of one series) compared to the bite force of 1009 N in the posterior region, the stain technique seems to be suitable for the use in the posterior area. Another reason would be the limited individual and aesthetic design. All results must be supported by other fracture strength studies and studies regarding the bonding strength between alloy and ceramic under different conditions. Only then a recommendation for clinical use can be pronounced...|$|E
