25|$|Muhammad Subuh saw {{the present}} age {{as one that}} demands {{personal}} evidence and proof of religious or spiritual realities, as people no longer <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in words. He claimed that Subud {{is not a new}} teaching or religion but only that the latihan kejiwaan itself is the kind of proof that humanity is looking for. There are now Subud groups in about 83 countries, with a worldwide membership of about 10,000.|$|E
25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the group's split, Susan continued her musical career {{as a member of}} The Continental Drifters, along with both her first husband Peter Holsapple and her second husband, Russ Broussard. She was a member of Dwight Twilley's band in the mid-1980s, and currently leads her own band, the Susan Cowsill Band. Her first solo album, <b>Just</b> <b>Believe</b> it, was released in late 2005 by Blue Corn Music. In 2011, she was featured in an episode of the HBO series, Tremé.|$|E

50|$|Experts {{are unsure}} {{of how far}} thought {{identification}} can expand, but Marcel <b>Just</b> <b>believed</b> in 2014 that in 3-5 years {{there will be a}} machine that is able to read complex thoughts such as 'I hate so-and-so'.|$|R
50|$|Overconfidence can be {{beneficial}} to individual self-esteem as well as giving an individual the will to succeed in their desired goal. <b>Just</b> <b>believing</b> in oneself may give one the will to take one's endeavours further {{than those who do}} not.|$|R
500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} in the Blackbird Studios, Nashville, Tennessee. The lyrics depict Tyler telling a lover who {{does not believe in}} love or religion to <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in her. [...] "Believe in Me" [...] was selected as the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest entry for the United Kingdom. To comply with the song duration rules, the album version was cut to three minutes and three seconds for radio play and for live performance. The photograph used for the cover art was taken by Tyler's nephew, Andrew Hopkins. Following the Eurovision Song Contest, the song peaked at No. 93 in the United Kingdom, but did not chart elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the song, {{the lyrics}} {{seemingly}} show the evolving {{relationship between the}} couple. Carey sings Anytime you need a friend / I will be here / You'll never be alone again / So don't you fear / Even if you're miles away / I'm by your side / So don't you ever be lonely / Love will make it alright, which hints at a current friendship where more still uncovered emotions are present. Author Chris Nickson explains on the song's switch in relationship, as the lyrics change to If you <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in me / I will love you endlessly / Take my hand / Take me into your heart / I'll be there forever baby / I won't let go / I'll never let go. The protagonist is {{willing to accept the}} relationship as only a friend, but tells her partner that no matter his feelings for her, she loves him and still wishes to be loved by him, something she will never forget or [...] "let go".|$|E
500|$|Jasmine {{demonstrates}} several traits, {{beliefs and}} ideologies associated with feminism, exercising much [...] "feminist potential", although notably less explicit than Belle's. Nonetheless, the character still adheres to traditional romance-oriented aspirations {{commonly associated with}} Disney's princess characters despite [...] "her modern, feminist attitude", although her yearning for romance is much more subdued in comparison. Steve Daly of Entertainment Weekly identified Jasmine as [...] "a sexually aware, proto-feminist princess". [...] "New" [...] Exoticisms: Changing Patterns in the Construction of Otherness author Isabel Santaolalla wrote that Jasmine appears to have inherited [...] "the legacy bequeathed by the 1960s Women's Movement." [...] Having [...] "stepped out of the 90s" [...] according to The Washington Posts Desson Howe, Jasmine is appropriately opposed to the glass ceiling." [...] Defying marriage laws and arranged marriages are also among Jasmine's central themes. Larkin believes that her character is responsible for inspiring a change in her kingdom's marriage laws, explaining, [...] "Jasmine didn't <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in something, she fought against something that she saw was an injustice... She actively sought change and made it happen." [...] Musker agreed that the princess [...] "rebel against the social structure in choosing to marry someone of her own free will". According to singer Brad Kane, who provides Aladdin's singing voice, [...] "Aladdin is a stealth feminist movie" [...] because Jasmine is [...] "willing to give up being a princess to not get stuck marrying someone." [...] Jasmine's defiance eventually successfully convinces her father to change the constitution.|$|E

500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , I heard he was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Mercedes {{featured}} {{in three of}} the episode's musical numbers. Flandez said of her solo, [...] "She blew Jennifer Hudson's 'Spotlight' out of this world." [...] Benigno wrote that it was [...] "great", but added that it was [...] "not much of a stretch for Amber Riley to hit this one". Berk praised her [...] "amazing voice" [...] and gave the performance four stars out of five, and Goldberg characterized the rendition as [...] "flawless". Other reviewers were more critical, including VanDerWerff, who said that this was the only song in the episode that [...] "really didn't work". Slezak felt that the arrangement used was not distinct enough from the original, though he gave the performance a [...] "B+", as did West, who wrote, [...] "Mercedes looked fantastic and carried herself well, and her voice was as strong as ever but it felt a little lacking." [...] In her [...] "Maria-off" [...] with Rachel, Benigno said they [...] "both kill it", characterized it as [...] "easy but fun", and gave it an [...] "A−", as did Slezak and West, the latter of whom [...] "didn't feel that Mercedes was the clear winner" [...] but thought both singers were [...] "fantastic". Kubicek thought that [...] "Mercedes clearly won" [...] and Flandez maintained that she [...] "clearly outshone her rival", and continued, [...] "You <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> so much of what she sings." [...] Berk agreed, and contrasted the two singers with his rating scale of one to five stars: [...] "Two stars for Rachel, who sang this like Barry Manilow; four for Mercedes, who sang this like she lived it." [...] Futterman had a slightly different take: [...] "Rachel puts on a diva front, but inside she's scared and nervous, while Mercedes is just a diva." [...] However, Hyman thought that the two [...] "were evenly matched", while Canning and Billboard Rae Votta both thought Rachel was the victor; Votta stated, [...] "While the show wants us to believe otherwise, Rachel clearly outsang Mercedes". [...] "It's All Over" [...] from Dreamgirls received the most enthusiastic commentary, including an [...] "A+" [...] from West, who wrote [...] "Mercedes was at her best in this performance", a sentiment echoed by Benigno when he awarded the song an [...] "A". Hyman called it [...] "pretty awesome" [...] and Flandez a [...] "cleverly amusing take", while Futterman said Mercedes [...] "fully embraces her inner Effie White" [...] and that the song was [...] "on par with the best of Glee's Broadway songs in terms of plot relevancy and vocal arrangements". She also praised [...] "the first group showtune the New Directions have done" [...] and added, [...] "we want more". Votta characterized it as [...] "a flawless fantasy homage" [...] and stated, [...] "It's the perfect use of the non-realism of [...] "Glee" [...] and the power of musical theater to express a storyline". Kubicek agreed it was [...] "like a real musical" [...] in these regards and praised Mike's short solo, and West liked the segment where Santana confronts Mercedes in the number. Slezak was not enthusiastic about the rendition, and wrote that he wished that the [...] "scene gelled better than it did", and questioned why Mercedes was the character Effie while all the other members of New Directions were themselves. He gave the number a [...] "C+".|$|E
2500|$|Zbyszko feuded with Bugsy McGraw, Abdullah the Butcher and Superstar Billy Graham in {{addition}} to wrestling Killer Kowalski and Baron Mikel Scicluna. In 1978 he summarized his mat-based ringwork with the statement, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in science over brawn".|$|E
5000|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Archie Comics reused {{the last name}} [...] "Wilkin" [...] in a new title, That Wilkin Boy. It is unknown if this was an attempt at relaunching Wilbur Comics (the new {{character}} Bingo Wilkin does not closely resemble Wilbur Wilkin), or if the editors <b>just</b> <b>believed</b> that [...] "Wilkin" [...] is a good comedy name.|$|R
50|$|In {{modal logic}} and the {{philosophy}} of language, a vivid designator is a term which is believed to designate {{the same thing in}} all possible worlds and nothing else where such an object does not exist in a possible world. It is the analogue, in the sense of believing, of a rigid designator, which is (refers to) the same in all possible worlds, rather than is <b>just</b> <b>believed</b> to be so.|$|R
5000|$|In the second, Lennon lists many idols that he {{does not}} believe in, ending by stating that he <b>just</b> <b>believes</b> in himself (individuality) and Yoko (his wife). The idols he lists are:magic, the I Ching, the Bible, tarot, Hitler, Jesus, Kennedy (which he also sang as [...] "Kennedys", {{referring}} to both John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy), Buddha, mantra, the Gita, yoga, kings, Elvis, Zimmerman (Bob Dylan) and the Beatles.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the context}} of theistic belief, Stephen Roberts said [...] "I contend we are both atheists, I <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in one fewer god than you do. When you {{understand}} why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." ...|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "historical induction" [...] {{argument}} {{concludes that}} since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately {{come to be}} regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts' popular quotation: I contend that we are both atheists. I <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2006, Farah {{recorded}} {{a time of}} 13 minutes 9.40 seconds for 5000 m to become Britain's second-fastest runner after Dave Moorcroft. A month later, Farah won the silver medal in the European Championship 5000m in Gothenburg. Coaches Alan Storey and Mark Rowland made sure that Farah remained competitive and a few words from Paula Radcliffe before the 5000m final inspired Farah. He has stated that: [...] "She said to me, 'Go out and be brave. <b>Just</b> <b>believe</b> in yourself'." [...] In December 2006, Farah won the 2006 European Cross Country Championships in San Giorgio su Legnano, Italy.|$|E

5000|$|In 1912, Glover {{had become}} {{the manager of the}} Maoriland Worker, New Zealand's leading labour journal of the time. In 1922 he was unsuccessfully prosecuted for blasphemous libel. To date, this is New Zealand's only trial for blasphemy ever held. Then Labour Party President Tom Paul later {{recalled}} of Glover: [...] "...his service was as competent as it was unselfish. He <b>just</b> <b>believed</b> in the cause of Labour and worked hard in harmony with his faith. The movement has reason to thank the John Glovers of those early days".|$|R
2500|$|At the old time, festivals {{happened}} on the month of Chaitra in temple complex of Dhakeswari. This place was crowded by various coloured shops. Virtous people used to visit the temple to gather religious merit {{and get back to}} their home. Millions of Hindu religious people would take bath at Langolbondon on the month of Choitra on Sukla Ostomi time to get rid of their sins. People in huge numbers used to come to Dhakeswari temple on foot from different roads to be blessed by the deity Durga. It was the best moment of their whole year. With great hope they would come out from their home, and it was reflected on their faces, to get rid of their sins by worshiping the Deity with exclusive devotion and bowing their head to meditation of Bhagaban. They forget about everything- hunger, sleep, restlessness – and they <b>just</b> <b>believe</b> that they will be blessed and they step up for the temple. All those people were divided into small groups with each group having ten to twenty people. The groups consisted of mainly women, only one man, who is the oldest of the village, was there for taking care of them. They came from very long distance by forming groups. People of different ages, including the oldest and skinniest, were also gathered with these groups. [...] Young people from the nearest city to the temple volunteering for the people would come from long distance to be blessed by the Deity, with a great concentration, eagerness to the worship of the Deity and often bowing by shouting [...] "Oom Dhaka eswari".|$|E
