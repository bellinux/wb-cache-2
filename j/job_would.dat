5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds of {{ammunition}} for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and miscellaneous equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount of ammunition, but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose <b>job</b> <b>would</b> be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E
5|$|Heikkinen {{signed on}} as an {{assistant}} coach at Michigan in the spring 1939 initially expressing ambivalence about playing professional football. Then, on September 9, 1939 he had accepted an offer to play with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the NFL. Heikkinen had previously refused offers to play pro football, but the persistence of coach Potsy Clark, and Crisler’s assurance that a coaching <b>job</b> <b>would</b> be open for him in 1940, persuaded Heikkinen to try professional football. Heikkinen noted on signing, though, that he would definitely return to law school in 1940. It was reported that Heikkinen signed a contract for “at least $175 a game” with the Dodgers. Heikkinen was cut by the Dodgers after playing only three games.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Shaughnessy {{traveled}} to Yale University, which was considering three candidates for its vacant head coaching position. A month later, {{he said he}} was not interested in Yale, but that he might move to an unnamed Eastern school with little football tradition. Shaughnessy resigned in March 1942 to move to Maryland. A 1977 Sports Illustrated article reported that he decided to leave when he realized Stanford might discontinue its football program during World War II. He expressed disappointment about leaving, but believed the new <b>job</b> <b>would</b> provide a challenge. Maryland reportedly offered the same salary as Stanford, $9,000 ($ adjusted for inflation), and a position on its faculty.|$|E

5|$|Opponents in Brooktondale to the {{construction}} felt the removal of trees would ruin the village. Feeling that the village of Brooktondale was not likely to grow in population {{as a result of}} this project, they questioned its purpose. Ruining the scenic narrative of the area would be a waste of taxpayer dollars, since the road just ends at two dirt roads in Guideboard Corners. Despite the opposition, the state met with Caroline town officials and they noted that about 20 people were opposed to the project while a petition of 547 people supporting the job existed. In early July1962, the state gave the go-ahead for the project to begin, but that the <b>job</b> <b>would</b> begin as early as 1963.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, warning that the <b>job</b> <b>would</b> be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E

5|$|The Grant administration, who {{recognized}} Morton {{as a powerful}} friend, offered him the position of Minister to Great Britain, replacing John Lothrop Motley, but Morton declined. Because the Indiana General Assembly was controlled by the Democrats, Morton feared a Democrat would be elected to his U.S. Senate seat. In 1874 similar concerns caused him to refuse invitations to accept a nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. (Later, Grant recalled that concerns over Morton's ill health alone had kept him from proposing Morton for Chief Justice, but Grant may have mistaken. Well-advised sources at the time heard that the Senator from Indiana had been offered {{a place on the}} Supreme Court, unofficially, and Justice David Davis took the credit for convincing Grant that the rigor of the <b>job</b> <b>would</b> cause Morton a physical breakdown).|$|E

25|$|Her avid {{interest}} in the Celtic Movement in Ireland was deepened when Douglas visited Dublin in 1921 {{at the invitation of}} Professor Agnes O'Farrelly of University College Dublin, who she had probably met at the Celtic Congress four years earlier. Whilst staying with O'Farrelly in Rathgar, Douglas was able to take a short course in Irish Literature, as well as to study a course in librarianism. The latter was undertaken with the intention of getting a job at the Library of the Manx Museum, which was to open in 1922. However, in the event, no such <b>job</b> <b>would</b> materialise.

By the time the repairs would be completed, the prisoners would have been sent home on other boats. Instead, Mason and his chief engineer, Nathan Wintringer, convinced the mechanic to make temporary repairs, hammering back the bulged boiler plate and riveting a patch of lesser thickness over the seam. Instead of taking two or three days, the temporary repair took only one. During her time in port, and while the repair was being made, Sultana took on the paroled prisoners.|$|E
25|$|After {{that day}} of pleasantry, Gromyko {{for the first}} time in his life wanted to enter higher education, but without warning, Gromyko and his family were moved in 1954 to Moscow, {{settling}} in the northeastern Alexeyevsky District.

His area of expertise was the US economy, and he published several books on the subject. Gromyko assumed his new <b>job</b> <b>would</b> be a permanent one, but in 1939 he was called upon by a Central Committee Commission which selected new personnel to work in diplomacy.

A couple of days later he was transferred from the Academy of Sciences to the diplomatic service.|$|E
25|$|Since it was {{perceived}} by the Maya that sickness was a punishment for a mistake or transgression, {{it was important that}} the healer inquire about details of the past of the sick person.

This aspect of the medicine man’s <b>job</b> <b>would</b> be similar to a modern-day therapy session. In addition to ritualistic and spiritual elements, the medicine man had extensive knowledge of medicinal plants and how they should be used. After studying the symptoms of a sickness, a medicine man may prescribe a remedy to his patient.
