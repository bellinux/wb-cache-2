5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} edge of their natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> Scotland, although recent research suggests that it may be a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E

5|$|Bound for a London {{show from}} Liverpool, The Beatles escape {{a horde of}} fans ("A Hard Day's Night"). Once they are aboard the train and trying to relax, various interruptions test their patience: after a dalliance with a female passenger, Paul's {{grandfather}} <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the guard's van and the four lads join him there to keep him company.

Due {{to a decline in}} sightings, B.phalloides was granted legal protection in Hungary in 2005, making it a finable offense to pick them. It received similar protected status in the United Kingdom in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The brolga {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the sarus crane, but the latter's red head-colouring extends partly down the neck, while the brolga's <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the head. The brolga is more silvery-grey in colour than the sarus, the legs are blackish rather than pink, and the trumpeting and grating calls it makes are at a lower pitch. Additionally, in Australia the range of the sarus is limited to a few scattered localities in northern Australia, compared to the more widespread distribution of the brolga.|$|E

5|$|The impala {{occurs in}} {{woodlands}} and sometimes {{on the interface}} (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced impala <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in Gabon and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.|$|E

5|$|There are {{numerous}} common liverworts such as Conocephalum conicum and Marchantia polymorpha. Autumn Flapwort (Jamesoniella autumnali), a nationally scarce species most {{commonly found in}} the sessile oak woods of western Scotland, was discovered at a site on Ben Lomond in 2008. The species is named after the Scottish botanist, William Jameson. Northern prongwort is an endemic liverwort found only in the Beinn Eighe nature reserve.

Ain't is used throughout the United Kingdom, with its geographical distribution increasing over time. It is also {{found throughout the}} United States, including in Appalachia, the South, New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the Upper Midwest.

5|$|Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) (Griffith, 1821): Also {{called the}} Iranian or Indian cheetah. Formerly {{occurred}} across the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), it <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> Iran, {{and is thus}} the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia. It has been classified as Critically Endangered. A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60. Later, a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100; the majority of individuals {{were likely to be}} juveniles. The population has declined sharply since the mid-1970s. As of 2012, only two captive individuals are known.|$|E

5|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution. It was found growing on Skye in the 18th century, {{although there was}} subsequent confusion as to both the discoverer and the correct scientific name – now agreed to be Eriocaulon aquaticum. The European range of this plant <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> Scotland and western Ireland {{and it is one}} of {{only a small number of}} species which is common in North America, but very restricted in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Earlier common {{throughout}} deciduous {{forests in}} India, four-horned antelopes are now found in low numbers. Their numbers were estimated at slightly above 10,000 in 2001, and are feared to be decreasing. In Mudumalai National Park, the populations are low and scattered. Their numbers in Gir National Park were estimated at 256 individuals in 1974; later estimates at waterholes {{in the same}} location put them a little above 1000. Densities of above 0.7 individuals per km2 have been considered as being healthy. Presently the four-horned antelope <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> <b>to</b> the Indian subcontinent, occurring widely in disjunct and small populations. The range in India covers a vast expanse, from {{the foothills of the}} Himalayas in the north to the Deccan Plateau in the south. Most of the existing populations are in India, and lower numbers in adjoining Nepal.|$|E
