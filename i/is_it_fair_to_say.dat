In what kind of poetry does he excel? (Quote from Childe Harold to illustrate your opinion.) Describe the typical Byronic hero. Can you explain his great popularity at first, and his subsequent loss of influence? Why is he still popular on the Continent? Do you find more of thought or of emotion in his poetry? Compare him, in this respect, with Shelley; with Wordsworth. Which is the more brilliant writer, Byron or Wordsworth? Which has the more humor? Which has the healthier mind? Which has the higher ideal of poetry? Which is the more inspiring and helpful? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Byron's quality is power, not charm? ...|$|E

5000|$|Suppose that an IQ {{test has}} three subtests: vocabulary, arithmetic, and picture analogies. The scores {{on each of}} the subtests are {{normalized}} (see standard score) and then added together to produce a composite IQ score. Now suppose that Joe obtains the maximum score of 20 on the arithmetic test, but gets 10 out of 20 on the vocabulary and analogies tests. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that Joe's total score of 20+10+10, or 40, represents his total ability? The answer is no, because Joe achieved the maximum possible score of 20 on the arithmetic test. Had the arithmetic test included additional, more difficult items, Joe might have gotten 30 points on that subtest, producing a [...] "true" [...] score of 30+10+10 or 50. Compare Joe's performance with that of Jim, who scored 15+15+15 = 45, without running into any subtest ceilings. In the original formulation of the test, Jim did better than Joe (45 versus 40), whereas it is Joe who actually should have gotten the higher [...] "total" [...] intelligence score than Jim (score of 50 for Joe versus 45 for Jim) using a reformulated test that includes more difficult arithmetic items.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{economic}} crisis is accepted to have entered management literature following the 1929 economic crisis. Can accounting {{be blamed for}} economic or financial crises? <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that a defect or negligence in accounting and auditing {{played a role in}} the occurrence and rapid dissemination of the current global credit crunch? In other words, is it possible to find a link between the reasons for or results of the global financial crisis and the basic principles of accounting, the generally accepted accounting principles, the prevalent accounting approaches, methods and practices, the regulations on accounting, accounting audit and any relevant professional or legal regulation and accounting culture and values? The objective of this communiqué is to open the above-mentioned questions up for discussion. The answers to these questions are quite important, in that they will provide clues that can be used to shape the future of accounting and auditing. This study is expected to be inspirational for further empirical studies to be carried out in this domain...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of a narrative science It all started with the "talking cure". Let me remind you {{that more than a}} century has passed since a patient of the Viennese physician Josef Breuer in 1881 naively labeled her treatment as talking cure (Anna O). Today this is quite in tune with a shared view that the many psychotherapies are correct in attributing a pivotal position to the talk in psychotherapy; however <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that "in comparison to the behavioral (i. e. proxemic or kinesic) or physiological constituents of psychotherapeutic interaction, the talk which transpires between therapist and client has consistently been in the critical limelight in psychotherapy research, theory and practice " (Russell, 1987, p. 1; 1993). For many years Freud’s rich clinical observations on his patients ’ talking supported the idea that only by telling these observations as stories one could do justice to what had transpired. Freud’s seemingly famous, yet somehow resignative statement in the "Studies on Hysteria" (1895) that his "case histories should read like short stories and that, they lack the serious stamp of science " (p. 160) may be made responsible for an unnecessary sharp divide between science and psychoanalysis. But even using Freud’s work one may find useful demonstrations what a treasur...|$|E
40|$|During the Vietnam War {{there existed}} {{a lack of}} {{consensus}} {{as to what the}} official policy of dealing with the crisis at hand should be. Starting with Eisenhower and continuing through Johnson, the consensus was that South Vietnam was an area of vital interest to the US that could not be lost to the Communists. After the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, the task of how to deal with Vietnam fell to Johnson. The following years witnessed a messy display of force, the loss of thousands of American lives, and the unsuccessful retreat of the US from Vietnam. Ever since, there has been an element of fear surrounding intervention and {{the use of force in}} places that could potentially take the US down this same route of failure. The lessons learned have varied and have coalesced into multiple strategies used by future administrations; however, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the memory of Vietnam and the “syndrome” that developed thereafter, are still driving forces behind creation of US foreign policy? This paper will try to demonstrate through three case studies (the First Gulf War, Somalia, and Afghanistan) that the need to avoid another Vietnam, not just the war itself but the consequences to such a loss, are still relevant factors in an Administration’s decision as to whether or not to intervene abroad...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this article}} is to rethink the {{relationship}} between the concepts of justification and wrongdoing, which play vital roles in the theory of criminal law. Reading George P. Fletcher’s new book, The Grammar of Criminal Law, in the context of his earlier scholarship has led me to one major disagreement with Fletcher as well as with the traditional criminal law doctrine: for Fletcher and many others, wrongdoing and justification mutually exclude each other; for me, they do not. Consider a hypothetical: a group of people are captured by criminals. The criminals are about to kill everyone but then they have a change of heart and offer their victims a deal: if Jack rapes Jill, the criminals will let everyone go. If not, no one’s life will be spared. Realizing that this is the only way to save several lives, including Jill’s own, Jack reluctantly agrees. Jill, on the other hand, vehemently protests that she would rather die than be violated. When Jack attempts to overpower her, Jill fights back and seriously injures Jack. At that moment, the police arrive and take everyone into custody. It appears that both Jack and Jill have valid defenses of justification – Jack can successfully claim necessity, and Jill can successfully claim self-defense. But <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the two are equally right or that neither of them has committed any wrongdoing? Focusing on the problem of incompatible justifications, I suggest that we should revise our understanding of justifications in general. Specifically, I argue that, in certain circumstances, justifiable conduct may be wrongful; that in a conflict between two incompatible justifications, one side may be more right than the other; and that justifications should be viewed not as a homogenous group in which each defense has equal importance but as a hierarchical structure in which the place afforded to a defense is determined by its rationale and effect on the rights of others. The top priority belongs to justifications that do not violate rights of others and, in addition, compel others to behave in a cooperative way (the public duty defenses). The intermediate priority belongs to justifications that neither violate rights of others nor create in others a duty to cooperate (the “special relationship” and autonomy defenses). Finally, the lowest priority belongs to the defense of necessity, which, by design, may involve violation of rights of innocent, unoffending individuals...|$|E
