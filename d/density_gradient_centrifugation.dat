The {{purposes of this}} experiment are to investigate the separation of X and Y spermatozoa by measuring the spermatozoa quality, sex ratio between X and Y, capacity of fertility indicated by conception rate and sex ratio of goat boar kids. Samples, used in this experiment, are fresh semen from Boer goat with high quality consists of 4 group treatments with 6 replications 1) group of spermatozoa without separation (control), 2) group of spermatozoa separated by percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation</b> 3 levels (P 1), 5 levels (P 2) and swine up (P 3). The observed parameters are spermatozoa quality, X and Y spermatozoa ratio, fertility’s capacity and sex ratio on the birth. Quality examination of spermatozoa and identify X and Y spermatozoa {{is based on the}} standard method of WHO. The conception rate was based on the ratio of pregnant goat after the first insemination. Data of spermatozoa quality and spermatozoa ratio were analyzed by using analisis of variance (ANOVA) and further analysis by LSD if there were differences between treatments. The results of this experiment showed that spermatozoa quality Boer goat significantly reduced (p< 0, 05) after separation with percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation</b>  and swim up. Percentage spermatozoa X after percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation</b> was significantly higher (P< 0, 05) compared to control and swim up. Meanwhile, the Y spermatozoa population was significantly higher (P< 0, 05) after swim up treatment compared to percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation</b> and control. The percentage of sex ratio (male: female) after insemination from percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation</b> produced more female than male. On the other hand, insemination from swim up produced more male than female. Sex ratio produced from separation of percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation,</b> swim up was difference from control semen (P< 0, 05). From this experiment, it was concluded that spermatozoa separation by percoll <b>gradient</b> <b>density</b> <b>centrifugation</b> and swim up can be used as one of the methods to separate   X and Y spermatozoa and further can be applied to get preferred sex animals...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{structural}} {{hallmark of}} lysosomes is heterogeneity of their contents. We describe {{a method for}} isolation of particulate materials from human placental lysosomes. After a methionine methyl ester-induced disruption of lysosomes and two <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugations</b> we obtained a homogeneous membrane fraction and another one enriched in particulate inclusions. The latter exhibited a yellow-brown coloration and contained bodies lacking a delimiting membrane, which were characterised by a granular pattern and high electron density. The lipofuscin-like inclusion materials were rich in tripeptidyl peptidase I, β-glucuronidase, acid ceramidase and apolipoprotein D and contained proteins originating from diverse subcellular localisations. Here we show that human term placenta contains lipofuscin-like lysosomal inclusions, a phenomenon usually associated with senescence in postmitotic cells. These findings imply that a simple pelleting of a lysosomal lysate is not appropriate for the isolation of lysosomal membranes, as the inclusions tend to be sedimented with the membranes...|$|R

40|$|The time {{course of}} {{covalent}} binding of polyoma viral DNA to mouse DNA was followed in mouse embryo cells {{that had been}} grown prior to infection {{in the presence of}} 5 -bromodeoxyuridine. Density-labeled (HL) mouse DNA was sepa-rated from free polyoma DNA by CsCl isopycnic centrifugation. Polyoma DNA sequences present in HL mouse DNA were detected by hybridization with radioactive cRNA synthesized in vitro. In reconstruction experiments, the limit of detection was found to be, on the average, about 0. 5 genome equivalent (g. e.) of polyoma DNA per cell. To find conditions for the isolation of HL mouse DNA and for its complete separation from free polyoma DNA, cultures infected at 40 C were used. HL mouse DNA extracted with sodium dodecyl sulfate and high salt concentrations (5 to 6 M CsCl) and then purified by three consecutive CsCl <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugations</b> was free from detectable amounts of polyoma DNA, whereas HL mouse DNA extracted with chloroform and phenol and purified in the same way always contained contaminating, noncovalently bound polyoma DNA.

40|$|The transfecting {{activity}} of Bacillus phage ϕ 29 DNA, extracted either by sodium lauroyl sarcosine-phenol or by 2 M perchlorate, {{was destroyed by}} treatment with proteolytic enzymes, although these enzymes did not effect transfecting DNAs of SPP 1, SPO 1, and SP 50. These facts suggest that a protein is associated with transfective ϕ 29 DNA. Stabilization of protease-resistance during transfection appeared earlier than that of DNaseresistance, indicating that the protein associated with ϕ 29 DNA is necessary for initiation of the incorporation of DNA molecules into competent cells. The physical nature of ϕ 29 DNA {{before and after the}} trypsin treatment was investigated by sucrose and CsCl <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugations.</b> The trypsin treatment did not alter the sedimentation rate of the unit ϕ 29 DNA; however, it did convert the sedimentation rate of the aggregated material in the untreated DNA to that of the unit ϕ 29 DNA.

40|$|RNA b is {{the most}} {{abundant}} member {{of a family of}} autonomously replicating single- and double-stranded RNA plasmids found in mitochondria of several maize races.

A soluble endogenous complex of RNA b, responsible for synthesis of the more abundant (+) RNA b strand in in vitro conditions (in mitochondrial lysate), was identified.

Only a minor fraction of RNA b molecules were bound in the complex; the majority of RNA b sedimented as naked RNA molecules. Complexes synthesizing other, less abundant, maize RNA plasmids were not identified.

40|$|Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) from calf was {{isolated}} by three <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugations.</b> The first centrifugation in Cs 2 S 04 /BAMD {{was used to}} obtain partially resolved dG+dC-rich fractions from total DNA. The second and third centrifugations, in Cs 2 S 04 /Ag+, led to the isolation of an rDNA fraction characterized by a symmetrical band in CsCl, p = 1. 724 g/cm 3. This new procedure appears to be generally suitable for the isolation of rDNA and other dG+dC-rich repeated genes. The organization of isolated calf rDNA has been studied by restriction enzyme digestion and by hybridization with cloned rDNA from Xenopus laevis. The repeat unit of calf rDNA has a molecular weight of 21 x 10 (6) and is split by EcoR 1 into two fragments, 16 x 10 (6) and 5. 0 x 10 (6), and by BamHI into seven fragments. EcoRI and BamHI sites have been mapped. Most of the 18 S and 28 S RNA genes and the transcribed spacer are contained in the small EcoRI fragment, while the non-transcribed spacer is localized in the large EcoRI fragment.

40|$|The sarcoplasmic {{reticulum}} (SR) of rabbit {{skeletal muscle}} was studied after isolation of a vesicle fraction and of vesicular subfractions {{by means of}} differential and <b>density</b> <b>gradient</b> <b>centrifugations.</b> The different fractions were examined electron microscopically by negative and positive staining; their content in protein and phospholipid {{and their ability to}} bind Ca++ were determined. After homogenization, differential centrifugation yielded a "sarco-vesicular fraction" (SVF) which was mainly composed of numerous vesicles of different types mixed with fibrous proteins and mitochondrial fragments. This SVF contained 2 % of the protein and 25 % of the phospholipid of the initial tissue extract. It had a high Ca++ binding activity that was preserved for several days by storage in the presence of oxalate. After centrifugations of the SVF on sucrose <b>density</b> <b>gradients,</b> two vesicular subfractions were obtained which were characterized by different sedimentation rates, isopycnic banding, morphology, and composition in protein and phospholipid, (a) The low-density sub-fraction (p 1. 10 - 1. 12) contained a heterogeneous population of membranous structures: thick- and thin-walled vesicles, tubular formations, triads, and plasma membranes. Its content in protein and phospholipid was very low. (b) The high-density subfraction (p 1. 13 - 1. 17) was a very pure subfraction composed only of thin-walled vesicles. Its content in phospholipid was high and the ratio of phospholipid-phosphorus to protein was about 20. The calcium-binding activity found in the total SVF was recovered only in this latter homogeneous subfraction. The origin of these two subfractions from the SR is discussed. © 1972, Rockefeller University Press. All rights reserved. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

The hybridization results showed that these sequence families were differentially represented at all ages in spcDNAs. B 2 sequences were the highest across all the age groups while L 1 sequences were the lowest. The quantity of B 1 -, B 2 -, IAP-, and L 1 -spcDNAs appeared to decrease at 24 -months.
