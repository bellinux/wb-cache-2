40|$|<b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> {{diamond-like}} carbon (DLC) thin films possess {{a number of}} unique and attractive material properties that are unattainable from Si and other materials. These include high values of Young's modulus, hardness, tensile strength and high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient combined with low coefficients of friction and good wear resistance. As a consequence, they are finding increasing applications in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). This paper reviews these distinctive material properties from an engineering design {{point of view and}} highlights the applications of <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> DLC materials in various MEMS devices. Applications of <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> DLC films in MEMS are in two categories: surface coatings and structural materials. Thin <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> DLC layers have been used as coatings mainly to improve the wear and friction of micro-components and to reduce stiction between microstructures and their substrates. The high values of the elastic modulus of <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> DLC have been exploited in the design of high frequency resonators and comb-drives for communication and sensing applications. Chemically modified surfaces <b>and</b> structures of <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> DLC films have both been utilized as sensor materials for sensing traces of gases, to detect bio-molecules for biological research and disease diagnosis...|$|R
5|$|The diamond {{industry}} can be separated into two distinct categories: one dealing with gem-grade <b>diamonds</b> <b>and</b> another for industrial-grade diamonds. Both markets value diamonds differently.|$|E
5|$|The diamond {{industry}} {{falls into}} two categories: one dealing with gem-grade <b>diamonds</b> <b>and</b> the other, with industrial-grade diamonds. While a large trade in {{both types of}} diamonds exists, the two markets act in dramatically different ways.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{precious}} metals such as gold or platinum, gem diamonds do not trade as a commodity: {{there is a}} substantial mark-up in the sale of <b>diamonds,</b> <b>and</b> there is not a very active market for resale of diamonds.|$|E
40|$|Hydrogen surface {{conductivity}} {{has been}} a controversial subject since its discovery. Initial plasma treatments on single crystal <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> polycrystalline <b>diamond</b> have lead to {{the widespread use of}} this material in active electronics. However, “Black” polycrystalline diamond, usually termed “Thermal Management Grade”, shows carrier concentration and mobility values similar to both white polycrystalline <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> single crystal material. Schottky contacts have also been fabricated and show promising characteristics. Black diamond can be grown considerably faster than white <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> is hence much cheaper...|$|R

5|$|Diamond {{hardness}} {{depends on}} its purity, crystalline perfection and orientation: hardness is higher for flawless, pure crystals oriented to the <111> direction (along the longest diagonal of the cubic diamond lattice). Therefore, whereas {{it might be possible}} to scratch some diamonds with other materials, such as boron nitride, the hardest diamonds can only be scratched by other <b>diamonds</b> <b>and</b> nanocrystalline diamond aggregates.|$|E

5|$|The Kimberley Process was {{developed}} to monitor the trade in rough <b>diamonds</b> <b>and</b> prevent their being used to fund violence. Before exporting, rough diamonds are certificated {{by the government of}} the country of origin. Some countries, such as Venezuela, are not party to the agreement. The Kimberley Process does not apply to local sales of rough diamonds within a country.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} between gem-quality <b>diamonds</b> <b>and</b> industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (for example, if demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones {{rather than being}} sold for industrial use). Within the category of industrial diamonds, there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as bort.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{impurity}} in diamond is nitrogen, which can comprise up to 1% of a diamond by mass. Previously, all lattice defects in diamond {{were thought to}} be the result of structural anomalies; later research revealed nitrogen to be present in most <b>diamonds</b> <b>and</b> in many different configurations. Most nitrogen enters the diamond lattice as a single atom (i.e. nitrogen-containing molecules dissociate before incorporation), however, molecular nitrogen incorporates into diamond as well.|$|E

In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic <b>diamonds,</b> <b>and</b> rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E

50|$|Aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, <b>diamond,</b> <b>and</b> cubic {{boron nitride}} (CBN) are four {{commonly}} used abrasive {{materials for the}} surface of the grinding wheels. Of these materials, aluminum oxide is the most common. Because of cost, <b>diamond</b> <b>and</b> CBN grinding wheels are generally made with a core of less expensive material surrounded by a layer of diamond or CBN. <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> CBN wheels are very hard and are capable of economically grinding materials, such as ceramics and carbides, that cannot be ground by aluminum oxide or silicon carbide wheels.|$|R

500|$|As {{with other}} generations of Pokémon games, <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Pearl {{retained}} the basic gameplay of their predecessors while introducing additional new features.

In previous generations, Pokémon moves were classified as [...] "physical" [...] or [...] "special" [...] based on their type; for example, all Fire-type moves were special and all Ground-type moves were physical. In <b>Diamond</b> <b>and</b> Pearl, however, moves are categorized into three groups.

She attempts to persuade Frazier to drop his investigation, but he refuses, playing a recording of an incriminating conversation that she had with him.
