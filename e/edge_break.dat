The northern samples (facies A) are clast-rich, overcon-solidated lodgement tills or proximal glacimarine sediments containing sparse reworked microfaunas. The southern samples (facies B) are distal glacimarine plastic silty clays containing abundant cold water microfaunas.

40|$|It is {{generally}} acknowledged {{that in most}} circumstances, some special treatment of an asphalt surface is required to improve aircraft braking in wet conditions. It is increasingly common for transverse grooves to be sawn in the runway surface for this purpose. Grooves introduce a number of potential distress mechanisms that are not present in an ungrooved surface including, rubber filling the grooves, reduction of groove depth due to surface erosion, groove <b>edge</b> <b>break</b> and groove closure. Groove loss by closure is the most concerning form of distress as this usually occurs early in the surface's life and cannot be corrected by re-sawing the grooves. Asphalt resurfacing and regrooving after removal of the closed grooves is required. In addition, maintenance activities such as crack filling, surface rejuvenation sprayed treatments, patching and resurfacing, require additional consideration when grooves are present. Despite the difficulties associated with grooves, sawing of grooves is now the most common method used for improving aircraft braking performance on wet asphalt runways...|$|E
40|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} strategy in animals to prevent predation. This includes disruptive coloration, where high-contrast markings placed at an animal's <b>edge</b> <b>break</b> up the true body shape. Successful disruption may also involve non-marginal markings found {{away from the body}} outline that create ‘false edges’ more salient than the true body form (‘surface disruption’). However, previous work has focused on breaking up the true body outline, not on surface disruption. Furthermore, while high contrast may enhance disruption, it is untested where on the body different contrasts should be placed for maximum effect. We used artificial prey presented to wild avian predators in the field, to determine the effectiveness of surface disruption, and of different luminance contrast placed in different prey locations. Disruptive coloration was no more effective when comprising high luminance contrast per se, but its effectiveness was dramatically increased with high-contrast markings placed away from the body outline, creating effective surface disruption. A model of avian visual edge processing showed that surface disruption does not make object detection more difficult simply by creating false edges away from the true body outline, but its effect may also be based on a different visual mechanism. Our study has implications for whether animals can combine disruptive coloration with other ‘conspicuous’ signalling strategies...|$|E

The purposes for the project is together with suitable partners demonstrate an automated system together with sensors for deburring not well-positioned surfaces. The <b>edge</b> <b>break</b> is now done partly manual because of robots limitation in achieving the required quality and accuracy. A typical edge breaking requirement is 0, 38 - 0, 76 mm on discs. Aero engine components are often exposed to high stress levels and vibrations during operations. Burrs and sharp edges on these components can lead to edge cracking and component failure. So therefore removal of burrs and creating rounded edges is necessary. Sensors {{can be used as a}} helping tool managing the problem with removing burrs that you with certainty not can define the size of, at the same time edge position varying. General there are four problems VAC wish to solve: 1. Robots have bad path following. 2. The position on the edges deviates from component to component. 3. Size of the burrs (root thickness) is varying. 4. Work hardening of material and burrs is different from component to component. This project demands an overall solution for a system that can work integrated together and within VAC tolerances.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} detecting axes of bilateral symmetry in images. In order to achieve robustness to variation in illumination, only edge gradient information is used. To overcome the problem of <b>edge</b> <b>breaks</b> a potential field is developed from the edge map which spreads {{the information in the}} image plane. Pairs of points in the image plane are made to vote for their axes of symmetry with some confidence values. To make the method robust to overlapping objects, only local features in the form of Taylor coefficients are used for quantifying symmetry. We define an axis of symmetry histogram, which is used to accumulate the weighted votes for all possible axes of symmetry. To reduce the computational complexity of voting, a hashing scheme is proposed, wherein pairs of points, whose potential fields are too asymmetric, are pruned by not being counted for the vote. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is fairly robust to <b>edge</b> <b>breaks,</b> and is able to detect symmetries even when only 0. 05 % of the possible pairs are used for voting...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate methods of improving fastener and joint performance in wood-based composite case furniture. In general, several types of joints and fasteners were tested and evaluated. This study, accordingly, provides much of the information needed for the product engineering of case furniture constructed of particleboard and medium density fiberboard. In order to achieve the desired objective and to produce practical results, the boards chosen for the project were representative of the quality of the material usually used in the construction of case furniture. Results of the <b>edge</b> <b>breaking</b> strength tests indicated that breaking strength of the corner joints increased approximately in proportion to the square root of both IB and MOR properties. A clear relationship between <b>edge</b> <b>breaking</b> strength and MOE, MOR, and IB could not be found in either the tension or the compression tests. Edge pull-out test results indicated that edge distance and hole diameter have a significant effect on the edge pull-out strength of the particleboard and medium density fiberboard. Test results for withdrawal strength of screws indicate that both face and edge withdrawal strength of screws were close to what have been obtained in the previous studies done by Eckelman. Using adhesive with screw, withdrawal strength resistance was increased in both MDF and particleboard panels. It is clear that the performance of the joints is not related to the cost of the fasteners. In many cases, joints with low performance were the most expensive. Cap screws, for example, had the highest cost but low performance. On the other hand, sheet metal screws with glue were cheaper but higher in performance. ...|$|R

The paper examines the consequences of a broken Dirac fermion parity in the framework of the effective boundary conditions varying from the Berry-Mondragon mass confinement to a zigzag <b>edge.</b> The parity <b>breaking</b> reflects the structural sublattice asymmetry of zigzag-type edges and is closely related to the previously predicted time-reversal symmetric edge states. We calculate the local and global densities of the edge states and show that they carry a specific polarization, resembling, to some extent, that of spin-polarized materials. The lack of the parity leads to a nonanalytical particle-hole asymmetry in the edge-state properties. We use our findings to interpret recently observed tunneling spectra in zigzag-terminated graphene. We also propose a graphene-based tunneling device where the particle-hole asymmetric edge states result in a strongly nonlinear conductance-voltage characteristics, which could be used to manipulate the tunneling transport.

FBS directly encounters with ambient air, as a consequence ice accretion may occur on its static vanes.

A specific flow visualization method was used for the experimental study. Vane surface near the trailing edge was dyed and thinner was injected into anti-ice jet flow in order to remove dye from the vane surface.
