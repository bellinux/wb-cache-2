50|$|It was {{discovered}} by Adco Co. and introduced as <b>diiodohydroxyquinoline.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{quinoline}} derivative <b>diiodohydroxyquinoline</b> (INN) or iodoquinol (USAN), {{can be used}} in the treatment of amoebiasis.|$|E
50|$|This {{nitroimidazole}} compound, like metronidazole, {{has shown}} a marked therapeutic response in amoebic liver abscess. Occasional side effects include nausea and dizziness. Tinidazole is not widely available though it {{is more effective than}} metronidazole. Zuberi and Ibrahim found tinidazole to be effective in 86.7% cases of intestinal amoebiasis and in 100% cases of amoebic liver abscess.Luminal amoebicides like halogenated oxyquinolines, e.g. <b>diiodohydroxyquinoline</b> in a dose of 0.6 G. thrice daily for 3 weeks, diloxanide furoate 0.5 G. three times a day for 10 days and sometimes tetracyclines 1-2 G./day for 5 days should be used concurrently with any of the above drugs as adjuncts to eliminate intestinal infection.|$|E
50|$|Thirdly, {{treatment}} of the infection and inflammation of the lesions themselves is addressed. This is usually with topical antifungal medication, such as clotrimazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, or nystatin cream. Some antifungal creams are combined with corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone or triamcinolone to reduce inflammation, and certain antifungals such as miconazole also have some antibacterial action. <b>Diiodohydroxyquinoline</b> is another topical therapy for angular cheilitis. If Staphylococcus aureus infection is demonstrated by microbiological culture to be responsible (or suspected), the treatment may be changed to fusidic acid cream, an antibiotic which is effective against this type of bacteria. Aside from fusidic acid, neomycin, mupirocin, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine are alternative options in this scenario.|$|E
