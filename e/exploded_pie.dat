50|$|A chart {{with one}} or more sectors {{separated}} {{from the rest of the}} disk is known as an <b>exploded</b> <b>pie</b> chart. This effect is used to either highlight a sector, or to highlight smaller segments of the chart with small proportions.|$|E

Usually such diagrams have the part identification number and a label indicating which part fills the particular position in the diagram.

The Terenzis arrive in their ice cream truck and use the intercom to distract the aliens. A gargantuan klown marionette, Jojo the Klownzilla (Charles Chiodo), descends from the ceiling, [...] breaks free from its strings, and attacks. After Jojo destroys the ice cream truck, apparently killing the Terenzis, Dave creates a distraction and Mike and Debbie are able to escape the structure. The tent begins to spin and rises into the air, revealing {{it to be a}} massive spaceship. Back inside, Jojo grabs hold of Dave, who removes his police badge and uses it to destroy the klowns nose.

The scope of this project is narrow in that only one specific Subject Gateway is considered in any detail, others being considered through a smaller scale evaluation. A user survey was undertaken in late 2001, involving both a paper and online questionnaire. Results were collated and presented in <b>exploded</b> <b>pie</b> graphical representations. Results from the survey have suggested that the service is perceived as useful and successful in its present form, and is used in many countries worldw ide. The result...|$|E
