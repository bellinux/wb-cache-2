50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} {{of light}} fuel oil, very similar to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the injector pump and injectors adequately, and its <b>ignition</b> <b>qualities</b> (<b>ignition</b> delay, cetane number). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate appearance of surface ignition- postignition experienced inside the engine cylinder and correlate it with the nature of the spark ignition combustion prior to the onset of surface ignition. The test engine used to carry out all experiments was a Jaguar optical single-cylinder engine, operating in spark-ignition mode, although with negative valve overlap. The optical configuration of the engine allows characterizing and analyzing combustion process based on the processing of captured images in correlation with in-cylinder pressure and other parameters recorded with regard to instantaneous engine operating conditions. Results of the experiments covered in this publication focus on flame propagation and development as well as reveal occurrence of abnormal combustion processes. Experimental observations, especially the captured images show a relationship between the nature of normal combustion process initiated by spark discharge and the existence of abnormal combustion phenomena. All tests were performed under fixed engine conditions – constant speed and single component hydrocarbon fuel. Because the nature of fuel can shape the combustion process, a brief discussion and a proposed correlation of anti-knock, auto-ignition, and resistance to surface <b>ignition</b> <b>qualities</b> of a few single-and multi-component fuels is presented. Finally the publication leads to provide an indication of possible solutions concerning the problem of uncontrolled post-ignition events in optical engines...|$|R

40|$|In this work, multi-dimensional {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} modeling predictions are compared for three different methods of achieving high-efficiency, low NOT, and soot premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) combustion. The first method is early injection, highly dilute (i. e., low oxygen concentration), diesel fuel PCCI operation. In this method, the oxygen concentration is reduced to extend the ignition delay to allow adequate time for mixing prior to autoignition. The second method is early injection PCCI operation using neat ethanol. In this method, the fuel reactivity is sufficiently low such that PCCI combustion can be achieved without using external dilution. The final method, dual-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion, blends fuels with different <b>ignition</b> <b>qualities</b> in the combustion chamber to tailor the auto-ignition properties of the mixture for the specific operating condition. In this study, RCCI operation was investigated using in-cylinder fuel blending of diesel fuel and gasoline as well as diesel fuel and an E 85 blend (i. e., 85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline). It {{was found that the}} modeling approach used in this work is capable of capturing the bulk combustion characteristics (e. g., cylinder pressure) as well as the details of the injection event (e. g., liquid penetration) and ignition processes. The simulations were shown to provide accurate predictions of the differences in combustion characteristics of diesel fuel, ethanol, and fuel blends (i. e., gasoline + diesel fuel and E 85 + diesel fuel). It was found that the ethanol PCCI and dual-fuel (gasoline + diesel fuel and E 85 + diesel fuel) RCCI cases have significantly reduced rates of energy release compared to neat diesel fuel PCCI operation. The reduced energy release rates of the ethanol PCCI and dual-fuel RCCI cases may allow these modes of PCCI combustion to achieve higher engine loads than that of neat diesel PCCI...|$|R

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model is}} presented for vaporization and combustion of heavy residual based fuel oil in high-pressure sprays, {{in the context}} of marine diesel engines. The fuel is considered as a mix of residual base and cutter stock. The model accounts for multiple fuel components as well as limited diffusion rates and thermal decomposition rates within droplets by the use of straight-line relationships for the saturation pressure of combustible fuel vapour at the droplet surface as functions of droplet temperature. The energy required for decomposition of heavy molecules is accounted for. Combustion is modelled using a timescale that is the sum of a kinetic timescale based on a single-step reaction and a turbulent timescale based on turbulent mixing rates. The ignition timescale is based on a simple three-equation model. Cellwise ignition is employed. The heavy fuel oil model is applied to two different constant volume chambers that are used to test <b>ignition</b> and combustion <b>quality</b> of marine heavy fuel oil, using the computational fluid dynamics code StarCD version 3. 2. Good agreement is shown between trends in measured and computed data including ignition delay, burn rate and spatial distribution of spray and flame parameters. The model is tested for two representative fuels, one with good ignition and combustion properties and one poor. Essentially only two parameters need to be changed to set the fuel quality. These are the ignition delay factor and the activation energy for the high-temperature kinetics. Further tuning of the model to specific fuels is possible by modifying the saturation temperature relationships...|$|R

Over the last few years biodiesel has gained importance as an alternative fuel for diesel engines. Manufacturing biodiesel from plant oil is relatively easy and possesses many environment benefits. Besides, what makes biodiesel all the more attractive is that it can be derived from waste cooking oil produced in large quantities in public eateries. The purpose of this project is to analyze the potential of waste cooking oil (WCO) for their suitability as feed stock for biodiesel preparation and to compare the fuel properties of the derived esters of WCO (WCO-biodiesel) with those esters of fresh oil and baseline diesel fuel.

40|$|The {{design process}} for {{development}} of engines could be made faster and less expensive {{with the help of}} computations which help understanding the processes prevalent in internal combustion engines. Running engine simulations are challenging as they need to accurately capture the fluid dynamic and chemical kinetic processes that occur in an engine. A major challenge in simulating chemical kinetic processes is the complexity of the fuel chemistry: real fuels are complex mixtures whose composition determines their physical properties and reactivity. The behavior of these real fuels can be conveniently represented using simpler mixtures often called “surrogates mixtures” that match the key properties of the real fuels. Successful modeling of the ignition of real fuel first requires the formulation of an appropriate surrogate mixture whose compositions are carefully chosen in order to best emulate the combustion properties of the targeted real fuel. Then a comprehensive chemical kinetic model developed based on the surrogate fuel is used to simulate the combustion process of the real fuel. The work presented in the current dissertation intends to systematically study the surrogate modeling of diesel fuels. The study has been conducted to understand the ignition of surrogate fuel constituents and fully blended diesel fuels. Autoignition of tetralin, 1 -methylnaphthalene, iso-cetane, and n-dodecane, the constituents of diesel surrogates, are investigated in the current dissertation. Besides, ignition of binary blends of the surrogate constituents has also been studied to investigate the effects of blending on ignition when neat components are blended to formulate a surrogate fuel. Furthermore, the ignition of two fully blended research grade diesel fuels has also been conducted inorder to provide <b>quality</b> <b>ignition</b> delay data for development and validation of chemical kinetic models of kinetic fuels...|$|R

50|$|The {{running of}} all {{internal}} combustion engines {{is dependent on}} the <b>ignition</b> <b>quality</b> of the fuel. For spark-ignition engines the fuel has an octane rating.

Cetane numbers are tested using a special test engine and the existing engine was not made for residual fuels. For residual fuel oil two other empirical indexes are used CII and Calculated Carbon Aromaticity Index (CCAI). Both CII and CCAI are calculated from the density and kinematic viscosity of the fuel.|$|E
50|$|Another {{reliable}} {{method of}} measuring the derived cetane number (DCN) of diesel fuel is the <b>Ignition</b> <b>Quality</b> Tester (IQT). This instrument applies a simpler, more robust approach to CN measurement than the CFR. Fuel is injected into a constant volume combustion chamber at approximately 575 °C and 310 psi. The {{time between the}} start of injection and {{the recovery of the}} combustion chamber pressure to 310 psi is defined as the ignition delay. This measured ignition delay is then used to calculate the DCN of the fuel. The fuel's DCN is then calculated using an empirical inverse relationship to ignition delay. Because of the reproducibility, material cost, and speed of the IQT, this has been the definitive source for DCN measurements of fuels since the late 2000s.|$|E

40|$|A {{methodology}} for estimating the octane index (OI), the {{research octane number}} (RON) and the motor octane number (MON) using ignition delay times from a constant volume combustion chamber with liquid fuel injection is proposed by adopting an <b>ignition</b> <b>quality</b> tester.

A correlation between the OI and the ignition delay time at the initial charge temperature enabled the OI of non-PRFs to be predicted at specified temperatures.

It offers many advantages including: higher cetane number; reduced emissions of particulates, NOx, SOx, CO, and hydrocarbons; reduced toxicity; improved safety; and lower lifecycle CO 2 emissions. A characteristic of biodiesel limiting its application is its relatively poor low-temperature flow properties, which are primarily {{a consequence of}} the fatty acid make-up of the oil feedstock. Attempts to influence the fatty acid profile of either the oil feedstock or the biodiesel product include winterisation and fractionation which reduce the fraction of saturated fatty acids and result in large reductions in yield. A reduction in saturated fatty acids reduces <b>ignition</b> <b>quality</b> of the fuel, while an increase in unsaturation reduces oxidation stability. Additives designed for petroleum diesel have been used with limited success and specific additives for biodiesel remain in their infancy.

40|$|Copyright © 2016 by ASME. The next {{generation}} of alternative fuels is being investigated through advanced chemical and biological production techniques {{for the purpose of}} finding suitable replacements to diesel and gasoline while lowering production costs and increasing process yields. Chemical conversion of biomass to fuels provides a plethora of pathways with a variety of fuel molecules, both novel and traditional, which may be targeted. In the search for new fuels, an initial, intuition-driven evaluation of fuel compounds with desired properties is required. Due to the high cost and significant production time needed to synthesize these materials at a scale sufficient for exhaustive testing, a predictive model would allow chemists to preemptively screen fuel properties of potentially desirable fuel candidates. Recent work has shown that predictive models, in this case artificial neural networks (ANN's) analyzing quantitative structure property relationships (QSPR's), can predict the cetane number (CN) of a proposed fuel molecule with relatively small error. A fuel's CN is a measure of its <b>ignition</b> <b>quality,</b> typically defined using prescribed ASTM standards and a cetane testing engine. Alternatively, the analogous derived cetane number (DCN), obtained using an <b>Ignition</b> <b>Quality</b> Tester (IQT), is a direct measurement alternative to the CN that uses an empirical inverse relationship to the ignition delay found in the constant volume combustion chamber apparatus. DCN data points acquired using an IQT were utilized for model validation and expansion of the experimental database used in this study. The present work improves on an existing model by optimizing the model architecture along with the key learning variables of the ANN and by making the model more generalizable to a wider variety of fuel candidate types, specifically the class of furans and furan derivatives, by including specific molecules for the model to incorporate. The new molecules considered include tetrahydrofuran, 2 -methylfuran, 2 -methyltetrahydrofuran, 5, 5 '-(furan- 2 -ylmethylene) bis(2 -methylfuran), 5, 5 '-((tetrahydrofuran- 2 -yl) methylene) bis(2 -methyltetrahydrofuran), tris(5 -methylfuran- 2 -yl) methane, and tris(5 -methyltetrahydrofuran- 2 -yl) methane. Model architecture adjustments improved the overall root-mean-squared error (RMSE) of the base database predictions by 5. 54 %. Additionally, through the targeted database expansion, it is shown that the predicted cetane number of the furan-based molecules improves on average by 49. 21 % (3. 74 CN units) and significantly for a few of the individual molecules. This indicates that a selected subset of representative molecules can be used to extend the model's predictive accuracy to new molecular classes.
