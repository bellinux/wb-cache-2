40|$|We present {{new data}} on {{effective}} {{corporate income tax}} rates in 85 countries in 2004. The data come from a survey, conducted jointly with PricewaterhouseCoopers, of all taxes imposed on "the same" standardized mid-size domestic firm. In a cross-section of countries, our estimates of the effective corporate tax rate have a large adverse impact on aggregate investment, FDI, and entrepreneurial activity. For example, a 10 {{percent increase in the}} effective corporate tax rate reduces aggregate <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> by 2 percentage points. Corporate tax rates are also negatively correlated with growth, and positively correlated with the size of the informal economy. The results are robust to the inclusion of controls for other tax rates, quality of tax administration, security of property rights, level of economic development, regulation, inflation, and openness to trade. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{recession}} {{under way}} in the European Union and the threat of deflation have spawned increasing frequent calls for modification of the Stability and Growth Pact. The present article confirms the negative correlation of the rate of real output growth with that of increase in current public expenditure, but finds a positive correlation of growth with the rate of increase in public capital spending, private <b>investment,</b> tax <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> and an indicator of the net profit rate. The policy prescription is for the urgent modification of the rules of the Pact, exempting public investment from its constraints subject to the assessment of the Ecofin Council. The markets would be receptive to such a change if the EU instituted clear new rules, not just reinterpreting those now in being under the pressure of contingent factors. On this basis, we find that Italy's economic crisis {{is due in part to}} the misconceived fiscal and monetary policy rules of the European Union.

Low investment results in low capital formation and hence lower long term growth and hence low levels of development. The long term growth literature from Harrod (1939) -Domer (1946), Solow (1956) to Romer (1986) is almost unanimous on the role of savings in long term economic growth. There have been studies in past on the macroeconomic determinants of savings in Pakistan. But, few studies have explored micro foundations of savings behavior in Pakistan. This study uses primary data collected through survey questionnaire to study the micro foundations of savings behavior in urban areas of Pakistan.

40|$|Surging {{public debt}} since the Great Recession has focused {{increasing}} {{attention on the}} issue of debt sustainability. This paper provides debt sustainability analyses for the Czech Republic and Slovakia by estimating their public debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP,</b> and primary balance <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> up until 2022 under three different projections. The first, labelled the baseline projection, predicts their debt ratios to 2022, if neither their public debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> nor their primary balance <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> change. This projection uses the official forecasts of the key variables. The second projection answers the question of how much the two counties have to consolidate, measured by their primary balance <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios,</b> if they want to hold their public debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios</b> at their current levels. The third projection answers the question of how much the countries have to consolidate if they aim to reattain their December 2008 pre-crisis public debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratios.</b> All three projections are made for the same five scenarios, which cover a status quo case, where official forecasts are realized, and both optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for growth and consolidation outcomes. The paper`s novelty lies in its development of an existing non-parametric methodology to encompass iterative numerical solution methods to assess public debt sustainability. This allows a richer set of results to be obtained, for example estimates for the required level of the public debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the primary balance <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio,</b> taking account of variables such as nominal interest rates, yields to maturity on public debt, inflation rates and average maturities of debt...|$|R
40|$|I {{show how}} to {{construct}} a stochastic long-lived overlapping generation’s model {{that is based on}} a non-stochastic model developed by Olivier Blanchard and Philippe Weil and that nests the RBC model as a special case. My innovation over previous work is to add an aggregate stochastic shock. I provide three different calibrations of my model economy. One mimics the RBC model and the other two are heterogenous agent economies (HA and HATAX) with and without corporate income taxes. I show that the HA and HATAX models can explain the low safe rate of interest that has been observed for long periods in US data. The HATAX model can also explain the fact that the <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> in US data is lower than the profit share.

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the impact of the real {{effective}} exchange rate on economic growth in Sierra Leone. First an analytical framework is developed to identify the determinants of the real effective exchange rate. Using quarterly data and employing recent econometric techniques, the relationship between the real effective exchange rate and economic growth is then investigated. A bivariate Granger causality test was also employed as part of the methodology to examine the causal relationship between the real exchange rate and economic growth. The empirical results suggest that the real effective exchange rate correlates positively with economic growth, with a statistically significant coefficient. The results also indicate that monetary policy is relatively more effective than fiscal policy in the long run, and evidence of the real effective exchange rate causing economic growth was profound. In addition, the results showed that terms of trade, exchange rate devaluation, <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and an excessive supply of domestic credit were the main determinants of the real exchange rate in Sierra Leone...|$|E

The government of Pakistan has opened several economic sectors to attract foreign investors and also issued several investment incentives for foreign investors. Since the market oriented economic reforms took place in 1992, in which emphasis has been given to attract FDI. In this study, the relationship between FDI and poverty reduction is analyzed empirically. It is based on time series data which are collected from the Hand Book of Statistics, World Development Indicators (WDI) and Economic Survey of Pakistan. The period covered in this study was 1973 - 2011. The first model in this study was estimated by using the ARDL technique.

A {{number of studies have}} tackled this problem, but very few make the transmission mechanism explicit in their analysis. We estimate a panel VAR model that incorporates the long-term real interest rate on government bonds as a vehicle to transmit shocks in both the public debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and economic growth.

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the fundamental {{role played by}} factor accumulation in explaining the extraordinary postwar growth of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. Participation rates, educational levels and (with the exception of Hong Kong) investment rates have risen rapidly in all four economies. In addition, there have been large intersectoral reallocations of labour, with (again, excepting Hong Kong) non-agricultural and manufacturing employment growing {{one and a half}} to two times as fast as the aggregate working population. Thus, while the growth of output per capita in these economies has averaged 6 % to 7 % per annum over the past two and a half decades, the growth of output per effective worker in the non- agricultural sector of these economies has been only 3 % to 4 % per annum. If one then allows for the doubling, tripling and even quadrupling of the <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> in these economies, one arrives at total factor productivity growth rates, both for the non- agricultural economy and for manufacturing in particular, which are well within the bounds of those experienced by the OECD and Latin American economies over equally long periods of time. While the growth of output and manufacturing exports in the newly industrializing economies of East Asia is virtually unprecedented, the growth of total factor productivity in these economies is not. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{examines}} whether female education promotes {{economic performance}} in Nigeria, using the co-integration and error correction techniques {{for the period}} 1975 - 2008. The augmented Solow model is used to incorporate the gender dimension. The unit root tests conducted indicated that all variables are stationary at first difference and are also co-integrated. This shows that a long-run equilibrium relationship exists among them. Furthermore, {{it was revealed that}} the male education has a significant and positive impact on the Nigerian economy, while female education does not. Contrary to expectations, the results also revealed that <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> and government investment on social and community services have no significant effect on real GDP when lagged by one year. It is implied that instead of promoting growth, investment efforts have not been beneficial to the economy. The result shows that trade openness is an effective policy for promoting economic performance in Nigeria. The policy implication of the study is that if the country wants to achieve sustainable growth which would engender structural transformation of the Nigerian economy, the issue of gender equality in access to education should be taken seriously. Thus, government should pay more attention to educational policies that enhance female enrolment rates, participation in educational institutions and literacy in order to enhance women contribution to growth and economic transformation in Nigeria. This should be done in a stable macroeconomic environment which has a tendency to enhance domestic investment in Nigeria. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact {{of changes in the}} {{external}} balance of a developing economy (Pakistan). We explain that the economic growth achieved during the past decade is highly dependent on the improvements in external balance. Between 2001 and 2007 Pakistan has benefited from, an increase in the inflow of remittances, foreign assistance from bilateral and multilateral sources, and a relatively stable exchange rate. This was also complimented by growth in the real sector. The GDP grew at an average of 6 percent from 2001 to 2007. During the same time period the <b>investment</b> <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> increased from 17 to 23 percent. After 2007 this performance came under pressure due to external price shocks. The increase in import price of petroleum, raw materials and other manufactured goods has the potential of reducing the growth performance, impacting the competitiveness of the economy and thereby threatening the gains achieved during the past years. We integrate a 33 sector CGE model with a detailed microsimulation model to study the effects of changes in foreign savings and import prices faced by Pakistan. A 50 percent increase in foreign savings leads to an increase in imports and a decrease in exports. Main sectors facing a decline in exports are textile, leather, cement and livestock. Changes in prices seem pro-poor as food and oil prices decline. Those factors of production that gain under this change are agricultural wage labor and non-agricultural unskilled wage labor.

40|$|We {{construct}} quarterly {{series of}} the revenues, expenditures, and debt outstanding for Japan from 1980 to 2010, and analyze the sustainability of the fiscal policy. We pursue three approaches to examine the sustainability. First, we calculate the minimum tax rate that stabilizes the debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> given the future government expenditures. Using 2010 as the base year, {{we find that the}} government revenue <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> must rise permanently to 40 %- 47 % (from the current 33 %) to stabilize the debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio.</b> Second, we estimate the response of the primary surplus when the debt <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> increases. We allow the relationship to fluctuate between two “regimes” using a Markov switching model. In both regimes, the primary surplus <b>to</b> <b>GDP</b> <b>ratio</b> fails <b>to</b> respond positively to debt, which suggests the process is explosive. Finally, we estimate a fiscal policy function and a monetary policy function with Markov switching. We find that the fiscal policy is “active” (the tax revenues do not rise when the debt increases) and the monetary policy is “passive” (the interest rate does not react to the inflation rate sufficiently) in both regimes. These results suggest that the current fiscal situation for the Japanese government is not sustainable. ...|$|R
