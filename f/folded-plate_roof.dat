The home features curved brick walls, flat roof, and sheet glass walls, and is organized around a central court, while the <b>folded-plate</b> <b>roof</b> floods the interior with light.

The {{proposed}} tower-arch was not completed and the first cupola was incorporated into a narthex. After a long pause the main church, extending into the Place de Torcy was completed {{in an entirely different}} design in reinforced concrete in 1964 under the direction of architect Pierre Isnard. Isnard's design followed Closson's footprint, but substituted a simple box covered by a <b>folded-plate</b> concrete <b>roof.</b> The church's stained glass was executed by Leon Zack, while a statue of Joan of Arc was carried out by Maxime Real del Sarte.|$|R
