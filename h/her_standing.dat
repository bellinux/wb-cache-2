5|$|Neuner's {{shooting}} performances {{have been}} a regular topic in the German media. At times she {{has been reluctant to}} discuss her shooting in interviews and has said the public's fixation on it contributes to the problem. She has insisted her difficulties in the standing position are not due to technical weaknesses but psychological, and her training results are just as good as the results of her team mates. She explained in interviews that she had developed a fear of the standing shooting over time, knowing she had to justify herself after the race if she missed. In 2008, Neuner trained with Bundeswehr shooting coach and former large calibre world champion, Rudi Krenn, and subsequently changed her stance slightly. Since 2009, she has worked with a psychologist, primarily focusing on mental techniques to build her confidence on the shooting range. <b>Her</b> <b>standing</b> position average has improved from 60% to 75% from 2008 to 2011. Neuner has been wearing ear plugs during some of the races in order to better concentrate while shooting. The individual race, which places a high emphasis on shooting, has traditionally been her worst discipline (each shooting error results in a one-minute time penalty, instead of a penalty loop).|$|E

25|$|Sharapova did {{not attempt}} to defend her Australian Open title, as she {{continued}} to recover from surgery. She returned to the sport in March, in the doubles tournament at the BNP Paribas Open, but she and partner Elena Vesnina lost in the first round. After this, Sharapova withdrew from further singles tournaments, resulting in <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> in the world rankings being severely affected. She dropped out of the top 100 {{for the first time in}} six years in May, the nadir being world No. 126.|$|E
25|$|Being at once {{admitted}} to the Suffolk bar, in Boston, Green became the second woman member of the Massachusetts bar. After practicing 18 months in Boston, she returned to Rhode Island in 1890, residing in Providence, where she was engaged in writing and lecturing on legal topics. Although she was successful in court practice, her physical frailty left her unable to endure its strain. For that reason, she never applied for admission to the Rhode Island bar, <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> at the Boston bar being sufficient {{for the kind of}} work she wanted to do. She engaged in an office practice, focusing largely on conveyancing and the care of estates.|$|E
25|$|Departing 12 May, Georgiana cruised off the Galapagos {{in search}} of British whaling ships. While sailing near James Island 28 May, she met Catherine and Rose and {{captured}} them with no resistance. She then chased a third whaler, Hector and engaged in a brief, but sharp, combat which brought down Hectors main-topmast and most of <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> and running rigging. After capturing Hector, Georgiana placed the crews of all three whalers in Rose, under parole, and sent her as a cartel to St Helena. Georgiana, Catherine, and Hector then on 24 June joined Essex at Tumbez, Peru. Also on 28 May, Essex captured the whaler Greenwich; Porter armed her too as and put Lieutenant Gamble of the US Marines on her as captain.|$|E

25|$|A 21-year-old exorcist, Millenear was {{orphaned}} at {{an early}} age and placed in the care of her uncle and aunt. They were abusive and one day, Millenear killed them with her spiritual rage. Priest Williams took her in and taught her how to focus her powers to help people. She became one of the best exorcists employed by the Vatican until she disobeyed the head Bishop of the Vatican to save a possessed girl using her dark magic abilities. She lost <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> as a priest and left the service. Though Deshwitat is often critical of her, she continues to him on his quest to defeat Kalutika. She was captured by Mr. Grey during an assassination attempt on Deshwitat and was turned into a vampire.|$|E
25|$|Juvenal's {{account of}} her nights spent in the brothel is {{commonly}} portrayed. Gustave Moreau paints her leading another man onto the bed while an exhausted prostitute sleeps in the background, while in Paul Rouffio's painting of 1875 she reclines bare-breasted as a slave offers grapes. The Dane Peder Severin Krøyer depicts <b>her</b> <b>standing,</b> her full body apparent under the thin material of her dress. The ranks of her customers are just visible behind the curtain against which she stands (see above). Two drawings by Aubrey Beardsley were produced for a private printing of Juvenal's satires (1897). The one titled Messalina and her companion shows her {{on the way to}} the brothel, while a rejected drawing is usually titled Messalina returning from the bath.|$|E
25|$|In the video, Norwood {{plays an}} all-seeing, all-knowing narrator, who gives the central male {{character}} pause with her wicked glances that {{let him know}} she's watching his every move. The pursuit starts with the singer performing the first lines of her song {{in the back of}} a cruising bus, while observing her boarding man next to a female, both discussing vehemently with each other. She's constantly moving and dancing, before the scene shifts to a scaffolding in front of a fenced building, where she performs the chorus in dusty backgrounds. The next scene shows <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> under a traffic light at a plied crossing, wearing a grey outfit and big glasses, wherefrom she enters a near barber shop and performs afresh in a hairdresser chair. At the same time the camera shows her man flirting with two girls. The video ends with a backflash on all locations Norwood was seen at, also catching the daytime in front of the sinking sun.|$|E

When the work was finished in 1866, Cleopatra's position changed to show <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> before Caesar with Apollodorus bent down beside her.|$|E

500|$|McCartney's {{earliest}} musical influences include Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry. When {{asked why}} the Beatles did not include Presley on the Sgt. Pepper cover, McCartney replied, [...] "Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't {{put him on the}} list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King." [...] McCartney stated that for his bassline for [...] "I Saw <b>Her</b> <b>Standing</b> There", he directly quoted Berry's [...] "I'm Talking About You".|$|E
500|$|American {{scientists}} {{thought the}} missing {{body to be}} Anastasia because none of the female skeletons showed the evidence of immaturity, such as an immature collarbone, undescended wisdom teeth, or immature vertebrae in the back, {{that they would have}} expected to find in a seventeen-year-old. In 1998, when the remains of the imperial family were finally interred, a body measuring approximately 5'7" [...] was buried under the name of Anastasia. Photographs taken of <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> beside her three sisters up until six months before the murders demonstrate that Anastasia was several inches shorter than all of them.|$|E

Susan is said to have attended Indiana State University, which helps solidify <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> as the smartest beauty pageant contestant. Leslie said one of her criteria categories as a judge is the [...] "Naomi Wolf factor", {{a reference to the}} American third-wave feminist author and political consultant. Sanderson, who has demonstrated a lack of pop culture familiarity in the show, was unfamiliar with a reference Tom made to the 1988 police action film Die Hard and its famous protagonist, John McClane.|$|E

500|$|... "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)" [...] is a {{modified}} {{repeat of the}} opening song at a faster tempo with heavier instrumentation.

[...] Ringo Starr starts the song proper by playing the drum part unaccompanied for four bars, {{at the end of which}} a brief bass glissando from McCartney cues the full ensemble of two distorted electric guitars (played by George Harrison and Lennon), bass, drums and overdubbed percussion. In addition, McCartney overdubbed a Hammond organ part onto the track.|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} finale drew close in 2004, Eric Deggans of St. Petersburg Times ranked Pitt {{as one of}} the worst guest stars in Friends: [...] "Stilted reactions, overly exaggerated comedy, near-palpable self-consciousness - despite his cred as a film actor, Pitt knew he was out of his depth on a sitcom stage. After five minutes' viewing, the {{audience}} did, too." [...] His work on set is admired by the main stars; Schwimmer recalls Pitt was [...] "definitely [...] going against type" [...] and LeBlanc called him [...] "really great on the show". USA Today rates Will's line [...] "Look at <b>her</b> <b>standing</b> there with those yams. My two greatest enemies, Ross.
