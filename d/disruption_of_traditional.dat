Since most Episcopalians gave their support to the Jacobite rebellions {{in the first half}} of the early eighteenth century, they suffered a decline in fortunes. The remoteness of the Highlands and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later eighteenth century saw some success, owing to the efforts of the SSPCK missionaries and to the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> society. Catholicism had been reduced to the fringes of the country, particularly the Gaelic-speaking areas of the Highlands and Islands. Conditions grew worse for Catholics after the Jacobite rebellions and Catholicism was reduced to little more than a poorly run mission. There was Evangelical Revival from the 1730s, reaching its peak at the Cambuslang Wark in 1742. The movement benefited the secessionist churches who gained recruits.|$|E
25|$|The {{familiar}} starting-point, {{a classical}} model of secularization, argues that religious faith becomes less plausible and religious practice more difficult in advanced industrial and urbanized societies. The breakdown or <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> communities and norms of behavior; {{the spread of}} a scientific world-view diminishing {{the scope of the}} supernatural and the role of God; increasing material affluence promoting self-reliance and this-worldly optimism; and greater awareness and toleration of different creeds and ideas, encouraging religious pluralism and eviscerating commitment to a particular faith, all form components of the case for secularization. Applied to the British churches in general by Steve Bruce and to Methodism in particular by Robert Currie, this model traces decline back to the Victorian era and charts in the twentieth century a steady ebbing of the sea of faith.|$|E

2500|$|P. P. Carp was {{an outspoken}} critic of generic intolerance, seeing it as the enemy of civic values. Speaking in 1892, he theorized: [...] "Culturally speaking, the first sign of a {{backward}} state is intolerance. When somebody thinks that only he is right, that there is nothing outside his brain and absolutely nothing in social life, he is an uncultured being, who never had a chance of knowing how varied, how many, there are manifestations of human thinking." [...] As Carp noted, the natural breakdown of [...] "forms without content", and the <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> <b>traditional</b> lifestyles, had made it tempting for regular Romanians, and for crowd-pleasing orators, to use the Jew as a scapegoat. Carp's political isolation was only increased by such discourse. According to Virgil Nemoianu, Carp was his usual [...] "trenchant" [...] speaker on this subject as well. Historian Armin Heinen notes that, with the minor socialist movement and, at times, Maiorescu, Carp was {{one of the very few}} to demand collective Jewish emancipation in the final quarter of the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|The Kunbi Hindre (or Hendre) are {{synonymous with}} the Hindre Patils, {{as far as their}} {{perceived}} distribution in the Vidharbha region of Maharashtra in the districts of Nanded, Parbhani, Yeotmal and Akola is concerned. There are no further subdivisions of the community. The community is said to have migrated from the Sahyadri ranges to the central Vidharbha region. The community does not have an oral tradition concerning the etymology of the word Hindre or the history of their migration, so their own origin is unknown to them. While the Hindre were grouped with the Kunbis of the Khandesh region in early ethnographical studies, the origin of the community is not known. Their population has not been accurately recorded in any official records; since the community is only found in certain rural districts, the Anthropological Survey of India estimates their population to be in thousands or in lakhs.

40|$|In {{the past}} few years we have {{witnessed}} how traditional manufacturing relationships between North and South are rapidly changing and allowing for new forms of interaction. This article suggests that we are facing, on the one hand, a <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>traditional</b> markets guided by traditional industries towards the creation of new industries and consequently new markets. The study proposes the co-existence of three, not-yet competing, trajectories: (i) the traditional one between Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and their subsidiaries in the South, (ii) the emerging South (with China and India) investing and acquiring OEMs from the North, (iii) the race for the development of environmentally friendly technologies, pushed by public policy and promoted by heavy public R&I funding; linked to the promotion by the North of new industries. The implications of the interaction of these trajectories are not yet clear. However, it seems that at least in the current stage of pre-competitive capabilities building, collaboration among firms (in any of its forms) rather than competition is proven to be more efficient in reaching technological mastery. The question of how the South will position itself in the new emerging order is still an open one...|$|R

First introauced following a <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> the <b>traditional</b> process <b>of</b> witcheraft control, it was openly supported by the king and chiefs.
