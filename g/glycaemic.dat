5|$|The low <b>glycaemic</b> index {{treatment}} (LGIT) is {{an attempt}} to achieve the stable blood glucose levels seen in children on the classic ketogenic diet while using a much less restrictive regimen. The hypothesis is that stable blood glucose {{may be one of the}} mechanisms of action involved in the ketogenic diet, which occurs because the absorption of the limited carbohydrates is slowed by the high fat content. Although it is also a high-fat diet (with approximately 60% calories from fat), the LGIT allows more carbohydrate than either the classic ketogenic diet or the modified Atkins diet, approximately 40–60g per day. However, the types of carbohydrates consumed are restricted to those that have a <b>glycaemic</b> index lower than 50. Like the modified Atkins diet, the LGIT is initiated and maintained at outpatient clinics and does not require precise weighing of food or intensive dietitian support. Both are offered at most centres that run ketogenic diet programmes, and in some centres they are often the primary dietary therapy for adolescents.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} drug-resistant epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low <b>glycaemic</b> index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of insulin at the University of Toronto in 1921 is {{considered among the}} most significant events {{in the history of}} medicine. The stem cell was discovered at the university in 1963, forming the basis for bone marrow transplantation and all subsequent research on adult and embryonic stem cells. This was the first of many findings at Toronto relating to stem cells, including the identification of pancreatic and retinal stem cells. The cancer stem cell was first identified in 1997 by Toronto researchers, who have since found stem cell associations in leukemia, brain tumors and colorectal cancer. Medical inventions developed at Toronto include the <b>glycaemic</b> index, the infant cereal Pablum, the use of protective hypothermia in open heart surgery and the first artificial cardiac pacemaker. The first successful single-lung transplant was performed at Toronto in 1981, followed by the first nerve transplant in 1988, and the first double-lung transplant in 1989. Researchers identified the maturation promoting factor that regulates cell division, and discovered the T cell receptor, which triggers responses of the immune system. The university is credited with isolating the genes that cause Fanconi anemia, cystic fibrosis and early-onset Alzheimer's disease, among numerous other diseases. Between 1914 and 1972, the university operated the Connaught Medical Research Laboratories, now part of the pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. Among the research conducted at the laboratory was the development of gel electrophoresis.|$|E

50|$|Slow {{digestion}} and distal {{absorption of}} carbohydrate from isomaltulose {{contributes to the}} low blood glucose response to isomaltulose ingestion and to the associated low insulin release. In comparison with sucrose, the rise in blood glucose concentration following the ingestion of isomaltulose appears slower and attenuated, with a lower amplitude that is sustained {{over a longer period}} of time. Isomaltulose has a low <b>glycaemic</b> index (GI). A GI of 32 for isomaltulose was determined by the University of Sydney <b>Glycaemic</b> Index Research Service, which list isomaltulose (Palatinose™) in their searchable GI database. The GI value of 32 compares with 67 for sucrose and 100 for glucose, which makes isomaltulose a very low-GI carbohydrate.|$|E

50|$|People {{with type}} 1 {{diabetes}} and undiagnosed celiac disease have worse <b>glycaemic</b> control and a higher prevalence of nephropathy and retinopathy.

50|$|Italian {{researchers}} have found that D-inositol given to pregnant women with polycistic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) can improve insulin sensitivity and <b>glycaemic</b> control. PCOS affects 10% of women and is characterized by excess levels of male hormone, which can lead to insulin resistance. This study showed that D-inositol reduced the onset of gestational diabetes and reduced the total weight gained during pregnancy. Inositol is metabolized into the important cellular signals IP4, IP5, and IP6 by ITP3K and other proteins.|$|E
50|$|The area postrema is also {{indicated}} in an insulin treatment against type 1 and type 2 diabetes. A particular mechanism, {{employed by the}} drug pramlintide, acts mainly on the area postrema and results in decreased glucagon secretion, which in turn slows down gastric emptying and the satiety effect. This targeting of the area postrema allows an improvement of <b>glycaemic</b> control without causing weight gain. Since the drug acts on the area postrema, the doses must be titrated slowly to avoid inducing nausea in the patient.|$|E
50|$|The low <b>glycaemic</b> {{response}} to isomaltulose {{has been confirmed}} in numerous studies for different population groups including healthy people, overweight or obese persons, and individuals in a prediabetic state and persons who manifest type 1 or type 2 diabetes (e.g.). Among these studies, all show the lower blood glucose response of isomaltulose and where tested also show the associated reduction in the blood insulin response. A significant role for the incretin hormone GLP-1 has been established, which occurs in {{response to}} distal carbohydrate absorption and limits the rise in blood glucose concentration after a meal.|$|E
5000|$|When {{compared}} with other ingested carbohydrates, isomaltulose allows higher rates of fat oxidation to fuel energy demanding processes in the body. Mechanisms for this can be explained: Ingested carbohydrates that cause a higher blood glucose concentration stimulate a higher release of insulin both to facilitate the uptake of glucose by tissues and to normalise the blood glucose concentration. The higher insulin concentration also promotes carbohydrate oxidation {{at the expense of}} fat oxidation, thus promoting fat retention and storage in adipose tissue. Thus, ingested isomaltulose with its slower, steadier, and longer time for release of glucose into blood allows the supply of carbohydrate energy to be steady for longer—meanwhile creating a more advantageous metabolic profile. That is, demand for insulin is lower after isomaltulose ingestion than it is for higher <b>glycaemic</b> carbohydrates. The associated lower insulin release and concentration thereby allow a person eating isomaltulose to maintain higher rates of fat oxidation in energy metabolism. The lower insulin concentration is also expected to lower the recycling by liver of circulating free-fatty acids back to adipose tissue via plasma triglycerides, a process that supports both fat oxidation and lowering of fat storage. Practical implications seem to be several, higher rates of fat oxidation occur after isomaltulose than after ingestion of higher <b>glycaemic</b> carbohydrates in many studies, yet the studies have different foci: ...|$|E

50|$|Foot ulcers in {{diabetes}} require multidisciplinary assessment, {{usually by}} diabetes nurse specialist, a tissue viability nurse, podiatrists, diabetes specialists and surgeons. An aim to improve <b>glycaemic</b>  control, if poor, forms {{part of the}} management, to slow disease progression. Individuals who have sausage shaped toes, a positive 'probe to bone' test, evidence suggesting osteomyelitis, suspected charcot neuroarthropathy, or those whose ulcers do not improve within 4 weeks of standard care and where {{there is evidence that}} exudate is of synovial membrane in origin. When osteomyelitis is suspected {{to be involved in the}} foot ulcer, but not evidenced on an x-ray, an MRI scan should be obtained.|$|E
5000|$|Dietary {{replacement}} of saturated fats by carbohydrates {{with a low}} glycemic index may be beneficial for weight control, whereas substitution with refined, high glycemic index carbohydrates is not. A Cochrane review found that adoption of low glycemic index (or load) diets {{by people who are}} overweight or obese leads to more weight loss (and better fat control) than use of diets involving higher glycemic index/load or other strategies. Benefits were apparent even with low glycemic index/load diets that allow people to eat as much as they like. The authors of the review concluded that [...] "Lowering the <b>glycaemic</b> load of the diet appears to be an effective method of promoting weight loss and improving lipid profiles and can be simply incorporated into a person's lifestyle." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} proven in animal {{experiments}} {{that there is an}} improvement in sorbitol levels and Na+/K+ ATPase activity leading to improved nerve conduction velocity. Diabetic rats treated with epalrestat showed improvement in morphological abnormalities of nerves. In a placebo controlled double blind trial of 196 patients, it was proved that Epalrestat in a dose of 150 mg/day improved the effects of diabetic neuropathy like upper limb spontaneous pain, motor nerve conduction velocity, thresholds of vibratory sensation and autonomic nerve function as compared to a placebo. These effects were significantly better in those with poorer control of diabetes.A systematic review and metaanalysis showed that {{based on the results of}} 10 articles, it can be concluded that Epalrestat has some benefit in the control of diabetic cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy but only in the early or mild cases. It also doesn't influence <b>glycaemic</b> control.|$|E
5000|$|In 1981, {{the idea}} of {{classifying}} carbohydrates according to their Glycemic Index was first published. Since then, many studies have been undertaken to determine the impact of altering the blood glucose-raising potential (glycemic challenge) of the diet {{on a wide range}} of short- and long-term health outcomes. However, evaluating the impact of a single dietary change on health is notoriously complex, and opinions on the relevance of GI, GL and GGE have been divided. There are many different ways of lowering glycemic response, GI or GL, not all of which have the same effects on health. ILSI Europe published a monograph in November 2011 titled [...] "Food, <b>Glycaemic</b> Response and Health", which concluded that [...] "it is becoming evident that modifying the glycemic response of the diet should not be seen as a stand-alone strategy but rather as an element of an overall balanced diet and lifestyle".|$|E

50|$|The {{treatment}} options for hypohidrosis and anhidrosis is limited. Those with hypohidrosis should avoid drugs that can aggravate the condition (see medication-causes). They should limit activities that raise the core body temperature and if exercises {{are to be}} performed, they should be supervised and be performed in a cool, sheltered and well-ventilated environment. In instances where the cause is known, treatment should be directed at the primary pathology. In autoimmune diseases, such as Sjogren syndrome and systemic sclerosis, treatment of the underlying disease using immunosuppressive drugs may lead to improvement in hypohidrosis. In neurological diseases, the primary pathology is often irreversible. In these instances, prevention of further neurological damage, such as good <b>glycaemic</b> control in diabetes, {{is the cornerstone of}} management. In acquired generalized anhidrosis, spontaneous remission may be observed in some cases. Numerous cases have been reported to respond effectively to systemic corticosteroids. Although an optimum dose and regime has not been established, pulse methylprednisolone (up to 1000 mg ⁄ day) has been reported to have good effect.|$|E

50|$|Epigenetics {{may play}} a role in a wide array of {{vascular}} complications and in diabetes. The epigenetic variations involved with diabetes can change chromatin structure as well as gene expression. Regardless of whether glycemic control has been achieved through treatment these epigenetic mechanisms are lasting and do not change with the alteration of diet. The most common vascular complication in patients with Type 2 Diabetes is retinopathy which causes many patients to go blind. Studies showed that retinal damage persisted even after the reversal of hyperglycemia in dogs. Studies with streptozotocin injected Type 1 diabetes rats showed that the re-institution of glycemic control after a short period of hyperglycemia had protective effects in the eyes, including reduction in parameters of oxidant stress and inflammation. However, specimens with prolonged diabetes failed to show similar protection. It was then seen with endothelial cells (which line blood vessels) cultured in high glucose that there was a sustained increase in the expression of key extracellular and pro-fibrotic genes and persistently increased oxidant stress, after subsequent glucose normalization. These studies show that the deleterious effects of prior hyperglycemic exposure have long-lasting effects on target organs even after subsequent <b>glycaemic</b> control underscoring the beneficial effects of intensive glycemic control in diabetes. The persistence of these symptoms points to epigenesis as an underlying cause.|$|E
