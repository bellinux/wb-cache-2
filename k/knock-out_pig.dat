40|$|Polyclonal xenogenic IgGs, {{although}} {{having been}} used in the prevention and cure of severe infectious diseases, are highly immunogenic, which may restrict their usage in new applications such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever. IgG glycans display powerful xenogeneic antigens in humans, for example alpha 1 - 3 Galactose and the glycolyl form of neuraminic acid Neu 5 Gc, and IgGs deprived of these key sugar epitopes may represent an advantage for passive immunotherapy. In this paper, we explored whether low immunogenicity IgGs had a protective effect on a guinea pig model of Ebola virus (EBOV) infection. For this purpose, a double <b>knock-out</b> <b>pig</b> lacking alpha 1 - 3 Galactose and Neu 5 Gc was immunized against virus-like particles displaying surface EBOV glycoprotein GP. Following purification from serum, hyperimmune polyclonal IgGs were obtained, exhibiting an anti-EBOV GP titer of 1 : 100, 000 and a virus neutralizing titer of 1 : 100. Guinea pigs were injected intramuscularly with purified IgGs on day 0 and day 3 post-EBOV infection. Compared to control animals treated with IgGs from non-immunized double KO pigs, the anti-EBOV IgGs-treated animals exhibited a significantly prolonged survival and a decreased virus load in blood on day 3. The data obtained indicated that IgGs lacking alpha 1 - 3 Galactose and Neu 5 Gc, two highly immunogenic epitopes in humans, have a protective effect upon EBOV infection...|$|E

40|$|The Galactose-α 1, 3 -galactose (α 1, 3 Gal) epitope is {{responsible}} for hyperacute rejection in pig-to-human xenotransplantation. Human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) is a cell surface regulatory protein {{that serves as a}} complement inhibitor to protect self cells from complement attack. The generation of α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase (GGTA 1) <b>knock-out</b> <b>pigs</b> expressing DAF is a necessary step for their use as organ donors for humans. In this study, we established GGTA 1 knock-out cell lines expressing DAF from pig ear fibroblasts for somatic cell nuclear transfer. hDAF expression was detected in hDAF knock-in heterozygous cells, but not in normal pig cells. Expression of the GGTA 1 gene was lower in the knock-in heterozygous cell line compared to the normal pig cell. Knock-in heterozygous cells afforded more effective protection against cytotoxicity with human serum than with GGTA 1 knock-out heterozygous and control cells. These cell lines may be used in the production of GGTA 1 knock-out and DAF expression pigs for xenotransplantation...|$|R
40|$|Microinjection {{of foreign}} DNA into pronuclei of a fertilized oocyte has {{predominantly}} {{been used for}} the generation of transgenic livestock. This technology works reliably, but is inefficient and results in random integration and variable expression patterns in the transgenic offspring. Nevertheless, remarkable achievements have been made with this technology with regard to xenotransplantation. Transgenic pigs that express human complement regulating proteins have been tested {{in their ability to}} serve as donors in human organ transplantation (i. e. xenotransplantation). In vitro and in vivo data convincingly show that the hyperacute rejection response can be overcome in a clinically acceptable manner by successfully employing this strategy. The recent developments in nuclear transfer and its merger with the growing genomic data allow targeted and regulatable transgenesis. Systems for efficient homologous recombination in somatic cells are being developed and the first <b>knock-out</b> <b>pigs,</b> carrying a deletion in the a-galactosyltransferase gene, were recently generated. It is anticipated that poly-transgenic pigs will be available as donors for functional xenografts within a few years. Similarly, pigs may serve as donors for a variety of xenogenic cells and tissues. The availability of these technologies is essential to maintain "genetic security" and to ensure absence of unwanted side effects...|$|R
40|$|AIM: The aim of {{this study}} was to study the Galactosyl alpha(1, 3) Gal {{expression}} and the vascular tissue distribution prior to and after isolation of porcine pancreatic islets. METHODS: Biopsies of native pancreas were carried out in young (12 - 15 weeks; n = 4) and adult Landrace pigs (2 years old; n = 7). These pancreases were then digested (Liberase Porcine Islets [PI]) to obtain isolated pancreatic islets from each pancreas. Alpha Gal-specific biotinylated BS- 1 isolectin B 4 and von Willebrand's Factor (vWF) staining were performed for Galactosyl and vascular structure analysis, respectively. Quantitative Galactosyl expression as well as location of the vascular structure were determined using image analysis in pig islets of different sizes. RESULTS: Vascular structures and Galactosyl expression varied following the islet sizes but not the pig age. In large islets (> 100 microm), capillaries were mainly located within the islets, whereas in small islets (< 100 microm), 4 -fold more vessels were situated at the periphery of the islets. Galactosyl expression followed a comparable distribution than vascular tissue in small and large islets. After isolation, a significant decrease of Gal staining (- 49 %) was observed, but Galactosyl expression remained positive within both small and large islets. CONCLUSIONS: Galactosyl expression is maintained within pancreatic islets after isolation procedure. Gal <b>knock-out</b> <b>pigs</b> could represent the solution to this hurdle...|$|R
40|$|Carbohydrate antigens {{expressed}} on pig {{cells are}} consid-ered to be major barriers in pig-to-human xenotransplanta-tion. Even after α 1, 3 -galactosyltransferase gene <b>knock-out</b> (GalT-KO) <b>pigs</b> are generated, potential non-Gal antigens are still existed. However, {{to the best}} of our knowledge there is no extensive study analyzing N-glycans expressed on the GalT-KO pig tissues or cells. Here, we identified and quantified totally 47 N-glycans from wild-type (WT) and GalT-KO pig fibroblasts using mass spectrometry. First, our results confirmed the absence of galactose-alpha- 1, 3 -galactose (α-Gal) residue in the GalT-KO pig cells. Interest-ingly, we showed that the level of overall fucosylated N-glycans from GalT-KO pig fibroblasts is much higher than from WT pig fibroblasts. Moreover, the relative quantity of the N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuGc) antigen is slightly higher in the GalT-KO pigs. Thus, this study will contribute to a better understanding of cellular glycan alterations on GalT-KO pigs for successful xenotransplantation...|$|R
40|$|Xenograft {{recipients}} produce {{large amounts}} of high-affinity anti-Gal IgG in response to Galα 1 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 GlcNAc-R (α-gal) epitopes on the graft. In contrast, ABO-mismatched allograft recipients undergo “accommodation,” a state of very weak immune response to ABO antigens. These differences in anti-carbohydrate immune response were studied in α 1, 3 galactosyltransferase <b>knock-out</b> mice. <b>Pig</b> kidney membranes administered to these mice elicited extensive production of anti-Gal IgG, whereas allogeneic kidney membranes expressing α-gal epitopes elicited only a weak anti-Gal IgM response. Anti-Gal IgG response to xenograft membranes depended on helper T cell activation and was inhibited by anti-CD 40 L antibody. These T cells were activated by xenopeptides and not by α-gal epitopes. Moreover, allogeneic cell membranes manipulated to express xenoproteins also induced anti-Gal IgG response. Xenoglycoproteins with α-gal epitopes are processed by anti-Gal B cells. Xenopeptides presented by these cells activate a large repertoire of helper T cells required for the differentiation of anti-Gal B cells into cells secreting anti-Gal IgG. Alloglycoproteins with α- gal epitopes have very few immunogenic peptides and fail to activate helper T cells. Similarly, ineffective helper T-cell activation prevents a strong immune response to blood group antigens in ABO-mismatched allograft recipients, thus enabling the development of accommodation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Adenosine {{metabolism}} and transport were evaluated in the isolated perfused mouse heart and {{compared with the}} well-established model of isolated perfused guinea pig heart. Coronary venous release of adenosine under well-oxygenated conditions in the mouse exceeds that in the guinea pig threefold when related to tissue mass. Total myocardial adenosine production rate under this condition was approximately 2 nmol/min per gramme and similar in both species. Coronary resistance vessels of mice are highly sensitive to exogenous adenosine, and the threshold for adenosine-induced vasodilation is approximately 30 nmol/l. Adenosine membrane transport was largely insensitive to nitrobenzyl-thioinosine (NBTI) in mouse heart, which {{is in contrast to}} guinea pig and several other species. This indicates the dominance of NBTI-insensitive transporters in mouse heart. For future studies, the assessment of cytosolic and extracellular adenosine {{metabolism and}} its relationship with coronary flow will require the use of more effective membrane transport blockers.

40|$|Countering aerosolized {{filovirus}} {{infection is}} a major priority of biodefense research. &# 160; Aerosol models of filovirus infection have been developed in <b>knock-out</b> mice, guinea <b>pigs</b> and non-human primates; however, filovirus infection of immunocompetent mice by the aerosol route has not been reported. &# 160; A murine model of aerosolized filovirus infection in mice should be useful for screening vaccine candidates and therapies. &# 160; In this study, various strains of wild-type and immunocompromised mice were exposed to aerosolized wild-type (WT) or mouse-adapted (MA) Ebola virus (EBOV). &# 160; Upon exposure to aerosolized WT-EBOV, BALB/c, C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6), and DBA/ 2 (D 2) mice were unaffected, but 100 % of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) and 90 % of signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat 1) knock-out (KO) mice became moribund between 7 &# 8211; 9 days post-exposure (dpe). &# 160; Exposure to MA-EBOV caused 15 % body weight loss in BALB/c, but all mice recovered. &# 160; In contrast, 10 &# 8211; 30 % lethality was observed in B 6 and D 2 mice exposed to aerosolized MA-EBOV, and 100 % of SCID, Stat 1 KO, interferon (IFN) -&# 947; KO and Perforin KO mice became moribund between 7 &# 8211; 14 dpe. In order to identify wild-type, inbred, mouse strains in which exposure to aerosolized MA-EBOV is uniformly lethal, 60 BXD (C 57 BL/ 6 crossed with DBA/ 2) recombinant inbred (RI) and advanced RI (ARI) mouse strains were exposed to aerosolized MA-EBOV, and monitored for disease severity. A complete spectrum of disease severity was observed. All BXD strains lost weight but many recovered. However, infection was uniformly lethal within 7 to 12 days post-exposure in five BXD strains. &# 160; Aerosol exposure of these five BXD strains to 10 -fold less MA-EBOV resulted in lethality ranging from 0 % in two strains to 90 &# 8211; 100 % lethality in two strains. &# 160; Analysis of post-mortem tissue from BXD strains that became moribund and were euthanized at the lower dose of MA-EBOV, showed liver damage in all mice as well as lung lesions {{in two of the}} three strains. &# 160; The two BXD strains that exhibited 90 &# 8211; 100 % mortality, even at a low dose of airborne MA-EBOV will be useful mouse models for testing vaccines and therapies. Additionally, since disease susceptibility is affected by complex genetic traits, a systems genetics approach was used to identify preliminary gene loci modulating disease severity among the panel BXD strains. Preliminary quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified that are likely to harbor genes involved in modulating differential susceptibility to Ebola infection...|$|R
