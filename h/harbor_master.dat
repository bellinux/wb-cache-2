In her youth, Eliza was noted for her equestrian skills on her father's lands at Lihue and Wahiawa {{on the island of}} Oʻahu where their family raised thorough-bred horses which were well known across the islands. According to archivist and historian Albert Pierce Taylor, Eliza was often [...] "seen riding the horse through the streets of Honolulu garbed in a wonderful pa-u, with a dozen or more followers riding behind her wearing the same color of garment". Eliza was considered a great beauty in her youth and possessed green-color eyes indicative of her hapa-haole (half-European, half-Hawaiian) heritage.|$|E

40|$|Piles made of treated wood {{have been}} {{traditionally}} {{used for the}} construction of piers and other waterfront structures. The main concern related to wood piles is deterioration due to marine borers, which limits the lifespan and requires frequent repair and replacement. Furthermore, since the use of preservative treatments for wood piles has been reduced due to environmental concerns, there is a current need for efficient methods for wood pile protection. Marine borer activity in Maine coastal waters was assessed through a survey directed to <b>harbor</b> <b>masters</b> correlated with historic data. In order to illustrate the type and extent of wood pile deterioration, two case studies in Maine harbors are presented.

5000|$|These [...] "forty-niners" [...] {{left behind}} {{families}} and {{jobs in the}} hope of instant wealth. A few succeeded handsomely, but the gold fields destroyed some and disappointed many more. The gold fields were very lucrative with up to $50,000,000 in gold being found every year for several years; but the gold finds were spread very unevenly. As the easily mined placer gold deposits were worked out the much more capital intensive hard rock mining took over. Americans and foreigners of many different countries, statuses, classes, and races rushed to California for gold. Almost all (~96%) were young men under age 40. Women in the California Gold Rush were initially less than 4% of the population in 1850 and had many opportunities to do new things and take on new tasks in women poor California. Argonauts, as they were often called, walked over the California Trail or came by sea. About 80,000 Argonauts arrived in 1849 alone—about 40,000 over the California trail and 40,000 by sea. In April 1850, a <b>harbor</b> <b>master's</b> estimate counted 62,000 people from across the globe arriving in San Francisco by ship in the preceding 12 months. Hundreds of ships lay abandoned, anchored in San Francisco Bay, their passengers and crews abandoning the ships to search for gold.|$|R

In addition, we will also present the results of a coarse regional simulation of the Strait of Juan de Fuca. This coarse study encompasses 28 regions that span the Strait’s coast, including the communities of Anacortes, Bellingham, Friday Harbor, and Victoria, BC in addition to extended areas around Port Angeles and Port Townsend. The finest grid for these 28 regions where we collected results had 2 arc sec resolution (around 62 meters). Finally, we will discuss some inherent uncertainties in the specification of the earthquake scenario, the limitations of the GeoClaw model, and the associated uncertainites in the results. This report documents the results of a study supported by the Washington State Emergency Management Division of the tsunami hazard along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Results include inundation depths and times of arrival that will be useful to communities along the Strait as well as speeds, momentum, momentum flux, and minimum water depths that are useful for <b>harbor</b> <b>masters</b> and the major shipping and ferry industries that operate within the Strait of Juan de Fuca.

They are a paired structure in the hypothalamus, located just above the optic chiasm, consisting of approximately 20 000 neurons. Due to their specific properties, the SCN have a unique position within the circadian system. They are connected with retina and, therefore, they can directly receive information about changes in external light/dark cycle. The individual SCN neurons are independent autonomous circadian oscillators which are inter-connected in a communication network. This network allows the individual SCN oscillators to synchronize among each other and thus to increase the precision and robustness of the oscillations. This work is focused to summarize the knowledge on the structure and function of the SCN at the level of single cells, subpopulations of cells and the whole SCN. The specific goal of this work is a summary of the factors that determine their central role within the circadian system...|$|R
