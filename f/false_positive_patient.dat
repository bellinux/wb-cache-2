40|$|In {{order to}} study whether {{different}} heart rates achieved at peak exercise by normal subjects and patients with {{coronary artery disease}} (CAD) affect the results of analysis of R-wave amplitude changes (delta R), we evaluated delta R at progressively increasing heart rate (HR) steps in 60 normal subjects with negative exercise tests (ET), in 130 patients with CAD, in 88 <b>patients</b> with true <b>positive</b> and 42 with false negative ET, and in 43 patients with no CAD and <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> ET. We found that the sensitivity and specificity of delta R were HR dependent, the former decreasing and the latter increasing with progressively increasing HR steps. Mean values of delta R did not discriminate among the four groups for HRs up to 150 bpm; {{significant differences were found}} between normal subjects and CAD patients, both with true <b>positive</b> and <b>false</b> negative stress tests, at HR greater than 150 bpm. <b>False</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients</b> had mean delta R similar to those found in normal subjects.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{positive}} scans of autologous 99 mTc-labelled leucocytes in {{the detection of}} intestinal inflammation was assessed in 29 patients with known inflammatory bowel disease and a high probability of intestinal inflammation and 58 with a low probability of intestinal inflammation comprising 37 with intestinal symptoms and 21 with suspected abscess. Autologous leucocytes were labelled with 99 mTc using either of the established methods. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, 3 / 13 with ileocaecal and 1 / 11 with colonic accumulation of 99 mTc were incorrectly diagnosed in {{that there was no}} histological evidence of inflammation in those regions. In the low probability <b>patients,</b> all 26 <b>positive</b> images were <b>false</b> positives: there were 19 in the ileocaecal and 7 in colonic regions and no differences between the two subgroups. <b>False</b> <b>positives</b> were more common in low probability than high probability patients (p = 0. 011). The results were independent of the 99 mTc cell labelling technique used. Three <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients</b> also had normal scans for 111 In-labelled granulocytes. The time of first detection of 99 mTc in the bowel was earlier in true than in <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients</b> (92 % v 33 % within 1 h, p = 0. 008), the <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> rates in the first hour of imaging being 5 % in high and 15 % in low probability patients. In 99 mTc scintigraphy, the appearance of the isotope in the intestine occurs commonly in the absence of inflammation irrespective of the cell labelling technique used. In high probability patients, imaging at 1 h can more reliably discriminate true from <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> and retain clinical usefulness. In low probability patients specificity remains unacceptable and 99 mTc-labelled leucocyte scanning in these patients is of little value as a positive predictor of intestinal inflammation...|$|R

Two methods {{were developed to}} recognize two types of lesions namely (1) Close border (CB) lesions and (2) Open border (OB) lesions, which cover most of the lesion types {{that can be found}} on CT images. For the detection of CB lesions, fifteen features were extracted from each initial lesion candidates and multi layer perceptron (MLP) neural network was used to classify suspicious regions. Moreover, OB lesions were detected using a rule based image processing method, where no feature extraction or classification algorithm were used. The results were validated using a CT dataset of 52 patients, where 22 patients had abnormalities and 30 patients were normal. Using non-training dataset, CB detection algorithm yielded 71 % sensitivity with 0. 31 <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> per <b>patient.</b> Furthermore, OB detection algorithm achieved 100 % sensitivity with 0. 13 <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> per <b>patient.</b> Results suggest that, the proposed framework, which consists of two methods, {{has the potential to be}} used in clinical context, and assist radiologists for better diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Laxative-free {{computed}} tomographic colonography (lfCTC) could significantly improve patient {{adherence to}} colorectal screening. However, {{the interpretation of}} lfCTC data {{is complicated by the}} presence of poorly tagged feces and partial-volume artifacts that imitate colorectal lesions. The authors developed a method for virtual tagging of such artifacts. A probabilistic model of colonic wall was developed, and virtual tagging was performed on artifacts that were identified by the model. The method was evaluated with 46 clinical lfCTC cases that were prepared with dietary fecal tagging only. Visual examples show that the method can label partial-volume artifacts, poorly tagged feces, nonadhering completely untagged feces, and artifacts such as rectal tubes. The effect of virtual tagging was evaluated by comparing the detection accuracy of a fully automated polyp detection scheme without and with the method. With virtual tagging, the per-lesion detection sensitivity was 100 % for lesions ⩾ 10 mm (n= 4) with 3. 8 <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> per <b>patient</b> (per two CT scan volumes) and 90 % for lesions ⩾ 6 mm (n= 10) with 5. 4 <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> per <b>patient</b> on average.

40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Mitochondria are {{the main}} site of {{cellular}} adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation {{which is achieved by}} a series of multi-subunit complexes and electron carriers which together create the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS). Whenever a defect in any of the numerous mitochondrial pathways occurs it is commonly referred to as a mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial disorders are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by impaired energy production and include a wide range of defects of either mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA (nDNA) encoded proteins. In cases of dysfunction in the respiratory chain (complex I to IV) it is known to be a respiratory chain deficiency (RCD) which presents a huge challenge for routine diagnosis largely {{due to the lack of}} a specific and sensitive biomarker(s). One sure way of confirming the suspicion of a RCD is by performing enzyme analysis on a muscle sample obtained through a biopsy. However, due to the lack of theatre time available to clinicians and the relative large number of <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients</b> that are being selected for biopsies, it was decided to develop a biosignature to limit the number of <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients</b> from the diagnostic workflow. An untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics approach was used to investigate RCDs in children from South Africa. Sample preparation, a liquid chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry method and data processing methods were standardised. Furthermore the developed methodology made use of reverse phase chromatography in conjunction with positive electrospray ionisation (ESI) and a hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) in negative electrospray ionisation. Urine samples of 61 patients representing three different experimental groups were analysed. The three experimental groups comprised of patients with respiratory chain deficiencies, clinical referred controls (CRC) and patients suffering from various neuromuscular disorders (NMD). After a variety of data mining steps and statistical analysis a list of 12 features were compiled with the ability to distinguish between patients with RCDs and CRCs. The proposed signature was also tested on the neuromuscular disorder group, but this result indicated that the biosignature performed better when used to differentiate between patients with RCDs and CRCs, since the model was designed with this purpose. An alternative validation study is required to identify the features found with this proposed biosignature, to ensure that this biosignature can be practically implemented as a non-invasive screening method.

Accordingly, we investigated the association between aortic PWV and coronary calcification measured by computed tomography (TC-score) in 105 adult incident hemodialysis patients. PWV resulted increased in patients with the higher TC-score values; indeed, at univariate analysis PWV directly correlated with age (p= 0. 016), presence of diabetes (p lower than 0. 0001), serum phosphorus (p= 0. 0066), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p= 0. 046), LDL-cholesterol (p= 0. 043), TC-score (p lower than 0. 0001), and inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure (p= 0. 036). At multivariate analysis, age, diabetes, serum phosphorus, CRP, LDL-cholesterol and vascular calcifications were determinants of arterial stiffening. Using the table “two for two”, we showed 6 false negative patients (high TC-score and low PWV) and 12 <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients</b> (low TC-score and high PWV).

40|$|Background : The acute {{inflamation}} of appendix {{is called}} appendicitis {{which is one}} of the most common surgical emergencies. Appendicitis must be diagnosed and appendectomy should be done. In order to prevent appendix gangrene or other complications such as peritonitis, phelegmon and abscess. Since sonography as an accurate diagnosis method to evaluate pathological processes has been accepted for every organ of the body, so among all diagnostic measurments, it along with other clinical symptoms has an immense role to dignose appendicitis. The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of sonography to the diagnosis of appendicitis in suspected patients referred to Ashayer hospital in khorramabad in 2005. Materials and Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study included all suspected individuals with acute appendicitis referred to the hospital during 5 months. The data gathered through a questionnaire, physical examination and surgery done by specialist and the sonography results which were compared with pathoelogy results. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics and SPSS software. Comparing the results of sonography and pathology, the positive and negative cases were recognized. The sesitivity and specificity of sonography was recognized too. Results: Among 131 suspected cases, 6 cases had negative sonography,their symptoms improved,so they were cured and were excluded from the study. Among 125 patients, 88 cases (% 70. 4) had positive sonography and 37 (% 29. 6) had negative sonography. Through comparison between results of sonography and pathology, 72 cases were true <b>positive</b> <b>patients,</b> 16 cases were <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> <b>patients.</b> 12 cases were true negative patients. 25 cases were false negative patients.

We compared the standard morphologic method of identifying leukemic cells, the Sezary preparation, to a genotypic method using Southern blot analysis of T-cell receptor gene rearangements in concurrent blood samples. We studied 26 MF/SS patients, five of them in remission, together with five controls from cases of various non-MF/SS skin disease. Six 26 MF/SS patients had morphologically atypical circulating leukocytes (3 %, 4 %, 5 %m 14 %, 16 %, 19 %). Seven of 26 MF/SS patients had clonal T-cell receptor gene rearrangements, including the four patients with the greatest percentages of atypical cells and three patients lacking atypical cells. Six of seven patients had skin disease at the time of sampling, including three with erythroderma, two with generalized thick plaques, and one with generalized patches, while one patient was in clinical remission. All five controls lacked morphologic and genotypic evidence of atypical or clonal T-Cells. Relative to genotyping, in our series the Sezary preparation was less sensitive and less specific. There were three apparent false negative results in the Sezary preparations, and two potential <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> (<b>patients</b> with 3 % and 4 % atypical leukocytes); however, there was agreement between the two techniques in most cases.

We reviewed information from patient records, free text, and hospital episode statistics (HES) data, and excluded patients with no indication of a secondary care referral. Remaining patients were classified as probable, possible, or unlikely cases of SJS/TEN by two specialised clinicians or based on pre-defined classification criteria. We quantified positive predictive values (PPV) for all SJS/TEN patients and for patients categorised as 'probable/possible' cases of SJS/TEN, based on a representative subsample of 118 patients for whom we had unequivocal information (original discharge letters or HES data).; We identified 1324 patients with a diagnosis of SJS/TEN, among whom 638 had a secondary care referral recorded. Of those, 565 were classified as probable or possible cases after expert review. We calculated a PPV of 0. 79 (95 % CI, 0. 71 - 0. 86) for all SJS/TEN patients with a recorded secondary care referral, and a PPV of 0. 87 (95 % CI, 0. 81 - 0. 93) for probable/possible cases.

While high sensitivities and low <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> rates are consistently achieved for the detection of polyps sized 1 cm or larger, lower sensitivities and higher <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> rates occur when the goal of CAD is to identify “medium”-sized polyps, 6 – 9 mm in diameter.

We applied the wavelet-based postprocessor to CTC CAD findings from 44 patients in whom 45 polyps with sizes of 6 – 9 mm were found at segmentally unblinded optical colonoscopy and visible on retrospective review of the CT colonography images. Prior to the application of the wavelet-based postprocessor, the CTC CAD system detected 33 of the polyps (sensitivity 73. 33 %) with 12. 4 <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> per <b>patient,</b> a sensitivity comparable to that of expert radiologists. Fourfold cross validation with 5000 bootstraps showed that the wavelet-based postprocessor could reduce the <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> by 56. 61 % (p< 0. 001), to 5. 38 per patient (95 % confidence interval [4. 41, 6. 34]), without significant sensitivity degradation (32 ∕ 45, 71. 11 %, 95 % confidence interval [66. 39 %, 75. 74 %], p= 0. 1713). We conclude that this wavelet-based postprocessor can substantially reduce the <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> rate of our CTC CAD for this important polyp size range...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} assay {{systems were}} used to detect mutant cystic fibrosis alleles in mouthwash samples from preg-nant women attending antenatal clinics. In {{the first phase of}} the study, comprising 3110 consecutive samples, we compared the performance of an in-house system and a commercial amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS). Successful analyses were completed at first at-tempt in- 90 % of samples, and the patient resampling rate was 1. 1 %. There were no <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> and only one detected false negative.

40|$|Very-long chain acyl-CoA {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (VLCADD) is a clinically heterogeneous disorder {{with three}} major phenotypes: severe neonatal/infantile, milder childhood and late onset myopathic. VLCADD is genetically heterogeneous with numerous pathogenic mutations and variants of uncertain significance. VLCADD {{is included in}} many newborn screening programs but these suffer from high <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> rates, primarily due to positive screens in heterozygotes. Separating these and newborns with two low-risk “mild” variants from clinically at risk patients can be problematic, as clinical and biochemical markers are often unreliable, particularly in stable neonates. We have measured fibroblast fatty acid oxidation flux using [9, 10 -H 3]myristic acid and [9, 10 -H 3]oleic acid from 69 clinically presenting VLCADD patients including myopathic and infantile phenotypes and 13 <b>positive</b> newborn screened <b>patients.</b> We also measured fibroblast VLCADD enzyme activity by UV-HPLC detection of product in a sub-set of patients and compared these results to oleate FAO-flux. Fibroblast enzyme assay by UV-HPLC detection failed to clearly discriminate between some clinically presenting VLCADD patient cell lines and cell lines from some simple heterozygotes. FAO-flux clearly discriminated between clinically presenting VLCADD <b>patients</b> and the <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> screened <b>patients.</b> FAO-flux at 37 °C provides information as to the likely clinical phenotype but FAO-flux at 41 °C is the best discriminator for identifying clinically at risk patients...|$|R
40|$|Poly (ADP-ribose) and dsDNA binding {{activity}} {{have been}} measured in sera from 61 patients with {{systemic lupus erythematosus}} (SLE) and 188 control sera from 20 normal individuals, 144 patients with clinically similar diseases and 24 patients with drug-induced anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA). Elevated poly (ADP-ribose) binding was not observed with normal sera. Five of 144 samples from diseases entering the differential diagnosis of SLE gave raised poly (ADP-ribose) binding compared with 12 in the 125 I-dsDNA binding. Only two of these <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> samples gave elevated binding in the 14 C-dsDNA assay. The apparent high specificity of the poly(ADP-ribose) assay was not observed with samples containing drug-induced ANA where 62 % had elevated binding values. The frequency with which the poly(ADP-ribose) assay was positive with SLE sera (sensitivity) was lower than either of the dsDNA assays. This low sensitivity and {{the high rate of}} <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> in <b>patients</b> with drug-induced ANA limit the value of the poly(ADP-ribose) assay as a diagnostic test for SLE. However the restriction of poly(ADP-ribose) antibody to SLE and patients with drug-induced ANA together with the known role of poly(ADP-ribose) in DNA excision repair suggest that the antibody may be of fundamental significance...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to establish additional electrocardiographic criteria to distinguish the <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> exercise results in patients with MVP. Methods. We studied 218 consecutive patients (53 ± 6 years, 103 males) with MVP (according to echocardiographic study), and positive treadmill ET was performed due to multiple cardiovascular risk factors or angina-like symptoms. A coronary angiography was performed to detect coronary artery disease (CAD). Results. From 218 patients, 90 (group A) presented with normal coronary arteries according to the angiography (<b>false</b> <b>positive</b> ET) while the rest 128 (group B) presented with CAD. ST-segment depression in hyperventilation phase was present in 54 patients of group A (60 %) while only in 14 patients of group B (11 %), P<. 05. Conclusions.

40|$|No {{abstract}} available. Article truncated at 150 words. Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} (OHCA) is an uncommon, but important, condition {{encountered in the}} emergency department (ED). While cardiac arrest represents the final common pathway of multiple conditions, early evaluation often focuses on cardiac abnormalities. However, observed associations between infection, particularly pneumonia, and in-hospital cardiac arrest led Coba et al. (1) to investigate the incidence of bacteremia among OHCA patients. The study prospectively investigated 250 adult patients who presented to an academic ED with OHCA between 2007 and 2009. Two blood culture samples were drawn during resuscitation or shortly after return of spontaneous circulation through vascular devices placed for clinical purposes. Children, pregnant women, victims of trauma were excluded. To minimize <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> results, <b>patients</b> were classified as bacteremic if one sample was positive for a typical pathogen or both samples were positive for the same skin colonizing organism. Patients in whom only 1 sample was positive for suspected skin contaminant [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{stratified}} regularity measure: a novel entropic measure to describe data regularity {{as a function}} of data domain stratification. Jensen-Shannon divergence is used to compute a set-similarity of intensity distributions derived from stratified data. We prove that derived regularity measures form a continuum {{as a function of}} the stratification’s granularity and also upper-bounded by the Shannon entropy. This enables to interpret it as a generalized Shannon entropy with an intuitive spatial parameterization. This measure is applied as a novel feature extraction method for a real-world medical image analysis problem. The proposed measure is employed to describe ground-glass lung nodules whose shape and intensity distribution tend to be more irregular than typical lung nodules. Derived descriptors are then incorporated into a machine learning-based computer-aided detection system. Our ROC experiment resulted in 83 % success rate with 5 <b>false</b> <b>positives</b> per <b>patient,</b> demonstrating an advantage of our approach toward solving this clinically significant problem. 1...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{detection}} of helicobacter pylori (HP) infection and estimation of the clinical validity and the accuracy of the 14 C-urea breath test in the groups of patients studied. A total of 248 patients with gastric diseases were examined. There were 38 patients with gastric ulcer, 41 with duodenal ulcer, 43 with gastroduodenitis erosiva, 26 with hiatus hernia, 36 with gastric carcinoma and 64 patients with gastritis.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we present newly {{developed}} methods for biomarker discovery. We applied these methods to discover biomarkers of leptomeningeal metastasis (LM) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{from breast cancer}} patients and in serum from patients with prostate cancer. Early diagnosis of LM remains challenging because 25 % of CSF samples test false negative at first cytological examination. In addition, the sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in diagnosing LM in solid tumors are approximately 75 %. Early diagnosis and initiation of treatment of LM are essential to prevent neurological deterioration. We therefore {{set out to find}} biomarkers to increase the accuracy of early diagnostic testing in LM. For prostate cancer a biomarker in the form of prostate specific antigen (PSA) is available. The specificity of this marker is however rather poor, in screening studies like the European Randomized study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) 75 % of men with an elevated PSA level > 3 ng/ml are <b>false</b> <b>positive.</b> Resulting in a group of men that undergo unnecessary treatment with a risk of complications including impotence and incontinence. New markers in addition to PSA could help to reduce the large number of <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> diagnosed <b>patients</b> and to predict the course of the disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the additional value of whole-body positron emission tomography (WB-PET) in the distant staging of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One hundred forty-four patients with NSCLC in whom conventional staging (CS) was negative or equivocal for metastases, and who underwent WB-PET {{as part of their}} initial work-up, were retrospectively analyzed. Conventional staging consisted of thoracic computed tomography (CT), upper abdominal ultrasound and/or CT, and bone scintigraphy or brain CT on indication. Final M stage was based on histology, additional imaging, or follow-up of = 18 months. An additional lesion suspect for metastasis was found on WB-PET in 11 patients. This was true positive in 7 (3 bone, 1 retroperitoneal lymph nodes, 1 lung, and 2 asymptomatic coexisting colorectal cancer) and <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> in 4 <b>patients</b> (3 bowel, 1 breast). Twenty-four lesions in 21 patients remained equivocal after CS. Whole- body PET correctly characterized 20 lesions in 18 <b>patients</b> as true <b>positive</b> (n = 1) or true negative (n = 19). Whole-body PET was <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> in one <b>patient</b> (adrenal adenoma) and false negative in 2 patients (2 bone, 1 lung lesion). Despite negative results of modern CS and WB-PET, 16 of 86 patients (19 %) who underwent a curative resection, experienced a systemic relapse. After thorough modern CS, WB-PET correctly detected additional distant malignant lesions in only 5 % of the patients, while the combined staging strategy probably still misses micrometastatic disease in one fifth of the patients. The most important contribution of WB-PET was its ability to exclude malignancy in the majority of distant lesions with equivocal CS. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Bone metastases are a {{frequent}} occurrence with cancer, and early detection can guide the patient's treatment regimen. Metastatic bone disease can present in density extremes as sclerotic (high density) and lytic (low density) or in a continuum with an admixture of both sclerotic and lytic components. We design a framework {{to detect and}} characterize the varying spectrum of presentation of spine metastasis on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) data. A technique is proposed to synthesize CT and PET images to enhance the lesion appearance for computer detection. A combination of watershed, graph cut, and level set algorithms is first run to obtain the initial detections. Detections are then sent to multiple classifiers for sclerotic, lytic, and mixed lesions. The system was tested on 44 cases with 225 sclerotic, 139 lytic, and 92 mixed lesions. The results showed that sensitivity (<b>false</b> <b>positive</b> per <b>patient)</b> was 0. 81 (2. 1), 0. 81 (1. 3), and 0. 76 (2. 1) for sclerotic, lytic, and mixed lesions, respectively. It also demonstrates that using PET/CT data significantly improves the computer aided detection performance over using CT alone...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Evaluation of {{three-dimensional}} MR {{coronary angiography}} with the navigator technique {{for the primary}} diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with chest pain. Materials and Methods: In this prospective study 20 patients with chest pain were examined with MR coronary angiography and conventional angiography. The three-dimensional MR coronary angiography was performed using a 1. 5 T scanner with an ECG-triggered 3 D-FLASH-sequence and retrospective respiratory gating in the navigator technique. The MR coronary angiography was evaluated by two radiologists blinded {{to the results of}} the conventional coronary angiography. Results: One patient was excluded from further evaluation due to reduced image quality. Conventional coronary angiography excluded CAD in 8 / 19 patients, 11 / 19 patients overall showed 20 stenoses (> 50 %) or occlusions. With MR coronary angiography, CAD was correctly excluded in 7 patients, one <b>patient</b> was <b>false</b> <b>positive,</b> one <b>patient</b> was <b>false</b> negative. 14 / 20 stenoses (> 50 %) or occlusions were detected, 5 stenoses were diagnosed <b>false</b> <b>positive.</b> Sensitivity and specificity for primary diagnosis of CAD or detection of coronary artery stenoses were 91 % and 88 % or 70 % and 91 %, respectively. Discussion: Using MR coronary angiography with the navigator technique in the primary evaluation of CAD, the diagnosis of stenoses or occlusions of the main coronary arteries is feasible...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) is high in general populations around the world. Targeted testing and screening for CKD are often conducted to help identify individuals that may benefit from treatment to ameliorate or prevent their disease progression. AIMS: This systematic review examines the methods used in economic evaluations of testing and screening in CKD, with a particular focus on whether test accuracy has been considered, and how analysis has incorporated issues that may be important to the patient, such as the impact of testing on {{quality of life and}} the costs they incur. METHODS: Articles that described model-based economic evaluations of patient testing interventions focused on CKD were identified through the searching of electronic databases and the hand searching of the bibliographies of the included studies. RESULTS: The initial electronic searches identified 2, 671 papers of which 21 were included in the final review. Eighteen studies focused on proteinuria, three evaluated glomerular filtration rate testing and one included both tests. The full impact of inaccurate test results was frequently not considered in economic evaluations in this setting as a societal perspective was rarely adopted. The impact of <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> tests on <b>patients</b> in terms of the costs incurred in re-attending for repeat testing, and the anxiety associated with a positive test was almost always overlooked. In one study where the impact of a <b>false</b> <b>positive</b> test on <b>patient</b> quality of life was examined in sensitivity analysis, it {{had a significant impact on}} the conclusions drawn from the model. CONCLUSION: Future economic evaluations of kidney function testing should examine testing and monitoring pathways from the perspective of patients, to ensure that issues that are important to patients, such as the possibility of inaccurate test results, are properly considered in the analysis.
