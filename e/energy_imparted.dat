A conductive pellet (the projectile) is attracted down the rails by electric current flowing through a rail. Through the magnetic forces that this system achieves, a force is exerted on the projectile moving it down the rail.

25|$|Amongst other minor theorems here {{given it}} may suffice {{to mention the}} {{proposition}} that the kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> by the given impulses to a material system under given constraints is a maximum, and the principle of least action. All the analysis is so elegant that Sir William Rowan Hamilton said the work could be described only as a scientific poem. Lagrange remarked that mechanics was really a branch of pure mathematics analogous to a geometry of four dimensions, namely, the time and the three coordinates of the point in space; and it is said that he prided himself that from the beginning {{to the end of the}} work there was not a single diagram. At first no printer could be found who would publish the book; but Legendre at last persuaded a Paris firm to undertake it, and it was issued under the supervision of Laplace, Cousin, Legendre (editor) and Condorcet in 1788.|$|E
500|$|The Maxwell wave theory, however, {{does not}} account for all {{properties}} of light. The Maxwell theory predicts that the energy of a light wave depends only on its intensity, not on its frequency; nevertheless, several independent types of experiments show that the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> by light to atoms depends only on the light's frequency, not on its intensity. For example, some chemical reactions are provoked only by light of frequency higher than a certain threshold; light of frequency lower than the threshold, no matter how intense, does not initiate the reaction. Similarly, electrons can be ejected from a metal plate by shining light of sufficiently high frequency on it (the photoelectric effect); the energy of the ejected electron is related only to the light's frequency, not to its intensity. W/cm2 at which point perturbation theory begins to break down. In contrast, in the intense regime, which for visible light is above approximately 1014 W/cm2, the classical wave description correctly predicts the energy acquired by electrons, called ponderomotive energy. (See also: Boreham et al. (1996). [...] "".) By comparison, sunlight is only about 0.1 W/cm2.|$|E

Such devices {{can be produced}} by externally coating semiconductor charged particle detectors with neutron reactive films that convert free neutrons into charged-particle reaction products.

2500|$|All photons of {{the same}} {{frequency}} have identical energy, and all photons of different frequencies have proportionally (order 1, [...] ) different energies. However, although the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> by photons is invariant at any given frequency, the initial energy state of the electrons in a photoelectric device prior to absorption of light is not necessarily uniform. Anomalous results may occur {{in the case of}} individual electrons. For instance, an electron that was already excited above the equilibrium level of the photoelectric device might be ejected when it absorbed uncharacteristically low frequency illumination. Statistically, however, the characteristic behavior of a photoelectric device will reflect the behavior of the vast majority of its electrons, which will be at their equilibrium level. This point is helpful in comprehending the distinction between the study of individual particles in quantum dynamics and the study of massed particles in classical physics.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{fragmentation}} {{mechanism of}} tetraethyl ortho silicate and tetrapropyl ortho silicate was studied {{to determine if}} the consecutive alkene losses observed in their MS/MS daughter ion spectra were produced via a McLafferty rearrangement or by ion-neutral rearrangement mechanisms. The experiments were carried out using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization and low energy collision-induced dissociation. Deuterium labeling of the γ-position provided evidence that the rearrangement mechanism of the successive alkene losses proceeds predominantly via the ion-neutral complex mechanism. Because the <b>energies</b> <b>imparted</b> to the ions in this experiment are of the same order of magnitude as solution phase reactions, this mechanism may shed light on the formation of silica gels (e. g., aerogels) in that similar structures have been proposed as reaction intermediates in the polymerization of SiO 2...|$|R
2500|$|Damage-prediction {{software}} {{was used to}} evaluate possible tile and RCC damage. The tool for predicting tile damage was known as [...] "Crater", described by several NASA representatives in press briefings as not actually a software program but rather a statistical spreadsheet of observed past flight events and effects. The [...] "Crater" [...] tool predicted severe penetration of multiple tiles by the impact if it struck the TPS tile area, but NASA engineers downplayed this. It had been shown that the model overstated damage from small projectiles, and engineers believed that the model would also overstate damage from larger Spray-On Foam Insulation (SOFI) impacts. The program used to predict RCC damage was based on small ice impacts the size of cigarette butts, not larger SOFI impacts, as the ice impacts were the only recognized threats to RCC panels up to that point. Under one of 15 predicted SOFI impact paths, the software predicted an ice impact would completely penetrate the RCC panel. Engineers downplayed this, too, believing that impacts of the less dense SOFI material would result in less damage than ice impacts. In an e-mail exchange, NASA managers questioned whether the density of the SOFI could be used as justification for reducing predicted damage. Despite engineering concerns about the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> by the SOFI material, NASA managers ultimately accepted the rationale to reduce predicted damage of the RCC panels from possible complete penetration to slight damage to the panel's thin coating.|$|E
2500|$|The {{electron}} multiplier {{consists of a}} number of electrodes called dynodes. Each dynode is held at a more positive potential, by ≈100 Volts, than the preceding one. A primary electron leaves the photocathode with the energy of the incoming photon, or about 3eV for [...] "blue" [...] photons, minus the work function of the photocathode. A small group of primary electrons is created by the arrival of a group of initial photons. (In Fig. 1, the number of primary electrons in the initial group is proportional to the energy of the incident high energy gamma ray.) [...] The primary electrons move toward the first dynode because they are accelerated by the electric field. They each arrive with ≈100eV kinetic <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> by the potential difference. Upon striking the first dynode, more low energy electrons are emitted, and these electrons are in turn accelerated toward the second dynode. The geometry of the dynode chain is such that a cascade occurs with an exponentially-increasing number of electrons being produced at each stage. For example, if at each stage an average of 5 new electrons are produced for each incoming electron, and if there are 12 dynode stages, then at the last stage one expects for each primary electron about 512 ≈ 108 electrons. [...] This last stage is called the anode. This large number of electrons reaching the anode results in a sharp current pulse that is easily detectable, for example on an oscilloscope, signaling the arrival of the photon(s) at the photocathode ≈50 nanoseconds earlier.|$|E

At {{the end of this}} time, La Desirée and le Cerf had drawn more than a mile to the eastward of the English ships; the latter following them, as soon as clear of their wrecks, but under diminished sail. The Black Prince had actually got up three spare top-masts, in the interval, and was now ready to set their sails. The Speedy was less active, or less skilful, though she, too, had not been idle. Then the English drove fast towards their enemies. Mons. Menneval bore up in good season, this time, edging away, and opening the fire of both ships on his adversaries, when they were about half a mile distant. The effect of this early movement was soon apparent, it being a great mistake to reserve a ship's fire, as against an enemy that approaches nearly bows on. M'Donough owed his victory in Plattsburg Bay, to having improved so favourable a chance; and the French were beaten at the Nile, because they did not; though Nelson probably would have overcome them, under any circumstances; the <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> by one of his character, more than counterbalancing any little advantage in tactics.|$|E
