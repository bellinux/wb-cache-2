5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between shell and other organic material ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E
5|$|Association football, {{the modern}} game, also <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> early {{involvement}} of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too. In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit {{violence on the}} pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play. The first match recorded by the Scottish Football Association took place in 1892 in Glasgow. In England, the first recorded game of football between women took place in 1895.|$|E

5|$|Oesau was aged 30 at {{the time}} of his death. He had a total of 127 kills gained over 300 missions. 27 were Spitfires, 14 four-engined bombers, 44 were scored on the Eastern Front and 9 in the Spanish Civil War. In {{recognition}} of his record, JG 1 received the title Oesau in honor of its fallen Geschwaderkommodore. Only Werner Mölders had a similar honor with JG 51 Mölders. Walter Oesau is buried in Meldorf, close to his birthplace and the town museum (Dithmarscher Landesmuseum) <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> his last journey in pictures.|$|E
5|$|Packer {{estimates}} {{more than}} 200 Tanzanians are killed {{each year by}} lions, crocodiles, elephants, hippos, and snakes, and that the numbers could be double that amount, with lions thought to kill at least 70 of those. Packer <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> that between 1990 and 2004, lions attacked 815 people in Tanzania, killing 563. Packer and Ikanda are among the few conservationists who believe western conservation efforts must take account of these matters {{not just because of}} ethical concerns about human life, but also for the long term success of conservation efforts and lion preservation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the 19th century most of the European {{settlements}} were related to the fur trade. The largest of these settlements were trading posts established by the North West Company, particularly those at Sandy Lake, Leech Lake, and Fond du Lac. Historian Grace Lee Nute <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> over 100 fur trading posts of varying sizes in the Minnesota area before statehood. Most of these posts were eventually taken over by the American Fur Company. When several hundred settlers abandoned the Red River Colony in the 1820s, they entered the United States by way of the Red River Valley, instead of moving to eastern Canada or returning to Europe, adding to the Minnesota region's population.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> {{that the}} Qedarites were {{called upon to}} assist Cambyses II of the Persian empire in his {{invasion}} of Egypt in 525 BCE. The Qedarites and Nabataens were known to enjoy close relations, even engaging as wartime allies against the Assyrians. It {{is possible that the}} Qedarites were eventually incorporated into the Nabataen state which emerged as the strongest Ishmaelite presence in northwestern Arabia c. the 2nd century CE. In The Cambridge Ancient History, some of the (Arab) Nabataens mentioned by Diodorus in his retelling of events that took place in 312 BCE are said to be Qedarites.|$|E
5|$|Other {{techniques}} {{may be used}} {{to confirm}} a particular diagnosis. X-rays are still used for head trauma, but evidence suggests they are not useful; head injuries are either so mild that they do not need imaging or severe enough to merit the more accurate CT. Angiography {{may be used to}} detect blood vessel pathology when risk factors such as penetrating head trauma are involved. Functional imaging can measure cerebral blood flow or metabolism, inferring neuronal activity in specific regions and potentially helping to predict outcome. Electroencephalography and transcranial doppler may also be used. The most sensitive physical measure to date is the quantitative EEG, which <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> an 80% to 100% ability in discriminating between normal and traumatic brain-injured subjects.|$|E
5|$|Up to {{four million}} people in Vietnam {{were exposed to the}} defoliant, with around one million now {{suffering}} serious health issues. The chemical is capable of damaging genes, resulting in deformities among the offspring of exposed victims. The U.S. government <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> higher cases of leukemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various kinds of cancer in exposed veterans. Agent Orange also caused enormous environmental damage in Vietnam. Over 3,100,000 hectares (31,000km2 or 11,969mi2) of forest were defoliated. Defoliants eroded tree cover and seedling forest stock, making reforestation difficult in numerous areas. Animal species diversity sharply reduced in contrast with unsprayed areas.|$|E

5|$|Yosemite National Park <b>has</b> <b>documented</b> {{more than}} 130 {{non-native}} plant species within park boundaries. These non-native plants were introduced into Yosemite following {{the migration of}} early Euro-American settlers in the late 1850s. Natural and human-caused disturbances, such as wildland fires and construction activities, have contributed to a rapid increase in the spread of non-native plants. A number of these species aggressively invade and displace the native plant communities, resulting in impacts on the park's resources. Non-native plants can bring about significant changes in park ecosystems by altering the native plant communities and the processes that support them. Some non-native species may cause {{an increase in the}} fire frequency of an area or increase the available nitrogen in the soil that may allow more non-native plants to become established. Many non-native species, such as yellow star thistle (Centaurea solstitialis), are able to produce a long tap root that allows them to out-compete the native plants for available water.|$|E
