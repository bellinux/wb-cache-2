40|$|Summary: Identifying {{priority}} areas for marine vertebrate conservation is complex because species of conservation concern are highly mobile, inhabit dynamic habitats and {{are difficult to}} monitor. Many marine vertebrates are known to associate with oceanographic fronts - physical interfaces at the transition between water masses - for foraging and migration, making them important candidate sites for conservation. Here, we review associations between marine vertebrates and fronts and how they vary with scale, regional oceanography and foraging ecology. Accessibility, spatiotemporal predictability and relative productivity of front-associated foraging habitats are key aspects of their ecological importance. Predictable mesoscale (10 s- 100 s km) regions of persistent frontal activity ('frontal zones') are particularly significant. <b>Frontal</b> <b>zones</b> are hotspots of overlap between critical habitat and spatially explicit anthropogenic threats, such as the concentration of fisheries activity. As such, they represent tractable conservation units, in which to target measures for threat mitigation. Front mapping via Earth observation (EO) remote sensing facilitates identification and monitoring of these hotspots of vulnerability. Seasonal or climatological products can locate biophysical hotspots, while near-real-time front mapping augments the suite of tools supporting spatially dynamic ocean management. Synthesis and applications. <b>Frontal</b> <b>zones</b> are ecologically important for mobile marine vertebrates.

5|$|Upon {{reaching}} peak intensity, Odette {{had begun}} accelerating northeastward, which decreased wind shear and slightly increased its southwesterly outflow. The low-level center decelerated as it approached Hispaniola, though the convection continued quickly northeastward. Failing to maintain vertical organization, Odette weakened slightly and made landfall on Jaragua National Park, in the Pedernales Province of the Dominican Republic, around 2300UTC on December 6 with winds of 60mph (95km/h). The circulation became disrupted as it crossed the country, and on December 7 it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean with winds of 45mph (75km/h). It accelerated {{to the northeast}} ahead of an approaching cold front, and late on December 7 Odette transitioned into an extratropical cyclone as its center became embedded within the front. The remnants continued quickly northeastward before losing its identity within the <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> on December 9; the <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> that absorbed Odette also absorbed Tropical Storm Peter a few days later.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not making}} landfall, Helene's close {{proximity}} to the United States resulted in impacts along the East Coast. Impacts were most severe in North Carolina, where the hurricane made its closest approach. Wind impacts were felt primarily from South Carolina to Virginia, though a <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> aided in bringing precipitation as far north as Maine. In the United States, Helene caused $11.2million in damages and one indirect fatality.|$|E
5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29.

Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny.

5|$|A {{cold front}} moved eastward through the United States {{in the middle}} part of July, and reached the East Coast of the United States on July23. By the {{following}} day, a low pressure area developed just southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina ahead of the <b>frontal</b> <b>zone,</b> and quickly formed into a subtropical depression. In association with a nearby upper-level low, the depression tracked quickly southeastward before turning to the southwest. The subtropical depression gradually organized, and satellite classifications began subsequent to merging with a tropical wave on July25. Convection developed closer {{to the center of}} circulation as it gradually decelerated while continuing southwestward and on July27, the system organized into Tropical Depression Three while located about 335miles (539.1km) east of Daytona Beach, Florida.|$|E
5|$|After {{landfall}} {{the storm}} rapidly weakened, and about eight hours after moving ashore, Ernesto deteriorated to tropical depression status. Interacting with a pre-existing <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> that extended eastward through Virginia, Ernesto quickly lost its tropical characteristics, and late on September 1 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. It re-intensified to a gale over the Mid-Atlantic states, only to weaken to an extratropical depression near Pennsylvania. With a large {{high pressure area}} to its east, the remnants turned to the north-northwest, reaching southern Ontario on September 3. After turning northeastward, the extratropical remnants of Ernesto were absorbed into a larger storm over Quebec on September 4.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Cristobal was a {{relatively}} weak tropical cyclone that meandered in the western Atlantic Ocean prior to being absorbed into a <b>frontal</b> <b>zone.</b> The third named storm of the 2002 Atlantic hurricane season, Cristobal developed on August 5 near the coast of South Carolina from the same trough that spawned Tropical Storm Bertha. The storm tracked slowly southeastward in the early portion of its duration, and initially remained disorganized. Cristobal attained peak winds of 50mph (85km/h), and lost {{the characteristics of a}} tropical cyclone on August 8. The remnants brought moderate precipitation to Bermuda, and in combination with a high pressure system the storm caused three drownings on Long Island from rip currents.|$|E

5|$|Virginia {{has some}} special {{considerations}} that affect tropical cyclone-related rainfall. Mountains {{to the west}} act as a perfect mechanism for upward motion during sustained east winds, {{which can lead to}} flash flooding and landslides in that region (e.g. Hurricane Camille). As a tropical system approaches from the south, a <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> sets up between the moist Atlantic Ocean and the drier landmass to the west. This boundary can set up two or three days in advance of a tropical storm, and can lead up to prolonged heavy rains across coastal sections (e.g. Hurricane Floyd). As the cyclone advances north, the boundary will slowly shift west, but progresses west of a Richmond/Washington, D.C. line.|$|E
5|$|After {{maintaining}} its peak intensity for about 24hours, Kyle began weakening on September27 as increased upper-level shear restricted outflow and distorted the convection envelope; drier air {{also contributed to}} the weakening. On September 28, after turning west-northwestward, the hurricane weakened to tropical storm status, and by the next day the center had become devoid of deep convection. A trough passing to its north and a developing ridge to its west left the storm nearly stationary for several days. The weakening rate of Kyle was temporarily halted when thunderstorms redeveloped on September29 and again early the next day, though late on September30 the storm weakened to tropical depression status. The circulation had become elongated from northeast to southwest. The northeastern portion became associated with the approaching <b>frontal</b> <b>zone,</b> and was briefly monitored for signs of development. However, the southwestern portion redeveloped convection and became the dominant circulation.|$|E
5|$|By November 30, {{the last}} day of the Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, a stationary front extended across eastern Cuba into the southwestern Caribbean Sea. On December 1, a low pressure area developed within the <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> just north of Panama, and an anticyclone aloft produced good outflow over the low-level center. The low remained nearly stationary for the next several days, and it gradually became separated from the stationary front. Convection increased across the area due to moisture from the eastern Pacific Ocean and moderate divergence. Increased wind shear deteriorated the system on December 2, though convection redeveloped as the system started a northeast drift. On December 3 a mid-level circulation developed about 140miles (225km) north of the surface center. Convection increased and became better organized as a weak tropical wave reached the area, and it is estimated the system developed into Tropical Depression Twenty at around 1200UTC on December 4 while located about 345miles (560km) south of Kingston, Jamaica; initially, the depression was forecast to track north-northeastward and pass over western Haiti.|$|E

5000|$|The {{synoptic}} scale in meteorology (also known as large scale or cyclonic scale) is a horizontal length {{scale of the}} order of 1000 kilometres (about 620 miles) or more. This corresponds to a horizontal scale typical of mid-latitude depressions (e.g. extratropical cyclones). Most high and low-pressure areas seen on weather maps such as surface weather analyses are synoptic-scale systems, driven by the location of Rossby waves in their respective hemisphere. Low-pressure areas and their related <b>frontal</b> <b>zones</b> occur on the leading edge of a trough within the Rossby wave pattern, while surface highs form on the back edge of the trough.

5|$|Initially, the {{depression}} possessed {{a combination of}} tropical and subtropical characteristics; it remained attached to a nearby <b>frontal</b> <b>zone,</b> though {{the organization of the}} convection and a warm core within the system resulted in classification as a tropical cyclone. Forecasters had predicted {{the depression}} would only slowly strengthen and reach a peak intensity of 65mph (105km/h). However, the depression steadily organized and had strengthened into Tropical Storm Juan by early September25. Juan moved northwestward at around 10mph (16km/h) in response to a developing subtropical ridge to its east. On September26, an eye feature developed, and very deep convection increased around the circulation. The cloud pattern continued to consolidate, and Juan attained hurricane status later on September26 while located 165mi (270km) southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane moved into an area of warm waters and light wind shear, allowing for additional strengthening; by September27, Juan had attained a peak intensity of 105mph (165km/h) while located 635mi (1,020km) south of Halifax, Nova Scotia. At this peak strength, the eye of the hurricane was distinct and embedded within a well-defined and round central dense overcast.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Helene recurving away from the United States East Coast, damage in the United States outside of the Carolinas was less severe. In Virginia, damage was {{relatively}} minor. A peak gust of 56mph (90km/h) was reported in Norfolk. In Hampton Roads, damage was minor, and was confined to downed utility wires and marginal infrastructural damage. Although rainfall was primarily concentrated in the Carolinas, 1,434official rain gauges measured precipitation in coastal areas from South Carolina to Maine. Precipitation was further increased by a <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> to the hurricane's north. In the Mid-Atlantic States, rainfall peaked at 5.29in (134.4mm) in Myerstown, Pennsylvania. Outside of Pennsylvania or the Carolinas, no weather station reported rainfall exceeding 5in (125mm). In the New England region, rainfall peaked at 4.11in (104.4mm) in Hyannis, Massachusetts. Elsewhere in Massachusetts, rainfall totals ranging from 1â4in (25â100mm) caused minor flooding and road washouts. The minor floods led to several automotive accidents. Other states in New England reported rainfall peaks of at least 1in (25mm), with the lowest peak occurring at a weather station in Machias, Maine, which reported 1.16in (29.5mm) of rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The {{subtropical}} storm tracked east-southeastward {{and continued}} to organize, and by late on April 20 an upper-level warm core was present over the system. Based on its organization, Ana is estimated to have become a tropical storm by 0000UTC on April 21. Upon becoming a tropical storm, Ana attained a peak intensity of 60mph (95km/h), {{which was based on}} estimates from the Hebert-Poteat technique and data from QuikSCAT. Shortly thereafter, it made its closest point of approach to Bermuda, when it passed about 130miles (210km) southwest of the island. Operationally, the cyclone was first classified by the National Hurricane Center around this time, when it was considered a subtropical cyclone. Strong upper-level wind shear removed much of the convection, though a small area of thunderstorms persisted near the center. The storm became completely separated from the upper-level system, and the cyclone re-organized, developing an eye feature late on April 21. Embedded within the flow of a cyclone to its north, Ana continued eastward, and early on April 22 the wind shear again removed the convection from the center. Convection waxed and waned throughout the day, and by April 23 the circulation had deteriorated in organization. After turning to the northeast, the circulation center merged with an approaching cold front on April 24, and Tropical Storm Ana completed the transition into an extratropical cyclone. The extratropical storm accelerated east-northeastward before losing its identity within the <b>frontal</b> <b>zone</b> on April 27 southeast of the Azores.|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} {{paper on the}} {{kinematics}} of frontogenesis, Keyser et al.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{that it is}} possible to use measurements of the Doppler spectrum width from a high-resolution radar to obtain quantitative estimates of dissipation rate during the passage of precipitating <b>frontal</b> <b>zones.</b> Using the high-resolution Chilbolton radar, this method has been applied, for the first time, to infer the rate at which kinetic energy is dissipated by turbulence within mid- and lower-tropospheric <b>frontal</b> <b>zones.</b> Analysis of detailed measurements for one cold-frontal region showed multiple shallow sheets of high dissipation rate, with spatially averaged values around I x m 2 s- 3. Comparable values were also observed i n a warm-frontal zone. The magnitude of the observed dissipation rate supports the hypothesis that mixing played a major role in determining the mean properties of the fronts, in that the turbulence acted to destroy the frontal shear layer on a tirne-scale of several hours. These issues have particular relevance to the representation of fronts within future very high-resolution numerical weather-prediction models...|$|R
40|$|The patchiness of {{phytoplankton}} in Charleston Harbor, {{as measured}} by the distribution of chlorophyll a, is coupled to the periodicity of the tidal cycle. Phytoplankton aggregations occur at <b>frontal</b> <b>zones</b> that form on the hood when river and tidal flow are in opposition. The magnitude and variability of the chlorophyll distribution decrease during the ebb, and phytoplankton patches do not form at <b>frontal</b> <b>zones.</b> Tidal current velocities and not tidal heights appear to be the important ecological variables. This tidally driven periodic aggregation of phytoplankton represents an in-teraction between physical forcing functions and biological activity that may focus and locally intensify the trophodynamics of the pelagic component of the Charleston Harbor estuary. Tidally induced aggregation and subsequent offshore transport on the ebb may, in part, provide the mech-anism that links the scale lengths of estuarine and coastal phytoplankton variability. Phytoplankton patchiness in the marine environment has been attributed to a cou-pling between physical forcing functions and biological activity (LeFevre 1986). Patterns of circulation and mixing influence the growth and aggregation of phytoplankton on a continuum of temporal and spatial scales ranging from meters and minutes to kilometers and seasonal changes (Seliger et al. 198 1; Haury et al. 1986; Powell et al. 1986). Increases in phytoplankton biomass occur at the junction of distinct water masses where frontally convergent circulation has either supplied limiting nutrients or resulted in the aggregation of passive (but buoyant) particulatcs (Bowman and Iverson 1978). In estuaries, phytoplankton concentrations are often elevated in <b>frontal</b> <b>zones,</b> as surface convergence promotes aggregation at th...|$|R

40|$|Satellite {{images of}} {{chlorophyll}} {{concentration in the}} surface waters of the Gulf of Mexico suggest {{a high degree of}} heterogeneity in the phytoplankton biomass. The causes of this variability and the amount of variability in the phytoplankton community structure are not well understood. The physical and chemical conditions of a specific environment can influence phytoplankton community structure by selecting for those phytoplankton species able to survive within that environment. Varying salinity and temperature characteristics give water masses distinct surface water density signatures. This study examined the relationship between phytoplankton biomass, community structure, and different water mass properties by measuring chlorophyll a and algal group concentration across <b>frontal</b> <b>zones.</b> Continuous salinity and temperature measurements were used to calculate continuous density along transects during four cruises on the R/V Gyre between summer 2002 and spring 2004. <b>Frontal</b> <b>zones</b> were identified as areas of sharp density change where ?t changed by 1. 5 points over a distance of 1 km. Density fronts that coincided with visible temperature fronts (satellite AVHRR images) were selected for biomass and community structure analysis. Discrete water samples were analyzed using fluorometric analysis (total chlorophyll a concentration) and HPLC analysis (photosynthetic pigments). Community composition for discrete samples was determined using CHEMTAX and these values were used to interpolate community composition. Phytoplankton biomass and community structure were examined at a total of 21 density fronts. Unlike previous studies of <b>frontal</b> <b>zones,</b> phytoplankton biomass (measured as chl a concentration) was not significantly higher within <b>frontal</b> <b>zones</b> than in adjacent waters at any of the 21 fronts.
