50|$|The <b>detailer</b> {{must comply}} with the {{requirements}} of the design drawings and with all industry standards and protocols, such as those established by the American Institute of Steel Construction (AISC) and the American Welding Society (AWS). The <b>detailer</b> is usually not responsible for design, including structural strength, stiffness, and stability (which are the responsibility of the structural engineer), major dimensions of the structure and compliance with relevant building codes (which are the responsibility of the architect). A <b>detailer</b> is generally required to submit his drawings to the structural engineer and/or architect for review prior to the release of drawings for fabrication. However, to complete his drawings, an experienced steel <b>detailer</b> usually suggests connections subject to the approval of the structural engineer in cases where the structural drawings have insufficient information. In these situations, the steel <b>detailer</b> is guided by his experience and knowledge of existing engineering codes such as the Steel Construction Manual published by AISC.|$|E

40|$|The {{existing}} Navy detailing {{process is}} characterized by bilateral negotiations between <b>detailers</b> and sailors. In this process, <b>detailers</b> match sailors with billets while attempting to satisfy, to the maximum extent possible, the needs and preferences of each group. The current process requires the effort of approximately 240 <b>detailers</b> and results in assignments that do not always satisfy the competing preferences of sailors and billets. This thesis explores various two-sided matching processes as currently used in some markets, as possible alternative means of assigning sailors. The {{similarities and differences between}} existing two-sided matching processes and the Navy's assignment process are examined. Various modifications to the assignment process and the matching algorithm are proposed to enable the matching algorithm to be suitably applied to the Navy's situation. It is found that the application of a two-sided matching process would significantly reduce the number of <b>detailers</b> required, while simultaneously improving the overall quality of assignments. Furthermore, to enhance the process, a means of including incentives to encourage sailors to accept difficult to fill positions is provided...|$|R

5000|$|A detailer's {{drawings}} generally {{go through}} several phases. If {{there is any}} unclear information that would prevent the <b>detailer</b> from creating or completing the drawings accurately, a request for information(RFI) {{is sent to the}} relevant trades(typically the general contractor, architect or structural engineer) before proceeding. If the required information is not needed immediately, then the <b>detailer</b> may opt to list the questions on the drawings. Following creation of the drawing, the <b>detailer</b> must usually (as described above) submit a copy of the drawing to the architect and engineer for review ("approval"). Copies of the drawing may be sent to other recipients at this time as well, such as the general contractor, for informational purposes only. The drawing must also be checked for accuracy and completeness by another <b>detailer</b> (for this purpose, the [...] "checker"). To keep track of changes during the drawing creation workflow, the revisions are identified by incrementing an associated number or letter code which should appear in the drawing revision block. Comments arising from approval and corrections made during checking must be resolved, and the original drawing must be updated accordingly (or [...] "scrubbed"). After this, the drawing may be released to the fabricator and/or erector for use in construction.|$|E
5000|$|Today, manual {{drafting}} {{has been}} largely replaced by computer-aided drafting (CAD). A steel <b>detailer</b> using computer-aided methods creates his drawings on a computer, using software specifically designed for the purpose, and printing out his drawings on paper only when they are complete. Many detailers would add another classification for those using 3-D Modeling applications specifically designed for steel detailing, as the process {{for the production of}} drawings using these applications is markedly different from a 2-D drafting approach.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} three types of interaction between physicians and the pharmaceutical industry [...] company-funded clinical trials, company-sponsored continuing medical education (CME) and information for physicians supplied by pharmaceutical <b>detailers</b> [...] on orientation and quality of clinical trials, content of CME courses and physicians' prescribing behaviour. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE and HEALTH searches for English-language articles published from 1978 to 1993, supplemented by material from the author's personal collection. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 227 papers from the MEDLINE and HEALTH searches and about 2000 items from the author's library were initially reviewed. The following selection criteria were used: studies conducted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Britain and the United States; studies conducted after 1977; quantitative surveys containing details of the survey methods; studies on the orientation and quality of company-funded clinical trials and on the content of CME courses giving explicit criteria used in the evaluation; and reports on the outcome of interactions stating how the outcomes were assessed. Thirty-six studies met these criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: Information was extracted on five topics: physicians' attitudes toward drug industry interactions, frequency with which physicians participate in the interactions, orientation and quality of company-funded clinical trials, content of company-sponsored CME courses and changes in physicians' prescribing behaviour {{as a result of an}} interaction. DATA SYNTHESIS: Although most physicians participate only occasionally in company-sponsored clinical trials, most see <b>detailers</b> and attend company-sponsored CME courses. However, physicians do not have a very high opinion of the information from <b>detailers</b> or of company-sponsored CME events. Many doctors regard pharmaceutical companies as an important source of funding for clinical trials, but they also have concerns about accepting money from this source. Company funding of clinical trials may affect the quality of the trials and the types of research that physicians undertake. Company-sponsored CME courses may have a commercial bias even if conducted under guidelines designed to ensure the independence of the event. All three types of interactions affect physicians' prescribing behaviour and, in the case of obtaining information from <b>detailers,</b> physicians' prescribing practices are less appropriate as a result of the interaction. CONCLUSIONS: Physicians are affected by their interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. Further research needs to be done in most cases to determine whether such interactions lead to more or less appropriate prescribing practices. The CMA's guidelines on this topic should be evaluated to see whether they are effective in controlling physician-industry interactions. Further measures may be necessary if the guidelines fail to prevent negative effects on prescribing practices...|$|R
