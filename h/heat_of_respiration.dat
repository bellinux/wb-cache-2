40|$|The {{respiration}} rate of fresh vegetables has the fundamental significance in storage, {{but there is}} few data available on respiration under wide range of temperature. In this study, the relationship between {{respiration rate}} and temperature of thirteen kinds of Japanese vegetables were measured by modern precise ventilatory method. Because of respiration being a result of chemical reaction, the relationships between respiration rate and temperature were fitted to Arrhenius’ equation and Gore’s equation (Modified Arrhenius’ equation). The <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> in kJ per ton per day was obtained multiplying the respiration rate of milligrams of CO_ 2 per kilogram per hour {{by a factor of}} 10. 61. The heats of respiration were all a little higher than the conventional values...|$|E
40|$|Temperature and {{moisture}} heterogeneity, with non-uniform airflow in cold rooms {{was observed in}} several studies. This heterogeneity {{can lead to a}} deterioration of food quality and safety. Heat and mass transfer in cold rooms is a complex phenomenon {{because of the presence of}} the product (airflow modification, <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration.)</b> and the coupling between heat transfer and airflow. Temperature, velocity, humidity and heat transfer coefficient measurements were carried out in a ventilated cold room filled with four apple pallets. The front pallets near the cooling unit were submitted to higher air temperatures compared to the rear ones, leading to product cooling rate and temperature heterogeneity. The experimental results allow the understanding of mechanism of airflow as well as heat and water exchanges between product and air. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|High {{product and}} air {{temperatures}} and moistures are often observed in certain positions {{of a cold}} room leading to deterioration of food quality and safety. To reduce food losses, {{it is necessary to}} understand heat and mass transfers. However, these transfers are complex phenomena {{because of the presence of}} the product (airflow obstacle, <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> [...] .) and the coupling between the transfers and airflow. Temperature and velocity measurements were carried out in a ventilated cold room filled with four apple pallets. Because of the room small dimensions (3. 4 x 3. 4 x 2. 5 m), the cold supply air headed directly to the rear part of the room. Therefore, the rear pallets were submitted to lower air temperatures compared to the front ones. This leads to more rapid product cooling rate and lower product final temperature at the rear. A simplified model was developed. It describes the evolution of product and air temperatures at different zones in the cold room. Good agreement between the predicted and experimental results was found for both product cooling rate and final product temperature...|$|E

50|$|Solar {{energy is}} fixed by the photoautotrophs, called primary producers, like green plants. Primary {{consumers}} absorb {{most of the}} stored energy in the plant through digestion, and transform it into the form of energy they need, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), through <b>respiration.</b> A part <b>of</b> the energy received by primary consumers, herbivores, is converted to body <b>heat</b> (an effect <b>of</b> <b>respiration),</b> which is radiated away and lost from the system. The loss of energy through body heat is far greater in warm-blooded animals, which must eat much more frequently than those that are cold-blooded. Energy loss also occurs in the expulsion of undigested food (egesta) by excretion or regurgitation.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{deviations}} in airflow {{properties and}} product properties on cooling of chicory roots were studied based on numerical simulations with a validated transient model of coupled heat and mass transfer in bulks of chicory roots. The model was solved for a one-dimension 1 -m deep bulk of chicory roots cooled {{at various levels}} of air velocity, temperature and relative humidity. Variations in bulk porosity, <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> and product heat capacity were studied as well. The results led to an improved understanding of the cooling process with respect to control strategies and cold store practice. The smallest sensitivity of product temperature with respect to process conditions was found at low velocity (0. 1 m s(- 1)), low temperature (1 degreesC) and high RH (95 %). Small deviations of these conditions could, however, still lead to increased weight losses {{by as much as}} 4 % after 3 months of storage. Variations of bulk porosity and of respiration rates significantly affected weight loss variations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a transient 3 D CFD model {{of heat and}} mass transfer in bulks of chicory roots. The model consists {{of the system of}} conservation equations of momentum, energy, and mass for the air phase, and the energy and mass for the product phase without considering the internal gradient in temperature and moisture in the product phase. The interaction between the airflow and the porous media is described by an Ergun-type equation based on experimental data. <b>Heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>respiration</b> is included in the model as an empirically derived function of temperature. A finite volume code is used to solve the model equations. The results show a good agreement between the model and the experiments. Differences between predicted and measured weight loss only amount to a maximum 10 % after the initial cooling period. The non-ideal experimental conditions (high velocity low relative humidity of the air), the various sizes of the products, the small scale of the porous region compared {{to the size of the}} product, and the estimation of transfer correlations contribute to the observed differences between experiment and simulation. The model can be applied to study the cooling process in an industrial cold store to find the optimal process settings to improve product quality and reduce product weight loss. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Resting {{cells of}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae Y 25 were heated at 56 degrees C for 0 to 2 min. Respiratory {{activity}} of the cells reflected the severity <b>of</b> the <b>heat</b> stress. The endogenous respiration was approximately 50 microliter of O 2 /mg per h for cells heated for 2 min at 56 degrees C as compared with 2 microliter of O 2 /mg per h for nonheated cells.

The rationale was that the rate and extent of such catabolism was indicative of the cytosolic arginine concentration. No catabolism was observed in cultures treated with an inhibitor or an uncoupler <b>of</b> <b>respiration,</b> but cultures treated with inhibitors of glycolysis rapidly degraded arginine.
