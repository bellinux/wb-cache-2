5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that developed in the Bay of Bengal passed over the southern Indian subcontinent and developed into a depression in the Arabian Sea off the southern Maharashtra coast on October 11. The depression did not <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> it drifted west, and it degenerated into an area of {{low pressure}} as it was approaching the Arabian Peninsula. The depression brought widespread rains to southern Maharashtra and Karnataka states, with 40mm (1.5in) of rain recorded in Karwar. Scattered heavy rain was also reported in the Laccadives.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, {{although}} {{agriculture and}} the dairy industry, particularly the production of Leigh cheese, sometimes known as Leigh Toaster, were important, spinning and weaving began to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> a cottage industry. Work was supplied from Manchester by agents who brought work weekly often to an inn, and where they collected the finished cloth. At first the work was done to supplement the income of local farmers and their families. The cloth woven in Leigh was fustian, a sort of rough corduroy, and by {{the end of the}} 17th century middlemen, fustian masters, were dealing directly with weavers and selling the finished cloth in Manchester.|$|E
5|$|By definition, {{there is}} no serious {{underlying}} medical condition, and most importantly, the ulcers do not represent oral cancer nor are they infectious. However, aphthae are capable of causing significant discomfort. There is a spectrum of severity, with symptoms ranging from a minor nuisance to disabling. Due to pain during eating, weight loss may <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> a result of not eating in severe cases of aphthous stomatitis. Usually, the condition lasts for several years before spontaneously disappearing in later life.|$|E
5|$|Cerezeda parcelled out the {{territory}} around Buena Esperanza in encomienda to his men, and {{gold and silver}} were discovered, {{to the delight of}} the colonists. Cerezeda planned to develop Buena Esperanza as a commercial hub, linking a route from the Caribbean and Spain to the Pacific and the wealth of the recently conquered Peru. The route would involve the resettlement of Puerto de Caballos; it was planned to pass through the Indian settlement of Maniani, which Cerezeda planned to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> a trading centre, and onwards to the Gulf of Fonseca.|$|E

5|$|Croatia has {{implemented}} a mine-awareness educational programme {{aimed at reducing}} the frequency of mine-related accidents through an ongoing information campaign. The programme is conducted by the Croatian Red Cross, the Ministry of Science, Education and Sports {{and a number of}} NGOs in cooperation with the Croatian Mine Action Centre. The Croatian Mine Action Centre actively supports NGOs to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> many programmes as possible and attract new NGOs to mine-awareness and educational activities.

5|$|Cyclone Akash (JTWC designation: 01B, {{also known}} as Cyclonic Storm Akash) was the first named {{tropical}} cyclone of the 2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Warned by both India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), it formed from an area of disturbed weather on the Bay of Bengal on May 12, and gradually organized as it drifted northward. An eye began to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> it approached land, and after reaching peak 3-min sustained winds of 85km/h (50mph) it struck about 115km (70mi) south of Chittagong in Bangladesh. Akash rapidly weakened over land, and advisories were discontinued on May 15.|$|E
5|$|Dense {{vegetation}} (such as that {{of tropical}} rainforests) and urban habitats are not ideal {{for the establishment of}} the human transmission cycle. However, in regions where the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> the insects search for new food sources.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Lawrence {{introduced}} Mars to {{his future}} A manager at Atlantic Records, Aaron Bay-Schuck. After hearing him play {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt {{it was too early}} and that he still needed to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> an artist.|$|E
5|$|In {{embryonic}} development, {{the lungs}} begin to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> an outpouching of the foregut, a tube which {{goes on to}} form {{the upper part of}} the digestive system. When the lungs are formed the fetus is held in the fluid-filled amniotic sac and so they do not function to breathe. Blood is also diverted from the lungs through the ductus arteriosus. At birth however, air begins to pass through the lungs, and the diversionary duct closes, so that the lungs can begin to respire. The lungs only fully develop in early childhood.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} fifteenth century, Scots prose {{also began to}} <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> a genre and to {{demonstrate}} classical and humanist influences. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the Auchinleck Chronicle, the first complete surviving work includes John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490). There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode and the treatise Secreta Secetorum, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to Alexander the Great.|$|E
5|$|Of the two {{theories}} on extratropical cyclone structure and life cycle, the older is the Norwegian Cyclone Model, developed during World War I. In this theory, cyclones <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> they {{move up and}} along a frontal boundary, eventually occluding and reaching a barotropically cold environment. It was developed completely from surface-based weather observations, including descriptions of clouds found near frontal boundaries. This theory still retains merit, {{as it is a}} good description for extratropical cyclones over continental landmasses.|$|E
5|$|Panzer Dragoon Saga was {{developed}} by Sega's Team Andromeda studio for the Saturn over approximately two years. Development began {{around the same time}} as development of the game's predecessor, Panzer Dragoon II Zwei, with a team of about 40, twice as many as the Zwei team. Director Yukio Futatsugi stated that Saga was the most difficult Panzer Dragoon game to <b>develop,</b> <b>as</b> full 3D environments and voice acting were unusual for RPGs at the time.|$|E

5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution is an arcade racing game {{developed}} {{and published by}} Namco for the PlayStation in 1995. It is the PlayStation sequel of Ridge Racer (the arcade sequel is Ridge Racer 2). Like the original Ridge Racer, the player races computer-controlled cars {{with the objective of}} winning a series of races, and supports Namco's NeGcon controller. Ridge Racer Revolution adds two hidden cars, and two-player support via the PlayStation Link cable, and took roughly the same time to <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> the first. The intention was to increase the depth and add features.|$|E
5|$|The backstory is {{explained}} progressively through the player's acquisition of audio logs and encounters with ghostly apparitions. At {{the beginning of}} the game, the player chooses a career in a branch of the Unified National Nominate, a fictional military organization. Each branch of service gives the player a set of starting bonuses composed of certain skills, though may thereafter freely <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> the player chooses. The Marine begins with bonuses to weaponry, the Navy officer is skilled in repairing and hacking, and the OSA agent gets a starting set of psionic powers.|$|E
5|$|The eggs {{have large}} yolks; {{cleavage}} (division) is superficial and a germinal disc develops at the pole. During gastrulation, {{the margins of}} this grow down and surround the yolk, forming a yolk sac, which eventually forms part of the gut. The dorsal side of the disc grows upwards and forms the embryo, with a shell gland on its dorsal surface, gills, mantle and eyes. The arms and funnel <b>develop</b> <b>as</b> part of the foot on the ventral side of the disc. The arms later migrate upwards, coming to form a ring around the funnel and mouth. The yolk is gradually absorbed as the embryo develops.|$|E
