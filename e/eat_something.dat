500|$|On 24 August, Epstein asked Peter Brown and Geoffrey Ellis down to Kingsley Hill for {{the bank}} holiday weekend. Approximately 50 miles {{from his home in}} Chapel Street, Kingsley Hill was Epstein's country home in Warbleton, Sussex. After they arrived, Epstein decided to drive back to London alone because an {{expected}} group of rent boys he had invited failed to arrive, although they did turn up after Epstein left. Epstein phoned Brown at 5pm the next day from his Chapel Street house in London. Brown thought that Epstein sounded [...] "very groggy", and suggested that he take a train back down to the nearest railway station, in Uckfield, instead of driving under the influence of Tuinals. Epstein replied that he would <b>eat</b> <b>something,</b> read his mail and watch Juke Box Jury before phoning Brown to tell him which train to meet. He never called again.|$|E
500|$|The {{digestive}} {{system of the}} horse is somewhat delicate. [...] Horses are unable to regurgitate food, except from the esophagus. [...] Thus, if they overeat or <b>eat</b> <b>something</b> poisonous, vomiting is not an option. [...] They also have a long, complex large intestine and a balance of beneficial microbes in their cecum that can be upset by rapid changes in feed. [...] Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to colic, which is {{a leading cause of}} death in horses. [...] Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets. Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins. [...] For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings. [...] Fermented silage or [...] "haylage" [...] is fed to horses in some places; however, contamination or failure of the fermentation process that allows any mold or spoilage may be toxic.|$|E
