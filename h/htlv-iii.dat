By this time the scientific community had studied the epidemic in great detail. Earlier that year that <b>HTLV-III</b> was identified and isolated by American research scientists, confirming the work done by French research scientists who called it LAV. A lengthy public battle to determine who should be recognized as the discover of the human retro virus delayed development of a test for what would later be called HIV. Ryan had apparently received a contaminated treatment of FactorVIII that was infected with HIV, as did thousands of other Americans with hemophilia and hemophiliacs around the world. At that time, because the retrovirus that causes AIDS had been recently identified, much of the pooled Factor VIII concentrate [...] was tainted. Blood banks and pharmaceuticals dismissed calls by the CDC to use a Hepatitis B test as a surrogate until a HIV test could be developed. Late plasma products were screen and heat treated to deactivate both HIV and Hepatitis. Among hemophiliacs treated with blood-clotting factors between 1979 and 1984, nearly 90% became infected with HIV and/or Hepatitis C. At the time of his diagnosis, his T-cell count had dropped to 25 (a healthy individual without HIV will have around 5001200). Doctors predicted Ryan White had only six months to live.|$|E

50|$|The human T-{{lymphotropic}} virus, human T-cell lymphotropic virus, {{or human}} T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus (HTLV) family of viruses are {{a group of}} human retroviruses that are known to cause a type of cancer called adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma and a demyelinating disease called HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The HTLVs belong to a larger group of primate T-lymphotropic viruses (PTLVs). Members of this family that infect humans are called HTLVs, {{and the ones that}} infect Old World monkeys are called Simian T-lymphotropic viruses (STLVs). To date, four types of HTLVs (human T-lymphotropic virus 1 HTLV-I, human T-lymphotropic virus 2 HTLV-II, <b>HTLV-III,</b> and HTLV-IV) and four types of STLVs (STLV-I, STLV-II, STLV-III, and STLV-V) have been identified. HTLV types HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 viruses are the first retroviruses which were discovered. Both belong to the oncovirus subfamily of retroviruses and can transform human lymphocytes so that they are self-sustaining in vitro. The HTLVs are believed to originate from intraspecies transmission of STLVs. The original name for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, was <b>HTLV-III.</b> The HTLV-1 genome is diploid, composed of two copies of a single-stranded RNA virus whose genome is copied into a double-stranded DNA form that integrates into the host cell genome, at which point the virus is referred to as a provirus. A closely related virus is bovine leukemia virus BLV.|$|E
50|$|Around 1985, {{public and}} private {{institutions}} started to create programs to educate the population. They began to hold informational meetings and public forums, distribute literature, and started outreach efforts such as a hotline for counseling and referrals.

The hotline staff met with social service providers, the New York State AIDS institute, the New York Blood Center and the Hemophilia Foundation in order to coordinate resources for post-test counseling programs.

50|$|It was {{not until}} French President François Mitterrand and American President Ronald Reagan met in person that the major issues were ironed out.

They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS). This compromise allowed Montagnier and Gallo to end their feud and collaborate with each other again, writing a chronology that appeared in Nature that year.|$|E

5000|$|A {{team led}} by Robert Gallo of the United States {{published}} similar findings {{in the same issue}} of Science and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus [...] "human T-lymphotropic virus type III" [...] (<b>HTLV-III)</b> because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab. Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly. In comparison, the first two human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, or at least shared a common source.|$|E
5000|$|Funding for the NIH {{has often}} {{been a source of}} {{contention}} in Congress, serving as a proxy for the political currents of the time. During the 1980s, President Reagan repeatedly tried to cut funding for research, only to see Congress partly restore funding. The political contention over NIH funding slowed the nation's response to the AIDS epidemic; while AIDS was reported in newspaper articles from 1981, no funding was provided for research on the disease. In 1984 National Cancer Institute scientists found implications that [...] "variants of a human cancer virus called <b>HTLV-III</b> are the primary cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)," [...] a new epidemic that gripped the nation. It was not until July 1987, as NIH celebrated its 100th anniversary, that President Reagan announced a committee to research the HIV epidemic. [...] By the 1990s, the NIH committee focus had shifted to DNA research, and launched the Human Genome Project.|$|E

Using this craftsman test, Mathez and Leibowitch discover a disturbing frequency of individuals contaminated by the retro-virus amongst the polytranfusion recipients, and later, in collaboration with Dr François Pinon, head of transfusions at the Cochin hospital, go on to discover, the alarming proportion of HV positive blood donors (1 in 200) in a pilot {{study carried out on}} [...] donors in the Paris and Ile-de-France area. The health authorities were alerted on this issue together with their dramatic consequences for hemophiliacs (« if the Cochin Hospital study is correct, then all anti-hemophiliac stocks are contaminated … », Jean Baptiste Brunet at the French General Directory on Health, Mars 1985 13). It was thanks to this artisanal test that 50 HIV positive blood donations, established then to be 100% contaminating, were taken out of the transfusion process, and 150 potential receivers of this blood were protected from contamination.|$|E
50|$|This {{move on the}} ICLU’s part {{seemed to}} only strain the {{relationship}} between the organization and the city’s gay leadership. Shortly after the creation of the Task Force, Berg and Sarris met with ICLU leaders. The previous year, the ICLU had reached an agreement with the Indianapolis Police Department to establish restrictions on the Department’s videotaping of gays and others, but had not included any of the gay leadership. Stan Berg wrote a brief story in The Works aptly titled, “ICLU and Gay Leaders Agree to Disagree.” Over {{the course of the next}} two years, Jones would criss-cross the state delivering speeches about gay rights and giving interviews to local media. In 1986, at the American Civil Liberties Union’s annual conference in Boulder, Colorado, Jones isolated himself in his room and after an entire night, he emerged with a draft policy on non-discrimination against people with AIDS and <b>HTLV-III</b> (the first name for HIV) and a resolution opposing mandatory AIDS testing. Both policies were adopted virtually unchanged. This conference was also attended by another person who would have a major leadership role in gay and lesbian politics, Urvashi Vaid. She and Jones met at a party in Boulder and spent most of their evening forging ideas about the future of the movement. Vaid would later become executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.|$|E
