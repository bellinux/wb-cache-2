5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western <b>Fergana</b> <b>Valley.</b> The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks.

5|$|Babur, was a {{descendant}} of Genghis Khan and Timur, from the <b>Fergana</b> <b>Valley</b> in modern-day Uzbekistan. In 1526, he invaded India, defeated the last Lodhi sultan in the First Battle of Panipat and founded the Mughal Empire that ruled from Delhi and Agra. The Mughal dynasty ruled Delhi {{for more than three}} centuries, with a sixteen-year hiatus during the reigns of Sher Shah Suri and Hemu from 1540 to 1556. In 1553, the Hindu king, Hemu acceded to the throne of Delhi by defeating forces of Mughal Emperor Humayun at Agra and Delhi. However, the Mughals re-established their rule after Akbar's army defeated Hemu during the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556. Shah Jahan built the seventh city of Delhi that bears his name Shahjahanabad, which served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1638 and is today known as the Old City or Old Delhi.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, Babur, a Timurid {{descendant}} of Timur and Genghis Khan from <b>Fergana</b> <b>Valley</b> (modern-day Uzbekistan), {{swept across the}} Khyber Pass and founded the Mughal Empire, covering India, along with modern-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The Mughals were descended from Persianised Central Asian Turks (with significant Mongol admixture). In the Mughal era, Uttar Pradesh became the heartland of the empire. Mughal emperors Babur and Humayun ruled from Delhi. In 1540 an Afghan, Sher Shah Suri, took over the reins of Uttar Pradesh after defeating the Mughal king Humanyun. Sher Shah and his son Islam Shah ruled Uttar Pradesh from their capital at Gwalior. After the death of Islam Shah Suri, his prime minister Hemu became the de facto ruler of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and the western parts of Bengal. He was bestowed the title of Hemchandra Vikramaditya (title of Vikramāditya adopted from Vedic Period) at his formal coronation took place at Purana Quila in Delhi on 7 October 1556. Hemu died in the Second Battle of Panipat, and Uttar Pradesh came under Emperor Akbar's rule. Akbar ruled from Agra and Fatehpur Sikri. In the 18th century, {{after the fall of}} Mughal authority, the power vacuum was filled by the Maratha Empire, in the mid-18th century, the Maratha army invaded the Uttar Pradesh region, which resulted in Rohillas losing control of Rohillkhand to the Maratha rulers Raghunath Rao and Malharao Holkar. The conflict between Rohillas and Marathas came to an end on 18 December 1788 with the arrest of Ghulam Qadir, the grandson of Najeeb-ud-Daula, who was defeated by the Maratha general Mahadaji Scindia. In 1803, following the Second Anglo-Maratha War, when the British East India Company defeated the Maratha Empire, much of the region came under British suzerainty.|$|E

5000|$|Wheat {{and barley}} are {{cultivated}} in rainfed areas, {{mostly in the}} southern plains of Khatlon province. Rice, on the other hand, is grown in river valleys, where paddies can be easily created by flooding. The main rice producer in Tajikistan is Sughd Province. Fully 44% of the rice harvest comes from Zeravshan and <b>Fergana</b> <b>valleys</b> in Sughd; another 36% is produced in the heavily irrigated Khatlon lowlands and the remaining 20% comes from Gissar Valley, irrigated by the Kofarnihon River. Other crops include potatoes, vegetables, and melons, which are grown across the entire country. The north of the country produces apricots, pears, plums, apples, cherries, pomegranates, figs, and nuts. Fresh fruits are consumed locally, whereas dried fruits are a traditional export for Tajikistan (making up more than 1% of total exports in 2005, with Russia the main destination).|$|R

Wallingford, UK: International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS). IAHS Publication 330 During the last decade, {{the competition for}} water between the hydropower-oriented upstream and irrigated agriculture-centred downstream in the Syrdarya River basin, Central Asia, has significantly increased. Since 1993, 2 - 3 km 3 of winter flows from hydropower generation in the upstream have flowed annually into the saline depression of Arnasai located in the midstream. This results in much less water being available for irrigation during summer. Groundwater development modelling conducted {{for one of the}} <b>Fergana</b> <b>Valley's</b> aquifers suggests that temporary storage of winter flows in the aquifer - "water banking" - could be an effective adaptive strategy to optimize water management in the basin. The study concludes that a shift from canal to groundwater irrigation, combined with winter-flow banking can effectively reduce the upstream-downstream pressures and ensure improved water supply for downstream water uses during summer time...|$|R

25|$|Namangan, {{like many}} other cities in the <b>Fergana</b> <b>valley,</b> was {{originally}} populated by the Sogdian people, later becoming a Persian speaking city.

A second Uzbek state, the Khanate of Khiva was established in the oasis of Khorazm {{at the mouth of the}} Amu Darya. The Khanate of Bukhoro was initially led by the energetic Shaybanid Dynasty, the successors of Muhammad Shaybani. The Shaybanids initially competed against Iran for a few years, which was led by the Safavid Dynasty, for the rich far-eastern territory of present-day Iran. The struggle with the Safavids also had a religious aspect because the Uzbeks were Sunni Muslims, and Iran was Shia.|$|E

25|$|Water resources, {{which are}} {{unevenly}} distributed, {{are in short}} supply in most of Uzbekistan. The vast plains that occupy two-thirds of Uzbekistan's territory have little water, and there are few lakes. The two largest rivers feeding Uzbekistan are the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, which originate in the mountains of Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, respectively. These rivers form the two main river basins of Central Asia; they are used primarily for irrigation, and several artificial canals have been built to expand the supply of arable land in the <b>Fergana</b> <b>Valley</b> and elsewhere. During the Soviet Era, a plan was devised in which Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan provided water from these two rivers to Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summer, and these three countries provided Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with oil and gas during the winter in return. However, this system dissolved {{after the collapse of the}} USSR, and a new resource-sharing plan has yet to be put in place. According to the International Crisis Group, this situation could lead to irreparable regional destabilization if it is not resolved.

25|$|Yaz I {{culture is}} argued {{to be related}} to the sedentarisation of the nomadic Indo-Iranians in the Eurasian Steppe, a {{synthesis}} with autochthonous traits. It extended from the central part of the Kopet Dag mountains to the fertile delta of the Murghab River. It is characterised for total lack of necropolises and tombs, as well painted ceramic with triangle and ladder patterns. Recent research shows four groups of patterns, the triangular (triangles and chevrons), lozenges, bands, and of additional elements. It seems to be connected to the Chust culture of <b>Fergana</b> <b>Valley,</b> Mundigak V-VI in Sistan, and Pirak I-III on the Kacchi Plain. Compared to Chust culture, there was not found any tomb from Yaz culture. Asko Parpola and Fred Hiebert argued that these cultures seemingly derive from Haladun culture (1750–1200 BCE) of Xinjiang, and some Andronovo culture contacts, indicating Europid upper strata who spoke East Aryan. The introduction of the culture is seemingly related to the sound change *s > h when Iranian language came in the Indo-Iranian borderlands of Rgvedic tribes around 1500 BCE, seen in the change of the Vedic river Sindhu into Avestan Hindu (Indus River), Sarasvati into Haraxhvaiti.|$|E
