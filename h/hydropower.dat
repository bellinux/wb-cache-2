5|$|<b>Hydropower</b> is {{the most}} used form of {{renewable}} energy in Russia, and there is large potential in Russia for more use of <b>hydropower.</b> Russia has 102 <b>hydropower</b> plants with capacities of over 100MW, making it fifth {{in the world for}} <b>hydropower</b> production. It is also second in the world for hydro potential, yet only 20% of this potential is developed. Russia is home to 9% of the world's hydro resources, mostly in Siberia and the country's far east. At the end of 2005, the generating capacity from hydroelectric sources in Russia was 45,700MW, and an additional 5,648MW was under construction. The World Energy Council believes that Russia has much potential for using its hydro resources, with a theoretical potential of about 2,295TWh/yr, with 852TWh being economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|The total <b>hydropower</b> {{potential}} of the river basin is 2,560,000kW.|$|E
5|$|About 90% of Seattle's {{electricity}} is produced using <b>hydropower.</b> Less than 2% of {{electricity is}} produced using fossil fuels.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydropower</b> is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global <b>hydropower</b> in 2010. China is the largest hydroelectricity producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three hydroelectricity plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of hydroelectricity is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.|$|E
5|$|It was {{the main}} power supply for Lhasa until the Yamdrok <b>Hydropower</b> Station came into operation.|$|E
5|$|Kala Capital owned 45 {{percent of}} the Georgia <b>Hydropower</b> Construction Company company SakHidroEnergoMsheni, a joint stock company {{incorporated}} in Georgia in 1998. His candidacy as Minister of Energy and Natural Resources in October 2012 was therefore overshadowed by concerns about a serious risk that a conflict of interests might arise. Reports {{on the same day}} indicated that Kaladze might refuse the energy portfolio or sell off his shares in Georgia <b>Hydropower</b> Construction Company within 10 days of his appointment.|$|E
5|$|Environmental {{concerns}} with electricity generation {{have led to}} an increased focus on generation from renewable sources, in particular from wind and <b>hydropower.</b> While debate {{can be expected to}} continue over the environmental impact of different means of electricity production, its final form is relatively clean.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, the BPA hired Oklahoma folksinger Woody Guthrie {{to write}} songs for a {{documentary}} film promoting {{the benefits of}} <b>hydropower.</b> In the month he spent traveling the region Guthrie wrote 26 songs, which have become {{an important part of}} the cultural history of the region.|$|E
5|$|Other key {{industries}} include {{tourism and}} <b>hydropower,</b> {{and there is}} prospective development in IT, ITES, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and automobile industries. The service sector of Uttarakhand mainly includes tourism, information technology, higher education, and banking.|$|E
5|$|According to the National Development and Reform Commission of China, 366grams of coal {{would produce}} 1kWh of {{electricity}} during 2006. At full power, Three Gorges reduces coal consumption by 31million tonnes per year, avoiding 100million tonnes {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions, millions of tonnes of dust, onemillion tonnes of sulfur dioxide, 370,000tonnes of nitric oxide, 10,000tonnes of carbon monoxide, and {{a significant amount of}} mercury. <b>Hydropower</b> saves the energy needed to mine, wash, and transport the coal from northern China.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the main}} common {{threats to the}} park are glacier retreat due to global warming; <b>hydropower</b> projects; legal and illegal mining {{operations}} with low environmental standards; and loss of biodiversity to agricultural land and pastures (the latter mainly due to a conflict between the park purposes and the ancestral rights to the land by the locals).|$|E
5|$|Between Memorial Day and Labor Day, the GRDA offers free {{tours of}} the dam. In 2010, there were over 9,000 visitors; a number which has been {{steadily}} growing in recent years. Additionally in 2010, the Ecosystems and Education Center was completed and {{has become part of}} the tour. The center serves as a water and fish monitoring research lab while offering visitors information about <b>hydropower</b> and water/electrical safety.|$|E
5|$|East River, {{formally}} East River Sheet Harbour, is {{the other}} main river that discharges into Sheet Harbour. It flows through the Marshall Flowage, a large flowage, then past the Ruth Falls Power Plant, a <b>hydropower</b> generating station. It narrows back into a river for a short while, then flows into {{the head of the}} Northeast Arm.|$|E
5|$|For all its success, by the 1920s Argentina {{was not an}} industrialized {{country by}} the {{standards}} of Britain, Germany or the United States. A major hindrance to full industrialisation was the lack of energy sources such as coal or <b>hydropower.</b> Experiments with oil, discovered in 1907, had poor results. Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales, the first state-owned oil company in Latin America, was founded in 1922 as a public company responsible for 51% of the oil production; the remaining 49% was in private hands.|$|E
5|$|Hydroelectricity is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 <b>hydropower</b> generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Iceland is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to create an economy {{generated}} through industries fueled by renewable energy, and there is still a large amount of untapped hydroelectric energy in Iceland. In 2002 it was estimated that Iceland only generated 17% of the total harnessable hydroelectric energy in the country. Iceland’s government believes another 30 TWh of <b>hydropower</b> every year could be produced, whilst taking into account the sources that must remain untapped for environmental reasons.|$|E
5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its upper reaches (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for hydroelectric power generation due to the steep gradient in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of hydroelectric power stations began before World War II, it significantly increased following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 kilowatt JR East Shinano River <b>Hydropower</b> Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|The trams are {{electrically}} powered from 750 V DC overhead lines. Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements {{to ensure that}} sustainable power would be factored into choosing an energy supplier, and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via <b>hydropower.</b> Now, energy for the system is generated by biomass.|$|E
5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of hydroelectric power are directly related to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via hydroelectric power plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting. In 2009 Iceland built its biggest hydroelectric project to date, a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the Kárahnjúkar <b>Hydropower</b> Plant. This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|In 1861, Loring joined Fletcher in L. Fletcher & Co., {{a general}} store specializing in {{supplies}} for lumbermen on Nicollet Avenue across from Minneapolis City Hall where they prospered for fifteen years. They joined with W. F. Cahill {{to convert the}} municipal waterworks building into a flour mill run on <b>hydropower,</b> the smallest in the Mississippi west bank milling district. With George Hineline they added three limestone stories and operated it as the W. F. Cahill & Co. Holly mill. During this period, Loring served in the city government, first as road supervisor and in 1872 as a Minneapolis City Council member from the Fifth Ward in the Near North community.|$|E
5|$|Inexpensive <b>hydropower</b> {{supported}} {{the location of}} a large aluminum industry in the region, because its reduction from bauxite requires large amounts of electricity. Until 2000, the Northwestern United States produced up to 17percent of the world's aluminum and 40percent of the aluminum produced in the United States. The commoditization of power in the early 21st century, coupled with drought that reduced the generation capacity of the river, damaged the industry and by 2001, Columbia River aluminum producers had idled 80percent of its production capacity. By 2003, the entire United States produced only 15percent of the world's aluminum, and many smelters along the Columbia had gone dormant or out of business.|$|E
5|$|Kaladze became {{involved}} in the politics of Georgia {{as a member of the}} opposition Georgian Dream–Democratic Georgia party founded by billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili in February 2012. He was elected to the Parliament of Georgia on 1 October 2012. He was approved as Deputy Prime Minister as well as Minister of Energy in the cabinet of Bidzina Ivanishvili on 25 October 2012. The appointment was met with skepticism in professional energy circles. More importantly, it stirred an intense debate on a conflict of interest arising from Kaladze's business interests in the Georgia <b>Hydropower</b> Construction Company, in which Kala Capital owned 45 percent. Kala Capital sold the shares to GMC Group in November 2012 but concerns whether his indirect commercial interests had been abandoned remain.|$|E
5|$|Renewable {{energy in}} Russia mainly {{consists}} of hydroelectric energy. The {{country is the}} sixth largest producer of renewable energy in the world, although it is 56th when hydroelectric energy is not taken into account. Some 179TWh of Russia's energy production comes from renewable energy sources, {{out of a total}} economically feasible potential of 1823TWh. 16% of Russia's electricity is generated from <b>hydropower,</b> and less than 1% is generated from all other renewable energy sources combined. Roughly 68% of Russia's electricity is generated from thermal power and 16% from nuclear power.|$|E
5|$|Switzerland's {{ecosystems}} can {{be particularly}} fragile, because the many delicate valleys separated by high mountains often form unique ecologies. The mountainous regions themselves are also vulnerable, with a rich range of plants not found at other altitudes, and experience some pressure from visitors and grazing. The climatic, geological and topographical conditions of the alpine region make for a very fragile ecosystem that is particularly sensitive to climate change. Nevertheless, according to the 2014 Environmental Performance Index, Switzerland ranks first among 132 nations in safeguarding the environment, due to its high scores on environmental public health, its heavy reliance on {{renewable sources of energy}} (<b>hydropower</b> and geothermal energy), and its control of greenhouse gas emissions.|$|E
5|$|The Norwegian {{fleet of}} plug-in {{electric}} cars {{is one of}} the cleanest in the world because 98% of the electricity generated in the country comes from <b>hydropower.</b> Norway, with about 5.2 million people, is the country with the largest EV ownership per capita in the world. In March 2014, Norway became the first country where over one in every 100 registered passenger cars is plug-in electric. The plug-in car market penetration reached 2% in March 2015, passed 3% in December 2015, and achieved 5% at the end of 2016.|$|E
5|$|The dams on the Willamette's major tributaries are {{primarily}} large flood-control, water storage, and power-generating dams. Thirteen of these dams were built from the 1940s through the 1960s {{to be operated}} by the United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), and 11 of those produce <b>hydropower.</b> Flood-control dams operated by the USACE are estimated to hold up to 27percent of the Willamette's runoff. They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn, and to divert water into deeper, narrower channels to prevent flooding. In addition, a relatively small of amount of the water stored in the reservoirs is used for irrigation.|$|E
5|$|The hilly {{northern}} {{parts of}} Hrvatsko Zagorje and the flat plains of Slavonia {{in the east}} (which {{is part of the}} Pannonian Basin) are traversed by major rivers such as Sava, Drava, Kupa and Danube. The Danube, Europe's second longest river, runs through the city of Vukovar in the extreme east and forms part of the border with Serbia. The central and southern regions near the Adriatic coastline and islands consist of low mountains and forested highlands. Natural resources found in the country in quantities significant enough for production include oil, coal, bauxite, low-grade iron ore, calcium, gypsum, natural asphalt, silica, mica, clays, salt and <b>hydropower.</b>|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the large}} <b>hydropower</b> plants in Russia date from the Soviet era, the {{abundance}} of fossil fuels in the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation has resulted in little need {{for the development of}} other renewable energy sources. There are currently plans to develop all types of renewable energy, which is strongly encouraged by the Russian government. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has called for renewable energy to have a larger share of Russia's energy output, and has taken steps to promote the development of renewable energy in Russia since 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for <b>hydropower.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first <b>hydropower</b> {{plant was}} built in 1904 by a local entrepreneur. It was located {{in a small town}} outside of Reykjavík and {{produced}} 9 kW of power. The first municipal hydroelectric plant {{was built in}} 1921, and it could produce 1 MW of power. This plant single-handedly quadrupled the amount of electricity in the country. The 1950s marked the next evolution in hydroelectric plants. Two plants were built on the Sog River, one in 1953 which produced 31 MW, and the other in 1959 which produced 26.4 MW. These two plants were the first built for industrial purposes and they were co-owned by the Icelandic government. This process continued in 1965 when the national power company, Landsvirkjun, was founded. It was owned by both the Icelandic government and the municipality of Reykjavík. In 1969, they built a 210 MW plant on the Þjórsá River that would supply the southeastern area of Iceland with electricity and run an aluminum smelting plant that could produce 33,000tons of aluminum a year.|$|E
5|$|The largest dams in Russia are the Sayano-Shushenskaya Dam, {{which has}} an {{installed}} capacity of 6,400MW; the Krasnoyarsk Dam (6,000MW); the Bratsk Dam (4,500MW); the Ust-Ilimsk Dam (4,320MW) and the Zeya Dam (1,330MW). Some {{of the most recent}} dam projects are the Bureya Dam (2010MW) and the Irganai Dam (800MW). The Boguchany Dam (1920MW), Zelenchuk Dam (320MW), Zaramag Dam (352MW) and Nizhne-Chereksky (60MW) are currently under construction. RusHydro is the largest hydroelectric company in Russia and the second largest hydroelectric producer in the world. In October 2010, China Yangtze Power, the largest <b>hydropower</b> corporation in China, and EuroSibEnergo, a Russian energy company, signed a cooperation agreement to expand hydroelectric energy production in Russia and export energy to China's northern territories. The West Siberian Generating Company has plans to start construction of eight mini-hydroelectric power plants in the Altai region before 2015.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or <b>hydropower</b> with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to study the effects of large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{distribution}} in the state {{as well in the}} Federal Territory of Labuan are operated and managed by the Sabah Electricity Sdn. Bhd. (SESB). Sabah electrics are mostly generated from diesel power plant, <b>hydropower</b> and combined cycle power plants. The only main hydroelectric plant is the Tenom Pangi Dam. The combined cycle power plant called Kimanis Power Plant was completed in 2014, supplying 300 MW, with 285 MW nominal capacity. The plant is a joint venture between Petronas and NRG Consortium that also includes facilities such as gas pipeline of Sabah–Sarawak Gas Pipeline and a terminal of Sabah Oil and Gas Terminal. There is another two combined cycle power plants with a capacity of 380 MW operated by Ranhill Holdings Berhad. In 2009, the electricity coverage covers 67% of the state population and by 2011 increase to 80%. The coverage reach 100% in 2012 after an allocation of RM962.5million from the federal government were given to expand the coverage under the 2012 National Budget. The electrical grid is divided into two of West Coast and East Coast which has been integrated since 2007. The West Coast Grid supplies electricity to Kota Kinabalu, Papar, Beaufort, Keningau, Kota Belud, Kota Marudu, Kudat and Labuan with a capacity of 488.4 MW and maximum demand of 396.5 MW. While the East Coast Grid supplies electricity to the major towns of Sandakan, Kinabatangan, Lahad Datu, Kunak, Semporna and Tawau with a capacity of 333.02 MW and maximum demand of 203.3 MW.|$|E
5|$|The newest {{bridge across}} the Parrett is Cocklemoor Bridge, a {{pedestrian}} footbridge close to the Great Bow Bridge. It was erected in 2006 and forms part of the River Parrett Trail. The next bridge upstream is Bicknell's bridge, which was formerly known as Bickling bridge, which carries the road from Huish Episcopi to Muchelney. It replaced a footbridge in 1829 or 1830. At Muchelney the Westover Bridge carries a minor road over the river, and another minor road crosses on the Thorney Bridge close to the Thorney (or silent) Mill and a lock. The mill, with an iron overshot wheel, was built to grind corn in 1823. Another bridge and mill occur further upstream at Gawbridge west of Martock, where the mill {{has been the subject}} of a feasibility study by the South Somerset <b>Hydropower</b> Group. Carey's Mill Bridge was built of Ham stone in the 18th century and named after Carey's Mill, which originally occupied the site. It is surrounded by a collection of buildings known as the Parrett Iron Works, founded in 1855 on the site of a former snuff mill, which included a foundry, with a prominent chimney, ropewalk, workshops and several smaller workshops and cottages. The sluice which powered the waterwheel and sluice keeper's cottage still exist. Further south the river flows under the A303 near Norton-sub-Hamdon and the A356 near Chedington.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydropower.</b> An {{important}} use {{of water}} in Egypt is {{for the production of}} <b>hydropower.</b> This use is non-consumptive and is thus available for other uses further downstream. <b>Hydropower</b> plants exist at the Aswan High Dam (2100 MW), the old Aswan Dam (270 MW)and power plants at the Esna (90 MW) and Naga Hammadi weirs (64 MW). Together these plants accounted for 16% of installed electricity generation capacity in 2004. The share of <b>hydropower</b> in power generation declines since the <b>hydropower</b> potential is largely exploited and power demand increases rapidly.|$|E
25|$|Romania has an {{estimated}} total usable <b>hydropower</b> of 36,000 GWh per year. In 2007 the total installed capacity of <b>hydropower</b> plants in Romania was 6,400 MWh {{all of which}} were owned by Hidroelectrica.|$|E
