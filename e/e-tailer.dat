Since 2014, the movement promised to display “campaign spreads and brand imagery with stomach rolls, gapless thighs and other perceived flaws that would normally have been edited out of the ads”. Other brands such as Neon Moon, which is a feminist lingerie brand from London, deeply believes in embracing and advocating the beauty of flaws, instead {{of the need to}} retouch their models for aesthetic purposes. Hence, campaigns often feature a range of “diverse models and lack of airbrushing as a marketing tool”.

40|$|In recent years, online {{retailers}} (also called <b>e-tailers)</b> {{have started}} allowing manufacturers {{direct access to}} their customers while charging a fee for providing this access, a format {{commonly referred to as}} agency selling. In this paper, we use a stylized theoretical model to answer a key question that <b>e-tailers</b> are facing: When should they use an agency selling format instead of using the more conventional reselling format? We find that agency selling is more efficient than reselling and leads to lower retail prices; however, the <b>e-tailers</b> end up giving control over retail prices to the manufacturer. Therefore, the reaction by the manufacturer, who makes electronic channel pricing decisions based on their impact on demand in the traditional channel (brick-and-mortar retailing), is an important factor for <b>e-tailers</b> to consider. We find that when sales in the electronic channel lead to a negative effect on demand in the traditional channel, <b>e-tailers</b> prefer agency selling, whereas when sales in the electronic channel lead to substantial stimulation of demand in the traditional channel, <b>e-tailers</b> prefer reselling. This preference is mediated by competition between e-tailers—as competition between them increases, <b>e-tailers</b> prefer to use agency selling. We also find that when <b>e-tailers</b> benefit from positive externalities from the sales of the focal product (such as additional profits from sales of associated products), retail prices may be lower under reselling than under agency selling, and the <b>e-tailers</b> prefer reselling under some conditions for which they would prefer agency selling without the positive externalities...|$|R

To explore the way how complementor partners add value to <b>E-tailers,</b> I propose a value added model of complementors following an induction research approach based on value creation theories and relevant literature review. The complementors add value to <b>E-tailers</b> through four value driver factors, namely trust, loyalty, efficiency and innovation.

Survival, however, is more difficult for <b>e-tailers</b> who sell touch and feel products and for pure <b>e-tailers</b> {{who do not have}} the support of either brick and mortar stores or catalog operations. While introductory stage entrants have higher survival rates versus growth stage entrants, there is no significant impact for rank order of entry or pioneer leadtime.

40|$|The dynamic {{effects of}} {{survival}} determinants in e-commerce are tested using longitudinal data on 460 <b>e-tailers.</b> This is achieved through {{the incorporation of}} both time-varying covariates and coefficients in a discrete hazard rate model. The model includes elements of competitive strategy, industry structure, firm and product characteristics, and the macro environment. The study demonstrates the changing effect over time of factors affecting survival. For example, order of entry advantages are observed, but they are short-lived. This finding shows that <b>e-tailers</b> cannot rely on early entry as a strategic move in the long run. <b>E-tailers</b> with more media presence seem to survive longer. Being publicly traded and selling products with digital characteristics present advantages for <b>e-tailers</b> only in the beginning years, {{but they are not}} sustainable over long time periods. Survival chances decrease with higher competitive density, market growth rate, and equity market level at the time of entry. Conversely, economic growth tends to increase survival chances.

To evaluate the dynamic stages of e-tailing business as an innovative venture, we propose four stages: exploration, breakeven, growth, and maturity. The stages are measured by the impact of revenue and income on the firm value, and a regression model is adopted to formulate the model. To empirically examine the stages of <b>e-tailers</b> and retailers, we have collected 14 <b>e-tailers,</b> 112 C 2 ̆ 6 M, and 75 B 2 ̆ 6 M from the U. S. stock markets. According to this study, the proposed stage model explains the evolution of pure <b>e-tailers</b> very meaningfully. <b>E-tailers</b> were in the late exploration stage in 1999, breakeven stage in 2000, and growth stage in 2001. Unlike our hypothetical expectation, the stage model could not adequately explain the effect of online business to C 2 ̆ 6 M. In this regard, the impact of online channel to traditional retailers was not revolutionary. In 1999 and 2000, the primary contributing factor to firm value of C 2 ̆ 6 M was income, but in 2001, it was revenue. According to this result, investors were very conservative to the risky investment on the click business of traditional retailers.
