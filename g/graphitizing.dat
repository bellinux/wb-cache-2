5000|$|Carbon fibres {{are created}} when {{polyacrylonitrile}} fibres (PAN), Pitch resins, or Rayon are carbonized (through oxidation and thermal pyrolysis) at high temperatures. Through further processes of <b>graphitizing</b> or stretching the fibres strength or elasticity {{can be enhanced}} respectively. Carbon fibres are manufactured in diameters analogous to glass fibres with diameters ranging from 4 to 17 µm. These fibres wound into larger threads for transportation and further production processes.

50|$|A common {{method of}} {{manufacture}} involves heating the spun PAN filaments to approximately 300 °C in air, which breaks many of the hydrogen bonds and oxidizes the material. The oxidized PAN is then placed into a furnace having an inert atmosphere of a gas such as argon, and heated to approximately 2000 °C, which induces graphitization of the material, changing the molecular bond structure. When heated in the correct conditions, these chains bond side-to-side (ladder polymers), forming narrow graphene sheets which eventually merge to form a single, columnar filament. The result is usually 93-95% carbon. Lower-quality fiber can be manufactured using pitch or rayon as the precursor instead of PAN. The carbon can become further enhanced, as high modulus, or high strength carbon, by heat treatment processes. Carbon heated {{in the range of}} 1500-2000 °C (carbonization) exhibits the highest tensile strength (820,000 psi, 5,650 MPa or N/mm²), while carbon fiber heated from 2500 to 3000 °C (<b>graphitizing)</b> exhibits a higher modulus of elasticity (77,000,000 psi or 531 GPa or 531 kN/mm²).|$|E

Fluorination resulted in higher electrical conductivity for all pitch fibers. Further bromination after ambient condition defluorination resulted in further increases in electrical defluorination conductivity for less <b>graphitized,</b> less structurally ordered pitch fibers (P- 55) which contain about 3 % fluorine by weight before bromination. This product can be stable in 200 C air, or 100 % humidity at 60 C. Due to its low cost, this less <b>graphitized</b> fiber may be useful for industrial application, such as airfoil deicer materials. The same bromination process, however, resulted in conductivity decreases for fluorine rich, more <b>graphitized,</b> structurally oriented pitch fibers (P- 100 and P- 75). Such decreases in electrical conductivity were partially reversed by heating the fibers at 185 C in air.

50|$|White {{cast iron}} {{displays}} white fractured surfaces {{due to the}} presence of an iron carbide precipitate called cementite. With a lower silicon content (<b>graphitizing</b> agent) and faster cooling rate, the carbon in white cast iron precipitates out of the melt as the metastable phase cementite, Fe3C, rather than graphite. The cementite which precipitates from the melt forms as relatively large particles. As the iron carbide precipitates out, it withdraws carbon from the original melt, moving the mixture toward one that is closer to eutectic, and the remaining phase is the lower iron-carbon austenite (which on cooling might transform to martensite). These eutectic carbides are much too large to provide the benefit of what is called precipitation hardening (as in some steels, where much smaller cementite precipitates might inhibit plastic deformation by impeding the movement of dislocations through the pure iron ferrite matrix). Rather, they increase the bulk hardness of the cast iron simply by virtue of their own very high hardness and their substantial volume fraction, such that the bulk hardness can be approximated by a rule of mixtures. In any case, they offer hardness at the expense of toughness. Since carbide makes up a large fraction of the material, white cast iron could reasonably be classified as a cermet. White iron is too brittle for use in many structural components, but with good hardness and abrasion resistance and relatively low cost, it finds use in such applications as the wear surfaces (impeller and volute) of slurry pumps, shell liners and lifter bars in ball mills and autogenous grinding mills, balls and rings in coal pulverisers, and the teeth of a backhoe's digging bucket (although cast medium-carbon martensitic steel is more common for this application).|$|E

In order to obtain adsorption isotherms at very low coverages with good precision, a gas chromatographic method has been adopted. The experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the hydrogen treatment in removing trace amounts of surface oxides and the usefulness of an oxygen-free carbon surface in deriving adsorption isotherms of hydrogen-bonding substances. The removal of chemical impurities causes the extent of propylamine adsorption to be sharply reduced and the shape of the isotherm to be altered. On untreated <b>graphitized</b> carbon blacks, the heat of adsorption of propylamine shows an uninterrupted fall as the surface coverage increases, whereas after the hydrogen treatment, a constant value of 7. 5 kcal/mole is obtained. In contrast to the behaviour of propylamine, on treated carbon surfaces the adsorption of acetic acid increases and the heat-coverage curve is steeper than for untreated surfaces.
