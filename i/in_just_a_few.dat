The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, when it is completed in 2023, {{will be able to}} map the entire sky <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> nights, providing more data on distant Kuiper belt objects that could both bolster evidence for Planet Nine and help pinpoint its current location.|$|E
5|$|It is even {{possible}} {{that in any}} one generation no marbles of a particular colour are chosen, meaning they have no offspring. In this example, if no red marbles are selected, the jar representing the new generation contains only blue offspring. If this happens, the red allele has been lost permanently in the population, while the remaining blue allele has become fixed: all future generations are entirely blue. In small populations, fixation can occur <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> generations.|$|E

Since the show's fourth season (2000), Parker has assumed most of the show's directorial duties, while Stone relinquished {{his share of the}} directing to focus on handling the coordination and business aspects of the production.

5|$|Most seabirds are colonial, and {{the reasons}} for colonial {{behaviour}} are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental Antarctica, such as the Antarctic petrel, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> locations.|$|E
5|$|The notability {{of there}} being four captains in just five Test matches can better be {{understood}} with context. The captain of a cricket team performs a vital role. Unlike many other team sports, the captain makes crucial decisions regarding on-field tactics, {{and may also}} have an important say in team selection. Traditionally, captains of international teams are not changed frequently – for example, between 1977 and 1988 (comprising 104 Test matches), only seven different men captained England, yet there were four captains <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks {{in the summer of}} 1988.|$|E

5|$|When growing {{conditions}} improve, {{such as the}} arrival of warmer weather and the longer days associated with spring in temperate regions, growth starts again. The expanding shoot pushes its way out, shedding the scales in the process. These leave behind scars {{on the surface of}} the twig. The whole year's growth may take place <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks. The new stem is unlignified at first and may be green and downy. The Arecaceae (palms) have their leaves spirally arranged on an unbranched trunk. In some tree species in temperate climates, a second spurt of growth, a Lammas growth may occur which is believed to be a strategy to compensate for loss of early foliage to insect predators.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2013 NHL season, Malhotra {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent.

The Carolina Hurricanes signed Malhotra to a one-year two way contract on October 31 and he made his Carolina debut against the New York Rangers on November 2. On November 6, Manny scored his first NHL goal in 19 months, scoring a game winner in overtime against the Flyers. As a measure of the amount of respect he has earned in the locker room <b>in</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, Manny was selected to be an interim Assistant Captain while Tim Gleason was out with an injury. After Gleason was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs, Malhotra was officially declared Alternate Captain for the remainder of the season.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, Kuala Lumpur was {{captured}} by the Imperial Japanese Army on 11 January 1942.

They occupied the city until 15 August 1945, when the commander in chief of the Japanese Seventh Area Army in Singapore and Malaysia, Seishirō Itagaki, surrendered to the British administration following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Kuala Lumpur grew through the war, and continued after the war during the Malayan Emergency, during which Malaya was preoccupied with the communist insurgency and New Villages were established on the outskirts of the city in an attempt to control community contacts with the insurgents.|$|E

Thanks to the hormone injections Rosie has had, it only took a day for Lilith to be born and she will age one year, every day, and take Callie's place as Twayne's bride. After an accident caused by Lilith, Rosie is hospitalized and Mark and Callie {{take on the task}} to raise Lilith. <b>In</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> weeks, she is eighteen years old and has started dating Randall. Mark takes in Twayne for a session and finds out about his arranged marriage to Lilith, and that the marriage will be a televised sex ritual. Callie realizes that she is forcing Lilith to marry Twayne, just like her father forced her, and tells Lilith that she does not want her to marry him. Lilith, however, wants to the opposite of what Callie wants and tells her that she will marry him. Just before the ritual is about to commence, Lilith reveals to Mark that she plots to kill Callie and Twayne and instead join Mark at the sex altar. Mark informs Callie, who takes out her soul to transform into a more demonic figure. Following a battle between the two, Lilith falls down to a lower level of Hell. Later, Callie kicks Mark out of her apartment as she does not have to marry Twayne anymore.|$|E
