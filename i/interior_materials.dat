40|$|Thermo-oxidative aging {{produces}} a non-uniform degradation state in PMR- 15 resin. A surface layer, usually attributed to oxidative degradation, forms. This surface layer has different properties {{from the inner}} material. A set of material tests was designed to separate {{the properties of the}} oxidized surface layer from the properties of <b>interior</b> <b>material.</b> Test specimens were aged at 316 C in either air or nitrogen, for durations of up to 800 hours. The thickness of the oxidized surface layer in air aged specimens, and the shrinkage and Coefficient of Thermal Expansion (CTE) of nitrogen aged specimens were measured directly. Four-point-bend tests were performed to determine modulus of both the oxidized surface layer and the <b>interior</b> <b>material.</b> Bimaterial strip specimens consisting of oxidized surface <b>material</b> and unoxidized <b>interior</b> <b>material</b> were constructed and used to determine surface layer shrinkage and CTE. Results confirm that the surface layer and core materials have substantially different properties...|$|R

The sound absorption coefficients of the treated wood samples were measured at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000  Hz in a reverberation room.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigid walled car cabin model {{to predict the}} acoustic effects of vehicle <b>interior</b> trim <b>materials.</b> The car cavity is made of a rigid walled enclosure system with one flexible wall on the front firewall position, where the <b>interior</b> trim <b>materials</b> are applied to the inner surface of the front firewall to modify the coupling between the flexible wall and the cabin air cavity. The car cabin is acoustically excited by using a single point source positioned at {{one corner of the}} inner air cavity to imitate the airborne noise. The propagated noise is measured by using pressure microphones at different locations inside the car cabin: one near the driver&# 039;s ear position and another one near the passenger&# 039;s ear position. An acoustic FE (Finite Element) model is also developed to investigate and predict the effects of <b>interior</b> trim <b>materials</b> on the car cabin noise level. Finally, the simulation results are compared with the experimentally acquired acoustic effects of the <b>interior</b> trim <b>materials.</b> The predicted acoustic response results show that the simulation agrees well with the experiment data, both with and without the <b>interior</b> trim <b>materials.</b> The noise propagating inside the car cabin is reduced by a similar ratio in both the experimental method and in the numerical analysis. The selected <b>interior</b> trim <b>materials</b> are starting to absorb noise at frequencies above 500 Hz, but they do not reduce the low-frequency noise effectively...|$|R
