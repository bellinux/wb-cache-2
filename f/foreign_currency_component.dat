The committee report showed an extra-budgetary spending {{to the tune}} of N643.8 billion and an additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>component</b> under the Goodluck Jonathan's watch. Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against Boko Haram insurgency in Nigeria.The investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for the purpose for which the money was disbursed.Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of Sambo Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser who later mentioned prominent Nigerians involved in the deal. Those that were mentioned and arrested includes Raymond Dokpesi, the Chair emeritus of DAAR Communications Plc, Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance, Azubuike Ihejirika, the Chief of Army Staff, Adesola Nunayon Amosu, the former Chief of the Air Staff, Alex Badeh and several other politicians were mentioned.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses which {{accounting}} disclosures {{are most}} useful in valuing firms with foreign {{operations in the}} presence of exchange rate movements. Our analytical model indicates that a valuation of these firms requires disaggregating cash flows into current unexpected cash flows in the parent currency, current unexpected cash flows in the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency,</b> the persistent <b>component</b> of previous unexpected <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> cash flows, and the permanent return on <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> operating capital.

The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of heavy vehicle chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|R

Basic assumptions of a new <b>Foreign</b> <b>Currency</b> Act of Feb. 15, 1989 is the principle according to which the duty to obtain a permit to enter into a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transaction is required only in matters expressly stated in the Act. It means that the Act introduces freedom of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> transactions in relations indifferent {{from the point of view}} of economic and <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> interests of the State. Besides, the new law provides for statutory guaranties of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> property rights. However, it also imposes on economic units the duty to resell to the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> banks part of those units' revenues in <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> The Act introduces also <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> auctions, open for all economic units. The auction price of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> is to be shaped by supply/demand rules.

40|$|We {{examine the}} firm- and country-level {{determinants}} {{of the currency}} denomination of small business loans. We first model the choice of loan currency in a framework which features a trade-off between lower cost of debt {{and the risk of}} firm-level distress costs, and also examines the impact of information asymmetry between banks and firms. When <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds come at a lower interest rate, all <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> earners as well as those local currency earners with high revenues and low distress costs choose <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans. When the banks have imperfect information on the currency and level of firms revenues, even more local earners switch to <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> loans, as they do not bear the full cost of the corresponding credit risk. We then test the implications of our model by using a 2005 survey with responses from 9, 655 firms in 26 transition countries. The survey contains details on 3, 105 recent bank loans. At the firm level, our findings suggest that firms with <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> income and assets are more likely to borrow in a <b>foreign</b> <b>currency.</b> In contrast, firm-level distress costs and financial transparency affect the currency denomination only weakly. At the country level, the interest rate advantages of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> funds and the exchange rate volatility do not explain the <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing in our sample. However, foreign bank presence, weak corporate governance and the absence of capital controls encourage <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing. All in all, we cannot confirm that "carry-trade behavior" is the key driver of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing by small firms in transition economies. Our results do, however, support the conjecture that banking-sector structures and institutions that aggravate information asymmetries may facilitate <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing. <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> borrowing, competition, banking sector, market structure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis empirically assesses {{exchange}} rate volatility given the choice of {{exchange rate}} regimes and the responses of current account components (trade balance and net investment income flows) to exchange rate fluctuations across countries. Chapter 1 presents the general motivations of this thesis, followed by the research aims and methodology. The structure of thesis is then outlined. Chapter 2 investigates {{exchange rate volatility}} given the choice of exchange rate regimes. By assessing a large currency-pair sample over 1999 M 1 - 2006 M 12, bilateral exchange rate volatility increases with the degree of {{the flexibility of the}} exchange rate regime combinations. Currency network effects (i. e. pegs sharing the same anchor would benefit lower exchange rate volatility) are significant, with the structural variables also being controlled. Relative to the both-free-floating pairs, the marginal volatility-stabilising effects are identical across the anchors (networks) and hence the network effect increases with the network size. Managed floats are shown to track the US dollar, which consequently increases the effective size of the USD network relative to the others. Structural factors, such as larger cycle asymmetry, lower bilateral trade openness, larger economy size and per capita land resources, are associated with greater bilateral exchange rate volatility. Inflation conditions significantly undermine the network effects. Moreover, the volatility-stabilising effects increases with the peg network size under the arithmetic multilateral exchange rate volatility measure but not under the trade-weighted measure, indicating the competing rationales for the choice of anchors (networks). Chapter 3 assesses the trade balance adjustments in response to exchange rate fluctuations across countries. By estimating fixed-effects regressions covering 96 countries from 1993 to 2006, trade balance exhibits significant responses for the contemporaneous and the subsequent one year, particularly for the Industrial and Emerging Market groups. The J-curve dynamics become more evident after exports and imports are examined separately. There are clear asymmetric patterns between the Industrial and developing economies. The latter group tends to have larger and more instant adjustments both on trade balance and between tradable and nontradable sectors than the former. Moreover, the Industrial economies on average show symmetric long-run and short-run responses to depreciations and appreciations. However, the Emerging Market economies’ trade balance tend to respond faster to depreciations than to appreciations. Relative to the moderate degree of fluctuations, large exchange rate changes for developing economies are associated with the inverse dynamics of the normal cases. Other factor variables, such as the terms of trade and domestic income variables exhibit explanatory power as expected in the literature. By taking fixed-effects regressions over a similar sample to Chapter 3, Chapter 4 examines the changes of net investment incomes in response to exchange rate fluctuations across countries with different <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> lending positions. Given the initial net capital outflow, depreciations (appreciations) are associated with net investment income improvements (deteriorations) for the Industrial economies, most of which have positive positions of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> exposure (FXE), i. e. <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> assets exceed liabilities. An inverse case applies for the developing economies of which most possess negative positions of FXE. Given the changes of exchange rate, the degree of this valuation effect increases with the imbalance position of FXE particularly among the Industrial and Emerging Market economies. Further investigations show that this is mainly driven by the adjustments of <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> <b>components</b> in the two groups’ external balance sheets. For the other developing economies, there are insignificant valuation effects conditioning on the FXE positions that are mainly driven by the overall net foreign borrowing positions. The initial captial outflow proxied by the lagged current account position tends to have insignificant effects on the net investment income flows across the countries. Combing the trade balance dynamics and the valuation effects, the overall current account adjustments are mainly driven by the trade balance across the economies. Given similar long-run quantitative effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the Industrial and Emerging Market economies, the latter group exhibits faster and larger short-run trade balance and current account responses than the former. The valuation effects are insignificant in the overall current account adjustments. Nevertheless, the valuation effects tend to counteract the trade balance adjustments for the Emerging Market economies given an exchange rate change, while those two channels work in the same direction for the Industrial economies. These asymmetries further indicate the importance of country’s external portfolio dynamics. Chapter 5 summarises the main findings, followed by the discussions about implications and possible future research. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The Venezuelan private sector requires more foreign exchange for imports than it generates for exports, and is dependent on the Bank to satisfy the difference.|$|R
