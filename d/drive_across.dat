5|$|The {{action in}} the book moves from Newby's life in the fashion {{business}} in London to Afghanistan. On the way Newby describes his very brief training in mountaineering in North Wales, a stop in Istanbul, and a nearly-disastrous <b>drive</b> <b>across</b> Turkey and Persia. They are driven out to the Panjshir Valley, where they begin their walk, with many small hardships described in a humorous narrative, supported by genuine history of Nuristan and brief descriptions of the rare moments of beauty along the way. Disagreements with Newby's Persian-speaking companion Hugh Carless, and odd phrases in an antique grammar book, are exploited to comic effect.|$|E

5|$|The bridge cost £1.5 million, {{as part of}} a wider {{road system}} costing £3.5 million. Construction on the bridge took 2 years and 5 months. It was officially opened by Governor Charles Gairdner on 13 November 1959. He {{unveiled}} a plaque on the bridge together with Premier Sir David Brand, Commissioner of Main Roads J. Digby Leach and Works Minister Wild. Gairdner was also the first person to <b>drive</b> <b>across</b> the new bridge. It was hoped at this stage that the debt raised to pay for the bridge would be repaid by the Government within 12 months.|$|E

5|$|Div Cav was {{withdrawn}} on 24 April {{and was sent}} back to a rest area two days later. The regiment moved forward west of Enfidaville on 4 May, moving near the town on 8 May, to exploit a breakthrough by tanks the following day. The breakthrough was forestalled by the First Army <b>drive</b> <b>across</b> Tunisia, and the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered on 13 May. Three days later, the regiment began moving back to Maadi, arriving on 1 June. At Maadi the regiment received replacements, while some personnel who had served with the first three echelons received three-month leaves in New Zealand. On 5 July, new personal weapons were issued and the regiment began training on the rifle and light machine gun ranges. A month later the regiment {{was one of the first}} units equipped with Staghound armoured cars. Five troops in each squadron received T17s and one troop in each was equipped with a Daimler Dingo Scout Car. On 17 September, the regiment moved to Burg el Arab and began embarking for Italy. By 1 November its equipment had arrived and the regiment moved up to Altamura.|$|E

5|$|Patton led U.S. {{troops into}} the Mediterranean theater with an {{invasion}} of Casablanca during Operation Torch in 1942, where he later established himself as an effective commander through his rapid rehabilitation of the demoralized U.S. II Corps. He commanded the U.S. Seventh Army during the Allied invasion of Sicily, {{where he was the}} first Allied commander to reach Messina. There he was embroiled in controversy after he slapped two shell-shocked soldiers under his command, and was temporarily removed from battlefield command for other duties such as participating in Operation Fortitude's disinformation campaign for Operation Overlord. Patton returned to command the Third Army following the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, where he led a highly successful rapid armored <b>drive</b> <b>across</b> France. He led the relief of beleaguered American troops at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge, and advanced his Third Army into Nazi Germany {{by the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The 9th Armored Division made a {{stand at}} Bastogne and held off the Germans {{long enough to}} enable the 101st Airborne Division to dig in for a defense of the city, {{resulting}} in the Battle of Bastogne. After a rest period in January 1945, the 9th Armored Division made preparations for a <b>drive</b> <b>across</b> the Roer River. The offensive was launched on February 28, and the 9th smashed across the Roer to Rheinbach, sending patrols into Remagen. The Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen was found intact, and was seized by elements of the 9th Armored Division minutes before demolition charges were set to explode on March 7, 1945. The division exploited the bridgehead, moving south and east across the Lahn River toward Limburg, where thousands of Allied prisoners were liberated. The Division drove on to Frankfurt {{and then turned to}} assist in the closing of the Ruhr Pocket. In April it continued east, encircled Leipzig and secured a line along the Mulde River. The division was shifting south to Czechoslovakia when the war in Europe ended on V-E Day in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|Though {{unsigned}} at this point, NY96 {{begins at}} the eastbound onramp to NY17 at exit64 on Southside <b>Drive</b> <b>across</b> the Susquehanna River from the Tioga County village of Owego. The route remains unsigned until the intersection of Court Street and Southside Drive, the western terminus of NY434. NY434 continues east along Southside Drive while NY96, now fully signed, turns north onto Court Street and crosses the Susquehanna River. On {{the opposite side of}} the river, NY96 intersects Front Street. The configuration of NY96 between Front Street and East Main Street is unorthodox in that NY96 splits at Front Street to follow a one-way couplet around the Tioga County Courthouse to Main Street, where both streets terminate. NY96 turns onto Main Street for half a block to North Avenue, where it resumes its northward path. The route shares the parallel one-way streets with NY17C, which enters Owego from the west via Main Street and leaves via Front Street to the east.|$|E
