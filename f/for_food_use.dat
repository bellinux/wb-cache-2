25|$|The {{majority}} of sugar substitutes approved <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>use</b> are artificially synthesized compounds. However, some bulk natural sugar substitutes are known, including sorbitol and xylitol, which {{are found in}} berries, fruit, vegetables, and mushrooms. It is not commercially viable to extract these products from fruits and vegetables, so they are produced by catalytic hydrogenation of the appropriate reducing sugar. For example, xylose is converted to xylitol, lactose to lactitol, and glucose to sorbitol. Other natural substitutes are known, but these have yet to gain official approval <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

As natural herbal materials are not always safe, the regulation of CHM <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>uses</b> at the national level is for the protection of public health, as well as protecting consumers from potentially harmful herbal ingredients. This study compares and summarizes a considerable number of CHM that are allowed <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>uses</b> by the governmental agencies of mainland China and Taiwan.

It is rather the disillusionment, because no road, sanitary and school infrastructure worthy of the name has emerged. These populations whose main activities are fishing, harvesting and agriculture have seen their area of activity polluted by the different boreholes, making their living conditions unbearable. In addition to the decline in agricultural yields (cassava, yams, plantains) that allow Pointe-Noire to be supplied, water points have also been polluted making water unfit <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>use.</b> ENI's only solution is to supply water by tanker trucks whose vats are not always curated.

25|$|Large-seeded legumes {{were part}} of the human diet long before the Neolithic Revolution, as evident from archaeobotanical finds from the Mousterian layers of Kebara Cave, in Israel. There is {{evidence}} suggesting that Paleolithic societies were gathering wild cereals <b>for</b> <b>food</b> <b>use</b> at least as early as 30,000 years ago. However, seeds—such as grains and beans—were rarely eaten and never in large quantities on a daily basis. Recent archaeological evidence also indicates that winemaking may have originated in the Paleolithic, when early humans drank the juice of naturally fermented wild grapes from animal-skin pouches. Paleolithic humans consumed animal organ meats, including the livers, kidneys, and brains. Upper Paleolithic cultures appear to have had significant knowledge about plants and herbs and may have, albeit very rarely, practiced rudimentary forms of horticulture. In particular, bananas and tubers may have been cultivated as early as 25,000BP in southeast Asia. Late Upper Paleolithic societies also appear to have occasionally practiced pastoralism and animal husbandry, presumably for dietary reasons. For instance, some European late Upper Paleolithic cultures domesticated and raised reindeer, presumably for their meat or milk, as early as 14,000BP. Humans also probably consumed hallucinogenic plants during the Paleolithic period. The Aboriginal Australians have been consuming a variety of native animal and plant foods, called bushfood, for an estimated 60,000 years, since the Middle Paleolithic.|$|E

The cultivation of GMOs has triggered a debate about coexistence of GM and non GM crops. Depending on the coexistence regulations incentives for cultivation of GM crops differ.|$|E
