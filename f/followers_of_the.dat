50|$|Context plays a {{large part}} in <b>the</b> {{interpretation}} <b>of</b> these philosophies. For example, an evil <b>follower</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Open Palm path could enable <b>the</b> suffering <b>of</b> others {{in order to achieve}} greater order, and a good <b>follower</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist path could encourage self-reliance in others, thus making them happier. For instance, if a <b>follower</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Open Palm came upon a peasant being attacked by a gang of bandits, he would help because it {{is the right thing to}} do. Conversely, if a <b>follower</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Closed Fist encountered this situation, he would reason that the peasant must survive on his own merit, or die. However, the Closed Fist student might also help the peasant if he felt that the peasant was too far out of his league for such a battle to be a valid test of his strength.|$|R
5|$|In addition, the family's {{status as}} {{religious}} dissenters—not <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Church of England—attracted discrimination. Dissenters {{were not allowed}} into universities or the army, and were excluded by law from several professions. Her father had been suffering from tuberculosis and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff. When he died in November 1810 (aged 44), he left the family with significant debts and no savings, forcing them to apply for parish relief.|$|E
5|$|Laura Johnson and Harold Knight {{married in}} 1903 {{and made their}} {{first trip to the}} Netherlands in 1904. They spent six weeks there that year and six months there in 1905.

The colony was a group of <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hague School of artists who had been {{painting}} in remote rural communities since the 1850s. The Knights made a third trip to Laren in 1906 before spending that winter in Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|Persecution of Zoroastrians is the {{religious}} persecution inflicted upon the <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Zoroastrian faith.

5|$|The new {{ideals of}} humanism, {{although}} more secular in some aspects, developed against a Christian backdrop, {{especially in the}} Northern Renaissance. Much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the Church. However, the Renaissance {{had a profound effect}} on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and God. Many of the period's foremost theologians were <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humanist method, including Erasmus, Zwingli, Thomas More, Martin Luther, and John Calvin.|$|E
5|$|A {{minority}} of Vietnamese are also <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cao Đài faith which {{was introduced in}} 1927. The Cao Đài faith attracted both Vietnamese and Cambodian adherents within {{the first few years}} of its founding, but a royal decree which outlawed the religion and efforts by Cambodian nationalists to prosecute Khmer adherents led to Cao Dai being observed solely by Vietnamese from the 1930s onwards. A Cao Đài temple was built in Mao Tse Tung Boulevard in 1937, and in the 1960s there were about 70,000 adherents in Cambodia. Cao Đài was outlawed during the Khmer Republic and Khmer Rouge regimes, but regained official recognition in 1985 and has about 2,000 adherents in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Affairs quieted {{after the}} initial persecution. Diocletian {{remained}} in Antioch for the following three years. He visited Egypt once, over the winter of 301302, where he began the grain dole in Alexandria. In Egypt, some Manicheans, <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prophet Mani, were denounced {{in the presence of}} the proconsul of Africa. On March 31, 302, in a rescript from Alexandria, Diocletian, after consultation with the proconsul for Egypt, ordered that the leading Manicheans be burnt alive along with their scriptures. This was the first time an Imperial persecution ever called for the destruction of sacred literature. Low-status Manicheans were to be executed; high-status Manicheans were to be sent to work in the quarries of Proconnesus (Marmara Island) or the mines of Phaeno. All Manichean property was to be seized and deposited in the imperial treasury.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman Conquest of England by William the Conqueror in 1066AD, {{the land}} in the East Riding was granted to <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new Norman king and ecclesiastical institutions. When some of the {{northern}} earls rebelled, William retaliated with the Harrying of the North which laid waste many East Riding villages. The land was then distributed among powerful barons, such as the Count of Aumale in Holderness and the Percy family in the Wolds and the Vale of York. These lay lords and ecclesiastical institutions, including the monasteries, continued to improve and drain their holdings throughout the Middle Ages to maximise the rents they could charge for them.|$|E
5|$|Agagianian {{was born}} Ghazaros Aghajanian on September 18, 1895 {{in the city}} of Akhaltsikhe, in the Tiflis Governorate of the Russian Empire—in present-day Samtskhe-Javakheti {{province}} of Georgia. At the time, around 60% of city's 15,000 inhabitants were Armenians. His family was part of the Catholic minority of Javakhk Armenians, most of whom were <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Armenian Apostolic Church. His ancestors came from Erzurum {{in the aftermath of a}} Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. Fleeing Ottoman persecution, they sought refuge in the Russian Caucasus. He lost his father, Harutyun, at an early age.|$|E

5|$|Al-Baqi cemetery, {{the oldest}} {{and one of the}} two most {{important}} Islamic graveyards located in Medina, Saudi Arabia, was demolished in 1806 and, following reconstruction in the mid-19th century, was destroyed again in 1925 or 1926. An alliance of the House of Saud, and the <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wahhabi movement known as the Emirate of Diriyah, carried out the first demolition. The Sultanate of Nejd, also ruled by the House of Saud and followers of Wahhabism, carried out the second. In both cases, the actors were motivated by the Wahhabi interpretation of Islam, which prohibits the building of monuments on graves.|$|E
5|$|For a {{brief period}} {{following}} {{the decline of the}} Vijayanagara Empire, the devotional movement seemed to lose momentum, only to become active again in the 17th century, producing an estimated 300 poets in this genre; famous among them are Vijaya Dasa (1682–1755), Gopala Dasa (1721–1769), Jagannatha Dasa (1728–1809), Mahipathi Dasa (1750), Helavanakatte Giriamma and others. Over time, their devotional songs inspired a form of religious and didactic performing art of the Vaishnava people called the Harikatha ("Stories of Hari"). Similar developments were seen among the <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Veerashaiva faith, who popularised the Shivakatha ("Stories of Shiva").|$|E
5|$|In Anglophone countries, Heathen {{groups are}} {{typically}} called kindreds or hearths, or alternately sometimes as fellowships, tribes, or garths. These are small groups, often family units, and usually consist of {{between five and}} fifteen members. They are often bound together by oaths of loyalty, with strict screening procedures regulating the admittance of new members. Prospective members may undergo a probationary period before they are fully accepted and welcomed into the group, while other groups remain closed to all new members. Heathen groups are largely independent and autonomous, although they typically network with other Heathen groups, particularly in their region. There are other <b>followers</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> religion who are not affiliated with such groups, operating as solitary practitioners, with these individuals often remaining in contact with other practitioners through social media.|$|E
