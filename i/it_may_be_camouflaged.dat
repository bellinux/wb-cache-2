2500|$|The {{psychedelic}} frogfish has so {{far been}} positively identified only at Ambon Island, Indonesia, although it is quite likely that it will be eventually found elsewhere in Indonesia. It has been found in coral rubble, where <b>it</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>camouflaged</b> from predators, though the location is primarily considered a 'muck' dive with few corals in the area. [...] The fish have so far been found in locations where the water is [...] deep, about [...] away from the shoreline. [...] Occasionally, the current in these areas is so strong that it makes it nearly impossible for the fish to swim, but usually the current is only mild.|$|E

This method can accurately detect location and shape of moving objects for initializing a tracker. Using long and varied video sequences, we quantify the effective-ness of this method. ...|$|R

40|$|Pixel-based {{visualizations}} {{have become}} popular, {{because they are}} capable of displaying large amounts of data {{and at the same time}} provide many details. However, pixel-based visualizations are only effective if the data set is not sparse and the data distribution not random. Single pixels- no matter if they are in an empty area or in the middle of a large area of differently colored pixels- are perceptually difficult to discern and <b>may</b> therefore easily <b>be</b> missed. Furthermore, trends and interesting passages <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>camouflaged</b> in the sea of details. In this paper we compare different approaches for visual boosting in pixel-based visualizations. Several boosting techniques such as halos, background coloring, distortion, and hatching are discussed and assessed with respect to their effectiveness in boosting single pixels, trends, and interesting passages. Application examples from three different domains (document analysis, genome analysis, and geospatial analysis) show the general applicability of the techniques and the derived guidelines...|$|R

50|$|Matters {{of weather}} play {{a large role}} in IMINT failure. While radar imaging can see through clouds, it is {{unlikely}} that a general satellite sweep could find something buried under a few feet of snow or in a frozen lake. Another problem with satellite imagery {{is that it is a}} simple snapshot in time. If the satellite that captures the image is not in a geo-synchronous orbit, there is a risk of the target not being there when the satellite passes over the area again. There is also the possibility of camouflage. For example, the entrance to an underground bunker <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>camouflaged</b> with foliage and it would take an arduous examination of the image to find the information needed. Another potential failure is a satellite being unavailable at the time needed because it is being used for other intelligence purposes, and the situation or event of interest is missed. Images can also be misinterpreted, generating misleading information and potentially supporting a bad decision.|$|R

50|$|This is {{considered}} to be a hybrid between an exocrine and endocrine tumor derived from crypt cells of the appendix. Histologically, it forms clusters of goblet cells containing mucin with a minor admixture of Paneth cells and endocrine cells. The growth pattern is distinctive: typically producing a concentric band of tumor nests interspersed among the muscle and stroma of the appendiceal wall extending up the shaft of the appendix. This makes the lesion difficult to suspect grossly and difficult to measure. Small tumor nests <b>may</b> <b>be</b> <b>camouflaged</b> amongst the muscle or in periappendiceal fat; cytokeratin preparations best demonstrate the tumor cells; mucin stains are also helpful in identifying them. They behave in a more aggressive manner than do classical appendiceal carcinoids. Spread is usually to regional lymph nodes, peritoneum, and particularly the ovary. They do not produce sufficient hormonal substances to cause the carcinoid or other endocrine syndromes. In fact, they more closely resemble exocrine than endocrine tumors. The term 'crypt cell carcinoma' has been used for them, and though perhaps more accurate than considering them carcinoids, has not been a successful competitor.|$|R
