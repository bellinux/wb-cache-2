Those devices are not expensive {{in such a way}} that everyone can buy a smart phone easily. So, developing mobile context-awareness applications for helping <b>dependent</b> <b>persons</b> to deal with their everyday tasks is crucial. This paper aims to develop a new identities manage-ment system that runs on the dependent person's mobile device. This agent will assist <b>dependent</b> <b>persons</b> by giving them information, advices, instructions and helps regarding their activities of daily living. The main idea is to use a simple communication way to identify objects and subjects in the surrounding context of the assisted person. In this paper we propose efficient identification mecha-nisms that take benefit from our well understanding of the context. Our ap-proach simplifies the use of the interaction between <b>dependent</b> <b>persons</b> and the agent. Hence, unlike usual approaches, the identity of a given entity will not be universal by widely tailored to the current person’s context. In the case where the context is shared by many entities with the risk of identification ambiguity, our identification could use different means such as colors or locations towards others for identification of entities...|$|R
