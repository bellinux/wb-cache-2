5|$|A {{nutritional}} {{analysis of}} P.indusiatus (based on specimens collected from Nigeria) {{determined that the}} egg stage of the fungus contains (per 100g of fungus, dry weight) 33.6g of crude protein, 1.66g of fat, and 3.98g of carbohydrates. The egg stage was also measured to comprise 20.9g <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre,</b> and 88.76% moisture. The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} was to characterise the physicochemical, rheological, {{prebiotic}} and emulsion stabilising properties of four varieties (black-eye, brown-eye, brown and red) of Bambara groundnut (BGN) extracted using the modified wet milling method. A relatively high yield of BGN <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> was obtained with soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> (SDFs) ranging from 15. 4 to 17. 1 % and insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> (IDFs) ranging from 12. 0 to 15. 6 %. Black-eye and brown-eye <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> showed superiority in terms of swelling capacities, water holding capacities, oil binding capacities, antioxidant properties as well as thermal stabilities than red and brown <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres.</b> In addition, black-eye and brown-eye <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> were characterised by higher lightness (L*), redness (+a*), yellowness (+b*), chroma (C*) and hue. All four SDFs showed acceptable colour differences with ΔE < 8 ranging from 0. 81 to 3. 08.

5|$|Mould fungi are {{the source}} of the meaty (umami) flavour of the soybean {{products}} tempeh, miso and soy sauce. Tempeh has been produced in Java since the 13th century. Like tofu, it is made into protein-rich blocks, but these have a firm texture and earthy flavour, since (unlike tofu) the whole beans are retained, providing a higher content of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> and vitamins. Miso too is rich in protein, vitamins and minerals. It is fermented from a mixture of soybeans and cereals, forming a soft paste used to flavour soups and other Japanese dishes. Soy sauce has been used in China since the 2nd century AD, and is now widespread in Asia. Like miso, it is made by fermenting a mixture of soybeans and cereals with moulds such as Aspergillus oryzae.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre.</b> Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|The koala {{has several}} adaptations for its {{eucalypt}} diet, {{which is of}} low nutritive value, of high toxicity, and high in <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre.</b> The animal's dentition consists of the incisors and cheek teeth (a single premolar and four molars on each jaw), which are separated by a large gap (a characteristic feature of herbivorous mammals). The incisors are used for grasping leaves, which are then passed to the premolars to be snipped at the petiole before being passed to the highly cusped molars, where they are shredded into small pieces. Koalas may also store food in their cheek pouches before it {{is ready to be}} chewed. The partially worn molars of middle-aged koalas are optimal for breaking the leaves into small particles, resulting in more efficient stomach digestion and nutrient absorption in the small intestine, which digests the eucalyptus leaves to provide most of the animal's energy. A koala sometimes regurgitates the food into the mouth to be chewed a second time.|$|E
40|$|Gestating sows {{are usually}} fed {{low levels of}} feed, which may not provide {{sufficient}} satiety, and does not allow sows to fully fulfil their motivation to express foraging and feeding behaviours. Feed restriction may therefore lead to high occurrences of non-feeding oral activities, including stereotypies, and restlessness and aggressive behaviour in grouphoused sows, which are interpreted as signals of sustained feeding motivation and frustration. Inclusion of fibres in the diet reduces the energy density of diets and therefore allows for larger meal sizes without increasing the energy supplied. Moreover, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> influence the mechanisms that enhance satiation and satiety at the sensory, postingestive and post-absorptive levels. This chapter reviews the impact of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> on behaviour and welfare of gestating sows, and describes their potential consequences for performance. <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> generally reduce the occurrence of stereotypies and decrease restlessness and activity, with some studies also reporting reduced aggression. These effects are most likely related to behavioural and physiological mechanisms underlying the impact of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> on satiety and feeding motivation. The extent of the response to <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> is, however, variable and depends {{on the characteristics of}} the fibrous diet (inclusion rate, fibre source, physicochemical properties), housing and feeding conditions, and characteristics of the sows, especially parity, with greater effects in younger sows. <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> provided during gestation usually result in increased feed intake of sows during lactation, probably due to their effects on the size and capacity of the gastrointestinal tract. Studies on the effects of fibres on reproductive performance are scarce and show variable results, which might partly be attributed to over- or underestimation of the energy content of the diet during pregnancy. In conclusion, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> generally have a beneficial effect on the behaviour and welfare of gestating sows which are restrictedfed. The impact of high fibre diets during gestation on reproductive performance over multiple successive cycles in group-housed sows merits further research...|$|R

5|$|Tigers {{generally}} do not prey on fully grown adult Asian elephants and Indian rhinoceros but incidents have been reported. More often, it is the more vulnerable small calves that are taken. Tigers have been reported attacking and killing elephants ridden by humans during tiger hunts in the 19th century. When {{in close proximity to}} humans, tigers will also sometimes prey on such domestic livestock as cattle, horses, and donkeys. Old or wounded tigers, unable to catch wild prey, can become man-eaters; this pattern has recurred frequently across India. An exception is in the Sundarbans, where healthy tigers prey upon fishermen and villagers in search of forest produce, humans thereby forming a minor part of the tiger's diet. Although almost exclusively carnivorous, tigers will occasionally eat vegetation for <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> such as fruit of the slow match tree.|$|E
5|$|Blackcurrants {{were once}} {{popular in the}} United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were {{considered}} {{a threat to the}} U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to jurisdiction of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist including Maine, New Hampshire, Virginia, Ohio, and Massachusetts. Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States, and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre</b> and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.|$|E
5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), pistachios (Pistacia vera) and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as <b>dietary</b> <b>fibre.</b> Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to extract soluble and insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> from four Bambara groundnut (BGN) varieties (black-eye, brown-eye, brown and red) using the wet milling method and evaluate their physicochemical properties. The swelling capacities of brown-eye (6. 5 g/mL) and black-eye (6. 2 g/mL) fibres were higher (p≤ 0. 05) than those of red (6. 0 g/mL) and brown (5. 5 g/mL) fibres while the water holding capacities of black-eye and brown-eye fibres (2. 84 g and 2. 83 g water/g sample) were higher (p≤ 0. 05) than those of brown and red fibres. The bulk densities of insoluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> (IDFs) and soluble <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> (SDFs) ranged between 0. 57 g/mL (red) to 0. 67 g/mL (brown-eye) and 0. 46 g/mL (brown-eye) to 0. 57 g/mL (black-eye), respectively. The oil binding capacities (OBCs) of SDFs ranged between 2. 78 g oil/g sample (brown) and 4. 03 g oil/g sample (brown-eye) while the OBC of all IDFs did not differ (p> 0. 05), ranging between 1. 52 g oil/g sample (brown) and 1. 40 g oil/g sample (brown-eye and black-eye).

Methods: N= 509 Dutch university students completed a survey collecting data on <b>dietary</b> intake of <b>fibres</b> (food frequency questionnaire), perceived health status and immune functioning (1 -item score ranging from absent (0) to severe (10)). Perceived general health status and immune functioning were associated with daily intake of fibres using nonparametric (Spearman) correlations for the group as a whole, and men and women separately. Results: Mean (SD) age was 20. 8 (2. 6) years old, 71. 9 % of the sample were females. Mean (SD) daily <b>dietary</b> total <b>fibre</b> intake was 15. 5 g (6. 9).

40|$|Abstract <b>Dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> are {{a diverse}} group of substances, indigestible by human {{digestive}} enzymes, but (partially) fermentable in the human large intestine by the resident microbiota. Many health beneficial effects of fibres such as lowering blood cholesterol levels or increasing stool bulk have been reported. For some fibres, immunomodulating properties have been shown. Other studies investigate the degradation fate of fibres by the bacteria. In this PhD thesis BMDCs from TLR 2 / 4 knock out mice were validated to be unresponsive to naturally present contaminants like LPS and proved to be a good tool to analyse the immune response of <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres.</b> A variety of 44 fibres, was tested on these immune cells and all fibres were found to modulated the immune system differently. Also, different immunomodulating properties of an oat and barley β-glucan having rather similar chemical structures, were found. The insoluble fraction of the β-glucans induced highest amounts of cytokines. As a consequence, sample preparation such as drying, dispersing and heating were shown to affect the immunomodulatory properties. The in vitro fermentation characteristics of barley β-glucan and sugar beet pectin and the immunomodulatory properties of their degradation products on BMDCs were compared and shown to be substrate and degradation product specific. This study showed, that glycosidic degradation products of both fibres induced higher amounts of cytokines than their intact polysaccharide. An in vitro batch fermentation of soluble, indigestible maltodextrins by human faecal inocula was monitored and the activity of carbohydrate degrading enzymes, produced by the microbiota, was analysed. Results revealed that the maltodextrin was only slowly and incompletely fermented, despite the high potential of microbial enzymes present to degrade typical starch linkages. Overall, this thesis showed that <b>dietary</b> <b>fibres</b> interact and influence the immune system dependent on their individual chemical fine structure.
