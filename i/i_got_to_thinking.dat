500|$|In 2013, Bibel {{criticized the}} soap opera when Victoria [...] "decided {{to give up a}} {{corporate}} career to become a children’s book author", writing: [...] "From the time she was SORASED into a teen, Victoria’s ambition was to run Newman Enterprises. She was the child who inherited Victor’s (Eric Braeden) business acumen. He, being a male chauvinist, always viewed the more family oriented Nick as his heir apparent. Her struggle to get her father’s recognition is what fueled her." [...] She also stated that while watching the series, there was [...] "the sense that women could, if that was what interested them, be power players". Of Victoria's choice to leave Newman Enterprises, Bibel wrote: [...] "For Victoria, it came across as giving up Peggy Olsen’s life for Betty Draper’s. I was also peeved by her telling her mother that she didn’t have the first idea of how to become an author. She ran a major cosmetics company. She should have a hundred contacts in publishing, and the confidence and skills to figure out what she doesn’t know. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about all of the ways that, over the past few months, the women of Genoa City have been, to use the lingo of Leaning In, the most popular non-fiction book in the country right now, leaning out." [...] Tommy Garrett of Highlight Hollywood blamed head writer Josh Griffith for turning the character into a [...] "hard-nosed unforgiving socialite".|$|E

So I got up and followed the road. Bright moonlight. I walked all the rest of the night. And that's all, sir." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am. But don't you get <b>to</b> worrying. <b>I</b> merely <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> how <b>I</b> should hate to have anybody's {{unhappiness}} {{mixed up}} with this happiness of ours.

6000|$|RANSOM: [...] "It was {{tantamount}} to {{telling me that}} she had been amusing herself with me instead of my lessons. It remanded our whole association, which <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> so romantic, <b>to</b> the relation of teacher and pupil. It was a snub--a heartless, killing snub; and I couldn't see it in any other light." [...] Ransom walks away to the window, and looks out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, he {{has done}} it." [...] "And I've tried to write to him about it--two letters: one so humble and {{grateful}} that it couldn't stand up on its edge, and the other so pert and flippant. Mother, I wish you could have seen those two letters! I wish I had kept them to look at if <b>I</b> ever <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>I</b> had any sense again. They would take the conceit out of me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] {{the old man}} assented, as with {{satisfaction}} in having got the notion right; and then he added, with a certain defiance: [...] "There ain't anything in that. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> it over, when you was gone, {{and the whole thing}} went to pieces. That idea don't prove anything at all, and all that we worked out of it had to go with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>{{thinking}}</b> {{about some}} one else at fust {{it was only}} not thinking about him--I was ashamed. Then I tried to make out that I was too young in the fust place, to know whether I really ca'ed for any one in the right way; but after I made out that I was, I couldn't feel exactly easy--and I've been wanting to ask you, Miss Milray--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nobody, I guess," [...] replied Blacky. [...] "I {{told you}} I {{was just talking}} foolishness. You see, I'm so hungry that <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> what I'd have if I could have {{anything}} I wanted.

2500|$|Stevens {{contracted}} tuberculosis in 1969 and {{was close}} to death {{at the time of}} his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut." ...|$|R
5000|$|When he was hospitalized, Stevens {{was often}} {{alone in a}} very spare and plain room. He was told {{that at the time}} he was admitted, he had perhaps only a few weeks of life left in him. The effect on the 19-year-old pop star was pronounced. He said, [...] "To go from the show {{business}} environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> down <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut." [...] The song itself shows Stevens switching from heavily orchestrated pop music to a folk-rock emphasis.|$|R

And then I made a resolve----" [...] Nat stopped and gave a gulp.|$|E
6000|$|Then he stopped, and chuckled in {{his usual}} dry manner. [...] "I {{was going to make}} Jordan the proposition--only <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>thinking</b> and my nerve failed me.

She's a clever woman--but I don't want to have her on my trail." ...|$|E
60|$|I had sadly broken {{sleep when}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> bed, through <b>thinking</b> {{of the strange}} man taking aim at me with his {{invisible}} gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed myself <b>to</b> sleep by <b>thinking</b> of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake.|$|R
5000|$|Novelization {{writers are}} often also {{accomplished}} original fiction writers, {{as well as}} fans of the works they adapt, which helps motivate them to undertake a commission that is generally compensated with a relatively low flat fee. Alan Dean Foster, for example, said that, as a fan, [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> make my own director's cut. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> fix the science mistakes, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> enlarge on the characters, {{if there was a}} scene I particularly liked, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> do more of it, and I had an unlimited budget.

5000|$|... "How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> Memphis" [...] is the {{shortened}} title used by American {{country music}} singer Bobby Bare, {{of a song}} whose full title is: [...] "That's How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> Memphis" [...] written by Tom T. Hall and which appears on his 1969 album: 'Ballad Of Forty Dollars & His Other Great Songs'. Bobby Bare's album This Is Bare Country was released in August 1970 and this track was taken from it as a single. Other performers of this song use the full title: That's How <b>I</b> <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> Memphis.|$|R

From the force of habit she tried to whimper with one side of her mouth, as she smiled, to keep her missing teeth from showing; and at the sight of this {{characteristic}} effort, so familiar and so full of long association, Cornelia's heart melted within her, and she ran to her mother, and pulled her head down on her breast and covered the unwhimpering cheek with kisses.|$|E
