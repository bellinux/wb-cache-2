This paper presents a strategy for achieving automated testing for certification and re-certification of SaaS applications, based on the adoption of simple state-based and functional specifications. High-level test suites are generated from specifications, by algorithms that provide the necessary and sufficient coverage. The high-level tests must be grounded for each implementation technology, whether SOAP, REST or rich-client. Two examples of grounding are presented, one into SOAP for a traditional web service and the other into Selenium for a SAP HANA rich-client application. The results demonstrate good test coverage.

Methods: With random sampling method, we selected patients who received modified radical mastectomy in Nanjing First Hospital as research subjects. Then, questionnaires were given to 286 breast cancer patients who met the inclusion criteria (from January 2014 to June 2016). The questionnaire includes three parts: General Information, the Health Literacy Scale, and the Postoperative <b>Functional</b> Exercise <b>Compliance</b> Scale for Breast Cancer Patients. In this study, the count data were presented as frequency and constituent ratio and the measurement data were presented as mean ± standard error. Correlation and logistic analysis were both performed by using SPSS for Windows v. 19. 0. Results: This study showed that the total mean score of postoperative <b>functional</b> exercise <b>compliance</b> of breast cancer patients was 82. 65 ± 12. 38 points, and the total mean score of postoperative <b>functional</b> exercise <b>compliance</b> of breast cancer patients was 46. 16 ± 3. 88 points.

40|$|Purpose – Corporate {{compliance}} {{practices are}} often “coercively” structured, coined by a legal discourse and derived from individualist normative concepts. Drawing on the “logic of the Decalogue”, {{the purpose of}} this paper is to design an “enabling” approach based on a covenantal logic present within the Decalogue. Design/methodology/approach – The approach is interdisciplinary analysis summarizing exegetical, social science and business literature. Findings – Within a covenantal and transcendental perspective, a morally literate community of employees, which have learned to reflect upon their responsibility, form the basis for compliance arrangements. They form a necessary complementary element of <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> systems. Practical implications – The covenantal logic of the Decalogue can orientate the formulation of corporate compliance programs, which intend to follow an “enabling” approach. Normative claims should be rooted in an analysis of responsibilities towards relevant stakeholder groups. The potential of “spiritual capital” should be taken into consideration. Originality/value – Reflecting one of the oldest ethical documents of human civilisation in the context of the contemporary management discussion on “coercive versus enabling control”, the orientating role of practical wisdom from the Jewish tradition becomes tangible...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{analyzed}} modulation of gene expression during physiological ageing with interesting, but often contradictory results, {{depending on the}} model used. In the present report we compare age-related metabolic and synthetic parameters in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) isolated from young and old subjects (ex vivo ageing model) and cultured from early up to late cumulative population doublings (CPD) (in vitro ageing model) in order to distinguish changes induced in vivo by the aged environment and maintained in vitro, from those associated with cell senescence and progressive CPD. Results demonstrate that fibroblasts from aged donors, already at early CPD, exhibit an impaired redox balance, highlighting {{the importance of this}} parameter during ageing, even in the presence of standard environmental conditions, which are considered optimal for cell growth. By contrast, several proteins, as those related to heat shock response, or involved in endoplasmic reticulum and membrane trafficking, appeared differentially expressed only during in vitro ageing, suggesting that, at high CPD, the whole cell machinery becomes permanently altered.

40|$|AbstractSince {{geometric}} deviations {{decrease the}} quality and <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> of mechanical products, geometric variations management {{is an important issue}} for quality-aware companies in all phases of the product life-cycle. In this regard, the Closed Loop Tolerance Engineering Model highlights the main activities during geometric variations management and can be used to analyse the relations between the different involved actors. Though computer aided engineering tools are widely spread in product development practice with the aim to ease product design and analysis, these tools are mainly used separately and are not integrated in a coherent virtual geometric variations management process. Therefore, in this paper, the prerequisites for a holistic computer aided tolerancing process during product development based on the CLTE model are analysed. The main question answered is, which tolerance simulation tools are required and how should they be connected in order to enable a coherent and integrated computer-aided tolerancing process. Based thereon, important software tools are identified and drawbacks as well as main potentials for improvement are carved out. The novelty of the contribution {{can be found in the}} consideration of the geometric variations management process from a computer-aided tolerancing point of view and in addressing possible improvements for the development of software tools for a coherent and complete computer aided geometric variations management process...|$|E

In personal applications of robotics, human-robot interaction re{{presents a}} critical factor for a robot design and introduces strict requirements on its behavior and control, which has to ensure safety and effectiveness. In this work, the problem of controlling the Dexter anthropomorphic robot arm with variable compliance has been investigated, not only to ensure safety in the interaction with humans, but especially to increase the robot functionality in tasks of physical interaction, performed in co-operation with humans. Two different control schemes have been formulated and implemented on the peculiar structure of the robotic arm, so as to compare their performance through experimental trials. Both schemes aim at realising a self-controlled compliant behavior without using information from force/torque sensors. The experimental comparison outlines how {{the performance of the}} two control systems are inverted with respect to the theoretical considerations, based on the classical control theory, on their accuracy and effectiveness. The paper firstly describes the two implemented control systems; then, the performance of the two controllers in the experimental trials are shown and compared, and the <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> of the better one is graphically demonstrated...|$|E

The results of the study showed the development of left ventricular myocardium remodeling in 58 % of patients with cystic fibrosis, among the variants of which eccentric hypertrophy predominated. The revealed changes increased with an increase in the severity of the course of the disease. The analysis of diastolic function of the left ventricle by standard method in the group of patients with cystic fibrosis did not reveal any significant differences from the parameters of the control group. The FCI calculation showed that in 37. 5 % of children with cystic fibrosis, which indicated the formation of left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, which progressed {{in the course of the}} disease, it decreased with respect to the values of the control group.

40|$|Abstract. A {{component}} {{is the basic}} re-usable unit of composition to build composite systems by connecting to others through their provided and required ports. Checking the <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> between provided and required ports is necessary to build functional systems. At the same time, {{one of the most}} important issues today in Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) is the prediction of the composite structure Quality of Service (QoS) at design time, using the extrafunctional properties of its components. This paper focuses on this specific CBSE issue, and the use of Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) in this context. For each component providing and requiring services, we propose to specify the QoS properties as required and provided operations, called dimensions, on the component ports. In this model, a QoS property can depend on other QoS attributes, and be constrained by OCL pre- and post-conditions. From this model, the QoS aspect of a {{component is}} translated into a QoS system of non-linear constraints over the reals: the dimensions and their pre/post-conditions as variables controlled by nonlinear constraints. These constraints are either inequalities that bound the admissible QoS values, or non-linear functions that bind QoS properties between them. Using the CLP, we are able to determine if a QoS system can be satisfied, and to predict what quality level is required by the assembly from its environment, as a set of admissible intervals. The CLP is a general framework that can be implemented with a realistic effort, to reason about the component-based models QoS properties at design time, that is {{one of the most important}} issues in CBSE. ...|$|E
40|$|Aortic {{stiffness}} is a {{major cause}} of age-related increase in arterial pulse pressure (PP) and associated increase in work load for the heart. A method to treat this condition is proposed: wrapping the ascending aortic wall with a highly compliant elastic material such that reducing the vessel diameter will shift the pulsatile load from the aortic wall to the wrap, thus increasing the <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> of the ascending aorta and decreasing the cardiac load. A multibranched mathematical model of the arterial system, in which every segment of the arterial tree is represented as a uniform elastic circular tube, has been used to simulate the effect of the wrapping procedure on PP and impedance changes, by varying the radius (R) and the stiffness (E) of the ascending aortic segment. The results of the simulation show that PP decreases with an increase in R and a decrease in E. A similar trend, but with a different sensitivity, is observed for the characteristic impedance (Z c) changes. The model shows that PP in the ascending aorta can be lowered by 8. 8 % by reducing R of 20 % and decreasing the functional E by 80 %, in good agreement with preliminary results obtained from an in vitro pilot study of elastic wrap in aortas. In conclusion, the modelling study demonstrates that the proposed aortic wrapping procedure is able to compensate for the increase in PP associated with R reduction by a decrease in PP determined by a reduction in functional E. Therefore, it supports the use of the aortic wrap as a potential non-pharmacological treatment of age-related increase in PP. 4 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Thoracic disk herniations {{are more}} easily detected, in respect to the past, with the {{increasing}} availability of MR scanners. However, in several cases, the time interval between {{the onset of the}} symptoms and the diagnosis is still long, due to the variability and non-specificity of the clinical pattern and to the good <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> of the spinal cord to slowly progressive compression. We describe two cases of non-traumatic calcified thoracic disk herniation with variable extension in the spinal canal, which were not suspected at the initial diagnostic work-up. In the first case, long-standing but subtle disturbances of gait and lower limb sensitivity were associated with a large calcified central disk herniation, which occupied almost all the spinal canal at the T 8 -T 9 level. The lesion was detected with MR of the thoracolumbar spine and further studied with CT for a better definition of the calcified part and its relationship with the nucleus polposus of the corresponding disk. In the second case, a hyperdense mass was observed in the right lateral recess of the T 10 -T 11 intersomatic space during a CT scan of the abdomen, performed in a patient with clinical suspicion of gallbladder stones. The lesion was further studied with MR scan of the thoracic spine for evaluation of the compression on the spinal cord. The literature review and our cases confirm that non-traumatic thoracic disk herniation is a possibility seldom considered in the clinical evaluation, and that, although MR is certainly the optimal diagnostic modality, in our opinion, in cases of herniated disk calcification, a CT scan remains useful, especially when a surgical approach is planne...|$|E

40|$|Theories in {{international}} relations posit, and empirical evidence has verified, that unwilling states can be compelled by another state or by an international institution to enact domestic policy reform. However, these theories ignore the important follow-on question of whether such externally imposed reforms {{can be expected to}} stick. Using intellectual property rights (IPR) reform as a policy case, this dissertation seeks to explain why imposed reform stabilizes in some states but not in others. Here, stable policy means a government demonstrates credible and ongoing commitment to the reform after enacting new law. For example, the state passes additional legal measures to extend the reform, and provides ample support for domestic institutions necessary for the law's implementation. This dissertation presents a comparative study of IPR reform in Brazil and South Korea, covering seven years in the former case and sixteen years in the latter. The Korean government acquiesced to U. S. pressure in 1987 and strengthened its national IPR regime. Brazil undertook IPR reform in 1996, owing in part to its obligation to abide by the directives of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Accord). (cont.) The argument put forward is that states commit to imposed reforms once they capture or create reform benefits, and that it is the state itself, not interest groups, that is the principal architect of domestic policy reform. Though states often yield to external pressure and enact policy reform, they are conceding formal compliance (via ratification) but may be feigning <b>functional</b> <b>compliance</b> (i. e., on-the-ground enforcement). In short, the decision to commit to, or backtrack on, imposed reform is made after enactment. Relative gains concerns figure prominently in a state's calculation of what to do post-ratification. Given that the welfare effects of IPR reform are zero-sum in the short term and indeterminate in the long term, states will backtrack on IPR reform to avoid absorbing the concomitant welfare losses. If the state is able to turn unwanted reform to national advantage, then the state commits and the policy stabilizes {{despite the fact that the}} reform lacks widespread local acceptance. Principally an empirical study, this research adds needed depth to the current literature on IPR reform in emerging economies. by Trudy M. Wilcox. Thesis (Ph. D.)

The effects of endurance training (i. e. walking or cycling) in older humans are assessed in cross-sectional studies, examining the brachial and carotid arteries (supplying non-trained areas). The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effects of 8 -week endurance training in older men on conduit artery characteristics in the trained and non-trained vascular beds. METHODS: In eight healthy sedentary older men (70 +/- 3 years), characteristics of the large conduit arteries [common femoral (CFA), superficial femoral (SFA), carotid (CA), and brachial artery (BA) ] were measured before and after 8 -week cycling training. <b>Functional</b> [arterial <b>compliance</b> and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) ] and structural (diameter and intima-media thickness) conduit artery properties were measured using echo-Doppler. Peak blood flow, representing structural peripheral adaptations, was measured using venous occlusion plethysmography. RESULTS: After training, peak leg blood flow was increased (P < 0. 01) and baseline diameter and flow were increased in the CFA (P < 0. 05). Cycling training enhanced arterial compliance of the SFA (P = 0. 03), but did not affect the FMD (P = 0. 32) or the intima-media thickness of the SFA. Exercise training did not alter characteristics of the BA or CA. CONCLUSION: Eight weeks of endurance training in older men altered functional and structural characteristics of the lower extremity vasculature, whereas no changes are reported for the conduit arteries in the non-trained areas (BA or in the CA) ...|$|R
