5|$|Following Ohayō, Kon {{began work}} on his next film, Dreaming Machine. In May 2010, Kon was {{diagnosed}} with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend {{the remainder of his}} life in his home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness at relatively recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal state {{in a matter of months}} after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010 at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the Fond Farewells in TIME's people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.|$|E

25|$|The chat system enables {{players to}} {{communicate}} with each other.

Friends Chat broadcasts text <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> box only to certain players tuned into a specific channel, who can be available on any RuneScape world. Each Friends Chat channel has an owner, who can assign different ranks to individual players; players' ranks dictate their ability to perform administrative tasks within the channel.

In this study there are 338 text messages: 206 of them written by girls and 132 written by boys. <b>The</b> informants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> study are 16 {{years old and}} they live <b>in</b> <b>the</b> countryside {{on the outskirts of}} a small town <b>in</b> southern Sweden. <b>The</b> {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate characteristic linguistic features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages,</b> <b>in</b> order to determine what significant meaning an emoticon such as a smiley brings to a text and further, to explore what speech acts smileys occur <b>in.</b> <b>The</b> results show that <b>the</b> language <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> is a mix of spoken and written language. The characteristic features that were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> were short sentences, onomatopoetic expressions, words written in capital letters, English expressions and use of smileys. Most of <b>the</b> speech acts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> were expressions of feelings or attitude. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> investigated corpus, 181 emoticons were found, scrutinized and placed into categories, which show various kinds of implicit information. The girls have used 97 emoticons and the boys 84. The most common emoticon was ,  which appeared 66 times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>messages</b> and mostly served the purpose of making <b>the</b> <b>message</b> nice and friendly and sometimes to alleviate a direction. The reason for using emoticons in text messages was to bring life to it by expressing feelings, without an emoticon the true emotion of <b>the</b> <b>message</b> can easily be misunderstood. ...|$|R

25|$|The {{idea behind}} the Vigenère cipher, like all {{polyalphabetic}} ciphers, is to disguise plaintext letter frequencies, which interferes with a straightforward application of frequency analysis. For instance, if P is the most frequent letter in a ciphertext whose plaintext is in English, one might suspect that P corresponds to E, because E is {{the most frequently used}} letter in English. However, using the Vigenère cipher, E can be enciphered as different ciphertext letters at different points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message,</b> thus defeating simple frequency analysis.|$|E

25|$|A {{windowless}} {{object is}} {{an object that}} doesn't have its own window but it instead displayed in its container's window. It {{is used by the}} container to relay messages received by the container's window that are intended for the contained object. For example, if the mouse is moved over a window, Windows places a mouse move message along with the mouse coordinates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> queue of the window. If this window contains windowless embedded objects, the message may have to be relayed to such an object if the coordinates of the mouse-pointer are over this object. For similar reasons this interface also provides access to the object's DropTarget interface.|$|E

25|$|PGP {{supports}} {{message authentication}} and integrity checking. The latter {{is used to}} detect whether a message has been altered since it was completed (the message integrity property) and the former {{to determine whether it}} was actually sent by the person or entity claimed to be the sender (a digital signature). Because the content is encrypted, any changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> will result in failure of the decryption with the appropriate key. The sender uses PGP to create a digital signature for the message with either the RSA or DSA algorithms. To do so, PGP computes a hash (also called a message digest) from the plaintext and then creates the digital signature from that hash using the sender's private key.|$|E

25|$|The {{auditory}} {{findings are}} further concretized by research on shadowing tasks (Cherry, 1966). These tasks involve two distinct auditory messages presented simultaneously to both ears. One message {{in one ear}} {{is supposed to be}} shadowed (repeated) while the other message in the other ear is supposed to be ignored. Participants generally perform well at repeating familiar messages in the attended channel. However, when there was a significant change in frequency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> in the unattended channel, it was detected; moreover, when their names were presented in the unattended channel, they noticed that as well. These shadowing tasks reinforce the idea that the gap between knowledge and experience is explained by our innate perceptual capacities that enhance our experience and optimize our knowledge gained from our environment.|$|E

Reaction within the firm was generally positive, with over 75% of staff volunteering. However, over 100 staff had been made redundant prior to this announcement, leading some to accuse KPMG of being hypocritical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that they were given.|$|E
25|$|The FIDONET {{program was}} what later {{became known as}} a mailer.

When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's storage, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packet, it would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program.|$|E
