However, without adaptation this force posture is to a lesser extent able to generate forces rapidly and flexibly in response to international crises. Moreover, the contributions that Norway has been able to make to international operations have tended to consist of lightly armoured mechanized infantry, well-suited for more traditional peacekeeping tasks (UNIFIL in southern Lebanon to which Norway contributed a sizable unit for over twenty years) but not sufficiently robust for missions which might entail enforcement tasks.|$|E

500|$|Some {{groups within}} the Christian metal {{movement}} have criticized bands within the industry for isolating the genre from general industry too avidly. For example, Christer Espevoll of Extol stated in 2003: [...] "I wish the scenes were more together. [...] For a long time {{there has been a}} huge – and still growing – distance between Christian and secular music industries. This is the situation peculiarly in the US but also in Scandinavia. In my opinion this kind of polarization is not a good thing. Music <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost</b> about music so why should every band or artist that represents a religion or lack of it have its own industry? Music has no religious borders." [...] However, most Christian bands today oppose to being isolated in the Christian music industry and have become mainstream successes, such as Virgin Black, and Norma Jean.|$|E

500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture telling you this is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film <b>is</b> <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>foremost</b> a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E
