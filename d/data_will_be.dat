5|$|DNA {{sequence}} {{data from}} genomic and metagenomic projects are essentially the same, but genomic sequence data offers higher coverage while metagenomic data is usually highly non-redundant. Furthermore, {{the increased use}} of second-generation sequencing technologies with short read lengths means that much of future metagenomic <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> error-prone. Taken in combination, these factors make the assembly of metagenomic sequence reads into genomes difficult and unreliable. Misassemblies are caused by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences that make assembly especially difficult because of the difference in the relative abundance of species present in the sample. Misassemblies can also involve the combination of sequences from more than one species into chimeric contigs.|$|E
5|$|The {{forecasting}} of the precipitation {{within the}} next six hours {{is often referred to}} as nowcasting. In this time range it is possible to forecast smaller features such as individual showers and thunderstorms with reasonable accuracy, as well as other features too small to be resolved by a computer model. A human given the latest radar, satellite and observational <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to make a better analysis of the small scale features present and so will be able to make a more accurate forecast for the following few hours. However, there is now expert systems using those data and mesoscale numerical model to make better extrapolation, including evolution of those features in time.|$|E

25|$|The {{symbolic}} {{closing of}} the gap was celebrated on 9 September 2016. High-speed runs were due to begin on 17 October 2016. Trials will begin at 160km/h and will be increased in 20-km/h increments until ultimately 330km/h is achieved. The runs will take about three weeks and the <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> evaluated over several months. ETCS test runs are to follow later.|$|E
25|$|Optimizing {{the speed}} and {{accuracy}} of these steps for use in large-scale automated structure prediction is {{a key component of}} structural genomics initiatives, partly because the resulting volume of <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> too large to process manually and partly because the goal of structural genomics requires providing models of reasonable quality to researchers who are not themselves structure prediction experts.|$|E

The chip triangulates the player's position within six inches and {{will be used to}} digitally broadcast replays. The RFID chip will make individual player information accessible to the public. The <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> available via the NFL 2015 app. The RFID chips are manufactured by Zebra Technologies.

25|$|In 2009 the African American {{figure on}} the Soldiers and Sailors Monument was {{digitally}} scanned to create a three-dimensional image. The process of creating a computer model was completed in one evening using a hand-held laser scanning system. The <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> sent to a computer-controlled stone cutting machine for a rough cut of the sculpture in Indiana limestone. This material was chosen for E Pluribus Unum because of its prominence in Indianapolis architecture {{in the late nineteenth}} century and to reflect the state's geological heritage. Like the Soldiers and Sailors Monument, many official buildings and monuments in downtown Indianapolis are constructed with Indiana limestone. After the figure is cut from the stone, an artist will refine the sculpture's more detailed areas.|$|E

500|$|The idea of {{the galactic}} {{habitable}} zone has been criticized by Nikos Prantzos, {{on the grounds that}} the parameters to create it are impossible to define even approximately, and that thus the galactic habitable zone may merely be a useful conceptual tool to enable a better understanding of the distribution of life, rather than an end to itself. For these reasons, Prantzos has suggested that the entire galaxy may be habitable, rather than habitability being restricted to a specific region in space and time. In addition, stars [...] "riding" [...] the galaxy's spiral arms may move tens of thousands of light years from their original orbits, thus supporting the notion that there may not be one specific galactic habitable zone. A Monte Carlo simulation, improving on the mechanisms used by [...] Ćirković in 2006, was conducted in 2010 by Duncan Forgan [...] of Royal Observatory Edinburgh. The data collected from the experiments support Prantzos's notion that there is no solidly defined galactic habitable zone, indicating the possibility of hundreds of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way, though further <b>data</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> required in order for a definitive determination to be made.|$|E
