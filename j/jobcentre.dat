25|$|Between December 1973 and May 1974, Nilsen {{worked as}} a {{security}} guard. The work was intermittent, and he resolved to find more stable, secure employment. He found work as a civil servant in May 1974. Nilsen was initially posted to a <b>Jobcentre</b> in Denmark Street, where his primary role was to find employment for unskilled labourers. At his workplace, Nilsen {{was known to be}} a quiet, conscientious employee, who was active in the trade union movement. Although his attendance record was hardly exemplary, Nilsen frequently volunteered to work overtime. In 1979, Nilsen was appointed Acting Executive Officer. He was officially promoted to the position of Executive Officer, with additional supervisory responsibilities, in June 1982, and transferred to another <b>Jobcentre</b> in Kentish Town, continuing in this job until his arrest.|$|E

The nearest Labour Exchange (<b>Jobcentre)</b> was on Coldharbour Lane, Brixton, and the new arrivals spread out into local accommodation.|$|E

50|$|The {{service will}} have a {{presence}} in other organisations, including <b>Jobcentres,</b> FE colleges, community centres, shops and places of worship.|$|R
30|$|The major {{challenge}} {{in this context}} is of course the necessity to adjust the resources of the <b>jobcentres</b> to accommodate to the larger inflow of unemployed that follows from fall in employment. There are indications that the <b>jobcentres</b> have faced severe difficulties in meeting the deadlines. Thus in January 2010 only 58 percent of the insured unemployed started activation in time. For young unemployed aged less than 30 years this was the case for only 42 percent (Arbejderbevægelsens Erhvervsråd, 2010 b).|$|R
25|$|The <b>JobCentre,</b> when it {{was opened}} on 24 June 1975 by Joe Godber, {{was the first of}} around 500 labour exchanges run by the Employment Service Agency, with soft chairs and carpets. Grantham and District Hospital is {{situated}} next to the Priory Ruskin Academy on the A607, at the north of the town. The maternity unit, which opened in August 1972, is now a midwife-staffed unit.|$|E

The village has a <b>Jobcentre</b> Plus, as well as a postal sorting office. There is also a driving test centre on Arrowe Park Road and two MOT test centres, one of which is on Manor Drive and the other being on Arrowe Park Road, next to the fire station. There are two petrol stations in the village, these being operated by Shell, which is a 24-hour business, as well as Sainsbury's. Both of these are situated next to Upton Bypass at Arrowe Park Road. Meanwhile, the Arrowebrook telephone exchange is situated on Church Road and serves approximately 25,000 residential premises and 686 non-residential premises. The exchange is operated by BT. This provides ADSL and SDSL services, among others.|$|E

50|$|In addition, {{the actual}} {{processing}} of claims to benefits is also changing, with benefits claims being processed at {{a smaller number}} of larger Benefit Centres rather than local benefit offices and <b>jobcentres.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initially {{benefits}} were paid weekly, in cash, at the Employment Exchange. From 1973, the then Department of Employment began {{to open a}} new network of <b>Jobcentres</b> that advertised Jobs but did not process benefits. During this time, claimants were required to make claims and 'sign on' in separate Unemployment Benefit Offices. With the introduction of the Employment Service in the mid 1990s, the Unemployment Benefit Offices were integrated into <b>Jobcentres.</b> From the 1970s {{benefits were}} paid in the form of girocheque until the early 2000s when payments would be made directly to the claimants bank account.|$|R

His education qualifications subsequently helped him become a civil servant working at the Garston <b>Jobcentre</b> in Liverpool, where he rose from employment officer to training manager for the Northwest of England, and, ironically, remembered [...] "a steady stream of real-life Yosser Hughes types" [...] imploring him to give them jobs. The most he could do, he recalls, was to offer to retrain them in other fields, [...] "which was an emotional issue for people who had done one kind of work all their lives." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2014, {{the number}} of jobless claimants on the WCA waiting-list ballooned to {{more than half a}} million because of {{problems}} with the delivery of the WCA itself. This exacerbated the situation that Black had identified in 2011: the waiting time for a WCA now stretched well beyond 13 weeks but these claimants were not included in the official 'claimant count' [...] - a key indicator of the level of unemployment nationally - nor available to <b>Jobcentre</b> Plus staff for help in finding work. By then however, once they had eventually undergone their WCA, the proportion of new claimants being declared unfit for work had risen to 75%.|$|E
