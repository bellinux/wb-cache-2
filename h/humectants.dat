[...] Medicine would be prescribed in order to re-balance the four humors of the body, an imbalance of which might result in psychosis.

50|$|<b>Humectants</b> used in {{cosmetics}} include triethylene glycol, tripropylene glycol, propylene glycol, and PPGs. Other popular <b>humectants</b> in cosmetics include glycerin, sorbitol (sugar alcohol), hexylene and butylene glycol, urea, and collagen. Glycerin {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular <b>humectants</b> used because it produces the desired result fairly frequently and is low in cost. A category of <b>humectants</b> called nanolipidgels allow skin to retain moisture, but also possess antifungal properties. Scientists are also working to discover different types of humectants; a study published in 2011 concluded that extracts from wine cakes have the potential to be used as a humectant in cosmetics.|$|E

40|$|In the {{manufacturing}} process of abrasive stones with cubic boron nitride (CBN) as abrasive and metallic binder, some differences were observed regarding abrasive density at different heights of the stones. If abrasive density is too low, honing stones do not cut the material properly. Honing stones are obtained by means of sintering processes. Previously, a <b>humectant</b> material is added to abrasive grains, and then they are mixed with metallic binder. <b>Humectant</b> is used to assure covering of each abrasive grain with binder. In the present work, along {{the manufacturing}} process of honing stones, quality of the mixing process of components was assessed by means of two different parameters: covering degree of grains by binder (CD) and homogeneity degree (HD) of the mix before sintering process. Both parameters are calculated by means of weight measurement in the mixing step. Different quantities of <b>humectant</b> and different mixing times were taken into account. A higher quantity of <b>humectant</b> implies a higher covering degree, leading to more homogeneous honing stones. For this reason, highest quantity of <b>humectant</b> is recommended within the range studied. However, a certain mixing time is required to assure homogeneity of the mix prior to sintering.

50|$|The main health concern {{regarding}} e-cigarettes is {{that their}} production is not regulated, and there is immense uncertainty of quality control during manufacturing. Self-rolled tobacco contains more <b>humectants,</b> which are added to tobacco to make it taste better and keep from drying out. As the <b>humectants</b> burn, they unleash chemicals such as acreolein. <b>Humectants</b> are found in most cigarettes and are {{considered one of the}} most dangerous chemicals found in tobacco.|$|E
5000|$|An {{example of}} where <b>humectants</b> {{are used to}} keep food moist is in {{products}} like toothpaste [...] as well as certain kinds of cookies. Regional kinds of cookies often use <b>humectants</b> as a binding agent {{in order to keep}} moisture locked {{into the center of the}} cookie rather than have it evaporate out. <b>Humectants</b> are favored in food products because of their ability to keep consumable goods moist and increase shelf-life.|$|E
50|$|<b>Humectants</b> are {{frequently}} used in cosmetics {{as a way}} of increasing and maintaining moisture in the skin and hair, in products including shampoo, conditioner, frizz serum, lotions, creams, lip treatments, cleansers, after-sun lotion, and some soaps or body lotions. As hygroscopic moisturizers, <b>humectants</b> work by attracting water to the upper layer of the skin (stratum corneum). All <b>humectants</b> have common hydroxyl groups which allow them to participate in hydrogen bonding and attract water. This process attracts moisture from the outer layer of the skin or, in high humidity, from the atmosphere. The moisture is then trapped against the epidermis or the shaft of the hair, depending on where the humectant is applied. Various <b>humectants</b> have different ways of behaving because they differ in water binding capacity at different humidities.|$|E

40|$|Marked {{changes in}} the {{specificity}} of hydrolysis of αs 1 -, β-, and κ-caseins by lactocepin III from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris SK 11 were found in <b>humectant</b> systems giving the equivalent water activity (aw) and salt concentration of cheddar cheese. Correlations were noted between certain peptides produced by the activity of lactocepin III in the <b>humectant</b> systems and peptides found in cheddar cheese. The stability of lactocepin III was {{compared with that of}} lactocepin I from L. lactis subsp. cremoris HP in the <b>humectant</b> systems at different pHs. Significant differences between the stability of each of the lactocepin types were evident. The relationship between stability and <b>humectant</b> type, aw, pH, and NaCl concentration was complex. Nevertheless, in those systems where aw, pH, and NaCl concentration were equivalent to those in cheddar cheese, lactocepin I was generally more stable than lactocepin III. It was concluded that differences in the specificity and/or stability of various lactocepin types are likely to persist in cheese itself and therefore potentially contribute to differences in the peptide composition of ripened cheese...|$|R
50|$|<b>Humectants</b> {{are used}} in {{stabilization}} of food products and lengthening shelf life through food and moisture control. The available moisture determines microbial activity, physical properties, sensory properties {{and the rate of}} chemical changes, that if not controlled, are the cause of reduced shelf life. Examples are dry cereal with semi-moist raisins, ice cream in a cone, chocolate, hard candy with liquid centers and cheese. <b>Humectants</b> are used to stabilize the moisture content of foodstuffs and are incorporated as food additives. <b>Humectants</b> are also used in military technology for the use of MREs and other military rations.A number of food items always need to be moist. The use of <b>humectants</b> reduces the available water, thus reducing bacterial activity. They are used for safety issues, for quality, and to have a longer shelf-life in food products.|$|E

In this xerosis treatments study, some “smarting and stinging” was also reported from the use of humectant-rich treatment products.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} the textural and sensory properties of pork jerky with differently added sources of tenderizer or <b>humectant</b> at final concentrations of 2 or 5 % (v/w). Pork jerky treated with 5 % glycerol, kiwi, or pineapple had lower moisture content and water activity than that of control pork jerky (p< 0. 05). The addition of tenderizer or humec-tant resulted in a lower shear force than that of control (p< 0. 05). The addition of 2 or 5 % glycerol resulted in higher equi-librium moisture content (EMC) than other treatments, and addition of tenderizer or <b>humectant</b> produced a higher EMC than that of control (p< 0. 05). Furthermore, addition of pineapple and kiwi to the samples affected the structures of the myosin heavy chain and the actin filaments of myofibrillar protein, respectively.

50|$|<b>Humectants</b> {{are used}} in the {{manufacturing}} of some tobacco products, such as cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and self-rolled tobacco. They are used to control and maintain the moisture content of the cut tobacco filler and add flavor. <b>Humectants</b> are vital to the creation of cigarettes. In an examination of waterpipe smoking, researchers worked to identify substances such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein in the smoke of a waterpipe, discovering that the value of formaldehyde detected in one smoking session was five times higher than that of a regular cigarette. This data demonstrated that increasing amounts of <b>humectants</b> in the unburned tobacco lowered the temperature in the waterpipe head during smoking, so that considerable amounts of toxic substances were present. Further, e-cigarettes produce aerosol by heating a humectant containing nicotine without burning tobacco. Those “vaping” then inhale the aerosol and receive nicotine.|$|E
