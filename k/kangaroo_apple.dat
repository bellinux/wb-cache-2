2500|$|The {{island has}} been {{classified}} as a drooping she-oak (Allocasuarina verticillata) forest, despite having relatively sparse foliage. Large macrocarpa have been identified around the remnants of an old cottage on the north-east coast. Eucalyptus globulus and Allocasuarina striata (small bull-oak) are also present on the island. The Marrubium vulgare weed has been identified towards the island's north. Occasional Blackberry bushes have been identified near the Southern peak and southern shoreline. <b>Kangaroo</b> <b>apple</b> is also occasionally found along the southern shoreline. The island's fire attributes are [...] "medium flammability, low sensitivity".|$|E

50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} levels. Each of them consist {{of the mother}} kangaroo on the bottom floor {{trying to reach the}} top floor where her joey is being held captive by some monkeys. On each of the levels, there are monkeys who are throwing apples at the mother <b>kangaroo.</b> Sometimes the <b>apples</b> are thrown so that she must jump over them and sometimes they are thrown so that she must duck. If she gets face to face with one of the monkeys, she can punch the monkey with a boxing glove. She can also punch and destroy apples if they're thrown in level with her gloves. Also, there are pieces of fruit that she can jump up and get for points. Additionally, {{there is at least one}} bell on each level that she can hit so that more fruits will appear. She must be wary of the big Ape, who will occasionally appear and try to take her gloves away from her. The level must be completed before the time runs out, otherwise the player will lose a life.|$|R

50|$|Griffiths Island {{lies in the}} Warrnambool Plain Bioregion. The {{original}} vegetation {{would have}} been {{similar to that of}} nearby areas, consisting of coastal shrubland, grassland and woodland. It has been heavily modified by the various human activities the island has been subject to. Predominant native plant species include bower spinach, small leaved clematis, seaberry saltbush, coast beard-heath, cushion bush, karkalla, common boobialla, knobby club-sedge, coast spear-grass, coast sword-sedge, <b>kangaroo</b> <b>apple,</b> coast daisy bush, coast tussock-grass, hairy spinifex and bidgee-widgee. marram grass was extensively planted in the past in an attempt to mitigate erosion.|$|E

50|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by the naturalist Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg following the discovery of Norfolk Island by James Cook on 10 October 1774. The description was only published in 1844. Around 1790, John Hunter depicted a bird on a <b>kangaroo</b> <b>apple</b> (Solanum aviculare). The bird was formally described by John Gould in 1836, from a specimen at the Zoological Society of London. Originally, the individuals from Norfolk Island and Philip Island were considered two separate species, Nestor norfolcensis (described by August von Pelzeln in 1860) and Nestor productus, respectively, but direct comparison of specimens of both island showed {{that they were the}} same species.|$|E

40|$|The potato cyst {{nematodes}} (PCN), Globodera rostochiensis (Woll.) and G. pallida (Stone), {{are major}} pests of ware and seed potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crops worldwide and severely impact {{the movement of}} potatoes around the globe through quarantine restrictions. In Australia, only G. rostochiensis has been discovered, on four separate occasions between 1986 and 2008. The infested areas {{are the subject of}} strict regulation and quarantine procedures and while they are considered to be contained, managing nematode populations remains a priority. This study has identified the G. rostochiensis Ro 1 resistance-status of potato cultivars currently grown by Australian potato growers, and new cultivars emerging from the Australian Potato Breeding Program. Resistance was assessed by a simple and robust procedure carried out in a purpose-built quarantine facility. Of the 24 potato cultivars grown in the affected Koo Wee Rup district in 2004, 10 were resistant to nematode infestation, including the locally important cultivar Atlantic. Other cultivars important to the Victorian and Australian potato industry, such as Kennebec, Desiree, Sebago and Coliban, were classified as susceptible. Importantly, this study provided evidence that the Koo Wee Rup PCN population was able to complete its lifecycle on the native plant species, S. aviculare (<b>kangaroo</b> <b>apple),</b> potentially acting as an alternate host and spreading PCN among potato crops...|$|E
40|$|GenGIS is {{free and}} open source {{software}} designed to integrate biodiversity data with a digital map and information about geography and habitat. While originally developed with microbial community analyses and phylogeography in mind, GenGIS {{has been applied to}} a wide range of datasets. A key feature of GenGIS is the ability to test geographic axes that can correspond to routes of migration or gradients that influence community similarity. Here we introduce GenGIS version 2, which extends the linear gradient tests introduced in the first version to allow comprehensive testing of all possible linear geographic axes. GenGIS v 2 also includes a new plugin framework that supports the development and use of graphically driven analysis packages: initial plugins include implementations of linear regression and the Mantel test, calculations of alpha-diversity (e. g., Shannon Index) for all samples, and geographic visualizations of dissimilarity matrices. We have also implemented a recently published method for biomonitoring reference condition analysis (RCA), which compares observed species richness and diversity to predicted values to determine whether a given site has been impacted. The newest version of GenGIS supports vector data in addition to raster files. We demonstrate the new features of GenGIS by performing a full gradient analysis of an Australian <b>kangaroo</b> <b>apple</b> data set, by using plugins and embedded statistical commands to analyze human microbiome sample data, and by applying RCA to a set of samples from Atlantic Canada. GenGIS release versions, tutorials and documentation are freely available a...|$|E
