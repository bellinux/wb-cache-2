The result tells us that 8. 3 % of 5 - 6 grade primary schoolchildren and 9. 1 % of junior-high schoolchildren are regarded as belonging to high risk groups.

40|$|We discuss {{two studies}} related to upper {{elementary}} school pupils’ use of additive and proportional strategies to solve word problems, {{in order to}} shed a light on pupils’ modelling disposition (i. e. both their abilities and their inclination) {{in the context of}} proportional reasoning. In Study 1, we used word problems that were clearly additive or proportional, while in Study 2 the problems were formulated with Greek symbols so that pupils had no access to the actual contents of the problems. Both studies yielded very similar results. 3 rd graders initially are strongly <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> reason additively to missing-value word problems (whether they are additive, proportional, or incomprehensible) and 6 th graders are strongly <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> reason proportionally. In the intermediate stage pupils heavily rely on the numbers appearing in the word problems in order to decide to apply a proportional or additive method. Even though the results were very similar, different nature of the tasks in both studies reveals a different aspect of pupils’ modelling disposition. The first study showed how pupils largely neglect the actual model underlying a word problem, and consistently apply the same model across situations. The second study indicates that already at a young age, a substantial number of leaners is <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> give <b>answers</b> based on quantitative analogical relations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Peer tutors’ {{behaviour}} {{has been}} stated {{to have the}} power to create and increase learning opportunities within peer tutoring programs. However, previous studies have shown that peer tutors struggle to adopt facilitative and constructivist-oriented strategies, as they lean more towards directive and knowledge-telling strategies. This study aims to explore a typology of approaches to peer tutoring by unraveling peer tutors’ behavioural strategies and related approaches. Furthermore, it aims to grasp peer tutors’ behavioural repertoire in-depth by shedding light on the concerns and challenges they experience while tutoring. Results showed that peer tutors used a variety of strategies but were mainly <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> adopt <b>answering</b> and directive actions. Their questioning behaviour remained relatively low level in terms of quality. Moreover, three types of peer tutors could be discerned, i. e. questioners, informers and motivational organisers. Finally, although all peer tutors reported diverse organisational, social and didactical concerns and challenges, results showed that different types of tutors struggled with different approach-specific issues and experienced tutoring in a slightly different manner. Taking these issues into account seems crucial for peer tutoring to reach its potential. Implications for peer tutoring programs and training of peer tutors are discussed. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|One of the {{questions}} on the paper was, 'Are you an anarchist?' To which a detached philosopher would naturally feel <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> 'What the devil has that to do with you? Are you an atheist?' along with some playful efforts to cross-examine the official about what constitutes an [Greek: archê]. Then there was the question, 'Are you in favour of subverting {{the government of the}} United States by force?' Against this I should write, 'I prefer to answer that question {{at the end of my}} tour and not the beginning.' The inquisitor, in his more than morbid curiosity, had then written down, 'Are you a polygamist?' The answer to this is, 'No such luck' or 'Not such a fool,' according to our experience of the other sex. But perhaps a better answer would be that given to W. T. Stead when he circulated the rhetorical question, 'Shall I slay my brother Boer?'--the answer that ran, 'Never interfere in family matters.' But among many things that amused me almost to the point of treating the form thus disrespectfully, the most amusing was the thought of the ruthless outlaw who should feel compelled to treat it respectfully. I like to think of the foreign desperado, seeking to slip into America with official papers under official protection, and sitting down to write with a beautiful gravity, 'I am an anarchist. I hate you all and wish to destroy you.' Or, 'I intend to subvert by force the government of the United States as soon as possible, sticking the long sheath-knife in my left trouser-pocket into Mr. Harding at the earliest opportunity.' Or again, 'Yes, I am a polygamist all right, and my forty-seven wives are accompanying me on the voyage disguised as secretaries.' There seems to be a certain simplicity of mind about these answers; and it is reassuring to know that anarchists and polygamists are so pure and good that the police have only to ask them questions and they are certain to tell no lies.|$|E

They would have to be passed through a powerful press first, to squeeze their old notions out of them, so that they would not soon get upon their legs again; and then there would be some one in the company with a maggot in his head, hatched from an egg deposited there nobody knows when, for not even fire kills these things, and you would have lost your labor.

30|$|Accordingly, the key {{intention}} of the paper is to seek to divulge key elements and processes by which in the ICT global network, TIS set-ups assisted indigenous firms and, especially, firm ecosystems to innovate in significant ways that enable agents to interact or adapt and learn. To do this the paper aims to show, analytically, how the torch of innovation was passed {{to a new generation}} of innovative Asian businesses {{at the expense of the}} Western (radical) innovators who pioneered mobile telephony (Alcatel, Siemens, Motorola, Ericsson, Nokia - and in GSM infrastructure, Denmark’s NorCOM cluster). The open question, which the paper <b>inclines</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> in the negative at present, is to what extent are the emergent torch-carriers in Asia likely to emulate Western radical innovation in ICT or any other industry? The inclination to the negative arises for three reasons that may be advertised beforehand. First, Western radical innovation is embedded in an extremely deep cultural earth that lends itself to global understanding and heightening demand. Western popular digital electronic culture has a unique capability of self-reflexivity and reincarnation as a next-generation globally commercial good. Second, the power of this influence is signified even where a rising pioneer like China’s animation segment of its emergent computer games culture reveals eight of the top ten games companies registering on Apple’s expensive App Store rather than cheaper domestic equivalents (Cooke, 2013). Hence maximization of returns and/or reputational capital remains at the behest of Western dominated rather than indigenous markets. Finally, radical innovation in the West has shifted into significant novelty with ICT support in advanced, knowledge-intensive services. One only has to think of innovations like the ‘servicization’ of ICT led by IBM and Honeywell, later to be dallied with by the likes of Hewlett-Packard. Indeed, existentially, the question of whether Apple, let alone Google, are in any significant ways manufacturing firms falls in this self-same category. Elsewhere, as in structured finance with collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or credit default swaps (CDSs) Asian institutions were often the end-of-the-line purchasers of the toxic bonds or lifeboats for their failed originators rather than in any way financial innovators (Lewis, 2010).|$|R

6000|$|So {{that the}} sum of the matter is this, without Christ we can do nothing, by trusting in Christ we can do every thing. See, then, how true the verse before my text must be, that he whose soul is lifted up in him is not upright; for if a man fancies that his body and soul are his own, to do what he pleases with them, when all the time they are God's gift;--if a man fancies that he can take perfect care of himself, while all the time it is God that is keeping him out of a {{thousand}} sins and dangers;--if a man fancies that he can do right of himself, when all the time the little good that he does is the work of God's Spirit, which has not yet left him;--if a man fancies, in short, that he can do without God, when all the time it is in God that he lives, and moves, and has his being, how can such a man be called upright? Upright! he is utterly wrong;--he is believing a lie, and walking accordingly; and, therefore, instead of keeping upright, he is going where all lies lead; into all kinds of low and crooked ways, mistakes, absurdities, and at last to ruin of body and soul. Nothing but truth can keep a man upright and straight, can keep a man where God has put him, and where he ought to be; and the man whose heart is puffed up by pride and self- conceit, who is looking at himself and not at God, that man has begun upon a falsehood, and will soon get out of tune with heaven and earth. For consider, my friends: suppose some rich and mighty prince went out and collected a number of children, and of sick and infirm people, and said to them, [...] "You cannot work now, but I will give you food, medicine, every thing that you require, and then you must help me to work; and I, though you have no right to expect it of me, will pay you for the little work you can do on the strength of my food and medicine."--Is it not plain that all those persons could only live by faith in their prince, by trusting in him for food and medicine, and by acknowledging that that food and medicine came from him, and thanking him accordingly? If they wished to be true men, if they wished him to continue his bounty, they would confess that all the health and strength they had belonged to him of right, because his generosity had given it to them. Just in this position we stand with Christ the Lord. When the whole world lay in wickedness, He came and chose us, of His free grace and mercy, to be one of His peculiar nations, to work for Him and with Him; and from the time He came, all that we and our forefathers have done well has been done by the strength and wisdom which Christ has given us. Now suppose, again, that one of the persons of whom I spoke was seized with a fit of pride--suppose he said to himself, [...] "My health and strength does not come from the food and medicine which the prince gave me, it comes from the goodness of my own constitution; the wages which I am paid are my just due, I am a free man, and may choose what master I like." [...] Suppose any one of YOUR servants treated you so, would you not be <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer,</b> [...] "You are a faithless, ungrateful fellow; go your ways, then, and see how little you can do without my bounty?" [...] But the blessed King in heaven, though He is provoked every day, is more long-suffering than man. All He does is to withdraw His bounty for a moment, to take this world's blessings from a man, and let him find out how impossible it is for him to keep himself out of affliction--to take away His Holy Spirit for a moment from a man, and let him see how straight he rushes astray, and every way but the right; and then, if the man is humbled by his fall or his affliction, and comes back to his Lord, confessing how weak he is and promising to trust in Christ and thank Christ only for the future, THEN our Lord will restore His blessings to him, and there will be joy among the angels of God over one sinner that repents. This was the way in which God treated Job when, in spite of all his excellence, HIS heart was lifted up. And then, when he saw his own folly, and abhorred himself, and repented in dust and ashes, God restored to him sevenfold what He had taken from him--honour, wisdom, riches, home, and children. This is the way, too, in which God treated David. [...] "In my prosperity," [...] he tells us, [...] "I said, I shall never be moved; thou, Lord, of Thy goodness hast made my hill so strong"--forgetting that he must be kept safe every moment of his life, as well as made safe once for all. [...] "Thou didst turn Thy face from me, and I was troubled. Then cried I unto Thee, O Lord, and gat me to my Lord right humbly. And THEN," [...] he adds, [...] "God turned my heaviness into joy, and girded me with gladness," [...] (Psalm xxx.) And again, he says, [...] "BEFORE I was troubled I went wrong, but NOW I have kept Thy word," [...] (Psalm cxix.) And this {{is the way in which}} Christ the Lord treated St. Peter and St. Paul, and treats, in His great mercy, every Christian man when He sees him puffed up, to bring him to his senses, and make him live by faith in God. If he takes the warning, well; if he does not, he remains in a lie, and must go where all lies lead. So perfectly does it hold throughout a man's whole life, that he whose soul is lifted up within him is not upright; but that the just must live by faith.|$|E

Both types of computer-assisted self interviewing have a big advantage over computer-assisted personal interviewing, because subjects are more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> sensitive questions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To enable {{occupational}} physicians (OPs) to {{make use}} of scientific information in the decision-making process, evidence-based occupational health practice is stimulated. AIMS: To study the questions which arise in daily practice of OPs, and to evaluate the possible contribution of evidence-based medicine (EBM) strategies <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> these questions. METHODS: Observation of 20 OPs during two consecutive half-day periods, followed by an interview to explore the topics that arose during the preceding period. The conscious or manifest and unconscious or latent questions by OPs were analysed, and the number of questions suitable for performing a search in scientific medical literature databases was assessed. RESULTS: After 40 half-day periods, the OPs had asked 26 manifest questions and 348 latent questions; the latter were voiced during the interview. Of all the questions, 40 % were clinical in nature and considered suitable for a literature search. The emphasis of these questions was on prognosis, susceptibility and diagnosis following individual consultations. A lack of time or 'no necessity to look for an answer' were the most important reasons for leaving the questions unanswered. CONCLUSIONS: OPs spontaneously formulated less than one question per working day. However, after an observation of their daily practice followed by an interview, many latent questions were formulated. A substantial number of these questions could be answered by EBM strategies. If OPs were encouraged more {{to improve the quality of}} their decision making, they might formulate more answerable questions and feel more <b>inclined</b> <b>to</b> search for <b>answer...</b>|$|R

Sheryl WuDunn of The New York Times wrote “what was remarkable was not just that the meeting took place but that the Government televised nearly all of it, apparently as a concession to a student’s demand”. From an outside perspective, progress occurred in the student movement as the government compromised to the students’ demands by holding a broadcast dialogue.
