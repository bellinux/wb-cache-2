De Sparengo commented on the concept and visual attributes of the video, saying: [...] "One {{of the interesting things}} for the concept for this video is that we knew we had to make everything look incredibly beautiful. It was about making a video where the Sugababes <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> {{at the top of their}} game." [...] The video made its premiere in August 2011.

Kerslake, the chairman, offered to resign, while Rose considered similar, but ultimately both continued in their roles. The Somerset players, who <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being treated like criminals by the press, were concerned about what sort of reception they would get at their next match; a home fixture against Hampshire. They need not have worried; the team were cheered onto the pitch, while Rose was given an individual standing ovation when he batted. A few supporters at the match hung out a banner stating [...] "It's Brian Rose I do declare!".|$|E

TV Guides Jennifer Sankowski enjoyed the episode and believed the producers had captured {{all aspects of}} popular 1980s teen culture well, but that [...] "at times it <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> trying too hard, throwing everything and anything '80s at us" [...] such as a montage of 1980s outfits worn by Lily and mentions of MTV videos, fanny packs, Rubik's Cube, and Jane Fonda workout videos. [...] "At this rate," [...] said Sankowski, [...] "they won't have anything left to showcase." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly [...] "loved" [...] the episode and complimented the casting choices, but agrees with Sankowski in that [...] "if this ends up being an actual series, they need to dial down the '80s references a tad." [...] Kona Gallagher of Cinema Blend said the premise was interesting and that [...] " [...] {{has the potential to}} be a strong spinoff, and [...] hope that CW decides to pick it up this fall." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times writes that he [...] "especially liked the moxie of Brittany Snow as young Lily and Krysten Ritter [...] as her sister, Carol. And of course the retro soundtrack was a total trip." [...] A few review sites took issue with the episode's script, such as BuddyTV, which claimed it was cliché, and Television Without Pity, which found it repetitive. While writing for The Frisky, Sara Benincasa praised the clothing styles and called the overall episode [...] "awesome fun! [...] weirdly sentimental, and sweet". She also believed that the confrontation between the Valley dwellers and the rich attendees of Keith's party was [...] "clearly a giant, dance-friendly metaphor for Reaganomics and the woes of a trickle-down world." [...] Michelle Graham for Film School Rejects liked both the 1980s and present day scenes separately, but when put together, [...] "the overall effect was disjointed and showed it for what it was: an attempt to shove two shows together in order to save money on a proper pilot." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{study found}} that it was not {{uncommon}} for adolescent girls in relationships to report they felt little desire to engage in sexual activity when they were in relationships. However, many girls engaged in sexual activity even if they did not desire it, in order to avoid what they think might place strains on their relationships. The researcher states that this may be because of society's pressure on girls to be [...] "good girls"; the pressure to be [...] "good" [...] may make adolescent girls think they are not supposed to feel desire like boys do. Even when girls said they did feel sexual desire, they said that they <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not supposed to, and often tried to cover up their feelings.

2500|$|Chávez used a {{strategy}} of polarization in Venezuela, a them against us situation, in order to single out those who {{stood in the way}} of his progress.

Such [...] "words spawned hatred and polarization" [...] with Chávez, [...] "a master of language and communication", creating his own reality among Venezuelans. Nelson says that what hurt Chávez's popularity the most was his relationship with Fidel Castro and Cuba, with Chávez attempting to make Venezuela in Cuba's image. Venezuela became Cuba's largest trade partner while Chávez, following Castro's example, consolidated the country's bicameral legislature into a single National Assembly that gave him more power and created community groups of loyal supporters allegedly trained as paramilitaries. Such actions created great fear among Venezuelans who <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> tricked and that Chávez had dictatorial goals.

Around {{the time of the}} release of her second studio album, A Girl like Me (2006), many critics felt that Rihanna's style, sound, and musical material were too similar to those of Beyoncé.

[...] With the release of her third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007), Rihanna dismissed her innocent image for an edgier look with a new hairstyle, which was inspired by Charlize Theron's bob cut in the science fiction thriller Æon Flux (2005).
