In 1981, it partnered with Infomart (then owned by the Torstar and Southam newspaper chains) to create the Grassroots service, providing information relevant to farmers on the Canadian prairies. Customers paid $47.50 per month to subscribe to Grassroots, plus connection fees to <b>DATAPAC.</b> Terminal equipment was manufactured by Norpak.|$|E
50|$|With {{the advent}} of lower-cost WAN {{technologies}} like IP/MPLS, the importance of <b>DATAPAC</b> diminished in the marketplace. Bell phased out support for <b>DATAPAC,</b> discontinuing the service {{at the end of}} 2009.|$|E
50|$|From {{the start}} Robert Temple Catalogues were {{set on a}} computer: {{originally}} on magnetic tape, but then, as this was difficult to edit when re-cataloguing unsold stock, they very soon went over instead to setting catalogues on the handier magnetic cards that were enjoying a brief vogue in about 1980-81. In 1982 they acquired their first P.C. from Premier Business Systems, a firm but recently founded by Charles Ross. This used a rudimentary program written in machine-code and designed for booksellers. The program incorporated a 'user-level' language, which was fairly basic, and in this Allen wrote a program capable of outputting catalogues in a style and format similar to those they had previously published. Up to this point all the catalogues had been produced as hard copy on a daisywheel printer, but Premier Business Systems morphed, first into Owl Microsystems, then, in December 1983, into 'The Clue Computing Company' (later to be bought by Bristol Office Machines), and they produced a system written in a higher-level language called CLUE, which {{was the brainchild of}} another bookseller, Mark Westwood. Allen produced his own system in this language (which is still in use by the firm to-day), and went over to producing hard-copy on a laser-printer. The original floppy discs were replaced in 1984 by Tandon <b>Datapacs,</b> and then, in 1990, after the advent of the cheap Winchester, by the conventional hard-discs we know to-day.|$|R

50|$|There {{were two}} kinds of X.25 networks. Some such as <b>DATAPAC</b> and TRANSPAC were {{initially}} implemented with an X.25 external interface. Some older networks such as TELENET and TYMNET were modified to provide a X.25 host interface in addition to older host connection schemes. <b>DATAPAC</b> was developed by Bell Northern Research which was a joint venture of Bell Canada (a common carrier) and Northern Telecom (a telecommunications equipment supplier). Northern Telecom sold several <b>DATAPAC</b> clones to foreign PTTs including the Deutsche Bundespost. X.75 and X.121 allowed the interconnection of national X.25 networks. A user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the DNIC of the remote network {{as part of the}} destination address.|$|E
50|$|<b>DATAPAC</b> was {{the first}} {{operational}} X.25 network (1976). It covered major Canadian cities and was eventually extended to smaller centres.|$|E

50|$|Tymnet offered local {{dial-up modem}} access in most {{cities in the}} United States and to a limited degree in Canada, which {{preferred}} its own <b>DATAPAC</b> service.|$|E
50|$|On March 15, 1983, the Delphi {{name was}} first used by General Videotex Corporation. Forums were text-based, and {{accessed}} via Telenet, Sprintnet, Tymnet, Uninet, and <b>Datapac</b> (Canada).|$|E
50|$|In 1997, <b>Datapac</b> {{was bought}} by Citrix Systems, Inc. and System Manager was {{abandoned}} soon later. In 2002, the Sydney-based unit was spun out into Citrix' Advanced Products Group.|$|E
50|$|<b>DATAPAC</b> was Canada's packet {{switched}} X.25-equivalent data network. Operated first by Trans-Canada Telephone System, then Telecom Canada, then the Stentor Alliance, it finally reverted to Bell Canada when the Stentor Alliance was dissolved.|$|E
50|$|Publicly {{accessible}} X.25 networks (Compuserve, Tymnet, Euronet, PSS, <b>Datapac,</b> Datanet 1 and Telenet) {{were set}} up in most countries during the 1970s and 1980s, to {{lower the cost of}} accessing various online services.|$|E

50|$|Other MS-DOS/PC DOS-compatible {{operating}} {{systems such as}} DR DOS 3.31 and higher, PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS, FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, <b>Datapac</b> System Manager and IMS REAL/32 support read/write/execute/delete file/directory access permissions on FAT volumes. With the exception of FlexOS, 4680 OS, and 4690 OS all these {{operating systems}} also support individual file/directory passwords. All operating systems except for DR DOS, PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS also support three independent file/directory ownership classes world/group/owner, whereas the single-user operating systems DR DOS 6.0 and higher, PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS only support them with an optional multi-user security module (SECURITY.BIN) loaded.|$|E
5000|$|The {{use of the}} 202 model modem, {{rather than}} one {{compatible}} with the existing <b>DATAPAC</b> dial-up points such as the Bell 212, created severe limitations, as it made use of the nationwide X.25 packet network essentially out-of-bounds for Telidon-based services. There were also many widely held misperceptions concerning the graphics resolution and colour resolution that slowed business acceptance. Byte magazine once described it as [...] "low resolution", when the coding system was, in fact, capable of 224 resolution in 8-byte mode. There was also a pronounced emphasis in government and Telco circles on [...] "hardware decoding" [...] even after very capable PC-based software decoders became readily available. This emphasis on special single-purpose hardware was yet another impediment to the widespread adoption of the system.|$|E
5000|$|After {{graduating from}} UCLA Jeff joined Amdahl Corporation's Communications Systems Division in 1980. Amdahl had just {{finished}} acquiring the privately held company Tran Telecommunications which became its Communications Systems Division. At Amdahl, Jeff developed software for high performance [...] packet switching systems designed for large enterprise and public data network infrastructures. Amdahl's circuit and packet switching systems were sold to PTT's and enterprises around the world. Some customers for the circuit and packet switching systems included Pacific Bell, SAPO, the Trans-Canada Telephone System and AT&T. The systems were used to build the Pacific Bell, <b>Datapac</b> and SAPONET public data networks as well as portions of AT&T's enterprise network. Jeff left Amdahl just before it moved its Communications Systems Division from [...] Marina Del Rey, California to Richardson, Texas and went to Doelz Networks in 1985.|$|E
50|$|The Ryan Cup is the Division II hurling {{championship}} {{for third}} level colleges, the Fitzgibbon Cup being the Division I hurling championship trophy. The Ryan Cup competition {{is administered by}} Comhairle Ard Oideachais Cumann Lúthchleas Gael (CLG), the GAA's Higher Education Council. At some time either in the late 1980s or in the early 1990s, the Ryan Cup - the trophy for the Division 1 gaelic football league - {{was presented to the}} winners of what was then the Division II Championship (non-university). As a result of this mix-up, the Division II Championship became colloquially known as the 'Ryan Cup'. Unfortunately several other GAA trophy competitions bear this name, including still the Higher Education First-Division football league.

50|$|The company's {{operating}} systems, {{starting with}} CP/M (1974) for 8080/Z80-based microcomputers, were the de-facto standard of their era. Digital Research's product suite included the original CP/M and its various offshoots like MP/M (1979), a multi-tasking multi-user version of CP/M. The first 16-bit system was CP/M-86 (1981), which was meant as direct competitor to MS-DOS. There followed the multi-tasking MP/M-86 (1981), and Concurrent CP/M (1982), a single-user version featuring virtual consoles from which applications could be launched to run concurrently. Successive revisions {{of this system}} incorporated MS-DOS API emulation (since 1983), which gradually added more support for DOS applications and the FAT filesystem. They were named Concurrent DOS (1984), Concurrent PC DOS (1984), Concurrent DOS XM, Concurrent DOS 386 (1987) and finally Multiuser DOS (1991), which later evolved into independent non-DRI products like <b>Datapac</b> System Manager, IMS REAL/32 and REAL/NG. Digital Research's multi-user family of operating systems was sidelined by single-user offsprings DOS Plus (1985) and DR DOS (1988), a version without CP/M application level compatibility, which became an independent product line and was further developed to use MS-DOS compatible internal structures to be marketed as a direct MS-DOS replacement with added functionality.|$|E
