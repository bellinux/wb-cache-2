2500|$|The Court {{found that}} {{according}} to precedent, government officials could not {{be held liable for}} the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior and that because vicarious liability was inapplicable to Bivens and §1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that each Government-official defendant, through the official's own individual actions, has violated the Constitution. To do so, the Court found, [...] "Where the claim is invidious discrimination in contravention of the First and Fifth Amendments, our decisions make clear the plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant acted with discriminatory purpose. Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 540–541 (1993) (First Amendment); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 240 (1976) (Fifth Amendment). Under extant precedent purposeful discrimination requires more than “intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.” Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). It instead involves a decisionmaker’s undertaking a course of action [...] "'because of,' not merely 'in spite of,' [...] adverse effects upon an identifiable group." [...] Ibid. It follows that, to state a claim based on a violation of a clearly <b>established</b> <b>right,</b> respondent must plead sufficient factual matter to show that petitioners adopted and implemented the detention policies at issue not for a neutral, investigative reason but for the purpose of discriminating on account of race, religion, or national origin." ...|$|E
