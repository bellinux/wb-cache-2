40|$|Interannual {{changes of}} springtime ozone over the Arctic follow from {{anomalous}} transport and chemical depletion, two mechanisms {{that control the}} wintertime increase of ozone. Attempts to disentangle these contributions to anomalous ozone rest upon the isolation of air over the Arctic. To elucidate changes of Arctic ozone between warm and cold winters, their latitude-height structure is investigated in the solar backscatterd ultraviolet record and then related to contemporaneous changes of dynamical structure in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction record. Structural differences between warm and cold winters imply a major contribution to anomalous Arctic ozone from horizontal transport. Anomalous <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> by planetary waves appears conspicuously {{in the structure of}} March ozone, which has been driven into coincidence with θ surfaces following warm winters but remains deflected across them following cold winters. In concert with anomalous downwelling of ozone-rich air, this mechanism accounts for at least two thirds of the observed deficit of springtime ozone over the Arctic following cold winters. About half of the observed deficit during March is erased during April, when weakening of the vortex following cold winters eventually opens the Arctic to <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> by planetary waves. Delayed relative to warm winters, <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> during cold winters ultimately leads to much the same ozone structure.

This constraint can be computed explicitly using the entropy balance of the core and depends on the thermal conductivity, whose value has been revised upwardly. A high order model (fourth degree polynomial of the radial position) for the core structure is derived and the implications for the core cooling rate and thermal evolution obtained, using the recent values of the thermal conductivity. For a thermal conductivity increasing with depth as proposed by some of these recent studies, a CMB heat flow equal to the isentropic value (13. 25 TW at present) leads to a 700 km thick layer {{at the top of}} the core where a downward convective heat flow is necessary to maintain an <b>isentropic</b> and well <b>mixed</b> average state. Considering a CMB heat flow larger than the well <b>mixed</b> <b>isentropic</b> value leads to an inner core less than 700 Myr old and the thermal evolution of the core is largely constrained by the conditions for dynamo action without an inner core. Analytical calculations for that period show that a CMB temperature larger than 7000 K must have prevailed 4. 5 Gyr ago if the geodynamo has been driven by thermal convection for that whole time. This raises questions regarding the onset of the geodynamo and its continuous operation for the last 3. 5 Gyr. Implications regarding the evolution of a basal magma ocean are also considered...|$|R

40|$|The {{structure}} of mass transport in the stratosphere, {{as well as}} its dynamic behaviors, is explored by imposing idealized sea surface temperature (SST) perturbations in an aqua-planet model. Mass transport within stratosphere is simultaneously running through two processes: the diabatic circulation, also well known as the Brewer-Dobson Circulation (BDC), advecting air mass across isentropic surfaces, and the quasi-horizontal mixing ventilating air mass along isentropic surfaces. It is shown that, with an equatorial SST heating, the stratospheric transport will increase in strength, in a circumstance with both BDC and high-latitude <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> being accelerated. Behaviors of transport, for both BDC and <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing,</b> turn out to be with more complexities when the imposed SST perturbation being relocated at different ranges of latitudes or expanding itself with larger longitudinal span.

40|$|The sensitivities of the Brewer–Dobson {{circulation}} (BDC) {{to different}} distributions of tropical SST heating are investigated in an idealized aquaplanet model. It is {{found that an}} increase in tropical SSTs generally leads to an acceleration of tropical upwelling and an associated reduction {{in the age of}} air (AOA) in the polar stratosphere and that the AOA near the subtropical tropopause is correlated with local <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> of tropospheric air with stratospheric air. The zonal distribution of SST perturbations has a major impact on the vertical and meridional structure of the BDC as compared with other SST characteristics. Zonally localized SST heatings tend to generate a shallow acceleration of the stratospheric residual circulation, enhanced <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> associated with a weakened stratospheric jet, and a reduction in AOA mostly within the polar vortex. In contrast, SST heatings with a zonally symmetric structure tend to produce a deep strengthening of the stratospheric residual circulation, suppressed <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> associated with a stronger stratospheric jet, and a decrease of AOA in the entire stratosphere. The shallow versus deep strengthening of the stratospheric residual circulation change has been linked to wave propagation and dissipation in the subtropical lower stratosphere rather than wave generation in the troposphere, and the former can be strongly affected by the vertical position of the subtropical jet. These results suggest that, while the longitudinally localized SST trends under climate change may contribute to the change in the shallow branch of the BDC, the upward shift of the subtropical jet associated with the zonal SST heating can impact the deep branch of the BDC...|$|E

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} model of dynamics and photochemistry {{is used to}} investigate the influence of planetary wave activity on the seasonal evolution of the wintertime stratosphere, which dictates springtime conditions. The final warming and springtime ozone are each found to depend strongly upon planetary wave activity during the disturbed season. The integrations reproduce their observed dependence, which enters through anomalous upward Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux from the troposphere and equatorial wind associated with the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO). Of those major influences, changes of upward EP flux are predominant. Changes representative {{of those in the}} observed record alter the timing of the final warming by as much as 1 – 2 months. Much the same lag distinguishes warm and cold winters in the observed record. Accompanying the shift in the final warming is a change of ozone at spring equinox. Magnified over the Arctic, anomalous springtime ozone develops largely through anomalous <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> by planetary waves. Such mixing, which precedes the final warming, incorporates ozone-rich air from lower latitude, leading to enriched polar ozone during spring. Relative to disturbed conditions, springtime polar ozone under undisturbed conditions appears depleted by some 60 DU. Derived through anomalous transport, the same difference characterizes observed changes between warm and cold winters.

40|$|Based on {{multiannual}} simulations {{with the}} Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere, (CLaMS) driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis, we discuss hemispheric asymmetries and the seasonality {{of the mean}} age of air (AoA) in the lower stratosphere. First, the planetary wave forcing of the Brewer-Dobson circulation is quantified in terms of Eliassen Palm flux divergence calculated by using the isentropic coordinate θ. While the forcing of the deep branch at θ = 1000 K (around 10 hPa) has a clear maximum in each hemisphere during the respective winter, the shallow branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation, i. e., between 100 and 70 hPa (380 < θ < 420 K), shows almost opposite seasonality in both hemispheres with a pronounced minimum between June and September in the Southern Hemisphere. Second, we decompose the time-tendency of AoA into the contributions of the residual circulation and of eddy mixing by analyzing the zonally averaged tracer continuity equation. In the tropical lower stratosphere between ± 30 °, the air becomes younger during boreal winter and older during boreal summer. During boreal winter, the decrease of AoA due to tropical upwelling outweighs aging by <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing.</b> In contrast, weaker <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> outweighs an even weaker upwelling in boreal summer and fall making the air older during these seasons.

40|$|The Lyapunov {{diffusivity}} is used {{to investigate}} local <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> events in the upper troposphere lower stratosphere (UTLS) region. The diagnostic highlights the seasonal cycle of the longitudinally varying mixing properties, in particular those associated with the monsoon circulations and the westerly ducts in the subtropics. The results are broadly consistent with studies of Rossby wave-breaking frequencies. The mixing structure is shown to be modulated by modes of atmospheric variability. El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is found to strongly influence the mixing structure throughout the tropics and subtropics. The subtropical jet is associated with longitudinal bands of mixing minima (<b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> barriers) separated by synoptic-scale regions of strong mixing activity. The greatest ENSO modulation in December-February is confined to the Pacific sector, where the barriers associated with the subtropical jets extend farther into the eastern Pacific, and in the western Pacific a barrier is found at the equator during the positive phase. During June-August, the influence is seen to extend beyond the Pacific region, with the barrier at the subtropical jet in the Southern Hemisphere increasing in strength at all longitudes and {{with an increase in}} strength (and isolation of) monsoon-related mixing over Asia and North America. The local influence of the North Atlantic Oscillation in wintertime is investigated.

40|$|A {{model of}} {{convective}} and advective transport across the tropical tropopause is described. In this model overshooting convective turrets inject dehydrated tropospheric air into a tropical ‘‘tropopause layer’ ’ (TTL) bounded approximately by the 50 - and 150 -hPa surfaces, a layer {{similar to the}} ‘‘entrainment zone’ ’ {{at the top of}} the planetary boundary layer. The overshooting process occurs only in limited regions. In the TTL, mixtures of overshooting and ambient air undergo buoyancy-driven settling, then slowly loft through the TTL and even-tually enter the main stratosphere throughout the Tropics. It is found that for reasonable parameter settings the combined action of convection, <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing,</b> and advection by the large-scale circulation in the model can produce realistic water vapor and ozone profiles while balancing the energy budget. Some of the observed peculiarities that can be simulated are (i) the widespread absence of vapor saturation at the tropopause despite tropical mean upward motion, (ii) an ozone minimum below the mean tropopause, and (iii) the typical location of stratiform cloud tops below the mean tropopause.

40|$|Tropospheric {{transport}} can {{be described}} qualitatively by the slow mean diabatic circulation and rapid <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing,</b> yet a quantitative understanding of the transport circulation is complicated, as {{nearly half of the}} isentropic surfaces in the troposphere frequently intersect the ground. A theoretical framework for the effective isentropic diffusivity of tropospheric transport is presented. Compared with previous isentropic analysis of effective diffusivity, a new diagnostic is introduced to quantify the eddy diffusivity of the near-surface isentropic flow. This diagnostic also links the effective eddy diffusivity directly to a diffusive closure of eddy fluxes through a finite-amplitude wave activity equation. The theory is examined in a dry primitive equation model on the sphere. It is found that the upper troposphere is characterized by a diffusivity minimum at the jet’s center with enhanced mixing at the jet’s flanks and that the lower troposphere is dominated by stronger mixing throughout the baroclinic zone. This structure of isentropic diffusivity is generally consistent with the diffusivity obtained from the geostrophic component of the flow. Furthermore, the isentropic diffusivity agrees broadly with the tracer equivalent length obtained from either a spectral diffusion scheme or a semi-Lagrangian advection scheme, indicating that the effective diffusivity of tropospheric transport is largely dictated by large-scale stirring rather than details of the small-scale diffusion acting on the tracers...|$|E

The Brewer-Dobson circulation is not well constrained by observations and further investigation is required to resolve uncertainties related to the mechanisms driving the circulation. This study has assessed the specified dynamics mode of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM 30) by comparing to the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) profile measurements of CFC- 11 (CCl 3 F), CFC- 12 (CCl 2 F 2), and N 2 O. In the CMAM 30 specified dynamics simulation, the meteorological fields are nudged using the ERA-Interim Reanalysis and a specified tracer was used for each species, with hemispherically-defined surface measurements used as the boundary condition. A comprehensive sampling technique along the line-of-sight of the ACE-FTS measurements has been employed to allow for direct comparisons between the simulated and measured tracer concentrations. The model consistently overpredicts tracer concentrations in the lower stratosphere, particularly in the Northern Hemisphere winter and spring seasons. The three mixing barriers investigated, including the polar vortex, the extratropical tropopause, and the tropical pipe, show that there are significant inconsistencies between the measurements and the simulations.

40|$|A global, nonlinear, {{equivalent}} {{barotropic model}} is used to study the <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> of passive tracers by barotropic instability. Basic states are analytical zonal-mean jets representative of the zonal-mean flow in the upper stratosphere, where the observed 4 -day wave {{is thought to be}} a result of barotropic, and possibly baroclinic, instability. As is known from previous studies, the phase speed and growth rate of the unstable waves is fairly sensitive to the shape of the zonal-mean jet; and the dominant wave mode at saturation is not necessarily the fastest growing mode; but the unstable modes share many features of the observed 4 -day wave. Lagrangian trajectories computed from model winds are used to characterize the mixing by the flow. For profiles with both midlatitude and polar modes, mixing is stronger in midlatitude than inside the vortex; but there is little exchange of air across the vortex boundary. There is a minimum in the Lyapunov exponents of the flow and the particle dispersion at the jet maximum. For profiles with only polar unstable modes, there is weak mixing inside the vortex, no mixing outside the vortex, and no exchange of air across the vortex boundary. These results support the theoretical arguments that, whether wave disturbances are generated by local instability or propagate from other regions, the mixing properties of the total flow are determined by the locations of the wave critical lines and that strong gradients of potential vorticity are very resistant to mixing...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigate}} the long-term variations in the stratospheric age spectra using simulations of the 21 st century with the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry- Climate Model (GEOSCCM). Our purposes are to characterize the long-term changes in the age spectra and identify processes that cause the decrease of the mean age in a warming climate. Changes in the age spectra in the 21 st century simulations are characterized by decreases in the modal age, the mean age, the spectral width, and the tail decay timescale. Our analyses show that the decrease in the mean age is caused by two processes: the acceleration of the residual circulation that increases the young air masses in the stratosphere, and the weakening of the recirculation {{that leads to the}} decrease of tail of the age spectra and the decrease of the old air masses. The weakening of the stratospheric recirculation is also strongly correlated with the increase of the residual circulation.

Long-term changes in the stratospheric <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> are investigated.

40|$|Although the {{stratosphere}} and troposphere are separately different in many aspects (thermal structure, dynamic circulation, chemical composition and etc.), studies {{in recent decades}} have indicated a much stronger connection between these two distinct layers. Dynamically, the stratospheric circulation {{is driven by the}} eddies that are dominantly generated in the troposphere, whereas the troospheric circulation varies, in some ocassion, mostly due to the circulation and eddy perturbation originated in {{the stratosphere}}. The exchange and transport between the two layers, on the other hand, tend to alter the chemical compostion on both sides, and hence induce subsequent influences on the chemistry and radiation within the two layers. In this study, we further enrich the understanding on the connection between the stratosphere and troposphere by examining their dynamic coupling and chemical exchange. We first investigate the dynamic impact from the troposphere to the stratosphere by examining the role of tropical sea surface temperature (SST). By designing several idealized SST forcing simulations in an aqua-planet model, we find that the zonal distribution of SST perturbations has a major impact on the vertical and meridional structure of the BDC as compared with other SST characteristics. Zonally localized SST heatings tend to generate a shallow acceleration of the stratospheric residual circulation, whereas SST heatings with a zonally symmetric structure tend to produce a deep strengthening of the stratospheric residual circulation. The shallow versus deep strengthening of the stratospheric residual circulation change has been linked to wave propagation and dissipation in the subtropical lower stratosphere rather than wave generation in the troposphere. The dynamic impact from the stratosphere to the troposphere is then discussed by focusing on the downward influence of polar stratospheric ozone depletion. Three possible mechanisms are examined in an idealized dry model: the polar stratospheric cooling impacts tropospheric synoptic eddies via (a) the direct influences on the lower stratospheric synoptic eddies, (b) the planetary wave-induced residual circulation, and (c) the planetary eddy - synoptic eddy nonlinear interaction. It is argued that the planetary wave-induced residual circulation is not the dominant mechanism, and that the planetary eddies and further nonlinear interaction with synoptic eddies are more likely the key to the downward influence of the ozone depletion-like cooling. Last, the chemical interaction between the stratosphere and troposphere is explored by quantifying the stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone. The specified dynamics (SD) version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) is used to estimate the ozone STE along different isentropic surfaces (isentropic ozone STE herein). Net troposphere-to-stratosphere ozone STE is diagnosed in the subtropics (350 K - 380 K), while net stratosphereto-troposphere ozone STE is diagnosed in the extratropics (280 K - 350 K), with different magnitudes and seasonalities over different isentropic (meridional) regions. Potential vorticity (PV) sources induced by both differential diabatic heating and <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> contribute to the diagnosed isentropic ozone STE flux, but the latter is slightly larger. Moreover, results in the SD-WACCM are generally consistent with the analysis in a different model, the SD version of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM), but the SD-CMAM diagnoses a smaller STE flux. This difference is associated with the different extent of <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> between the two models...|$|E

The distribution of all the possible transient times, i. e. the stratospheric age spectrum, contains important information on transport characteristics. However, it is computationally very expensive to compute seasonally varying age spectra, and previous studies have focused mainly on the annual mean properties of the age spectra. To date {{our knowledge of the}} seasonality of the stratospheric age spectra is very limited. In this study we investigate the seasonal variations of the stratospheric age spectra in the Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model (GEOSCCM). We introduce a method to significantly reduce the computational cost for calculating seasonally dependent age spectra. Our simulations show that stratospheric age spectra in GEOSCCM have strong seasonal cycles and the seasonal cycles change with latitude and height. In the lower stratosphere extratropics, the average transit times and the most probable transit times in the winter/early spring spectra are more than twice as old as those in the summer/early fall spectra. But the seasonal cycle in the subtropical lower stratosphere is nearly out of phase with that in the extratropics. In the middle and upper stratosphere, significant seasonal variations occur in the sUbtropics. The spectral shapes also show dramatic seasonal change, especially at high latitudes.

The inverse of the Lyapunov exponent measures the stretching time scale of a Lagrangian parcel on a chaotic orbit up to a finite time t, while the first equivalent time measures it in the recent past before t and the second equivalent time {{in the early part of}} the trajectory.

A new {{technique}} {{is presented to}} determine the degree of denitrification that occured during the 1996 / 97 Arctic winter, based on balloon and aircraft borne measurements of NO,, N 2 O and CH 4. The NO, / N 20 relation can undergo significant change due to <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> of subsided vortex air masses with extra-vortex air due to the high non-linearity of the relation. In this study high-altitude balloon measurements are used to define the properties of air masses that later descend in the polar vortex to altitudes sampled by the ER- 2 aircraft (i. e. 20 km) and mix isentropically with mid-latitude air. Observed correlations of CH 4 and N 20 obtained are used to quantify the degree of subsidence and mixing for individual air masses. Based on these results the expected mixing ratio of NO, resulting from subsidence and mixing, defined here as NO,**, is calculated and compared with the measured mixing ratio of NO,.

This deficit is interpreted as indication for weak denitrification (- 2 - 3 ppbv) in that air mass. The small degree of denitrification is con-sistent with the temperature history of the sampled air, which hardly encountered temperatures below the frostpoint during the Arctic winter 1996 / 97. Much larger degrees of denitrification would have been inferred if mixing effects had been ignored, which is the traditional approach to diagnose denitrification. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of using other correla-tions of conserved species to be able to accurately interpret changes in the NO, / N 2 O relation with respect to denitrification...|$|E

The main result is a scalar <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> coefficient, K yy, and a mean meridional transport circulation consistently derived from the same data base. For both data sources, isentropic mean meridional circulation is derived from horizontal mass flow rate for 4 representative months. Alternatively, a mean meridional circulation is calculated from total diabatic heating rates of the ECHAM 3 model. It is shown that only the latter is in good agreement with the ECMWF mean meridional circulation. Isentropic analysis also comprises the seasonal cycle of the climatological meridional gradient and flux of Ertel's potential vorticity (PV). Application of Tung's flux-gradient relation yields that for all seasons K yy is positive in height-latitude regions where statistical significance is reached. Large K yy values, marking regions of more efficient mixing, have been found in the subtropical vertical band of weak westerly wind and in mid-latitudes in regions of upward-propagating baroclinic wave activity in the middle and upper troposphere. Based on the ECMWF data and results of baroclinic-wave behaviour, strong indications are presented that positive zonally averaged PV flux polewards of the jet core in the NH is strengthened by stationary waves and nonlinear effects. Reduced eddy transport is apparent in winter and spring slightly below the subtropical tropopause jet.

The main result is a scalar <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> coefficient, K yy, and a mean meridional transport circulation consistently derived from the same data base. For both data sources, isentropic mean meridional circulation is derived from horizontal mass flow rate for 4 representative months. Alternatively, a mean meridional circulation is calculated from total diabatic heating rates of the ECHAM 3 model. It is shown that only the latter is in good agreement with the ECMWF mean meridional circulation. Isentropic analysis also comprises the seasonal cycle of the climatological meridional gradient and flux of Ertel's potential vorticity (PV). Application of Tung's flux-gradient relation yields that for all seasons K yy is positive in height-latitude regions where statistical significance is reached. Large K yy values, marking regions of more efficient mixing, have been found in the subtropical vertical band of weak westerly wind and in mid-latitudes in regions of upward-propagating baroclinic wave activity in the middle and upper troposphere. Based on the ECMWF data and results of baroclinic-wave behaviour, strong indications are presented that positive zonally averaged PV flux polewards of the jet core in the NH is strengthened by stationary waves and nonlinear effects. Reduced eddy transport is apparent in winter and spring slightly below the subtropical tropopause jet. The seasonal cycle of K yy from ECHAM 3 data is to a great extent in agreement with the result based on ECMWF analysis. In the model, reduced interannual variability enlarges the height-latitude range where sign of K yy is significant. Key words.

40|$|We {{determine}} {{the degree of}} denitrification {{that occurred during the}} 1996 - 1997 Arctic winter using a technique that is based on balloon and aircraft borne measurements of NOy, N 2 O, and CH 4. The NOy/N 2 O relation can undergo significant change due to <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> of subsided vortex air masses with extravortex air due to the high nonlinearity of the relation. These transport related reductions in NOy can be difficult to distinguish from the effects of denitrification caused by sedimentation of condensed HNO 3. In this study, high-altitude balloon measurements are used to define the properties of air masses that later descend in the polar vortex to altitudes sampled by the ER- 2 aircraft (i. e., ~ 20 km) and mix isentropically with extravortex air. Observed correlations of CH 4 and N 2 O are used to quantify the degree of subsidence and mixing for individual air masses. On the basis of these results the expected mixing ratio of NOy resulting from subsidence and mixing, defined here as NOy**, is calculated and compared with the measured mixing ratio of NOy. Values of NOy and NOy** agree well during most parts of the flights. A slight deficit of NOy versus NOy** is found only for a limited region during the ER- 2 flight on April 26, 1997. This deficit is interpreted as indication for weak denitrification (~ 2 - 3 ppbv) in that air mass. The small degree of denitrification is consistent with the general synoptic-scale temperature history of the sampled air masses, which did not encounter temperatures below the frostpoint and had relatively brief encounters with temperatures below the nitric acid trihydrate equilibrium temperature. Much larger degrees of denitrification would have been inferred if mixing effects had been ignored, which is the traditional approach to diagnose denitrification. Our analysis emphasizes the importance of using other correlations of conserved species to be able to accurately interpret changes in the NOy/N 2 O relation with respect to denitrification...|$|E
40|$|Transport of {{long-lived}} tracers (such as O, CO, and N O) in {{the lower}} stratosphere largely determines {{the composition of the}} entire stratosphere. Stratospheric transport includes the mean residual circulation (with air rising in the tropics and sinking in the polar and middle latitudes), plus two-way isentropic (quasi-horizontal) mixing by eddies. However, the relative importance of two transport components remains uncertain. Previous studies quantified the relative role of these processes based on tropics-wide average characteristics under common assumption of well-mixed tropics. However, multiple instruments provide us with evidence that show significant differences in the seasonal cycle of ozone between the Northern (0 - 20 N) and Southern (0 - 20 S) tropical (NT and ST respectively) lower stratosphere. In this study we investigate these differences in tracer seasonality and quantify transport processes affecting tracers annual cycle amplitude using simulations from Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model (GEOSCCM) and Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and compare them to observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on the Aura satellite. We detect the observed contrast between the ST and NT in GEOSCCM and WACCM: annual cycle in ozone and other chemical tracers is larger in the NT than in the ST but opposite is true for the annual cycle in vertical advection. Ozone budgets in the models, analyzed based on the Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework, demonstrate a major role of quasi-horizontal mixing vertical advection in determining the NTST ozone distribution and behavior. Analysis of zonal variations in the NT and ST ozone annual cycles further suggests important role of North American and Asian Summer Monsoons (associated with strong <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing)</b> on the lower stratospheric ozone in the NT. Furthermore, multi model comparison shows that most CCMs reproduce the observed characteristic of ozone annual cycle quite well. Thus, latitudinal variations within the tropics have to be considered {{in order to understand the}} balance between upwelling and quasi- horizontal mixing in the tropical lower stratosphere and the paradigm of well mixed tropics has to be reconsidered...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree to}} which the Southern Hemisphere polar vortex is {{isolated}} against horizontal (<b>isentropic)</b> <b>mixing</b> is investigated using data from the Halogen Occultation Experiment (HALOE), U. K. Meteorological Office (UKMO) potential vorticity (PV), and contour advection diagnostics. Measurements of methane and water vapor taken by HALOE during a disturbed period in the Southern Hemisphere springtime (21 September - 15 October 1992) are interpreted in light of the prevailing synoptic meteorology. Daily fields of winds and PV are shown to be essential in the interpretation of the data. A climatological high pressure region is responsible for a distorted vortex, and a substantial 'vortex stripping' event is present, associated with the early stages of vortex breakdown. This leads to significant temporal, zonal, and altitudinal variations in the distribution of tracers. The authors point out the difficulties this presents for the interpretation of solar occultation data, especially with regard to the use of zonal average time series. Longitude-height methane distributions from two days during the period are examined. Both days show substantial variations in abundance around a latitude circle. In particular, the authors investigate HALOE measurements at 77 deg S on 15 October 1992, which indicate an abundance of methane in the height region 600 - 2000 K (approximately 30 - 1 mb) that is more typical of midlatitude air. Similar distributions, observed in the 1991 HALOE data, have previously been interpreted as evidence for the penetration of midlatitude air into the vortex. Gradients of potential vorticity and contour advection diagnositcs are employed to examine whether the UKMO winds are consistent with this hypothesis in 1992. Although midlatitude air is able to penetrate poleward of the main jet core by advection processes alone, an essentially intact inner core of vortex air remains, which does not mix to any great extent with air from lower latitudes. The authors show that the high-latitude HALOE abundances that are typical of midlatitude air were observed in a region of extensive filamentation and mixing, rather than within the inner, more isolated, core...|$|E
40|$|A 3 D {{model of}} {{dynamics}} and photochemistry {{is used to}} investigate interannual changes of stratospheric dynamical and chemical structure through their dependence on tropospheric planetary waves and on the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). The integrations reproduce the salient features of the climate sensitivities of temperature and ozone, which have been composited from the observed records of ECMWFand the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS). Characterized by a strong anomaly of one sign at polar latitudes and a comparatively weak anomaly of opposite sign at subpolar latitudes, each bears the signature of the residual mean circulation. The structure {{is very similar to}} that associated with the Arctic Oscillation. The integrations imply that, jointly, anomalous Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux transmitted from the troposphere by planetary waves and the QBO are the major mechanisms behind interannual changes in the stratosphere. An analogous conclusion follows from the observational record. During early winter, anomalous temperature and ozone are accounted for almost entirely by anomalous EP flux from the troposphere, as they are in the observational record. During late winter, both mechanisms are required to reproduce observed anomalies. Although the QBO forces anomalous structure equatorward of 40 °N, the strong anomaly over the Arctic follows principally from anomalous upward EP flux. Reflecting anomalous wave driving of residual mean motion, the change of EP flux leads to anomalous downwelling of ozone-rich air. In concert with <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> by planetary waves, the anomalous enrichment that ensues at extratropical latitudes sharply modifies total ozone over the Arctic. Integrations distinguished by the omission of heterogeneous processes indicate that chemical destruction accounts for approximately 20 % of the anomaly in Arctic ozone between warm and cold winters. Analogous to estimates derived from the observed record of the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet, version 8 (SBUV-V 8) instrument, the remaining approximately 80 % follows from anomalous transport. The climate sensitivities of temperature and ozone describe random changes between years, introduced by anomalous EP flux and the QBO. Those interannual changes evolve with a particular seasonality. Like their structure, the seasonal dependence of anomalous temperature and ozone bears the signature of the residual mean circulation. Systematic changes in the observed record, which comprise stratospheric trends, have similar structure and seasonality. 13 page(s...|$|E
40|$|A {{prominent}} {{ozone minimum}} {{of less than}} 240 Dobson Units (DU) was observed over Irene (25. 5 ° S, 28. 1 ° E) by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) during May 2002 with extremely low ozone value of less than 219 DU recorded on 12 May, as compared to a climatological mean of 249 DU for May between 1999 and 2005. In this study, the vertical structure of this ozone minimum is examined using ozonesonde measurements performed over Irene on 15 May 2002, when the total ozone (as given by TOMS) was about 226 DU. Indeed, {{it is found that}} the ozone minimum is of Antarctic polar origin with a low-ozone layer in the middle stratosphere above 625 K and of tropical origin with low-ozone layer between 400 -K and 450 -K isentropic levels in the lower stratosphere. The upper and lower depleted parts of the ozonesonde profile for 15 May, are respectively attributed to equatorward and poleward transport of low-ozone air toward the subtropics. The tropical air moving over Irene and the polar one passing over the same area associated with enhanced planetary-wave activity are simulated successfully using a high-resolution advection contour model (MIMOSA) of Potential Vorticity. Indeed, in mid-May 2002, MIMOSA maps show a polar vortex filament in the middle stratosphere above the 625 -K isentropic level and they show also tropical air-masses moving southward (over Irene) in the lower stratosphere between 400 -K and 450 -K isentropic levels. The winter stratospheric wave driving and its associated localized <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> leading to the ozone minimum are investigated by means of two diagnostic tools: the Eliassen-Palm flux and the effective diffusivity computed from the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fields. The unusual distribution of ozone over Irene during May 2002 in the middle stratosphere is closely connected to the anomalously pre-conditioned structure of the polar vortex at that time of the year. Indeed, the perturbed vortex was typically predisposed for easy erosion by dynamical transport processes, which have been driven by strong planetary wave activity and have eventually resulted in a very large latitudinal advection of polar air masses towards the subtropics. The exceptional presence of polar vortex air over the subtropics during May 2002 can be considered as the first sign of the particular polar vortex disturbances, which after being well reinforced, contributed to the unprecedented behavior of the Antarctic spring ozone hole observed during September 2002...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the warming}} effect of {{atmospheric}} trace gases, such as CH 4 and CO 2, {{it is important}} to monitor their variations and understand their sources and sinks. While an increasing trend in atmospheric concentrations of CH 4 and CO 2 is confirmed by many measurements, the sources and sinks are not completely understood. As one of the methods determining sinks and sources of traces gases, inverse modeling, its accuracy depends on assimilated observation and the simulation ability of atmospheric motion. For CH 4 measurements, a method has been developed to determine tropospheric column-averaged mole fractions of CH 4 from total columns of CH 4 and N 2 O measured by solar absorption Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS). The motivation of this work is that tropospheric CH 4 is more directly related to its sources and sinks compared to the total columns, which contain variabilities of stratospheric CH 4 mostly originating from dynamic processes. Another reason is that the chemical transport model, in its current state, represents the troposphere better than the stratosphere. The method is applied to most of the FTS sites within the Total Carbon Column Observing Network. The measured tropospheric and stratospheric column-average CH 4 are used to assess performances of three European CH 4 models in the troposphere and stratosphere separately. In addition, the <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> processes and evolutions of the polar vortex in the models are evaluated using equivalent length. It is found the southern surf zone is not developed to a real extent. Together with the southern surf zone, a region with both vertically and horizontally uniform CH 4 occur between 450 and 850 K (18 and 30 km) in surf zone latitudes, which is absent in the models. The modeled polar vortex breaks too fast compared to the measurements. Measuring different isotopes of one species is another approach to improve knowledge on the sources and sinks of traces gases. This is explored for CO 2 using ground-based solar FTS spectra, specifically the ratio 13 C/ 12 C in atmospheric CO 2. Retrieval from the FTS spectra is almost entirely determined by assumed molecular spectroscopy. The existing databases can not fulfill requirements for CO 2 isotopes retrieval. An algorithm that inverts molecular spectroscopy from the ground-based spectra is developed. This algorithm is applied to H 2 O, CO 2 and solar lines indicating its feasibility. While the inverted spectroscopy improves the accuracy of the column and profile retrieval of CO 2 and H 2 O, the retrieved ratio 13 C/ 12 C is still beyond the required accuracy at a FTS site Bialystok...|$|E
40|$|We present {{airborne}} in situ measurements {{made during}} the AMMA (African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis) /SCOUT-O 3 campaign between 31 July and 17 August 2006 on board the M 55 Geophysica aircraft, based in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. CO 2 and N 2 O were measured with the High Altitude Gas Analyzer (HAGAR), CO was measured with the Cryogenically Operated Laser Diode (COLD) instrument, and O 3 with the Fast Ozone ANalyzer (FOZAN). We analyse the data obtained during five local flights to study the dominant transport processes controlling the tropical tropopause layer (TTL, here ~ 350 – 375 K) and lower stratosphere above West-Africa: deep convection up {{to the level of}} main convective outflow, overshooting of deep convection, and horizontal inmixing across the subtropical tropopause. Besides, we examine the morphology of the stratospheric subtropical barrier. Except for the flight of 13 August, distinct minima in CO 2 mixing ratios indicate convective outflow of boundary layer air in the TTL. The CO 2 profiles show that the level of main convective outflow was mostly located at potential temperatures between 350 and 360 K, and for 11 August reached up to 370 K. While the CO 2 minima indicate quite significant convective influence, the O 3 profiles suggest that the observed convective signatures were mostly not fresh, but of older origin (several days or more). When compared with the mean O 3 profile measured during a previous campaign over Darwin in November 2005, the O 3 minimum at the main convective outflow level was less pronounced over Ouagadougou. Furthermore O 3 mixing ratios were much higher throughout the whole TTL and, unlike over Darwin, rarely showed low values observed in the regional boundary layer. Signatures of irreversible mixing following overshooting of convective air were scarce in the tracer data. Some small signatures indicative of this process were found in CO 2 profiles between 390 and 410 K during the flights of 4 and 8 August, and in CO data at 410 K on 7 August. However, the absence of expected corresponding signatures in other tracer data makes this evidence inconclusive, and overall there is little indication from the observations that overshooting convection has a profound impact on gas-phase tracer TTL composition during AMMA. We find the amount of photochemically aged air isentropically mixed into the TTL across the subtropical tropopause to be not significant. Using the N 2 O observations we estimate the fraction of aged extratropical stratospheric air in the TTL to be 0. 0 ± 0. 1 up to 370 K during the local flights. Above the TTL this fraction increases to 0. 3 ± 0. 1 at 390 K. The subtropical barrier, as indicated by the slope of the correlation between N 2 O and O 3 between 415 and 490 K, does not appear as a sharp border between the tropics and extratropics, but rather as a gradual transition region between 10 ° N and 25 ° N where <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> between these two regions may occur...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol from {{aircraft}} {{can affect}} the environment in three ways: First, soot aerosol has been implicated to cause Icing-tern ozone depletion at mid-latitudes in the lower stratosphere {{at a rate of}} approx. 5 % per decade. This effect is in addition and unrelated to the polar ozone holes which are strongly influenced by heterogeneous chemistry on polar stratospheric clouds. Second, the most obvious effect of jet aircraft is the formation of visible contrails in the upper troposphere. The Salt Lake City region experienced an 8 % increase in cirrus cloud cover over a 15 -year period which covariates with an increase in regional commercial air traffic. If soot particles act as freezing nuclei to cause contrail formation heterogeneously, they would be linked to a secondary effect to cloud modification that very likely is climatologically important. Third, a buildup of soot aerosol could reduce the single scatter albedo of stratospheric aerosol from 0. 993 + 0. 004 to 0. 98, a critical value that has been postulated to separate stratospheric cooling from warming. Thus arises an important question: Do aircraft emit sufficient amounts of soot to have detrimental effects and warrant emission controls? During the 1996 SUCCESS field campaign, we sampled aerosols in the exhaust wake of a Boeing 757 aircraft and determined emission indices for sulfuric acid (EI(sub H 2 SO 4) = 9. 0 E- 2 and 5. 0 E- 1 g/kg (sub FUEL) for 75 and 675 ppm fuel-sulfur, respectively) and soot aerosol (2. 2 E- 3 less than EI(sub SOOT) = l. lE- 2 g/kg (sub FUEL)). The soot particle analysis accounted for their fractal nature, determined electron-microscopically, which enhanced the surface area by a factor of 26 and the volume 11 -fold over equivalent-volume spheres. The corresponding fuel-sulfur to H 2 SO 4 conversion efficiency was 10 % (for 675 ppmm fuel-S) and 37 % (for 75 ppmm fuel-S). Applying the H 2 SO 4 emission index to the 1990 fuel use by the worlds commercial fleets of 1. 3 E 11 kg, a conversion efficiency of 30 % of 500 ppmm fuel-S would have led to an annual contribution to the atmospheric sulfur budget by aircraft of 2. E 7 kg H 2 SO 4. This is about one part in 1. E 4 of anthropogenic sulfate from other sources. The soot emission index given above yielded a 1990 injection of soot aerosol by aircraft of 1. E 6 kg. Thus, soot amounts to only five percent of the aerosol generated by aircraft. Its reactivity with ozone would have to be 20 times that of sulfuric acid particles to make it chemically significant. Nevertheless, the findings, of stratospheric soot loadings commensurate with aircraft fuel consumption, based on the emission index given above and the assumption of stratospheric residence times of the order of one year implicate aircraft as stratospheric polluters. A trend similar to soot of H 2 SO 4 aerosol loading could not be deciphered, neither from in situ measurements nor SAGE II satellite extinction, against the "noise" due to volcanic eruptions. Observation of soot particles at 20 km altitude which, if emitted by aircraft were generated at 10 - 12 km altitude, suggests a displacement of those particles against gravity. Because eddy mixing is virtually absent in the lower stratosphere and <b>isentropic</b> <b>mixing</b> explains lofting to only about 15 km, radiometric forces acting on morphologically and chemically asymmetric soot particles must be considered a possibility. The consequence could be an extended residence time of soot against that of sulfuric acid aerosol that would lower the single scatter albedo with time...|$|E
