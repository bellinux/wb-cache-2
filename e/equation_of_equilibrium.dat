40|$|The {{governing}} differential <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> for flexural-torsional-distortional {{analysis of}} thin-walled box girder structures with various shapes were derived {{in this work}} using V. Z. Vlasov’s theory. The obtained equations were {{used to evaluate the}} cross sectional deformations of some box girder structures having rectangular (doubly symmetric) and trapezoidal (mono symmetric) shapes. Evaluation of Vlasov’s coefficients for the obtained differential <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> formed a major part of this work. This was accomplished by examining the strain modes interaction diagrams for the various cross sections and by using Morh’s integral chart for displacement computations. Cross sectional deformations of the box girder structures were obtained by integration <b>of</b> the differential <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> using method <b>of</b> trigonometric series with accelerated convergence.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{differential}} equations for torsionaldistortional analysis of mono symmetric box girder structure were derived using Vlasov’s theory. The application <b>of</b> the derived <b>equations</b> was demonstrated using a single cell mono symmetric box girder structure. The {{evaluation of the}} coefficients (Vlasov’s coefficients) <b>of</b> the governing <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> which form {{a major part of}} the work was accomplished using the strain mode diagrams and Morh’s integral for displacement computation. Torsional-distortional <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> for the analysis of the single cell mono symmetric box girder structure were obtained by substituting the Vlasov’s coefficients into the generalized differential <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> A single span simply supported mono symmetric box girder structure was considered in the analysis. The derived equations are fourth order coupled ordinary differential <b>equations</b> <b>of</b> <b>equilibrium</b> which were integrated by method of trigonometric series with accelerated convergence.
