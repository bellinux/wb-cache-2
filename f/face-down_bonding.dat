40|$|Abstract—This study aims {{to develop}} an array sensor to measure pulse waves. A seven-channel sensor, which has no {{interference}} among the channels, was fabricated by <b>face-down</b> <b>bonding.</b> The coefficient of variance was calculated using the output sensor signal corresponding to seven steps of applied pressure for three times. The result showed that the sensor is suitable to measure radial pulses for pulse diagnosis algorithms. Keywords—pulse diagnosis; array sensor; face-down bonding; traditional medicine I...|$|E
40|$|The {{radial artery}} pulse {{is one of}} the major {{diagnostic}} indices used clinically in both Eastern and Western medicine. One of the prominent methods for measuring the radial artery pulse is the piezoresistive sensor array. Independence among channels and an appropriate sensor arrangement are important for effectively assessing the spatial-temporal information of the pulse. This study developed a circular-type seven-channel piezoresistive sensor array using <b>face-down</b> <b>bonding</b> (FDB) as one of the sensor combination methods. The three-layered housing structure that included independent pressure sensor units using the FDB method not only enabled elimination of the crosstalk among channels, but also allowed various array patterns to be created for effective pulse measurement. The sensors were arranged in a circular-type arrangement such that they could estimate the direction of the radial artery and precisely measure the pulse wave. The performance of the fabricated sensor array was validated by evaluating the sensor sensitivity per channel, and the possibility of estimating the blood vessel direction was demonstrated through a radial artery pulse simulator. We expect the proposed sensor to allow accurate extraction of the pulse indices for pulse diagnosis...|$|E
