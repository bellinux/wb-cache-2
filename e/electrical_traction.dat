25|$|The {{construction}} of the Montmartre funicular was decided upon by the Paris municipal council in 1891. It was built to serve the Sacré-Cœur Basilica at {{the summit of the}} outlier of Montmartre and was inaugurated on 5 June 1891. If built according to the plan of the project selected initially the funicular would have used <b>electrical</b> <b>traction</b> and had a much longer route, serving six stations as well as two termini. It ended up being far more modest with only two terminal stations, and using water-filled counterweights for motion.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{single-deck}} cars of different designs were rebuilt as illuminated theme cars.

40|$|Inductors are {{frequently}} used in railway <b>electrical</b> <b>tractions</b> systems in filtering and current limiting operations. Magnetic fields are generated {{due to the}} flow of large AC currents through the coils, which intend induce currents on the coils {{as well as the}} metallic components in the vicinity, causing electromagnetic heating. The heating may cause temperatures to exceed project temperature requirements and in the worst case distort the functionality of drive system. The purpose of this work is to simulate the Electromagnetic Heating effect of inductors in 3 D using COMSOL Multiphysics. First a 3 D CAD model of the inductor geometry is imported to COMSOL and the magnetic fields for a giving current excitation are estimated. Then the power losses are fed in to a heat flow simulation to predict the temperature distributions. Cooling is simulated by driving cool air through the heated coils and the surrounding metal objects. The temperature distributions for different current excitations and air flow velocities are estimated. Simulation is performed on conceptual project inductor model. The 3 D inductor modeling approach established in this thesis work could be used to characterize the electromagnetic heating issues early in the project design phase. ...|$|R

2500|$|On 19 January 1915, the Ore Line between Riksgränsen and Kiruna was electrified. A {{plan for}} {{electrification}} of the Ofoten Line {{had been made}} in 1911, but not until 1920 did parliament approve the plans. Operations with <b>electrical</b> <b>traction</b> started on 15 May 1923, and was officially opened on 10 July. Until 1925, Swedish Oe locomotives were used. NSB decided to order two types of electric locomotive for the line: El 3 and El 4. El 3 was nearly identical to Oe and was a twin unit locomotive with a combined power output of [...] Four twin units were delivered in 1925, and a fifth in 1929. The El 4 locomotives were longer and more powerful, and operated as singles. Each single El 4 had the same power output as a twin El 3. Two units were delivered in 1926, two in 1928 and one in 1929. NSB operated the trains using their rolling stock from Narvik to Abisko, where there was a change of locomotive and operating company.|$|E
2500|$|Between 1940 and 1948, {{domestic}} {{steam locomotive}} sales declined from 30 {{percent of the}} market to 2 percent. By 1949, there was no demand for steam locomotives. Baldwin's attempts to adapt to the changed market for road locomotives had been unsuccessful; the reliability of their offerings was unsatisfactory, epitomized by notorious failures such as their [...] "Centipede" [...] Diesel locomotives and their steam turbine-electric locomotives, which proved to be money pits unsuited for their intended service. [...] In July 1948 Westinghouse Electric, which had teamed with Baldwin to build diesel and electric locomotives and wanted to keep their main customer in the rail industry afloat, purchased 500,000 shares, or 21 percent, of Baldwin stock, which made Westinghouse Baldwin's largest shareholder. Baldwin used the money to cover various debts. Westinghouse vice president Marvin W. Smith became Baldwin's president in May 1949. In a move to diversify into the construction equipment market, Baldwin merged with Lima-Hamilton on December 4, 1950, to become Baldwin-Lima-Hamilton. However, Lima-Hamilton's locomotive technology was unused after the merger and market share continued to dwindle. By January, 1952 Baldwin closed its factory in Rochelle, Il. and consolidated Whitcomb production at Eddystone. In 1953 Westinghouse discontinued building <b>electrical</b> <b>traction</b> equipment, so Baldwin was forced to reconfigure their drive systems based on General Electric equipment. [...] In 1954, during which time they were being virtually shut out of the Diesel market, Baldwin delivered one steam turbine-electric locomotive to the Norfolk and Western railroad, which proved unsatisfactory in service.|$|E

2500|$|They {{were built}} by East Lancashire Coachbuilders from 1984 to 1988. The first two {{vehicles}} (641 and GEC Traction test bed 651, later rebuilt into conventional Centenary 648) were completed {{ahead of the}} tramway's centenary year, hence their name. Originally intended to replace the OMO cars which were suffering from metal fatigue, ten were ordered. However, due to cost cutting only seven were built for Blackpool Transport, with GEC's 648 later joining the fleet. The cost cutting continued, as although the bodies, chassis and bogies were new, the motors and wheelsets were pre-war, refurbished ones from withdrawn cars. The bogie design continued {{the theme of the}} [...] "O.M.O." [...] and London Transport Underground cars, having [...] "Metalastik" [...] rubber/metal bonded springs. With the introduction of the new Bombardier Flexity 2 trams in 2012, all eight Centenary cars were withdrawn. Six of them were sold with two used on heritage tours: 642 and 648, the latter of which has been restored back to its original appearance. This is not strictly accurate, as 648 was numbered 651 when originally delivered. Also the work was done on a tight budget meaning some of the modern features had to be retained. The retained Centenaries unfortunately suffer from electrical issues, with 642 failing {{on the first day of}} its re-entry into service, although it has operated successfully since. Two of the sold cars are preserved: Centenary 641 is owned by the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust; Centenary 647, the last traditional standard gauge tram built in Great Britain, is owned by the North Eastern <b>Electrical</b> <b>Traction</b> Trust, based at the North East Land, Sea and Air Museum. Its all over advert has been stripped away and it is intended that it will be repainted into a fictional 1920s style red, teak and white livery. Two of the sold cars are based at outside locations: 643 is used as a classroom at Brooke School in Rugby, 644 is stored at Farmer Parrs Animal World in Fleetwood. 645 was stored at Windy Harbour Holiday Park in Singleton near Blackpool and moved back to Rigby Road depot for continued storage on the 27 July 2017. After initially being preserved by the Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust, 646 was scrapped in October 2012 after it was vandalised.|$|E
2500|$|... 20 trams {{were built}} by Brush in 1937. These are {{single-deck}} cars that closely resemble the original English Electric railcoaches, but have more pointed ends. They were originally numbered 284–303, with eighteen survivors being renumbered 621–638 in 1968 (301 and 303 having been mothballed and scrapped without being renumbered). 638 was experimentally converted as a driver-only operated tram in 1969 with doors {{built at the}} ends for entry, but the experiment was deemed a failure due to the layout and seating capacity reduction; 638 was converted back into a conventional Brush railcoach. 638 was withdrawn from service in 1980 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1984 after being deemed surplus to requirements. 629 was withdrawn in 1972 requiring an overhaul, but was scrapped in 1980 due to Rigby Road workshops working throughout the 1970s on the OMO rebuild programme. 628 was withdrawn in 1969 due to a collision with Balloon car 726. The body of 628 was scrapped, but the underframe was converted into a rail carrying trailer with a rail crane installed. 628 was renumbered to 748 and then 260. 633 was rebuilt as the illuminated Trawler and was renumbered to 737 in 2008. One Brush car, No. 631, was retained by Blackpool Transport for their heritage fleet of trams and has been restored back to its 1950s condition. Although its restoration {{has not yet been}} completed and some features of its 1990s rebuild remain, it re-entered service in May 2013. 622 was given to Anchorsholme Primary School for use as a static classroom. 626 was sold to Peel Holdings. 636 was sold to Stored Energy Technology to test experimental equipment. All of the other Brush cars were acquired for preservation due to the modernisation of the tramway in 2011-2012. In December 2013, former Permanent Way car 259 (624, originally 287) and 632 which were preserved by the Lancastrian Transport Trust, returned to Rigby Road Depot from outside storage and await repaints and repairs before they can re-enter service as part of the heritage fleet. 621 was preserved at Beamish museum until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool and moved back there in December 2016. 621 will return to service in September 2017, painted in 1950s green and cream livery. 623, painted in 1940s wartime green and cream livery, is in operation at Heaton Park Tramway, Manchester. In 2017, it went on loan to the Blackpool Tramway for the 80th anniversary of the Brush railcoach cars. 625 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Rigby Road Depot. 290 (627) is preserved by Fleetwood Heritage Leisure Trust. 630 is in operation at the National Tramway Museum, Crich. 630 was rebuilt in the 1990s with modern indicator headlamps, electrical equipment and bus-type seats. It remains in this condition as a reminder of this period of Blackpool's tramway history. 634 was privately sold and was on static display at the North Eastern <b>Electrical</b> <b>Traction</b> Trust museum painted in 1990s green and cream livery until 2016 when the tram was donated to the heritage fleet in Blackpool by its owner and returned to Blackpool in February 2016 and will re-enter service in the future. 298 (635) was preserved by the National Tramway Museum, Crich and remains stored. 637 is privately preserved and is currently stored in Fleetwood.|$|E
