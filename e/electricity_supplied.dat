Recently, the government of Nigeria has initiated a lot of projects aimed at boosting <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> but this effort seems to yield no positive results. This may be attributed to the inability of policy makers to identify the determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> for actual policy formulation and implementation. Hence, this study analyzed the determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Nigeria (from 1970 - 2009), using a parametric econometric methodology of ordinary least squares. The results showed that technology, government funding, and the level of power loss were the statistically significant determinants of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in Nigeria and that an average of 40 % of power is lost in transmission per annum. Thus, the government should inject more funds into the power sector to complete power projects with state of the art technology in order to enhance <b>electricity</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
25|$|Offshore {{wind power}} or {{offshore}} wind energy {{is the use of}} wind farms constructed offshore, usually on the continental shelf, to harvest wind energy to generate electricity. Higher wind speeds are available offshore compared to on land, so offshore wind power’s contribution in terms of <b>electricity</b> <b>supplied</b> is higher, and NIMBY opposition to construction is usually much weaker. The cost of offshore wind power has historically been higher than that of onshore wind generation, but in 2016 had decreased to €54.5/MWh the 700 MW Borssele 3&4 due to government tender and size. Similarly, €49.90/MWh ($55.34, without transmission) was achieved at the 600 MW Kriegers Flak.|$|E

It was over three times as heavy (without pilot) as the Gossamer Penguin and had a shorter wingspan, but was proportionately more powerful, with <b>electricity</b> <b>supplied</b> by 16,128 solar cells powering two three-horsepower motors. The solar panels were directly affixed to the wing and large horizontal stabilizer, both of which had to be flat on top to accommodate them.

40|$|Nigeria’s {{economic}} history is coloured with {{various types of}} crises and fluctuations in important macroeconomic variables. These include crises in electricity generation and distribution, domestic and external debt crisis, {{balance of payments disequilibrium}} and fluctuations in key macroeconomic variables such as broad money supply, exchange rate, real GDP growth rate etc. This paper has attempted to investigate the impact of stabilization policies (monetary and fiscal policies) and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> on economic development in Nigeria using the OLS estimation technique. The time series characteristics of the variables were tested using the Ng and Perron (2001) modified unit root test and the (ARDL) bounds testing approach to cointegration proposed by Pesaran et al (2001). The result of the parsimonious estimates showed that broad money supply, government expenditure and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> were important determinants of per capita GDP growth rate in Nigeria. To test for the importance of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the model, we run the regression first without <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> and then with <b>electricity</b> <b>supply,</b> the inclusion of <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> in the regression significantly improved the diagnostic statistics. The findings of this paper showed that albeit demand management is useful for the purpose of economic stabilization in Nigeria, it is equally important for policy makers to address <b>supply</b> issues, especially <b>electricity</b> <b>supply.</b> This is because as the study shows, <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> is important to drive economic growth and development to the desired threshold...|$|R

2500|$|The cavity {{magnetron}} is a high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves using {{the interaction of}} a stream of electrons with a magnetic field while moving past a series of open metal cavities (cavity resonators). Electrons pass by the openings to these cavities and cause radio waves to oscillate within, {{similar to the way}} a whistle produces a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening. The frequency of the microwaves produced, the resonant frequency, is determined by the cavities' physical dimensions. [...] Unlike other vacuum tubes such as a klystron or a traveling-wave tube (TWT), the magnetron cannot function as an amplifier in order to increase the intensity of an applied microwave signal; the magnetron serves solely as an oscillator, generating a microwave signal from direct current <b>electricity</b> <b>supplied</b> to the vacuum tube.|$|E

The monopolistic South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> {{industry}} {{is undergoing a}} transformation that would change its ownership and market structure. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether the strategic choice to transform the {{industry is}} indeed appropriate. A qualitative, case based study of the existing and proposed South African <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry was performed. Various strategic tools and techniques, related to both strategic theory and <b>electricity</b> <b>supply</b> industry models, formed the basis of the evaluation.
