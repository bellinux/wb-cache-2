500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing {{his left knee}} in the same direction, {{with the palm of}} his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E

2500|$|.....while talking or even musing {{as he sat}} in his chair, he {{commonly}} held his <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side towards his right shoulder, and shook it in a tremulous manner, moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand. In the intervals of articulating he made various sounds with his mouth; sometimes giving a half whistle, sometimes making his tongue play backwards from the roof of his mouth, as if clucking like a hen, and sometimes protruding it against his upper gums in front, as if pronouncing quickly under his breath, 'Too, too, too.' All this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale.|$|E
6000|$|The {{paper was}} one from New York {{that had just}} come from the {{metropolis}} on the three o'clock paper train. I spread it open, and was rather startled to behold the following <b>heading</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> of the columns: ...|$|R

50|$|In another macabre touch, {{instead of}} a graceful bow or bob of the <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one's</b> dancing partner, a man who {{attended}} a bal des victimes would jerk his head sharply downwards in imitation of the moment of decapitation.
