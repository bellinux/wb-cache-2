5|$|A week out of Lima, the Beagle {{reached the}} Galápagos Islands on 15 September 1835. The next day Captain FitzRoy dropped anchor {{near the site}} of the modern town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Chatham Island.

5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of the day three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the <b>first</b> <b>hour.</b> Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E

5|$|The draft {{had little}} effect on the {{television}} ratings for WWE's programming. Generally, the ratings of the three shows during the week of the draft were consistent with the ratings of each from the previous week. The ratings for WWE programming the week before the draft were the following: the April 6 episode of Raw was watched by 5.7 million viewers in its <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> and by 6.1 million viewers in its second hour for an average 3.9 rating, the April 7 episode of ECW on Sci Fi earned a 1.3 television rating, and Friday Night SmackDown earned a 2.0 television rating. The draft episode of Raw was watched by 4.7 million viewers in its <b>first</b> <b>hour,</b> 5.7 in its second hour, and 6.1 in the final hour for an average 3.7 television rating. Later that week, ECW on Sci Fi earned a 1.2 television rating, while Friday Night SmackDown earned a 2.0.|$|E

Johnson was only given five overs and took 0/19 as the pacemen efficiently cut down the English batsmen in 79 overs.|$|E

5|$|New Year's Rockin' Eve 2012 brought ABC's highest {{ratings on}} New Year's Eve since ABC 2000 Today; an average 8.4 million viewers watched the 40th anniversary retrospective, the primetime hour brought in 12.9 million viewers, and the <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> {{of the main}} {{broadcast}} peaked at 22.6 million viewers. These numbers excluded viewership from locations such as bars and New Year's Eve parties, as Nielsen ratings do not account for out-of-home viewership (however, the company announced on October 24, 2016 that it would begin to offer out-of-home ratings data to broadcasters in April 2017).|$|E
5|$|The draft helped {{increased}} the television ratings of Raw, {{which was one}} of the main purposes of the draft. The television rating for the three hours was 3.40 TVR, as it earned 2.78 TVR for the <b>first</b> <b>hour,</b> 3.46 TVR for the second hour, and 3.95 TVR for the final hour. In its regular time slot, the show would have garnered a 3.7 rating. Both ratings were higher than the week's previous rating of a 3.3 TVR.|$|E

This gave many of those aboard a false sense of hope that the ship might stay afloat long enough for them to be rescued. By 1:30, the sinking rate of the front section increased until Titanic reached a down angle of about ten degrees.|$|E

30|$|Conclusions: Hence in {{patients}} with STBI and aspiration of gastric contents we observed significant increase in EVWL (p[*]=[*] 0.05) and decrease in PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio in the <b>first</b> <b>hours</b> after trauma {{in comparison with the}} patients without aspiration. Accumulation of EVWL can be considered as one of ARDS criteria, but only with other signs of damage. ARDS is registered in the <b>first</b> <b>hours</b> after trauma roughly in 50  % of cases {{in patients}} with aspiration of both gastric contents and blood.|$|R

5|$|To {{advertise}} the game, Konami {{released a}} series of screenshots and viral videos prior to release. The screenshots depicted {{different areas of the}} asylum and victims in their traps.

While a few of the videos are inaccurate due to the developer making dramatic changes to the environment and gameplay, they still maintained the general roots of the game and the storyline.|$|E
5|$|A {{surprisingly}} fast {{beginning to}} the stage, with a <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> that covered over , {{managed to keep}} any breakaways from going clear for over two hours. Twelve eventually came ahead of the peloton, with seven in the lead and five chasing between the leaders and the peloton. The third group on the road eventually dwindled to a select contingent of overall favorites, which included race leader Danilo Di Luca. Former Giro champion Stefano Garzelli attacked from this group on the day's first climb and got to the leading group of five before the summit, claiming maximum points on it and on Sestrière to gain leadership of the mountains classification {{at the end of}} the day. Garzelli's maximum advantage, at the summit of Sestrière, was just over six minutes.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} opening ceremony, United States {{broadcaster}} NBC was criticised for its coverage, as omitting performers less-known in the US. John Clarke, writing for Forbes, said it was wrong not to air performances from Ray Davies and Muse, as well as delaying the performance from The Who by an hour to broadcast the pilot of the sitcom Animal Practice followed by the late local news. While in New Zealand, Prime TV were also criticised for delayed coverage, running 20 minutes behind Sky Sport. In the Philippines, TV5 was also criticised because it only aired the <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of coverage of the ceremony and highlights were incorporated into its morning news programme, Good Morning Club.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{headed into}} the First Test at Trent Bridge with ten wins and two draws from twelve tour matches, {{including}} eight innings victories. England captain Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat. Pundits predicted that the pitch would be ideal for batting after offering some assistance to fast bowlers in the <b>first</b> <b>hour.</b> The surface had greened up following overnight rain. Australia's fast bowlers reduced England to 8/74 before finishing them off for 165 late on the first day. The tourists had already taken the lead by the time Hassett came in to join Bradman at 4/185 on the second afternoon. The hard-hitting Miller had come in at No. 4, the more Hassett's usual position, indicating that Bradman may have been looking to attack, but the change in batting order failed as Miller was out for a duck.|$|E
5|$|Claims that Stroheim's {{original}} cut was {{a completely}} unabridged version of McTeague are not accurate. Stroheim's 300-page script was {{almost as long as}} the original novel, but he rethought the entire story and invented new scenes, as well as extensively elaborating existing ones. In the Norris novel, McTeague's back story in Placer County and relationships with his father, mother and Potter were remembered as a flashback and took two paragraphs. In Stroheim's original Greed, this sequence took up the <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of the film and was not a flashback. Stroheim also modernized the novel's time span to between 1908 and 1923, a quarter-century later than the novel.|$|E

The feel of the show also changed and was also split into three sections. The <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> became Kicking Toons which bunched all the cartoons together, the next hour would feature {{the main components of}} Live & Kicking including the games and sketches and the final hour became Live & Loud which featured all the music performances.|$|E

5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{more active}} {{in the early morning}} than at other times of the day; flying more when visiting flowers at the time when nectar is most abundant. Its body mass {{decreases}} during the night, and then increases during the day with the greatest increase occurring during the important <b>first</b> <b>hour</b> of early morning foraging. It seems to make up around half of the overnight water loss during this hour. The energy that the brown honeyeater can potentially get from nectar exceeds its requirements in all seasons except winter, when it needs to be selective in the plants that are used, to balance energy intake and expenditure. It compensates for any lessening in nectar concentration by increasing the frequency of feeding.|$|E
5|$|The film made back {{most of its}} {{production}} and promotions budget the day it opened, grossing close to $6,000 in the <b>first</b> <b>hour,</b> and nearly $25,000 during its first week, landing it on Varietys list of the week's 50 top-grossing films. Positive word of mouth spread and the film was favorably reviewed in Variety ("There are no more closets!"), The Advocate ("Everyone will {{fall in love with}} this philandering fellator.") and other outlets, which previously had completely ignored the genre. While some critics were less impressed, others saw the film as akin to the avant-garde work of directors like Kenneth Anger and Andy Warhol. Within six months the film had grossed $140,000 and was continuing to open in theatres across the United States and around the world.|$|E
5|$|This left Australia {{to chase}} 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have}} been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, {{predicting}} that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating spinners' wicket. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs on a pitch that offered spin and bounce. Only 44 runs came in the <b>first</b> <b>hour,</b> leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Both players survived close calls before Hassett fell at 1/57.|$|E
