To investigate whether microbial assemblages shifted {{in response to the}} changes of a redox state within acidic hot ponds, we collected three paired water and sediment samples from the Tatun Volcano Group, assessed metabolic roles of community members, and correlated their functional capabilities with geochemical factors along depth. Molecular analyses revealed that Sulfolobus spp., Acidianus spp. and Vulcanisaeta spp. capable of respiring elemental sulfur under oxic and/or low-oxygen conditions were the major archaeal members in planktonic communities. In contrast, obligate anaerobic Caldisphaera spp. dominated over others in bottom-dwelling communities. Bacteria were only detected in one locality wherein the majority was affiliated with microaerophilic Hydrogenobaculum spp. Cluster analyses indicated that archaeal communities associated with sediments tended to cluster together and branch off those with water. In addition, the quantities of dissolved oxygen within the water column were substantially less than those in equilibrium with atmospheric oxygen, indicating a net oxygen consumption most likely catalyzed by microbial processes. These lines of evidence suggest that the segregation of planktonic from bottom-dwelling archaeal assemblages could be accounted for by the oxygen affinities inherited in individual archaeal members.

40|$|Stable and {{efficient}} operation of an Ironmaking Blast Furnace {{is driven by}} control of furnace permeability, particularly in the cohesive zone where ferrous materials undergo softening and melting. Due to the difficulty in replicating the conditions in experimental studies, numerical simulation is vital to building understanding of the behaviour of material in the cohesive zone and the effects on the overall permeability in the furnace. Whilst there have been significant attempts to simulate liquids flow, and effects on gas and solid distribution around the cohesive zone, {{there has been little}} consideration of how particle deformation during softeningâmelting affects cohesive zone permeability. This study developed a numerical model capable of simulating the change of shape experienced by particles as they undergo deformation within the cohesive zone. A subâparticle Discrete Element Model framework was chosen where an agglomeration of subâparticles represents a single deformable macroâparticle. Rearrangement of the subâparticles permits deformation of the macroâparticle. Sensitivity of deformation characteristics to model parameters was studied in two systems compression of a single spherical agglomerate and tensile extension of a cylindrical sample. Simulations with brittle and ductile conditions showed that multiple parameters impacted on the deformation behaviour of material. Simulations of the deformation under load of a packed bed were conducted and compared to previous experimental results. The numerical simulation was able to reproduce broadly the deformation of particles within the packed bed; however lack of a creep mechanism limited the accuracy of the time dependent response. Direct analysis of the contact areas between deforming particles provided useful information regarding the behaviour of softening particles under load. Finally, the model was applied to simulate an industrial scale softeningâmelting test, in which <b>hot</b> <b>reducing</b> gas is passed through a bed of iron ore particles sandwiched between layers of coke particles. Localised porosities within the packed bed, as well as the condition of the softening particles, were used to calculate the pressure drop of the gas passing through the bed. This pressure drop was comparable to the experimental results. Channelling effects at lower porosity levels was also investigated and shown to have an influence on the understanding of the pressure drop within a deformable packed bed...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the processes responsible for the enrichments of certain siderophile/ chalcophile trace elements during the production of subduction-related magmas, representative lavas from seven subduction zones have been analyzed for Pb, As, Sb, Sn, W, Mo, Tl, Cu, and Zn by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), radiochemical epithermal neutron activation analysis (RENA), and atomic absorption (AA). The siderophile/chalcophile elements are compared to the highly fluid-mobile element B, the light rare earth elements (LREEs), U, and Th in order to place constraints on their behavior in subduction zones. Boron, As, Sb, and Pb are all enriched in arc lavas and continental crustal rocks more so than expected assuming normal magmatic processes (melting and crystallization). Tin, W, and Mo show little evidence of enrichment. Correlations of Pb/Ce, As/Ce, and Sb/Ce with B/La are statistically significant and have high correlation coefficients (and, more importantly, slopes approaching one) suggesting that Pb, As, and Sb behave similarly to B (i. e., that they are fluid-mobile). In addition, across-arc traverses show that B/La, As/Ce, Pb/Ce, and Sb/Ce ratios decrease dramatically with distance towards the back-arc basin. W/Th, Tl/La, Sn/Sm, and Mo/Ce ratios and Cu and Zn concentrations have much less systematic across-arc variations and correlations with B/La are not as strong (and in some cases, not statistically significant) and the regression lines have much lower slopes. Mixing models between upper mantle, slab-derived fluid, and sediment are consistent with a fluid-derived component in the arcs displaying extra enrichments of B, Pb, As, and Sb. These observations imply efficient mobilization of B, Pb, As, Sb, and possibly Tl into arc magma source regions by hydrothermal fluids derived from metamorphic dehydration reactions within the slab. Tin, W, and Mo show little, if any, evidence of hydrothermal mobilization. Copper appears to be slightly enriched in arc lavas relative to mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs) whereas Zn contents of arc lavas, MORB, ocean island basalts (OIBs), and continental crustal samples are similar suggesting that the bulk partition coefficient for Zn is approximately equal to one. However, Zn contents of the upper mantle are lower than these reservoirs implying an enrichment of the source region in Zn prior to melting. These nonigneous enrichments have implications not only for arc magma genesis but also for continental crust formation and crust-mantle evolution. The mobility of Pb, As, Sb, and B in <b>hot,</b> <b>reducing,</b> acidic hydrothermal fluids may be greatly enhanced relative to the large-ion lithophile elements (LILEs; including U) {{as a result of}} HS−, H 2 S, OH−, or other types of complexing. In the case of Pb, continued transport of Pb from subducted slabs into arc magma source regions throughout Earth history coupled with a U fluxing of the mantle a the end of the Archean may account for the depletion of Pb in the upper mantle, the low U/Pb of most arc volcanics and continental crustal rocks, and provide an explanation for the Pb- Paradox (Hofmann et al., 1986;McCulloch, 1993;Miller et al., 1994). Recycled slabs will then retain high U/Pb ratios upon entering the deep mantle and may eventually become incorporated into the source regions of many OIBs; some with HIMU (high 238 U/ 204 Pb) signatures...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} indicates {{the fate of}} Zr, Hf and Rare Earths during their sublimation from the high-temperature gas phase (100 ° - 420 °C), in volcanic systems associated with different geodynamic regimes, and processes associated with volcanic sublimation representing the last natural “inorganic” interface where a detailed investigation into the behaviour of Rare Earths had never been conducted. The research {{was carried out in}} active volcanic systems at Vulcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy), Santorini (Cyclades Islands, Greece), Phlegrean Fields (Italy), Tenerife (Canary Islands, Spain) and Fogo Island (Cape Verde) where both fumaroles and thermal waters from submarine springs and inland wells were collected and investigated. Both solid newly forming sublimates and the coexisting volcanic gas phase were studied in fumaroles in order to evaluate partitioning of the elements studied during the sublimation. Volatile geochemistry of Zr, Hf and Rare Earths (hereafter reported REE, being the sum of lanthanides and yttrium) data suggested a scenario where REE are transported in the volcanic gas phase as chloride complexes. This indication is apparently also confirmed for Zr and Hf by the Zr partitioning in the volcanic gas phase during sublimation relative to Hf. This evidence is attributed to the formation of [(Zr,Hf) Cl 4 (H 2 O) 4] and other Cl-complexes that are more stable in the volatile phase when Zr is the coordinating metal relative to Hf. Features of shale-normalised REE patterns show positive Gd anomalies in volcanic gas during the sublimation whose amplitude progressively grows with increasing HCl contents in volcanic gas. These features are consistent with reference values of stability constants for chloride-REE complexes rather than for fluorine- and other REE complexes. This data may explain several instances of medium REE enrichments in natural waters during and immediately after large volcanic eruptions and suggests a particular Gd fate relative to other REE during the emission of volcanic soluble substances. Geochemical evidence coming from hydrothermal waters from Vulcano and Santorini Islands confirm the above-mentioned suggestion about the particular Gd behaviour in volcanic fluids since positive Gd anomalies are recognised in waters from submarine vents. Here Gd/Gd* ii up to 1. 6 are associated with clear signs of W-type tetrad effects that allow us to identify these fluids as those leaching the authigenic solids that are immediately formed during the mixing between the <b>hot</b> <b>reducing</b> and acidic hydrothermal fluids with cold, oxidizing and basic seawater close to the vent. This and other geochemical evidence along with model calculations allow us to identify two different water groups in terms of physical-chemical characters, calculated saturation/oversaturation with respect to carbonates (group 1 waters) and Fe-oxyhydroxides (group 2 waters) and reciprocal Zr-Hf behaviour dissolved in natural pools. In both waters, the dissolved speciation of these elements is dominated by [Zr(OH) 4] 0 e [Hf(OH) 5]- complexes. These species being differently charged, they fractionate during interactions with occurring solid surfaces. Our data confirms that Zr and Hf undergo a competition process between dissolved speciation and surface adsorption, but also suggests that the larger Hf surface reactivity, especially onto Fe-oxyhydroxides, can be related to the Hf surface complexation rather than to a simple interaction attributed to electrostatic attractions. Our findings prove that passive volcanic degassing can represent a suitable Gd source in a soluble and bioavailable form. Model calculations based of CO 2 fluxes from the studied active volcanic areas indicate that about 1 kg Gd per year is released as a whole into the atmosphere. Comparing this value with reference data, this indication suggests that the volcanic Gd-flux is of the same order of magnitude as the yearly anthropogenic Gd delivered to the hydrosphere from hospital wastewaters in Germany. Therefore, Gd from volcanic source could represent a potential environmental risk under particular conditions...|$|E

40|$|The Falun pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu-(Au-Ag) {{sulphide}} deposit, {{situated in}} the Palaeoproterozoic (1. 9 – 1. 8 Ga) Bergslagen lithotectonic unit in the south-western part of the Fennoscandian Shield, {{is one of the}} major base and precious metal sulphide deposits in Sweden. Felsic volcanic rocks and limestone hosting the deposit, as well as their hydrothermally altered equivalents and the mineralization, were affected by heterogeneous ductile strain and metamorphism under low-pressure, lower amphibolite-facies conditions during the Svecokarelian orogeny (2. 0 – 1. 8 Ga). These processes reworked the mineral assemblages of the original hydrothermal system and the mineralization, and also reshaped the structural geometry of the deposit. A three-dimensional modelling approach has been used in order to evaluate geometric relationships between lithologies at the deposit. The polyphase character (D 1 and D 2) of the strong ductile deformation at Falun is apparent. The main rock-forming minerals in the altered silicate-rich rocks are quartz, biotite and anthophyllite with porphyroblasts of cordierite and garnet, as well as retrogressive chlorite. Major static grain growth occurred between D 1 and D 2, inferred to represent the peak of metamorphism, as well as after D 2 with growth (or recrystallization) of anthophyllite. A major shear zone with chlorite, talc and disseminated sulphides bounds the pyritic Zn-Pb-Cu-rich massive sulphide mineralization to the north, the latter being surrounded elsewhere by disseminated to semi-massive Cu-Au mineralization. F 2 sheath folding along axes plunging steeply to the south-south-east is suggested as a key deformation mechanism, accounting for the cone-shaped mineralized bodies, which pinch out at depth, and explaining the similar character of intensely altered rocks on all sides of the massive sulphide mineralization. Immobile-element lithogeochemistry suggests that they share a common volcanic precursor. These relationships are consistent with a model in which the pyritic massive sulphide mineralization is located in the core of a sheath fold structure, surrounded by the same altered stratigraphic footwall rocks with Cu-Au mineralization. The geological evolution in the metavolcanic inlier that hosts the Falun deposit, constrained by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) U–Pb (zircon) geochronology, involved emplacement of a felsic volcanic and sub-volcanic rock suite at 1894 ± 3 Ma, followed by hydrothermal alteration and mineralization. Subsequent burial and intrusion of late- to post-mineralization dykes occurred between 1896 ± 3 Ma and 1891 ± 3 Ma, followed by further burial and emplacement of plutons with variable composition during the time span 1894 ± 3 Ma to 1893 ± 3 Ma. The age determinations for all these magmatic suites overlap within their uncertainties, indicating a rapid sequence of continuous burial and different magmatic pulses. A metamorphic event, herein dated at 1831 ± 8 Ma and 1822 ± 5 Ma (SIMS U–Pb monazite), falls in the age range of a younger Svecokarelian metamorphic episode (M 2). U-Th-Pb isotope systematics in monazite was completely reset during this event. During hydrothermal alteration and mineralization, a <b>hot,</b> <b>reducing</b> and acidic fluid carrying metals and sulphur together flowed upward along syn-volcanic faults, leading to intense chloritization, sericitization and silicification of calc-alkaline volcanic rocks in the stratigraphic footwall to the deposit. This resulted in proximal siliceous associations including Fe-rich chlorite, and dominant Mg-rich chlorite and sericite in more peripheral parts. Cu-Au stockwork mineralization formed in the siliceous core of the hydrothermal system as result of fluid cooling. Neutralization of the metal-bearing fluids upon carbonate interaction stratigraphically higher in the sub-seafloor regime led to formation of Zn-Pb-Cu-rich massive sulphide mineralization, the space for which was created by a combination of carbonate dissolution, primary porosity in the overlying volcanic rocks and secondary porosity produced during syn-volcanic faulting. A hybrid model for mineralization is suggested by alteration styles, metal zoning and textures indicating replacement of carbonate rock or highly porous pumice breccia by pyritic massive sulphide. Aspects of a sub-seafloor volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) system and carbonate replacement are both present. Partly Zn-Pb-(Ag) mineralized skarns comprise a separate and subordinate type of mineralization, probably formed after burial of the hydrothermal system to the contact-metasomatic regime. Textures and microstructures in the massive sulphide mineralization indicate that the ductile deformation and metamorphism resulted in internal mechanical and chemical remobilization of sulphide minerals. Laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analysis of the main sulphide minerals suggests, for example, that trace elements (including Au) were liberated from pyrite during metamorphism. A system of auriferous quartz veins, affected by D 2 ductile strain, occurs in intensely altered and mineralized rocks on the eastern side of the deposit. It is suggested that they formed after the peak of metamorphism and prior to the completion of the D 2 tectonic event, as a result of fluid-assisted remobilization of sulphides and Au in the disseminated to semi-massive Cu-Au mineralization and possibly also the massive sulphide mineralization.
