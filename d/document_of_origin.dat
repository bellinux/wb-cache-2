5000|$|He was {{a pioneer}} in the {{application}} of [...] "form criticism" [...] approach to Rabbinic texts. Much of Neusner's work focused on deconstructing the prevailing approach that viewed Rabbinic Judaism as a single religious movement within which the various Rabbinic texts were produced. In contrast, Neusner viewed each rabbinic document as an individual piece of evidence that can only shed light on the more local Judaisms <b>of</b> such specific <b>document's</b> place <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and the specific Judaism of the author. His 1981 book Judaism: The Evidence of the Mishnah is the classic statement of his work and the first of many comparable volumes on the other <b>documents</b> <b>of</b> the rabbinic canon.|$|R

40|$|THE HIDROGRAPHIC NETWORK IN THE MAP OF PORTUGAL BY FERNANDO ÁLVARO SECO (1560). A cartographic {{examination}} of the hidrographic network demonstrates, on one hand, its high quality in general and allows us, on the other hand, to seek reasons for the mistakes in its drawing and orienting, {{as well as the}} omissions made. To this effect, the plotting of the rivers was compared with itineraries descriptions of that same period. An examination was also made of the distribution of bridges and hidronymy. A solid spatial correlation was found to exist between the quality of the plotting and the density and frequency of the various itineraries, along with the influence of military concerns for the Eastern boundary of the portuguese kingdom. The correlation with the regional properties of relief and climate is important but less direct.
