5|$|Chernow, {{a former}} {{business}} journalist, {{was inspired to}} write the book while researching another biography on Washington's long-time aide Alexander Hamilton. Washington: A Life took six years to complete and makes extensive use of archival evidence.

5|$|Irene was Johnson's only play, and {{was first}} {{performed}} on 6 February 1749 in a production {{by his friend}} and former pupil, David Garrick. The play was a commercial success and earned Johnson more money than anything else he had written up to that point. It was never revived during his lifetime, {{and there is no}} subsequent evidence of any other full-scale productions of Irene anywhere until 1999, {{making it one of the}} most unsuccessful plays <b>ever</b> <b>written</b> by a major author.|$|E

5|$|The name Giacomo Meyerbeer {{first became}} known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto—premiered in Venice in 1824 and {{produced}} in London and Paris in 1825; incidentally, {{it was the}} last opera <b>ever</b> <b>written</b> to feature a castrato, and the last to require keyboard accompaniment for recitatives. This 'breakthrough' in Paris was exactly what Meyerbeer had been aiming for over the past ten years; he had been carefully preparing for it, developing contacts, and fully reaped his reward.|$|E
5|$|As {{expected}} by Voltaire, Candide has enjoyed both great success and great scandal. Immediately after its secretive publication, {{the book was}} widely banned because it contained religious blasphemy, political sedition and intellectual hostility hidden under a thin veil of naïveté. However, with its sharp wit and insightful portrayal of the human condition, the novel has since inspired many later authors and artists to mimic and adapt it. Today, Candide is recognized as Voltaire's magnum opus and is often listed {{as part of the}} Western canon; it is among the most frequently taught works of French literature. The British poet and literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith listed Candide as one of the 100 most influential books <b>ever</b> <b>written.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque <b>ever</b> <b>written,</b> and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E

5000|$|In its {{narrative}} structure, The Sea Lady plays cleverly with {{conventions of}} historical and journalistic research and verification. According to John Clute, [...] "Structurally {{it is the}} most complex thing Wells <b>ever</b> <b>wrote,</b> certainly the only novel Wells <b>ever</b> <b>wrote</b> to directly confirm our understanding that he did, indeed, read Henry James." [...] Adam Roberts has argued that The Sea Lady was written in a kind of dialogue with James's The Sacred Fount (1901).|$|R
5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can hear how these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces <b>ever</b> <b>written</b> by an American composer.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{the book}} has {{influenced}} a number of non-fiction books including The Song of the Dodo by David Quammen (1997), which discussed Wallace's contributions {{to the field of}} island biogeography; The Spice Islands Voyage by Tim Severin (1997) that retraced Wallace's travels; and Archipelago: The Islands of Indonesia, by Gavan Daws (1999), which compared the environment described by Wallace with the modern state of the archipelago. The Malay Archipelago is considered {{to be one of the}} most influential books <b>ever</b> <b>written</b> about the Indonesian islands. It remains a resource for modern authors of works about the region such as the 2014 book Indonesia Etc, which contains multiple quotations from Wallace's book as well as recommending it as further reading on the geography of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle of}} San Lorenzo {{is the theme}} of the San Lorenzo march. The {{military}} march was composed in February 1901 by Cayetano Alberto Silva following a proposal from Representative Celestino Pera. It was first officially played on October 30, 1902 at the inauguration of the monument to General San Martín in Rosario. The lyrics were written by professor Carlos Benielli in 1908. The march became famous in other countries and, according to the Argentine British Community Council, it has been considered in Europe {{to be one of the}} five best military marches <b>ever</b> <b>written.</b> The military bands of Uruguay, Brazil and Poland, amongst others, include it in their musical repertory.|$|E

5|$|Patterson {{describes}} The Bridge on the Drina as {{a seminal}} work whose themes and motifs—forced labour, invasion, annexation and displacement—would appear frequently in subsequent 20th-century fiction. The town of Višegrad and its historic sites were popularized throughout Yugoslavia {{as a result}} of the novel, to which the Mehmed Paša Sokolović Bridge owes its renown. The Bridge on the Drina was widely read by Western scholars, reporters and policy makers amidst the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s, and often cited as one of the two most important texts <b>ever</b> <b>written</b> about the Balkans, the other being Rebecca West's 1941 travel book Black Lamb and Grey Falcon. The bridge was recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2007. In 2011, Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica began construction of a mock-town called Andrićgrad in the vicinity of the bridge. Andrićgrad was officially opened on 28 June 2014, the 100th anniversary of Franz Ferdinand's assassination. Kusturica intends to use it as a set for a future cinematic adaption of the novel.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Boleskine, Crowley came {{to believe}} that Mathers had begun using magic against him, and the {{relationship}} between the two broke down. On 28 July 1905, Rose gave birth to Crowley's first child, a daughter named Lilith, with Crowley writing the pornographic Snowdrops From a Curate's Garden to entertain his recuperating wife. He also founded a publishing company through which to publish his poetry, naming it the Society for the Propagation of Religious Truth in parody of the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Among its first publications were Crowley's Collected Works, edited by Ivor Back. His poetry often received strong reviews (either positive or negative), but never sold well. In an attempt to gain more publicity, he issued a reward of £100 for the best essay on his work. The winner of this was J. F. C. Fuller, a British Army officer and military historian, whose essay, The Star in the West (1907), heralded Crowley's poetry as some of the greatest <b>ever</b> <b>written.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, Cowell's student Lou Harrison {{utilized}} keyboard clusters {{in several}} {{works such as}} his Prelude for Grandpiano (1937). At least {{as far back as}} 1942, John Cage, who also studied under Cowell, began writing piano pieces with cluster chords; In the Name of the Holocaust, from December of that year, includes chromatic, diatonic, and pentatonic clusters. Olivier Messiaen's Vingt regards sur l'enfant Jésus (1944), often described as the most important solo piano piece {{of the first half of}} the twentieth century, employs clusters throughout. They would feature in numerous subsequent piano works, by a range of composers. Karlheinz Stockhausen's Klavierstück X (1961) makes bold, rhetorical use of chromatic clusters, scaled in seven degrees of width, from three to thirty-six semitones, as well as ascending and descending cluster arpeggios and cluster glissandi. Written two decades later, his Klavierstück XIII employs many of the same techniques, along with clusters that call for the pianist to sit down on the keyboard. George Crumb's Apparitions, Elegiac Songs, and Vocalises for Soprano and Amplified Piano (1979), a setting of verse by Walt Whitman, is filled with clusters, including an enormous one that introduces three of its sections. The piano part of the second movement of Joseph Schwantner's song cycle Magabunda (1983) has perhaps the single largest chord <b>ever</b> <b>written</b> for an individual instrument: all 88 notes on the keyboard.|$|E
