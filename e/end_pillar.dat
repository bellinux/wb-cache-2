40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{integration}} of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with thermal fluctuations is used to study the dynamic response of singledomain nanomagnets to rapid changes in the applied magnetic field. The simulation can resolve magnetization patterns within nanomagnets and uses the Fast Multipole method to calculate dipole-dipole interactions efficiently. The thermal fluctuations play an essential part in the reversal process whenever the applied field {{is less than the}} zero-temperature coercive field. In this situation pillar-shaped nanomagnets are found to reverse through a local curling mode that involves the formation and propagation of a domain wall. Tapering the <b>ends</b> of the <b>pillars</b> to reduce pole-avoidance effects changes the energies involved but not the fundamental process. The statistical distribution of switching times is well described by the independent nucleation and subsequent growth of regions of reversed magnetization at both <b>ends</b> of the <b>pillar.</b> Magnetic nanoparticles are important components of nanotechnology. Previously, Ising models, which describe only highly anisotropic materials, have been used to understand thermally activated switching in singledomain magnets [1]. Single-domain magnets with dimensions of only a few nanometers are being manufactured and measured, for instance, using scanning microscopy techniques [2]. We have chosen these nanomagnets as a specific system in which to investigate magnetization switching with more realistic computational models of magnetic materials. Here magnetic materials are modeled by position-dependent magnetization density vectors M(r) with fixed length Ms, that precess around the 200...|$|R

The three pillars at {{the east end of}} the chapel are named, from north to south: the Master Pillar, the Journeyman Pillar and, most famously, the Apprentice Pillar.

50|$|According to Shiv Mahapuraan, Brahma (The Creator) and Vishnu (The Preserver) {{once had}} a {{disagreement}} about which of them was supreme. To test them, Shiva pierced the three worlds as an immeasurable pillar of light, the Jyotirlinga. Vishnu and Brahma parted company {{to determine the extent}} of each <b>end</b> of the <b>pillar.</b> Brahma, who had set off upward, lied that he had discovered the upper <b>end</b> of the <b>pillar,</b> but Vishnu, who had gone in the direction of the base of the pillar, admitted that he had not. Shiva then appeared as a second Jyotirlinga and cursed Brahma, telling him that he would have no place in the ceremonies, though Vishnu would be worshipped until the 'end of eternity'. The Jyotirlinga is the supreme indivisible reality from which Shiva appears. Jyothirlinga shrines commemorate this time when Shiva appeared. It was believed that there were originally sixty-four jyothirlingas. Twelve are considered to be especially auspicious and holy. Each of the twelve sites takes the name of the presiding deity and each is considered a separate manifestation of Shiva. At all these sites, the primary deity is a lingam representing the beginning less and endless Stambha pillar, symbolizing the Shiva's infinite nature. The twelve jyothirlinga are Somnath in Gujarat, Mallikarjuna at Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh, Mahakaleswar at Ujjain in Madhya Pradesh, Omkareshwar in Madhya Pradesh, Kedarnath in Himalayas, Bhimashankar in Maharashtra, Viswanath at Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh, Triambakeshwar in Maharashtra, Vaidyanath at Deoghar in Jharkhand, Nageshvara Jyotirlinga, Rameshwar at Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu and Grishneshwar at Aurangabad in Maharashtra.|$|R

Holes were dug in the ground, the pillars placed in position, and the earth well rammed down. The length of the pillar varied according to the contour of the ground, for their upper ends must range with each other, so as to carry the superstructure; this was formed by two longitudinal beams of wood (or iron) placed side by side, with a space between them, bolted to, strutted from, {{and supported by the}} pillars.|$|R

50|$|Eventually, Mokona narrows the {{candidates}} down to two: Hikaru and the sickly Eagle Vision of Autozam, who is friends with Lantis and, as such, wishes to <b>end</b> the <b>Pillar</b> system for {{him with his}} eternal sleep. As the two undergo the test to become the new Pillar in a recreation of Tokyo, Mokona reveals itself to be the creator of Cephiro and its laws, which it had created after sadly witnessing the violence and destructive nature {{of the people on}} its earlier creation, Earth. It was responsible for bringing the three girls back to Cephiro. In the end, Hikaru becomes the new Pillar of Cephiro, and brings Eagle Vision back to Cephiro with the help of Fuu and Umi, against Mokona's insistence that only one may return. Hikaru then rebels against the Pillar system, decreeing once and for all that the fate of the planet should not be the responsibility of one person. Mokona accepts their decision and leaves with the three Mashin. The manga concludes with the three girls' return to a new Cephiro to visit their loved ones, as they work with the rulers of the other planets to solve their planets' problems, and contemplate Mokona's wish to allow the three protagonists to bring change to Cephiro.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the model-based design {{and evaluation of}} an instrument that estimates incident neutron direction using the kinematics of neutron scattering by hydrogen- 1 nuclei in an organic scintillator. The instrument design uses a single, nearly contiguous volume of organic scintillator that is internally subdivided only as necessary to create optically isolated pillars. Scintillation light emitted in a given pillar is confined to that pillar {{by a combination of}} total internal reflection and a specular reflector applied to the four sides of the pillar transverse to its long axis. The scintillation light is collected at each <b>end</b> of the <b>pillar</b> using a photodetector. In this optically segmented design, the (x, y) position of scintillation light emission (where the x and y coordinates are transverse to the long axis of the pillars) is estimated as the pillar's (x, y) position in the scintillator "block", and the z-position (the position along the pillar's long axis) is estimated from the amplitude and relative timing of the signals produced by the photodetectors at each <b>end</b> of the <b>pillar.</b> For proton recoils greater than 1 MeV, we show that the (x, y, z) -position of neutron-proton scattering can be estimated with < 1 cm root-mean-squared [RMS] error and the proton recoil energy can be estimated with < 50 keV RMS error by fitting the photodetectors' response time history to models of optical photon transport within the scintillator pillars. Finally, we evaluate several alternative designs of this proposed single-volume scatter camera made of pillars of plastic scintillator (SVSC-PiPS), studying the effect of pillar dimensions, scintillator material, and photodetector response vs. time. Specifically, we conclude that an SVSC-PiPS constructed using EJ- 204 and an MCP-PM will produce the most precise estimates of incident neutron direction and energy...|$|R
5|$|In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata, the god Shiva is {{described}} as having cast a curse on Surabhi.

It was that decided whoever found the <b>end</b> of this <b>pillar</b> was superior. Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar, but failed. So Brahma forced Surabhi (in some versions, Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances. This tale appears in the Skanda Purana.|$|R

The roof rock between the pillar, which is the working face, and the snook is modelled as an Euler-Bernoulli beam acted on at each end by a horizontal force and by its weight per unit length. The beam is clamped at the pillar and simply supported (hinged) at the snook. The dimensionless differential equation for the beam and the boundary conditions depend on one dimensionless number. We consider the range of values of before the displacement and curvature first become singular at = 1.
