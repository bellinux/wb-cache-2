Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song's composition is a [...] "chaotic dense spray of boasts over a muscular, scraping beat". Brad Stern of MTV Buzzworthy labeled the song as [...] "noisy, trap-tastic twerker" [...] that is reminiscent of Rihanna's 2012 single [...] "Birthday Cake" [...] and according to him, contains blazin' beats, brags aplenty, nasty unapologetic attitude. Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted that [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] is an aggregation off [...] "distorted" [...] synthesisers derived from Joey Beltram's 1990 record [...] "Mentasm" [...] "until it sounds weird and disorientating". The Boston Globes James Reed labeled [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] as a club banger containing a heavy bass [...] "that rumbles more in your chest instead of rattling your feet." [...] Alex Macpherson of Fact wrote that on the song [...] "Rihanna sprays declamations like machine gun fire over what could pass for a lost early ’90s Prodigy rave anthem." [...] The lyrical content of [...] "Phresh Out the Runway" [...] revolves around Rihanna explaining how if any of her crew does not respect her, then she should no longer remain with her, singing: [...] "How could you be so hood, but you're so fuckin' pop?/ <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> so fun and sound like you're selling rocks?". On the song, Rihanna sounds [...] "indignant" [...] and [...] "impressed" [...] with being herself and proclaims: [...] "Walk up in this bitch like I own the ho".|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, so I do hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you inside my head... <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> <b>be</b> so cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E
