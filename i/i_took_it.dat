500|$|In mid-1992, MC Serch, whose group 3rd Bass had dissolved, {{began working}} on a solo project and {{approached}} Nas. At the suggestion of producer T-Ray, Serch collaborated with Nas for [...] "Back to the Grill", the lead single for Serch's 1992 solo debut album Return of the Product. At the recording session for the song, Serch discovered that Nas {{did not have a}} recording contract and subsequently contacted Faith Newman, an A executive at Sony Music Entertainment. As Serch recounted, [...] "Nas was in a position where his demo had been sittin' around, 'Live at the Barbeque' was already a classic, and he was just tryin' to find a decent deal ... So when he gave me his demo, I shopped it around. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to Russell first, Russell said it sounded like G Rap, he wasn't wit' it. So <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to Faith. Faith loved it, she said she'd been looking for Nas {{for a year and a}} half. They wouldn't let me leave the office without a deal on the table." ...|$|E

500|$|A 163-minute {{version of}} the film competed in the main {{competition}} of the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. The Cannes cut lacked much of the finished film's sound design, and some visual effects were not fully in place. Noé said about the version: [...] "the film was like a baby of three months. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> out of my belly to show it, flattered by [...] Thierry Frémaux's invitation, {{but it was still}} in gestation. So I had to put it back into my belly, that is to say to tweak many details." ...|$|E

I was doodling the slime-looking character and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to Mr. Toriyama, who did the character design, and he made it the Slime we see today." [...] Horii said that when it was originally conceived, the Slime was [...] "a pile of goo", but Toriyama's design came back as a tear-drop which they considered [...] "perfect".|$|E
500|$|Before the book's publication, Heather Lauer was {{a public}} affairs {{consultant}} in Arizona. She hatched the idea {{to write a book}} about bacon after going out for cocktails with her two brothers in 2005. [...] Lauer explained to The Arizona Republic: [...] "I was out drinking with my brothers one night, and the topic of bacon came up. We had eaten bacon as kids, and bacon was a special thing on Sunday mornings. Somehow, the idea came up about how funny it would be to start a blog about bacon... <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> and ran with it." [...] She began the blog Bacon Unwrapped, at www.baconunwrapped.com, and a social networking site about bacon at baconnation.ning.com in 2005.|$|E
500|$|Henson {{received}} help editing {{the film}} from executive producer George Lucas. According to Henson, [...] "When {{we hit the}} editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After that, <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> over again and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson went on to explain, [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] {{is among}} Dylan's most celebrated compositions. In his sleeve notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991, John Bauldie writes {{that it was}} Pete Seeger who first {{identified}} the melody of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] as Dylan's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual [...] "No More Auction Block". According to Alan Lomax's The Folk Songs of North America, the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after Britain abolished slavery in 1833. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: [...] "'Blowin' in the Wind' {{has always been a}} spiritual. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> off a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' in the Wind' follows the same feeling." [...] Dylan's performance of [...] "No More Auction Block" [...] was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Kaif {{appeared}} in [...] "Chikni Chameli", an item number in Agneepath that incorporated dance {{steps from the}} Lavani genre (a Maharashtrian folk dance). The song was filmed over a ten-day period and, according to the actress, [...] "It was hard work. It was very fast {{and it was not}} a style I was used to, but <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> as a challenge". Kaif appeared next in Kabir Khan's espionage thriller Ek Tha Tiger as a Pakistani ISI agent who falls in love with an Indian RAW agent. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express wrote about her performance: [...] "Katrina is an able, animated foil to Salman, her long legs making her leaps and kicks credible". The film received predominantly positive reviews, with Aniruddha Guha of Daily News and Analysis calling it [...] "smart and stylish". With worldwide earnings of , Ek Tha Tiger was the highest-grossing Bollywood film of the year.|$|E
500|$|During {{practice}} for the 1980 Indianapolis 500, Richmond set the fastest unofficial practice speed of the month, besting even race favorite Johnny Rutherford in the vaunted Chaparral. His hopes for the pole were dashed with a crash in morning practice {{on the first day}} of qualifying. After repairs he qualified 19th for the race. He worked his way up to the top 10 during the race, led a lap, and finished ninth as he ran out of fuel at the end of the race. To the delight of the crowd, winner Rutherford gave him a ride back to the pits. He was named the 1980 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year. [...] "I busted up a few Indy cars right after that," [...] he said. [...] "Milwaukee, Mid-Ohio... at Michigan I cut one in two. I was afraid my racing career would come to a halt.

500|$|In 1962 Littleton’s first {{pieces in}} blown glass were, like his earlier works in pottery, {{functional}} forms: vases, bowls and paperweights. His breakthrough to non-functional form came in 1963 when, with no purpose in mind, he remelted and finished a glass piece {{that he had}} earlier smashed {{in a fit of}} pique. The object lay in his studio for several weeks before he decided to grind the bottom. As Littleton recounts in his book Glassblowing: A Search for Form, he brought the object into the house where [...] "it aroused such antipathy in my wife that I looked at it much more closely, finally deciding to send it to an exhibition. Its refusal there made me even more obstinate, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> to New York ... I later showed it to the curators of design at the Museum of Modern Art. They, perhaps relating it to some other neo-Dada work in the museum, purchased it for the Design Collection." [...] This led to Littleton’s mid-1960s series of broken-open forms, and [...] "Prunted," [...] "Imploded" [...] and [...] "Exploded" [...] forms.|$|E
500|$|There was one [...] "crucial {{historical}} fact" [...] Cameron {{chose to}} omit {{from the film}} – the SS Californian {{was close to the}} Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. [...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was really more about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. [...] "The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," [...] said Cameron. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, {{for the end of the}} world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained." ...|$|E
500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very dark shadow on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it</b> deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E

500|$|Upon her release, Leeds {{struggled}} to find work in Hollywood, and signed on to star in Wild Weed. [...] During publicity for the film in 1949, Leeds, who had been 20 {{at the time of}} the arrest, said that appearing in the picture would keep other people her age from trying drugs, but in 1952 she confided in Collier's that she [...] "only had one offer… which was an obvious attempt to capitalize on the Mitchum case notoriety. <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it.</b> I was broke." [...] The film gained approval from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to use the drug references, a standard practice at the time even though the Bureau had no power to censor the films. The film used its plot to push many of the beliefs of the time: that drug-using youth would turn to crime and the theory of [...] "marijuana as a gateway drug". [...] The latter was a leading argument for drug prohibition during the era, and an argument that Leeds herself made, based on her own history with marijuana and heroin.|$|E

"The Survivor" [...] is writer James Schmerer's only {{credit in}} the Star Trek franchise, whose other genre work {{consisted}} of two episodes of the television series Wonder Woman {{as well as a}} single episode of Buck Rodgers.

He pitched stories for [...] on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to [...] and not children. He {{knew it was going to}} be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said [...] "that was one of the reasons why <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>it,</b> because I'm not an animated writer... I had written a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth." [...] He explained that he wrote the script for [...] "The Survivor" [...] as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as [...] "The Chameleon".
