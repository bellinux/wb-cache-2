40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{development}} and application of a novel hydration apparatus, used to initiate water-mediated reactions in an isothermal microcalorimeter. Conventionally, the relative humidity (RH) in a sample ampoule is maintained using one of two methods; an amount of a saturated salt solution is held in a small glass tube (<b>Durham</b> <b>tube</b> or mini-hydrostat) sealed within the ampoule or a carrier gas of known RH is flowed over the sample at a constant rate. The <b>Durham</b> <b>tube</b> method is often used {{on the basis of}} simplicity and cost, but has several disadvantages; the system may be rate-limited by the small surface area available for water evaporation, the internal surfaces of the ampoule are wetted and the system cannot reach equilibrium before the reaction is initiated. In this work, we show how by switching the placement of the sample and water reservoir (sample in a sealed hydrostat and water reservoir in the ampoule) many of these drawbacks are overcome. The use of the system is demonstrated by studying the hydration of anhydrous ceftazidime. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

A <b>Durham</b> <b>tube</b> is provided to detect the production of gas. SUMMARY AND EXPLANATION Hajna and Perry developed EC Broth for improved selective detection of coliform bacteria and presumptive detection of E. coli as evidence of fecal coliforms in water, foods, shellfish, milk and other materials. 1, 2 Tennant et al. reported using EC Broth at an incubation temperature of 44. 5 °C for the estimation of E. coli densities in sea water and shellfish. 3 Fishbein and Surkiewicz compared the recovery of E. coli from frozen foods and nutmeats using EC Broth incubated at 44. 5 and 45. 5 °C. 4 The higher incubation temperature (45. 5 °C) enhanced the specificity of the test for E. coli, while the lower incubation temperature (44. 5 °C) provided a 4 % greater recovery of E. coli. EC Broth is used as part of the confirmatory test of the total coliform MPN (most probable number) procedure. 5, 6 The EC Broth is inoculated with broth from positive presumptiv...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Several {{modifications}} of the <b>Durham</b> <b>tube</b> method for detecting gas production {{have been tested}} {{with a variety of}} heterofermentative lactobacilli, some of which had been described in the literature as failing to produce gas from glucose by this method. Gas production in Durham tubes was detected consistently when the surface of a tomato juice broth medium containing 0. 5 yo or 2. 5 94 (wlv) glucose was sealed with liquid paraffin or with washed agar, but less consistently when the surface of the medium was unsealed. A minority of the strains examined grew weakly in a peptone+yeast extract medium containing glucose and produced very little titratable acidity or detectable gas. These produced large quantities of gas in the same medium when maltose replaced glucose. Several methods may be used to differentiate between heterofermentative and homofermentative lactic acid bacteria. Analysis of the acid end products produced during the fermentation of hexoses shows that the former, including the genus Leuconostoc and some species of LactobaciZZus, produce characteristic proportions of lactic and acetic acids, whereas the homofermentative species produce mainly lactic acid (Pederson, 1952). However, these two types may, for the most part, be differentiated by the production of gas from the fermenta-tion of carbohydrates, which is confined to the heterofermentative organisms. This method, although simple in application, depends upon the reliability of the methods used for the detection of such gas (Davis, 1 9 5 5 ~). Many quantitative and qualitative methods of detecting gas production by lactic acid bacteria have been described (Gibson & * 4 bd-el-Malek, 1945); qualitative tests have been carried out in liquid, solid or semi-solid media. The results of tests in liquid medium by the conventional <b>Durham</b> <b>tube</b> method, which is adequate for detecting gas production by Gram-negative bacteria, have led to erroneous conclusions. For example, Strilfors (1950) concluded that there were no gas-producing lactobacilli in the mouth, a conclusion at variance with the observations of Rogosa, Wiseman, Mitchell, Disraely &...|$|E
50|$|<b>Durham</b> <b>tubes</b> {{are used}} in {{microbiology}} to detect production of gas by microorganisms. They are simply smaller test tubes inserted upside down in another test tube. This small tube is initially filled with the solution in which the microorganism is to be grown. If gas is produced after inoculation and incubation, a visible gas bubble will be trapped inside the small tube. The initial air gap produced when the tube is inserted upside down is lost during sterilization, usually performed at 121 °C for 15 or so minutes. The method was first reported in 1898 by British microbiologist Herbert Durham.|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Out of a {{total of}} 457 {{cultures}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae conserved in the Industrial Yeasts Collection DBVPG and screened for their ability to ferment glucose at supra optimal temperatures, 43 strains were able to form gas in <b>Durham</b> <b>tubes</b> at 41 °C, 13 at 42 °C and one at 43 °C. Fermentation tests carried out on these 57 yeasts selected nine isolates characterized by ethanol yields of about 50 % from 150 g/l of glucose, relatively high cell viability, and fermentation rates comparable to those of the wine industry. A pre-liminary scaling-up test carried out using a bench-top fermentor showed that the best per-forming S. cerevisiae strain (DBVPG 1849) was able to meet the minimum commercial tar-get set at 8 % (vol/vol) ethanol from 14 - 15 % (wt/vol) glucose at 40 °C...|$|R

40|$|Three {{hundred and}} seven colonies {{believed}} to be enteric pathogens were selected from primary plates of MacConkey, xylose desoxycholate, or salmonella-shigella agar for inoculation to lactose-sucrose broth, urea- 41 motility medium, modified Andrade glucose broth with inverted <b>Durham</b> <b>tube,</b> pregrowth broth, triple sugar iron agar, lysine iron agar (LIA), and Christensen urea agar. The rapid screen consisted of interpreting the lactose-sucrose, urea- 41 motility, and modified Andrade glucose broth gas reactions after 4 to 6 h at 35 °C. These rapid screening biochemicals plus LIA were incubated for 24 h if further interpretation was required. Reference biochemicals (triple sugar iron, LIA, and Christensen urea agars) were interpreted at 24 h. Of 307 isolates, 49 (16 %) were reported as negative for enteric pathogens after 4 to 6 h because their biochemical profiles were not compatible with those for enteric pathogens. A total of 87 (28. 3 %) isolates produced biochemical profiles at 4 to 6 h that were presumptive for enteric pathogens. The 87 presumptive pathogens were inoculated into the AutoMicrobic system Gram-Negative General Susceptibility Card and the AutoMicrobic system Enterobacteriaceae-Plus Biochemical Card (AMS-EBC+) after 4 to 6 h of growth in pregrowth broth. Of these isolates, 63 were confirmed to be enteric pathogens, of which 61 (96. 8 %) were correctly identified by the AMS-EBC+. One isolate was identified as Shigella dysenteriae by AMS-EBC+ but confirmed as Shigella flexneri biotype 6 by a reference laboratory.

40|$|SUMMARY: In the {{classification}} of yeasts it is customary to use an infusion of bakers’ yeast as the basal medium for fermentation tests. This extract frequently contains variable amounts of trehalose. A number of yeasts were observed to ferment yeast ex-tract and trehalose. The fermentationof yeast extract is serious from a taxonomic point of view, since it gives the impression of positive fermentation of a sugar which actually may not be fermentable. Dilute yeast autolysate should {{be used as the}} basal fermenta-tion medium since during autolysis trehalose is destroyed. The fermentation of yeast extract (without added sugar) is easily observed in <b>Durham</b> <b>tubes</b> by the collection of gas in the inserts, but when Einhorn fermentation tubes are used gas production is seldom apparent. One culture (N- 18) isolated from spoiled apricots, and identified as Candida tropicalis showed adaptive trehalose fermentation. The ability of various yeasts to ferment trehalose was investigated, using 133 cultures, representing twenty genera and seventyTthree species.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{wild-type}} yeast {{that could}} ferment D-xylose was {{isolated from the}} abdominal content of Nasutitermes sp. collected in the Central Amazon rainforest using sugarcane bagasse hemicellulosic hydrolyzate (SBHH) as selective medium. The yeast was identified as Meyerozyma guilliermondii. Its ability to ferment D-xylose was assessed using liquid medium containing <b>Durham</b> <b>tubes.</b> A fermentometer assay showed a low ethanol yield using D-xylose as the carbon source. Cell viability after heat shock and ethanol shock was 39. 8 % and 56. 0 %, respectively. Cultivation in SBHH (pH = 5. 0) showed its capability to perform saccharification of this substrate, increasing total reducing sugar concentration to 42. 6 %. The log phase was observed between 36 and 108 hours of cultivation with a highest specific growth rate (µMAX) of 0. 10 h- 1. After 120 hours, 79. 5 % of total reducing sugar was consumed giving a biomass yield of 0. 52 g/g. The final pH of SBHH (7. 6) showed that M. guilliermondii was able to neutralize the acids of this substrate. These results agree with some predictions in the early eighties, which stated that investigations about microbial content of termite guts would provide new tools for bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass to fuels and other added-value chemicals. This work is the first report for this species associated with termites in the Amazonian habitat...|$|R
40|$|The {{recombinant}} xylose-utilizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae TMB 3399 {{was constructed}} by chromosomal {{integration of the}} genes encoding D-xylose reductase (XR), xylitol dehydrogenase (XDH), and xylulokinase (XK). S. cerevisiae TMB 3399 was subjected to chemical mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate and, after enrichment, 33 mutants were selected for improved growth on D-xylose and carbon dioxide formation in <b>Durham</b> <b>tubes.</b> The best-performing mutant was called S. cerevisiae TMB 3400. The novel, recombinant S. cerevisiae strains were compared with Pichia stipitis CBS 6054 through cultivation under aerobic, oxygen-limited, and anaerobic conditions in a defined mineral medium using only D-xylose as carbon and energy source. The mutation led to a more than five-fold increase in maximum specific growth rate, from 0. 0255 h- 1 for S. cerevisiae TMB 3399 to 0. 14 h- 1 for S. cerevisiae TMB 3400, whereas P. stipitis grew at a maximum specific growth rate of 0. 44 h- 1. All yeast strains formed ethanol only under oxygen-limited and anaerobic conditions. The ethanol yields and maximum specific ethanol productivities during oxygen limitation were 0. 21, 0. 25, and 0. 30 g ethanol g xylose- 1 and 0. 001, 0. 10, and 0. 16 g ethanol g biomass- 1 h- 1 for S. cerevisiae TMB 3399, TMB 3400, and P. stipitis CBS 6054, respectively. The xylitol yield under oxygen-limited and anaerobic conditions was two-fold higher for S. cerevisiae TMB 3399 than for TMB 3400, but the glycerol yield was higher for TMB 3400. The specific activity, in U mg protein- 1, was higher for XDH than for XR in both S. cerevisiae TMB 3399 and TMB 3400, while P. stipitis CBS 6054 showed the opposite relation. S. cerevisiae TMB 3400 displayed higher specific XR, XDH and XK activities than TMB 3399. Hence, we have demonstrated {{that a combination of}} metabolic engineering and random mutagenesis was successful to generate a superior, xylose-utilizing S. cerevisiae, and uncovered distinctive physiological properties of the mutant. © 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
