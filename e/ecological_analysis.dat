5|$|In Europe, {{a cohort}} study of 467,450 Danish {{children}} found no association between TCVs and autism or autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), nor any dose-response relationship between thiomersal and ASDs {{that would be}} suggestive of toxic exposure. An <b>ecological</b> <b>analysis</b> that studied 956 Danish children diagnosed with autism likewise did not show an association between autism and thiomersal. A retrospective cohort study on 109,863 children in the United Kingdom found no association between TCVs and autism, but a possible increased risk for tics. Analysis in this study also showed a possible protective effect with respect to general developmental disorders, attention-deficit disorder, and otherwise unspecified developmental delay. Another UK study based on a prospective cohort of 13,617 children likewise found more associated benefits than risks from thiomersal exposure with respect to developmental disorders. Because the Danish and UK studies involved only diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) or diphtheria-tetanus (DT) vaccines, they are less relevant for the higher thiomersal exposure levels {{that occurred in the}} U.S.|$|E

2500|$|The Arctic wolf {{was first}} {{described}} as a distinct subspecies by British zoologist R. I. Pocock in 1935, after having examined a single skull from Melville Island. , the Arctic wolf is still recognized as a distinct subspecies by Mammal Species of the World (MSW3). However, studies undertaken on Arctic wolf autosomal microsatellite DNA and Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data indicate that the Arctic wolf has no unique haplotypes, thus indicating that its colonization of the Arctic Archipelago from the North American mainland was relatively recent, and thus not sufficient to warrant subspecies status. However, the research of Chambers et al. (2012) that dismissed the Arctic wolf's genetic integrity became controversial, forcing the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to commission a peer review of it, known as the National Center for <b>Ecological</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Synthesis (NCEAS) (2014). This peer review highlighted numerous flaws in the research such as the erroneous merging of the coastal British Columbia island wolves with the inland Canis lupus nubilus as well as suggesting that gray wolves never lived in the eastern third of the US, and thus concluded unanimously that the Chambers' review [...] "is not accepted as consensus scientific opinion or best available science." ...|$|E
2500|$|Most {{mathematical}} {{studies in}} ecology {{in the nineteenth}} century assumed a uniform distribution of living organisms in their habitat. In the past quarter century, ecologists have begun to recognize the degree to which organisms respond to spatial patterns in their environment. Due to the rapid advances in computer technology in the same time period, more advanced methods of statistical data analysis have come into use. Also, the repeated use of remotely sensed imagery and geographic information systems in a particular area has led to increased analysis and identification of spatial patterns over time. [...] These technologies have also increased the ability to determine how human activities have impacted animal habitat and climate change. The natural world has become increasingly fragmented due to human activities; anthropogenic landscape change has had a ripple-effect impacts on wildlife populations, which are now more likely to be small, restricted in distribution, and increasingly isolated from one another. In part as a reaction to this knowledge, and partially due to increasingly sophisticated theoretical developments, ecologists began stressing the importance of spatial context in research. Spatial ecology emerged from this movement toward spatial accountability; [...] "the progressive introduction of spatial variation and complexity into <b>ecological</b> <b>analysis,</b> including changes in spatial patterns over time".|$|E

The construction of quantitative food webs and their analysis by means of <b>Ecological</b> Network <b>Analysis</b> provides outputs {{that have been used}} in many studies to assess system development, stress, robustness, resilience and maturity. Here we attempt to relate to the physical characteristics of the environment, ecosystem indices derived from <b>Ecological</b> Network <b>Analysis.</b> Ten models of food webs were gathered, across a selection of soft-bottom estuaries representative of a large morphological and hydrodynamic diversity, from wave-dominated to mixed energy tide-dominated systems. The selection allowed the comparison of their derived <b>Ecological</b> Network <b>Analysis</b> indices, because of similarities of accuracy in the representation of detritus and bacteria, and because models took into account all trophic levels up to top-predators. In order to obtain comparable physical characteristics, global models were used for a homogeneous description of tide and tidal prisms. Spearman correlations, hierarchical ascendant clustering and Redundancy Analysis were applied {{to examine the relationship between}} <b>Ecological</b> Network <b>Analysis</b> indices and physical characteristics. The set of four physical variables selected (catchment area, tidal range at neap tide, index of tide-wave domination and latitude in absolute value) explained 67 % of the structure of the <b>Ecological</b> Network <b>Analysis</b> indices. This implies that the physical forcing related to climate, hydrodynamics and morphology is essential for determining the ecological emergent properties of the food web.

40|$|In this paper, we use data {{gathered}} from the Sylt-Romo Bight Ecosystem in Germany to conduct an <b>ecological</b> network <b>analysis.</b> Specifically, we perform Network Environ Analysis to compare with result already published using EcoPath, which incorporates the <b>ecological</b> network <b>analysis</b> package NETWRK. We focus {{on the issue of}} model aggregation in that the Sylt-Romo Bight Ecosystem has data sets representing nine subsystems. We find that the network properties total system throughflow, cycling, indirect effects ratio, and path proliferation are not affected by aggregation whereas connectivity, homogenization, and synergism are affected. The most interesting result to emerge from this analysis is that careful attention is needed to the different use of total system throughflow and total system throughput (both of which are called TST in the literature). As a result of this difference, the calculations for the Finn Cycling Index differ between the various <b>ecological</b> network <b>analysis</b> packages. Noting that Finn based his index on the total system throughflow approach, a consistent method should be adopted if the metrics are reported as FCI. Further work is needed to determine if a simple correction factor {{can be applied to the}} NETWRK and EcoPath values or if the coding algorithms should be changed to reflect the FCI approach...|$|R
