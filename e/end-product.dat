5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an <b>end-product</b> of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess whether formula-fed infants had increased skin advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> compared with breastfed ones. We also evaluated the effect of maternal smoke during pregnancy and lactation on infant skin advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> accumulation. Methods: Advanced glycation end-product–linked skin autofluorescence was measured in 101 infants. Results: In infants born from non-smoking mothers, advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> were higher in formula-fed subjects than in breastfed subjects (0. 80 (0. 65 – 0. 90) vs 1. 00 (0. 85 – 1. 05), p[*]<[*] 0. 001). Advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> in breastfed infants from smoking mothers were higher than in those from non-smoking mothers (0. 80 (0. 65 – 0. 90) vs 1. 00 (0. 90 – 1. 17), p[*]=[*] 0. 009). Conclusion: Formula-fed infants had increased amounts of advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> compared with the breastfed ones, confirming that breast milk represents the best food for infants. Breastfed infants from mothers smoking during pregnancy and lactation had increased skin advanced glycation <b>end-products,</b> suggesting that smoke-related advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> transfer throughout breast milk. Moreover, advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> may already increase during gestation, possibly affecting fetal development. Thus, we reinforced that smoking must be stopped during pregnancy and lactation...|$|R

5|$|Bilins are found, for example, in Micrommata virescens, {{resulting}} in its green color. Guanine {{is responsible for}} the white markings of the European garden spider Araneus diadematus. It is in many species accumulated in specialized cells called guanocytes. In genera such as Tetragnatha, Leucauge, Argyrodes or Theridiosoma, guanine creates their silvery appearance. While guanine is originally an <b>end-product</b> of protein metabolism, its excretion can be blocked in spiders, leading to an increase in its storage. Structural colors occur in some species, which are the result of the diffraction, scattering or interference of light, for example by modified setae or scales. The white prosoma of Argiope results from hairs reflecting the light, Lycosa and Josa both have areas of modified cuticle that act as light reflectors.|$|E

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} is a metabolic disease, {{which results}} in microvascular and macrovascular complications in later stages. It has been known that with elevated glucose concentrations, proteins in both the circulation and the tissues are non-enzymatically glycated and this results {{in the production of}} advanced glycation <b>end-products.</b> Advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> alter cell structure and function which lead to the synthesis and release of cytokines and growth factors. Therefore, advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> contribute to the microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of advanced glycation was found to reduce diabetic complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy and neuropathy. Some of the agents that are used for the treatment of advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> formation and accumulation are summarized in this review.

40|$|Introduction High {{mobility}} group box 1 is {{a versatile}} protein involved in gene transcription, extracellular signaling, {{and response to}} inflammation. Extracellularly, high mobility group box 1 binds to several receptors, notably the receptor for advanced glycation <b>end-products.</b> Expression of high mobility group box 1 and the receptor for advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> has been described in many cancers. Objectives To systematically review the available literature using PubMed and Web of Science to evaluate the clinical value of high mobility group box 1 and the receptor for advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Data synthesis A total of eleven studies were included in this review. High mobility group box 1 overexpression is associated with poor prognosis and many clinical and pathological characteristics of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas patients. Additionally, the receptor for advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> demonstrates potential value as a clinical indicator of tumor angiogenesis and advanced staging. In diagnosis, high mobility group box 1 demonstrates low sensitivity. Conclusion High mobility group box 1 and the receptor for advanced glycation <b>end-products</b> are associated with clinical and pathological characteristics of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.

25|$|Two {{molecules}} of dALA are then combined by porphobilinogen synthase to give porphobilinogen (PBG), which contains a pyrrole ring. Four PBGs are then combined through deamination into hydroxymethyl bilane (HMB), which is hydrolysed {{to form the}} circular tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen III. This molecule undergoes a number of further modifications. Intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances, but, in humans, the main <b>end-product</b> protoporphyrin IX is combined with iron to form heme. Bile pigments are the breakdown products of heme.|$|E
25|$|Mescaline is {{produced}} when products of natural mammalian catecholamine-based neuronal signalling such as dopamine and serotonin {{are subjected to}} additional metabolism via methylation, and mescaline's hallucinogenic properties stem from its structural similarities with these two neurotransmitters. In plants, this compound may be the <b>end-product</b> of a pathway utilizing catecholamines {{as a method of}} stress response, similar to how animals may release compounds such as cortisol when stressed. The in vivo function of catecholamines has not been investigated, but they may function as antioxidants, as developmental signals, and as integral cell wall components that resist degradation from pathogens. The deactivation of catecholamines via methylation produces alkaloids such as mescaline.|$|E
25|$|Cortisone is one {{of several}} end-products of a process called steroidogenesis. This process starts with the {{synthesis}} of cholesterol, which then proceeds through a series of modifications in the adrenal gland (suprarenal) to become any one of many steroid hormones. One <b>end-product</b> of this pathway is cortisol. For cortisol to be released from the adrenal gland, a cascade of signaling occurs. Corticotropin-releasing hormone released from the hypothalamus stimulates corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary to release ACTH, which relays the signal to the adrenal cortex. Here, the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis, in response to ACTH, secrete glucocorticoids, in particular cortisol. In the peripheral tissues, cortisol is converted to cortisone by the enzyme 11-beta-steroid dehydrogenase.|$|E

Perfection in these products was judged by more experienced craftspeople and was attained by repeated attempts interspersed with feedback. The perfected final products were kept as a special reminder and never used. Their production was seen as a necessary first step in “clearing the way” for other products to come; an indication of mastery for that skill set. Throughout several research articles, it becomes clear that many of the Native Hawaiian ways of learning resemble the defining characteristics of LOPI, which is common in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.|$|E
