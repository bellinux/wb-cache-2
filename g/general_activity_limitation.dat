Methods: Medline, Scopus, and OvidSP databases were searched using defined search terms to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were published in English between January 2000 and April 2012 and calculated the indirect burden of COPD in a US population in terms of prevalence, incidence or costs of productivity loss, disability, morbidity, or mortality. Results: Of 53 studies identified, eleven met eligibility criteria, with data years spanning 1987 – 2009. Estimates of workforce participation range from 56 % to 69 % among individuals with COPD and from 65 % to 77 % among individuals without COPD. Approximately 13 %– 18 % of those with COPD are limited in the amount or type of work they can do and one-third or more experience <b>general</b> <b>activity</b> <b>limitation.</b> Estimates of restricted activity days range from 27 – 63 days per year. Estimates of mean annual sick leave and/or disability days among employed individuals with COPD range from 1. 3 – 19. 4 days. Estimates of bed confinement range from 13 – 32 days per year. Estimated mean annual indirect costs were $ 893 –$ 2, 234 /person (US dollars) with COPD ($ 1, 521 –$ 3, 348 in 2010 [US dollars]) and varied with the population studied, specific cost outcomes, and economic inputs. In studies that assessed total (direct and indirect) costs, indirect costs accounted for 27 %– 61 % of total costs, depending on the population studied. Conclusions: COPD is associated with substantial indirect costs. The disease places a burden on employers in terms of lost productivity and associated costs and on individuals in terms of lost income related to absenteeism, activity limitation, and disability. Consideration of indirect as well as direct costs is necessary to gain a more complete view of the societal burden of COPD.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} both specially-designed and commonly used instruments for measuring impairments, activity limitation and health-related quality of life (overall Sickness Impact Profile (SIP)). The focus was on shoulder and upper extremity. The relationships between concepts according to the International Classification of Impairments, Activity limitation and Participation (ICIDH) were studied. The instruments studied were also used in an evaluation of physiotherapeutic shoulder exercises. Ninety patients with mild or moderate RA {{were included in the}} studies. The results showed low clinical reliability and large day-to-day variations when measuring active motion range in the shoulder. A dynamic muscle function test for the shoulder also showed large day-to-day variations. A functional shoulder-arm movement impairment instrument showed satisfactory reliability though day-to-day variations. It correlated significantly (r= 0. 42 - 0. 68) to pain during shoulder-arm movement, passive shoulder (except passive adduction) and elbow extension motion ranges, and active wrist motion range, isometric shoulder rotational muscle strength, a part of a specially-constructed shoulder-arm activity limitation questionnaire (SDQ), the Health Assessment Questionnaire, parts of the Functional Status Questionnaire, and the physical dimension and overall SIP. The shoulder-arm movement impairment instrument indicated construct and content validity and the SDQ indicated construct validity. The single variables as number of swollen joints in the upper extremity, passive shoulder (except adduction) and elbow motion range, isometric and isokinetic (concentric internal rotation) shoulder rotational strength did not indicate activity limitation or the overall SIP. However, the variables pain (including Ritchie index for upper-body half and shoulder tendalgia), shoulder-arm movement, passive shoulder adduction, and active elbow supination and wrist motion, and shoulder isokinetic eccentric internal rotational strength range did. In combining the variables, shoulder-arm movement, pain during movement and isokinetic eccentric shoulder internal rotation strength explained a rather large proportion (61. 4 %) of the SDQ 1, covering predominantly personal hygiene activities. Still, the shoulder and upper-extremity variables indicated activity limitation and overall SIP to a rather small extent (11. 330. 2 %). Static and dynamic shoulder rotator endurance training in a group of women (n= 37) were compared in a randomised study and measurements were taken at start, after 10 weeks training, and after a further 10 weeks. After the training both groups had fewer swollen joints (p= 0. 02) and less pain during movements (p= 0. 04) and during dynamic (p< 0. 002) and static (p= 0. 02) muscle function test of shoulder. The dynamic exercising group also improved according to the physical dimension (p= 0. 004) and overall SIP (p< 0. 002). The results of the studies showed that movement, pain and muscle strength are related to activity limitation and overall SIP but to a rather small extent although shoulder-arm activity limitation, disease-specific and more <b>general</b> <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> and health-related quality of life questionnaires were used in the analysis. Threshold levels, the severity of the disease, motivational, emotional and coping factors and impairments in other joints not studied in this thesis might explain the part of variation that our variables did not explain. Thus, it seems that all levels in the ICIDH-model have to be measured if all consequences of the disease are to be understood...|$|E

Multivariate logistic regressions reveal substantial variation in the health outcomes of Latinos by immigrant status, national origin, and measure of health. Furthermore, patterns of health disparities vary by gender. For some groups, disadvantages in health are explained by group differences in socioeconomic resources. For other groups, disadvantage persists despite control for socioeconomic, demographic and geographic factors.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess {{health-related}} quality of life in polio survivors (PS) compared with that in the general population in Korea. Polio survivors (n = 120) from outpatient clinics at two hospitals, healthy controls (HC, n = 121) and members of the <b>general</b> population with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> (AL, n = 121) recruited through a proportional-allocation, systematic sampling strategy from the Fourth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were surveyed with self-rated health-related quality of life (Euro QoL five-dimensions). The proportion of participants who reported problems in mobility, usual activity, and symptoms of anxiety/depression were higher in the PS group compared with the HC and AL groups. There was no significant difference in the self-care dimension across the groups. Polio-specific questionnaire, pain, depression, fatigue, Modified Barthel Index (K-MBI) and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) were assessed in the PS group. Those with post-poliomyelitis syndrome had greater problems in mobility, usual activity, and depression/anxiety. Polio survivors, especially those with more pain and fatigue symptoms, and those who did not have access to medical services had poorer health-related quality of life. These findings afford useful information for potential intervention improving quality of life in polio survivors...|$|R
40|$|Background: Disability {{and chronic}} {{conditions}} both {{have an impact}} on health expenditures and although they are conceptually related, they present different dimensions of ill-health. Recent concepts of disability combine a biological understanding of impairment with the social dimension of <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> and resulted {{in the development of the}} Global <b>Activity</b> <b>Limitation</b> Indicator (GALI). This paper reports on the predictive value of the GALI on health care expenditures in relation to the presence of chronic conditions. Methods: Data from the Belgian Health Interview Survey 2008 were linked with data from the compulsory national health insurance (n = 7, 286). The effect of <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> on health care expenditures was assessed via cost ratios from multivariate linear regression models. To study the factors contributing to the difference in health expenditure between persons with and without <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method was used. Results: <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> are a strong determinant of health care expenditures. People with severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> (5. 1 %) accounted for 16. 9 % of the total health expenditure, whereas those without <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> (79. 0 %), were responsible for 51. 5 % of the total health expenditure. These observed differences in health care expenditures can to some extent be explained by chronic conditions, but <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> also contribute substantially to higher health care expenditures in the absence of chronic conditions (cost ratio 2. 46; 95 % CI 1. 74 - 3. 48 for moderate and 4. 45; 95 % CI 2. 47 - 8. 02 for severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations).</b> The association between <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> and health care expenditures is stronger for reimbursed health care costs than for out-of-pocket payments. Conclusion: In the absence of chronic conditions, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> appear to be an important determinant of health care expenditures. To make projections on health care expenditures, routine data on <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> are essential and complementary to data on chronic conditions...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> {{before and}} after carpal tunnel release among patients with and without diabetes, to explore differences between genders {{and the influence of}} grip strength on <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. PATIENTS: Thirty-three patients with diabetes and carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were age and gender matched with 30 patients without diabetes having idiopathic CTS. METHODS: <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were assessed pre-operatively, 3 and 12 months after surgery, with the self-administered Evaluation of Daily Activities Questionnaire (EDAQ) containing 102 activity items in 11 dimensions and 3 additional male-activity-oriented dimensions including 22 items. RESULTS: For all dimensions the mean score was higher for patients with diabetes compared with patients without diabetes. This indicates a more pronounced <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> for patients with diabetes. However, no statistical {{differences between the two groups}} could be demonstrated. In general, females have significantly higher <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> scores than males. CONCLUSION: CTS creates a broad variety of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> for affected patients. After carpal tunnel release a significant alleviation of these limitations occurs within the first 3 months. <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> seem not to be related to diabetes, but were more pronounced in women than in men, probably due to reduced grip strength...|$|R

The aim {{of the present study was}} to identify homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with early symptomatic knee OA and to describe characteristics of these subgroups. Methods Follow-up data over a period of 5 years of 697 participants with early symptomatic knee OA from the Cohort Hip and Cohort Knee (CHECK) were used. <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were measured yearly with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index. Latent class growth analyses identified homogeneous subgroups with distinct trajectories of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Multivariable regression analyses examined differences in characteristics between the subgroups. Results Three subgroups were identified. Participants in Subgroup 1 (?egood outcome?f; n= 330) developed or displayed slight <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> over time. Participants in Subgroup 2 (?emoderate outcome?f; n= 257) developed or displayed moderate <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> over time.

40|$|Background: Body-mass index (BMI) and {{depressed}} mood are both {{positively associated with}} pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in knee osteoarthritis (OA), and are interrelated. The aims {{of the present study}} were: 1) to assess whether BMI {{and depressed}} mood are independently associated with knee pain and activity limitations; and 2) to compare the relative contributions of BMI and depressed mood to knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Methods. A cross-sectional study in 294 patients with clinical knee OA. Regression analyses were performed with knee pain or <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> (self-reported and performance-based) as dependent variables, and BMI and depressed mood as independent variables. All analyses were adjusted for age, gender, marital status, education level, radiographic OA and comorbidity. Dominance analyses were performed to examine the relative contributions of BMI and depressed mood to knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Results: BMI and depressed mood were positively and independently associated with knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> BMI and depressed mood explained small parts (3. 0 % and 2. 3 %, respectively) of variance in knee pain. BMI explained a substantial part of variance in both self-reported (9. 8 %) and performance-based (20. 4 %) <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> while depressed mood explained a small part of variance (3. 1 % in self-reported and 2. 6 % in performance-based <b>activity</b> <b>limitations).</b> Conclusions: In patients with knee OA both BMI and depressed mood seem to be independently associated with knee pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> The contribution of BMI to <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> is most substantial, thereby offering a relevant target for interventions. © 2013 Holla et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{patients}} {{diagnosed with}} Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome Hypermobility Type (EDS-HT) {{are characterized by}} pain, proprioceptive inacuity, muscle weakness, potentially leading to <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> In EDS-HT, a direct relationship between muscle strength, proprioception and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> has never been studied. The objective {{of the study was}} to establish the association between muscle strength and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and the impact of proprioception on this association in EDS-HT patients. Methods: Twenty-four EDS-HT patients were compared with 24 controls. <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were quantified by Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Six-Minute Walk test (6 MWT) and 30 -s chair-rise test (30 CRT). Muscle strength was quantified by handheld dynamometry. Proprioception was quantified by movement detection paradigm. In analyses, the association between muscle strength and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> was controlled for proprioception and confounders. Results: Muscle strength was associated with 30 CRT (r = 0. 67, p = < 0. 001), 6 MWT (r = 0. 58, p = < 0. 001) and HAQ (r = 0. 63, p = < 0. 001). Proprioception was associated with 30 CRT (r = 0. 55, p < 0. 001), 6 MWT (r = 0. 40, p = < 0. 05) and HAQ (r = 0. 46, p < 0. 05). Muscle strength was found to be associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> however, proprioceptive inacuity confounded this association. Conclusions: Muscle strength is associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in EDS-HT patients. Joint proprioception is of influence on this association and should be considered in the development of new treatment strategies for patients with EDS-HT. Implications for rehabilitation : Reducing <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> by enhancing muscle strength is frequently applied in the treatment of EDS-HT patients. Although evidence regarding treatment efficacy is scarce, the current paper confirms the rationality that muscle strength is an important factor in the occurrence of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in EDS-HT patients. Although muscle strength is the most dominant factor that is associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> this association is confounded by proprioception. In contrast to common belief proprioception was not directly associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> but confounded this association. Controlling muscle strength on the bases of proprioceptive input may be more important for reducing <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> than just enhancing sheer muscle strength...|$|R
40|$|Patients with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) have impaired physical function {{which can lead}} to difficulties with daily activities. Despite improved pharmacological treatment, patients with early RA report difficulties with activities involving the shoulder. There is limited knowledge of the shoulder function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand among patients with early RA. The overall aim of this thesis was to investigate shoulder function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand, and the relationship between shoulder function, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and work ability in patients with early RA. A methodological study evaluated the reliability and validity for the Disability of the Shoulder,Arm and Hand (DASH) questionnaire which assess <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand. A controlled cross-sectional study and a crosssectional study investigated shoulder function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand and the relationship between shoulder function, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and work ability in patients with early RA. A randomized-controlled study evaluted moderately intensive pool exercise for patients with RA. Main findings. DASH was found to possess satisfactory reliability and validity to assess <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with early RA. The shoulder function was found to be impaired, in particular the shoulder muscle strength which was 65 % of the muscle strength in the reference group. The majority of the patients reported some <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder,arm and hand when compared with the reference group. Impaired work ability is common among patients with early RA and associated with impaired shoulder function, mechanical exposure and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand. Moderately intensive pool exercise improved muscle function in the upper and lower extremites, active range of motion of the shoulder, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and well-being in patients with RA, while the aerobic capacity did not improve. Long-term follow-up showed also improved physical and mental quality of life. Conclusion. Screening and monitoring of shoulder function from disease onset is warranted as the shoulder function is impaired, in particular the shoulder muscle strength. The majority of the patients with early RA report <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand. DASH can be used to monitor the progress of the upper extremity function and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with RA. Work ability in early RA is associated with shoulder function, mechanical exposure and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> related to the shoulder, arm and hand.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine which questionnaire, the Roland Morris disability questionnaire (RMDQ) or the patient-specific functional scale (PSFS), was better at detecting change in <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> in a large cohort of patients with low back pain undergoing rehabilitation. A secondary aim was to determine if the responsiveness of the questionnaires was influenced by the patient’s level of <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> at baseline. Responsiveness statistics, including effect size statistics, Pearson’s r correlations and receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to determine ability to detect change in <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> on 831 patients with low back pain. Data were analysed at two time points; directly after treatment (termed short-term) and several weeks post-treatment (termed mid-term). The data were subsequently re-analysed on sub-sets of the full cohort according to the level of <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> from RMDQ baseline scores. In the total cohort we found that the PSFS was more responsive than the RMDQ; however, in the subgroup with high <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> this pattern was not observed.

40|$|Background Pain-related {{avoidance}} of activities is hypothesized {{to lead to}} lower muscle strength and thereby <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Negative affect (e. g., low vitality, depression) is thought to strengthen the tendency to avoid activities. Purpose The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the validity of this "avoidance model" in patients with early symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods Cross-sectional data (n= 151) were used. The associations between pain, negative affect, avoidance, muscle strength, and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were modeled using structural equation modeling. Results Pain and negative affect were associated with lower muscle strength via avoidance (mediation by avoidance). Avoidance was associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> via lower muscle strength (mediation by muscle strength). There were also direct associations between pain, negative affect, avoidance, muscle strength, and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> Conclusions The results support the validity of the avoidance model, which explains the associations between pain, negative affect, avoidance, muscle strength, and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with early symptomatic knee OA. © The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2012...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} {{and nature of}} the relationships between motor impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> assessed by the ACTIVLIM questionnaire were investigated in 245 patients with neuromuscular disorders. Measures of motor impairments consisted of (1) a grip strength test using a Jamar dynamometer, (2) a manual muscle testing bilaterally performed in eighteen muscle groups and (3) a gait speed spontaneously adopted by the patients using the 10 -meter timed walking test. <b>Activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were poorly correlated with grip strength in both hands (r= 0. 3 and 0. 36) and moderately correlated with gait speed (r= 0. 53). The Spearman's coefficients of correlation between the manual muscle testing and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were moderate to very poor (rho= 0. 5 to 0. 17). The relationships between motor impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> are not so straightforward in patients with neuromuscular disorders, indicating that the <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> should be separately assessed and cannot be simply inferred from motor impairment measures...|$|R
40|$|Life expectancies at older ages {{continue}} to increase in most developed countries. But how these additonal years will be divided between those with and without severe question is important {{for a variety of}} issues including the ability of people to continue working in the labor market at ever older ages and forecasting the growth of health care expenditures. We use the harmonized data on severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> from the Survey of Income and Living Conditons (SILC) and predicted life tables from the United Nations to produce forecasts of demographic quatities that take the prevalence of severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> into account. For developed countres, we provide forecasts of (1) age-specific proportions of remaining lifetimes at age 65 spent without severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> (2) the proportions of populations 60 + years old with severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> and (3) a new dependency ratio called the Genuine Adult Dependency Ratio (GADR) that takes severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> into account. We show that, on average, life expectancies without severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> at age 65 in high income OECD countries are likely to increase by around 2. 7 years between 2005 - 2010 and 2045 - 2050. Proportions of 60 + populations with severe <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> are likely to be only marginally higher in 2045 - 2050 than in 2005 - 2010. We also show that the speed of increase of the Genuine Adult Dependency Ratio is around one-fifth as fast as the conventional old age dependency ratio...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Hypermobility {{syndrome}} (HMS) {{is diagnosed}} when generalized joint laxity (GJL) {{is associated with}} musculoskeletal pain. 1 <b>Activity</b> <b>limitation</b> {{has been found in}} children with HMS. 2 The relationships between pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitation,</b> and GJL have not been well reported. This study investigated these issues in children with HMS. Methods: Twenty-nine children with HMS aged 8 - 15 years participated in this investigation. Following ethical approval,informed written consent was obtained from the participants and their parents/guardians. GJL was assessed using the Beighton score. 3 Average pain (the more painful knee) was measured with a Colored Analogue Scale. Functional range of movement during walking was examined as a measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> using a VICON camera system (Oxford Metrics, England). Spearman Rho correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between pain, GJL, and <b>activity</b> <b>limitation.</b> Results: No correlation was found between pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> (r range = - 0. 048 to - 0. 308; all P > 0. 05). No relationship was observed between pain and Beington scores (r = - 0. 096; P > 0. 05). Conclusions: There was no relationship between pain and <b>activity</b> <b>limitation,</b> and between pain and GJL in children with HMS. For effective management of HMS, <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> should also be examined as an important outcome. A high Beighton score for diagnosing HMS may be inappropriate as some children with low scores could also present with pain and may be missed out during assessment.

40|$|Objectives. Data {{from the}} Netherlands {{indicate}} a recent increase in prevalence of chronic diseases and a stable prevalence of disability, suggesting that diseases have become less disabling. We studied {{the association between}} chronic diseases and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in the Netherlands from 1990 to 2008. Methods. Five surveys among noninstitutionalized persons aged 55 to 84 years (n= 54847) obtained self-reported data on chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, stroke, lung disease, joint disease, back problems, and cancer) and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] long-term disability questionnaire or 36 - item Short Form Health Survey [SF- 36]). Results. Prevalence rates of chronic diseases increased over time, whereas prevalence rates of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were stable (OECD) or slightly decreased (SF- 36). Associations between chronic diseases and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were also stable (OECD) or slightly decreased (SF- 36). Surveys varied widely with regard to disease and limitation prevalence rates and the associations between them. Conclusions. The hypothesis that diseases became less disabling from 1990 to 2008 was only supported by results based on <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> data as assessed with the SF- 36.

40|$|QuestionWhat predicts short- and {{medium-term}} <b>activity</b> <b>limitation</b> {{in people}} after ankle fracture?DesignInception cohort observational study. ParticipantsAdults with ankle fracture recruited within days following cast removal from physiotherapy departments of teaching hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Outcome measuresThe predictive value of variables that were injury-related (fracture management, fracture severity, {{angle of the}} ankle during cast immobilisation, and time from cast removal to baseline) and performance-related (<b>activity</b> <b>limitation,</b> pain, mobility, and dorsiflexion range of motion measured soon after cast removal) were examined in one dataset (n = 150) using univariate linear regression. Significant variables (p ≤ 0. 20) were further examined with a multivariate linear model. A clinical prediction rule was derived then validated using data from an independent dataset (n = 94). ResultsFracture management, fracture severity, baseline <b>activity</b> <b>limitation,</b> pain, mobility, and dorsiflexion had significant but weak univariate associations with <b>activity</b> <b>limitation.</b> Only pain and dorsiflexion range of motion contributed independently to the clinical prediction rule. When applied to the validation data, the rule explained 12 % of the short-term and 9 % of the medium-term variance in <b>activity</b> <b>limitation.</b> ConclusionPerformance-related variables were stronger predictors than injury-related variables. A clinical prediction rule consisting of pain and dorsiflexion range of motion explained {{a small amount of}} the variance in short- and medium-term <b>activity</b> <b>limitation,</b> suggesting that it may be appropriate to identify people with high levels of pain and restricted dorsiflexion after ankle fracture and target intervention accordingly...|$|R
40|$|Assessment in {{patients}} with NMD consists principally of measures of motor impairment since they are well known by clinicians and their measures do not require much equipment. The conventional treatments {{in patients}} with NMD are above-all focused on the diminution of motor impairments by maintaining or improving joint mobility, muscle strength and endurance. Nevertheless, a reduction of motor impairments does not directly lead to a higher ability in performing daily <b>activities.</b> Therefore, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> should be measured specifically. A new scale of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> was first developed in children and adults with NMD. The use of the Rasch model provided a scale to assess the fundamental psychometric qualities. Secondly, relationships between motor impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were investigated to verify the assumption that reduced motor impairments do not necessarily lead to higher activity levels. Finally, to complete the investigation of psychometric qualities, a longitudinal study of the developed questionnaire was carried out to evaluate its sensitivity to change. Chapter 1 presents the development of ACTIVLIM, a Rasch-built measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and its validation in children and adults with NMD. ACTIVLIM is a self-reported questionnaire that assesses the difficulties adult patients and parents of affected children perceive when they or their children perform daily activities. This questionnaire originally included 126 daily activities and was submitted to 369 patients. The Rasch model selected 22 daily activities to define a linear and unidimensional measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> {{in patients with}} NMD. The validity and the reproducibility of the results were also studied. A second section of Chapter 1 demonstrates why the measure of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in children with NMD as assessed using the ACTIVLIM questionnaire {{is based upon the}} perception of their parents. A third section of Chapter 1 compares the difficulties self-perceived by the patients with the difficulties observed by external examiners. The agreement between both measures is very good, indicating that the use of ACTIVLIM as a self-reporting questionnaire is a valid method to assess <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in patients with NMD. Chapter 2 investigates the relationships between motor impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> as measured with the ACTIVLIM questionnaire. As the anatomical basis and pathophysiology are different from one NMD to another, the relationships between impairments and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> were investigated in six main diagnostic groups and in the whole sample without diagnostic distinction. Gait speed and muscle weakness in proximal and flexor muscle groups were significantly but moderately correlated to the <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> indicating that the latter cannot simply be inferred from motor impairments but should be independently measured and treated. 	 Chapter 3 investigates the sensitivity to change of the ACTIVLIM questionnaire. As NMD are progressive disorders, {{it is important that the}} ACTIVLIM questionnaire be able to assess the change over time in the activity level of patients with NMD in order to characterize the disease course and to quantify the effects of new treatments on <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> in these patients. Finally, the last section discusses the results of the different chapters and presents perspectives for future research. (READ 3) [...] UCL, 200...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This study {{compared}} {{activity levels}} of adolescents with chronic pain and healthy adolescents, and investigated relations between actigraphy and subjective measures of <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and depression. Methods Forty adolescents (n 20 with chronic pain, n 20 otherwise healthy; 12 – 17 years; 72. 5 % females) participated. Adolescents completed questionnaires regarding pain, <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> and depression. <b>Activity</b> levels were assessed for 7 days using the Actiwatch 64 device, yielding mean and peak activity levels, and {{time spent in}} moderate and sedentary activity. Results Physical activity was lower in adolescents with chronic pain than in healthy peers. Adolescents with chronic pain reported {{significantly higher levels of}} <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> and depression. Age and gender were related to activity.

40|$|The {{avoidance}} {{model in}} patients with knee and hip osteoarthritis (OA) hypothesizes that pain and psychological distress lead to avoidance of activities, and thereby to muscle weakness and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> This paper systematically reviews the scientific evidence for the validity of this avoidance model. A qualitative data synthesis was used to identify levels of evidence. Sixty studies were included. In knee OA, strong evidence was found that avoidance of activities is associated with <b>activity</b> <b>limitations</b> via muscle weakness (mediation by muscle weakness), strong evidence was found for an association between muscle weakness and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations,</b> and weak evidence was found that pain and psychological distress are associated with muscle weakness via avoidance of activities (mediation by avoidance). In hip OA, weak evidence was found for mediation by muscle weakness; and strong evidence was found for an association between muscle weakness and <b>activity</b> <b>limitations.</b> More research is needed on the consecutive associations between pain or psychological distress, avoidance of activities and muscle weakness, and to confirm causal relationships...|$|R
