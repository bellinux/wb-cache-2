40|$|In 1975, the ‘Fallow {{experiments}} in Baden-Württemberg’ {{were set up}} by K. -F.

The focus of this study is two-fold: First, different management treatments should be compared in their proportion of CSR-strategies (Nature 250 (1974) 26). Second, LHS-strategies (Plant Soil 199 (1998) 213) are applied to test if the treatment effects may also be predicted with three easily measurable traits. CSR- as well as LHS-strategies were found to differ predominantly between the study sites. Significant differences between the management treatments could be identified when the effect of habitat properties was removed arithmetically. Through CSR-strategies the treatments grazing, mulching twice a year, mulching every second year and succession could be distinguished.

40|$|What is {{unmanaged}} motorized recreation? Recreation visitors {{expect a}} great deal from their national forests and other public lands in terms of settings, experiences, facilities and services. The challenge for recreation managers is to address the needs and conflicting expectations of millions of people who use and enjoy national forests while protecting the health and integrity of the land. Recreation is the fastest growing use of the national forests and grasslands; other federal, state, and private lands are also experiencing increased recreation use. Increased pressure from growing populations, coupled with advances in recreation technology, will continue to challenge public land management agencies, state and local governments, and private landowners. While the focus of this threat is on national forests and <b>grasslands,</b> <b>management</b> decisions must take into account the impacts of unmanaged recreation on adjacent private and public lands.

40|$|A {{field study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the influence of a short-term (2 year) cessation of fertiliser applications, liming, and sheep-grazing on microbial biomass and activity in a reseeded upland grassland soil. The cessation of fertiliser applications (N and NPK) on a limed and grazed grassland had no effect on microbial biomass measurements, enzyme activities, or respiration. Withholding fertiliser and lime from a grazed grassland resulted in significant reductions in both microbial biomass C (P< 0. 05) and dehydrogenase activity (P< 0. 05) by approximately 18 and 21 %, respectively. The removal of fertiliser applications, liming, and grazing resulted in even greater reductions in microbial biomass C (44 %, P< 0. 001) and dehydrogenase activity (31 %, P< 0. 001), and significant reductions in microbial biomass N (P< 0. 005), urease activity (P< 0. 05), phosphatase activity (P< 0. 001), and basal respiration (P< 0. 05). The abundance of culturable bacteria and fungi and the soil ATP content were unaffected by changes in <b>grassland</b> <b>managements.</b> With the cessation of liming soil pH fell from 5. 4 to 4. 7, and the removal of grazing resulted in a further reduction to pH 4. 5.

40|$|International audiencePatchy landscapes {{driven by}} human {{decisions}} and/or natural forces {{are still a}} challenge to be understood and modelled. No attempt has been made up to now to describe them by a coherent framework and to formalize landscape changing rules. Overcoming this lacuna was our first objective here, and this was largely based {{on the notion of}} Rewriting Systems, also called Formal Grammars. We used complicated scenarios of agricultural dynamics to model landscapes and to write their corresponding driving rule equations. Our second objective was to illustrate the relevance of this landscape language concept for landscape modelling through various <b>grassland</b> <b>managements,</b> with the final aim to assess their respective impacts on biological conservation. For this purpose, we made the assumptions that a higher grassland appearance frequency and higher land cover connectivity are favourable to species conservation. Ecological results revealed that dairy and beef livestock production systems are more favourable to wild species than is hog farming, although in different ways. Methodological results allowed us to efficiently model and formalize these landscape dynamics. This study demonstrates the applicability of the Rewriting System framework to the modelling of agricultural landscapes and, hopefully, to other patchy landscapes. The newly defined grammar is able to explain changes that are neither necessarily local nor Markovian, and opens a way to analytical modelling of landscape dynamics...|$|R
