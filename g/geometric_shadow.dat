A generalization of the halfplane problem is the wedge problem, solvable as a boundary value problem in cylindrical coordinates. The solution in cylindrical coordinates was then extended to the optical regime by Joseph B. Keller, who introduced the notion of diffraction coefficients through his geometrical theory of diffraction (GTD). Pathak and Kouyoumjian extended the (singular) Keller coefficients via the uniform theory of diffraction (UTD).|$|E

The final orthoimage can be evaluated in terms of geometric quality paying attention to several kinds of common artifacts.

Similar previous algorithms on GPUs focus on <b>geometric</b> <b>shadows</b> and lose many important benefits of the original concept. We focus on shadows for interactive direct volume rendering, where shadow algorithms currently either compute additional per-voxel shadow data, or employ half-angle slicing to generate shadows during rendering. We adapt the original concept of deep shadow maps to volume ray-casting on GPUs, and show that it can provide anti-aliased high-quality shadows at interactive rates. Ray-casting is used for both generation of the shadow map data structure and actual rendering. High frequencies in the visibility function are captured by a pre-computed lookup table for piecewise linear segments. Direct volume rendering is performed with an additional deep shadow map lookup for each sample. Overall, we achieve interactive high-quality volume ray-casting with accurate shadows. To conclude, we briefly describe how semi-transparent geometry such as hair could be integrated as well, provided that rasterization can write to arbitrary locations in a texture.

Qualitative assessment of the shadow detection results indicates pixel level accuracy, which is indirectly validated by shadow restoration improvements when sub-pixel shadow detection is used in lieu of single pixel detection. The inclusion of TLS intensity in existing shadow restoration algorithms that use regions of matching material in sun and shade exposures was found to have a marginal positive influence on restoring shadow spectrum shape, while a proposed combination of TLS intensity with passive HSI spectra boosts restored shadow spectrum magnitude precision by 40 % and band correlation with respect to a truth image by 45 % compared to existing restoration methods...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the time {{evolution of a}} wave packet representing a quantum particle moving in a geometrically open billiard that consists {{of a number of}} fixed hard-disk or hard-sphere scatterers. Using the technique of multiple collision expansions we provide a first-principle analytical calculation of the time-dependent autocorrelation function for the wave packet in the high-energy diffraction regime, in which the particle's de Broglie wave length, while being small compared {{to the size of the}} scatterers, is large enough to prevent the formation of <b>geometric</b> <b>shadow</b> over distances of the order of the particle's free flight path. The hard-disk or hard-sphere scattering system must be sufficiently dilute in order for this high-energy diffraction regime to be achievable. Apart from the overall exponential decay, the autocorrelation function exhibits a generally complicated sequence of relatively strong peaks corresponding to partial revivals of the wave packet. Both the exponential decay (or escape) rate and the revival peak structure are predominantly determined by the underlying classical dynamics. A relation between the escape rate, and the Lyapunov exponents and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of the counterpart classical system, previously known for hard-disk billiards, is strengthened by generalization to three spatial dimensions. The results of the quantum mechanical calculation of the time-dependent autocorrelation function agree with predictions of the semiclassical periodic orbit theory. Comment: 24 pages, 13 figure...|$|E
40|$|Deep {{acoustic}} shadow-zone arrivals {{were first}} observed on horizontal, bottom-mounted receiving arrays in the North Pacific Ocean {{in the late}} 1990 s. These receptions revealed significant acoustic energy penetrating an estimated 500 - 1000 m into <b>geometric</b> <b>shadow</b> zones below cusps (caustics) of predicted timefronts, much more than predicted by diffraction theory. Two vertical line array receivers deployed in close proximity in the North Pacific {{as part of the}} SPICEX experiment, together virtually spanning the water column, show the vertical structure of the shadow- zone arrivals for transmissions from broadband 250 -Hz acoustic sources moored at the sound channel axis (750 m) and slightly above the surface conjugate depth (3000 m) at ranges of 500 and 1000 km. Chapter II compares a daily average of acoustic timefronts with parabolic equation simulations based on a sound-speed profile measured nearly concurrently with the acoustic data acquisition. Simulations incorporating a range-independent sound-speed profile confirmed the presence of deep shadow-zone arrivals. Receptions from off-axis sources also revealed acoustic energy scattering back up toward the axis {{at the end of the}} timefront, referred to as axial shadow-zone arrivals. Simulations incorporating sound-speed fluctuations consistent with the Garrett-Munk internal- wave energy spectrum at full strength accurately predict the vertical extent of and energy contained in both axial and deep shadow-zone arrivals. Chapter III extends the analysis to include acoustic receptions from June to November 2004. Incoherent monthly averages of acoustic timefronts indicate that lower cusps associated with acoustic rays with shallow upper turning points (UTPs), where sound-speed structure is most variable and seasonally dependent, deepen from June to October as the summer thermocline develops. Surface-reflected rays, or those with near-surface UTPs, exhibit less scattering due to internal waves than in later months, when the UTP deepens. Data collected in November exhibits dramatically more vertical extension than previous months. The depth to which the timefronts extend as the seasons change is a complex combination of deterministic changes in the depths of the lower cusps as the range-average profiles evolve and of the amount of scattering, which depends on the depths of the UTPs and the mean vertical gradients at those depth...|$|E

Physicality of the vector potential expressed in the source adhering gauge will thus be unequivocally proved. 1 An unconventional testable claim De Broglie has tersely stated [1] that his [2] universal formula P i ≡ µU i − eA i = �k i relating the canonical 4 -momentum P i of a point charge of charge −e, rest mass µ, 4 -velocity U i, to the 4 -frequency ki of the associated wave, selects uniquely the electromagnetic gauge. The point is: In absence of external electromagnetic sources, adding to the 4 -potential A i an arbitrary 4 -gradient would entail indefiniteness of the 4 -frequency-a cardiac arythmy of the electron, so to speak. This is not observed-and is denied by crystal diffraction unequivocally displaying (in standard notation) the formula (1) p ≡ mv = �k (2) What then of gauge invariance of the Dirac equation? Adding to the canonical 4 -momentum operator i�∂i − eAi an arbitrary 4 -gradient can be compensated by substracting this same 4 -gradient from the wave function’s phase.

40|$|Purpose: One of {{the major}} issues in high {{intensity}} focused ultrasound ablation of abdominal lesions is obstruction of the ultrasound beam by the thoracic cage. Beam shaping strategies have been shown by several authors to increase focal point intensity while limiting rib exposure. However, as rib obstruction leaves {{only part of the}} aperture available for energy transmission, conserving total emitted acoustic power, the intensity in the near-field tissues inherently increases after beam shaping. Despite of effective rib sparing, those tissues are therefore subjected to increased risk of thermal damage. In this study, for a number of clinically representative intercostal sonication geometries, modeling clinically available hardware, the effect of beam shaping on both the exposure of the ribs and near-field to acoustic energy was evaluated and the implications for the volumetric ablation rate were addressed. Methods: A relationship between rib temperature rise and acoustic energy density was established by means of in vivo MR thermometry and simulations of the incident acoustic energy for the corresponding anatomies. This relationship was used for interpretation of rib exposure in subsequent numerical simulations in which rib spacing, focal point placement, and the focal point trajectory were varied. The time required to heat a targeted region to 65 degrees C was determined without and with the application of beam shaping. The required sonication time was used to calculate the acoustic energy density at the fat-muscle interface and at the surface of the ribs. At the fat-muscle interface, exposure was compared to available literature data and rib exposure was interpreted based on the earlier obtained relation between measured temperature rise and simulated acoustic energy density. To estimate the volumetric ablation rate, the cool-down time between periods of energy exposure was estimated using a time-averaged power limit of 100 kJ/h. Results: At the level of the ribs, the temperature rise-energy density proportionality constant was estimated to be 6. 0 - 7. 6 degrees C/(J/mm(2)). Beam shaping by the <b>geometric</b> <b>shadow</b> method typically reduces the acoustic intensity a factor of 2, considering the 1 cm(2) with the highest exposure. For a 4 mm diameter circular sonication trajectory, the near-field energy limit of 2. 5 J/mm(2) was exceeded for all considered geometries. The estimated rib temperature was in all but one (sonication 50 mm behind the ribs, with 15 mm rib spacing and a 4 mm diameter circular sonication trajectory) of the considered scenarios within acceptable limits. For those sonication scenarios where a single sonication is considered safe both in terms of near-field as well as rib heating, volumetric ablation rates in the order of 1 ml/h are estimated. Conclusions: Intercostal sonication is associated with an increased risk of near-field overheating. This risk is strongly dependent on the considered rib spacing, the placement of the focus behind the ribs, and the selected sonication trajectory. For the hardware under simulation, obstruction by the thoracic cage renders ablations of clinically relevant volumes within a practical time-frame unfeasible in {{a large part of the}} liver. Improvements maybe expected from transducer designs with a larger active surface and/or nonlinear sonication strategies. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine...|$|E

To further enhance film roughness, the substrate may be mounted at a steep angle with respect to the flux to achieve <b>geometric</b> <b>shadowing,</b> where incoming line of sight flux lands onto only higher parts of the developing film. This method is known as glancing-angle deposition (GLAD) or oblique-angle deposition (OAD).|$|R
40|$|The United States and Russia {{have agreed}} to jointly develop a solar dynamic (SD) system for flight {{demonstration}} on the Russian MIR space station starting in late 1997. Two important components of this SD system are the solar concentrator and heat receiver provided by Russia and the U. S., respectively. This paper describes optical analysis of the concentrator and solar flux predictions on target receiver surfaces. The optical analysis is performed using the code CIRCE 2. These analyses account for finite sun size with limb darkening, concentrator surface slope and position errors, concentrator petal thermal deformation, gaps between petals, and the shading effect of the receiver support struts. The receiver spatial flux distributions are then combined with concentrator <b>shadowing</b> predictions. <b>Geometric</b> <b>shadowing</b> patterns are traced from the concentrator to the target receiver surfaces. These patterns vary with time depending on the chosen MIR flight attitude and orbital mechanics of the MIR spacecraft. The resulting predictions provide spatial and temporal receiver flux distributions for any specified mission profile. The impact these flux distributions have on receiver design {{and control of the}} Brayton engine are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The {{substrate}} {{on which}} the film deposition takes place is ultrasonically cleaned and fastened to the substrate holder. The substrate holder {{is attached to the}} manipulator shaft. The manipulator shaft moves translationally to adjust the distance between the ingot source and the substrate. The shaft also rotates the substrate at a particular speed so that the film is uniformly deposited on the substrate. A negative bias DC voltage of 200-400 V {{can be applied to the}} substrate. Often, focused high-energy electrons from one of the electron guns or infrared light from heater lamps is used to preheat the substrate. Heating of the substrate allows increased adatom-substrate and adatom-film diffusion by giving the adatoms sufficient energy to overcome kinetic barriers. If a rough film, such as metallic nanorods, is desired substrate cooling with water or liquid nitrogen may be employed to reduce diffusion lifetime, positively bolstering surface kinetic barriers.
