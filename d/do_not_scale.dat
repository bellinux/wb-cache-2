5|$|Computer systems {{make use}} of caches—small and fast {{memories}} located close to the processor which store temporary copies of memory values (nearby in both the physical and logical sense). Parallel computer systems have difficulties with caches that may store the same value {{in more than one}} location, with the possibility of incorrect program execution. These computers require a cache coherency system, which keeps track of cached values and strategically purges them, thus ensuring correct program execution. Bus snooping {{is one of the most}} common methods for keeping track of which values are being accessed (and thus should be purged). Designing large, high-performance cache coherence systems is a very difficult problem in computer architecture. As a result, shared memory computer architectures <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>scale</b> as well as distributed memory systems do.|$|E

2500|$|The size of {{a diamond}} {{may also be a}} factor. Very small (< 0.02 carats [...] ) diamonds—known as melée—are usually given {{simplified}} cuts (i.e., with fewer facets). This is because a full-cut brilliant of such small size would appear milky to the human eye, owing to its inability to resolve the stone's dispersive fire. Conversely, very large diamonds are usually given fancy cuts with many extra facets. Conventional round brilliant or fancy cuts <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>scale</b> up satisfactorily, so the extra facets are needed to ensure there are no [...] "dead spots". Because large diamonds {{are less likely to be}} set in jewelry, their cuts are considered for how well they display the diamonds' properties from a wide range of viewing directions; in the case of more moderate-sized diamonds, the cuts are considered primarily for their face-up appeal.|$|E
60|$|We could, at length, {{realize the}} place {{mountains}} occupy on the land, {{and how they}} come into the general scheme of the universe. When first we climb their summits and observe their lesser irregularities, we do not give credit to the comprehensive intelligence which shaped them; but when afterward we behold their outlines in the horizon, we confess that the hand which moulded their opposite slopes, making one to balance the other, worked round a deep centre, and was privy to the plan of the universe. So is the least part of nature in its bearings referred to all space. These lesser mountain ranges, {{as well as the}} Alleghanies, run from northeast to southwest, and parallel with these mountain streams are the more fluent rivers, answering to {{the general direction of the}} coast, the bank of the great ocean stream itself. Even the clouds, with their thin bars, fall into the same direction by preference, and such even is the course of the prevailing winds, and the migration of men and birds. A mountain-chain determines many things for the statesman and philosopher. The improvements of civilization rather creep along its sides than cross its summit. How often is it a barrier to prejudice and fanaticism? In passing over these heights of land, through their thin atmosphere, the follies of the plain are refined and purified; and as many species of plants <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>scale</b> their summits, so many species of folly no doubt do not cross the Alleghanies; it is only the hardy mountain plant that creeps quite over the ridge, and descends into the valley beyond.|$|E
