60|$|Again, {{trade is}} a social act. Whoever {{undertakes}} to sell any <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> to the public, does what affects the interest of other persons, and of society in general; and thus his conduct, in principle, comes within the jurisdiction of society: accordingly, it was once held to be the duty of governments, in all cases which were considered of importance, to fix prices, and regulate the processes of manufacture. But it is now recognised, though not till after a long struggle, that both the cheapness and the good quality of commodities are most effectually provided for by leaving the producers and sellers perfectly free, under the sole check of equal freedom to the buyers for supplying themselves elsewhere. This is the so-called doctrine of Free Trade, which rests on grounds different from, though equally solid with, the principle of individual liberty asserted in this Essay. Restrictions on trade, or on production for purposes of trade, are indeed restraints; and all restraint, quâ restraint, is an evil: but the restraints in question affect only that part of conduct which society is competent to restrain, and are wrong solely {{because they do not}} really produce the results which it is desired to produce by them. As the principle of individual liberty is not involved in the doctrine of Free Trade, so neither is it in most of the questions which arise respecting the limits of that doctrine: as for example, what amount of public control is admissible for the prevention of fraud by adulteration; how far sanitary precautions, or arrangements to protect work-people employed in dangerous occupations, should be enforced on employers. Such questions involve considerations of liberty, only in so far as leaving people to themselves is always better, cæteris paribus, than controlling them: but that they may be legitimately controlled for these ends, is in principle undeniable. On the other hand, there are questions relating to interference with trade, which are essentially questions of liberty; such as the Maine Law, already touched upon; the prohibition of the importation of opium into China; the restriction of the sale of poisons; all cases, in short, where the object of the interference is to make it impossible or difficult to obtain a particular commodity. These interferences are objectionable, not as infringements on the liberty of the producer or seller, but on that of the buyer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Current eCommerce {{is still}} mainly {{characterized}} by the trading of commodity goods. Many industries offer complex compositions of goods based on customers ’ specifications. This is facilitated by a component-based <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> supported {{by a variety of}} product classification schemes, e. g., UNSPSC and eCl@ss. These focus on physical goods – wrongly referred to as products – rather than on services. Services are intangible products, for instance insurances, transportation, network connectivity, events hosting, entertainment or energy supply. Due to major differences between goods and services, product classification schemes cannot support automated service scenarios, such as a customer who wishes to define and buy a set of independent services, possibly supplied by multiple suppliers, via one website. To enable such eCommerce scenarios for services, a service ontology is required that supports a component-based structure of services. Defining a set of services is then reduced to a configuration task, as studied in the knowledge management literature. In this paper we use a case study from the Norwegian energy sector to describe how a component-based ontological description of services facilitates the automated design of a set of services, a so called service bundle. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel {{knowledge-based}} approach for automated electronic barter trade systems. An e-barter {{is basically a}} closed e-marketplace, where agents may exchange (buy/sell) goods –or equivalent trade dollars – only with other participants to the e-barter. Obviously, in such systems {{one of the major}} issues is keeping exchanges as balanced as possible. If the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> or services to be exchanged is simple and limited to a well defined set, e. g., oil, wheat, transport, etc., then an exchange based only on price and quantity is enough. But, what if goods or services to be exchanged are described in a complex way? Is it a suitable exchange the one involving mobile phones supporting video streaming with a QWERTY keyboard if the agent is looking for smart phones? Those two descriptions, although very different form a syntactic point of view, are very similar with respect to their meaning (semantics). How could an agent manage and exploit the knowledge on a given domain to deal with such a semantic information and optimize exchanges? We focus on how to find most promising matches, in a many-to-many matchmaking process, between bids (supplies/demands), taking into account not only the price and quantities as in classical barter trade systems, but also a semantic similarity among bid descriptions while keeping exchanges balanced. To this aim we use a logical language to express agent preferences, thereby enhancing bid expressiveness. We also define a logic-based utility function that allows to evaluate the semantic similarity between bids. Finally we illustrate the optimization problem we solve in order to clear the market. ...|$|E
