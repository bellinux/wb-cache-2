5|$|Often, DVT {{begins in}} the valves of veins. The blood <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> in the valves can cause low oxygen {{concentrations}} in the blood (hypoxemia) of a valve sinus. Hypoxemia, which is worsened by venous stasis, activates pathways—ones that include hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1. Hypoxemia also results {{in the production of}} reactive oxygen species, which can activate these pathways, as well as nuclear factor-κB, which regulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1 transcription. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 and early-growth-response protein 1 contribute to monocyte association with endothelial proteins, such as P-selectin, prompting monocytes to release tissue factor-filled microvesicles, which presumably begin clotting after binding to the endothelial surface.|$|E

Business process models are implicitly composed of a set of control <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> such as the Parallel Split, Synchronization, Exclusive Choice, and Simple Merge, etc. Several studies have proposed the concepts and definitions of control <b>flow</b> <b>patterns.</b> But, few analyzed the structure of process models to identify the constituent control <b>flow</b> <b>patterns.</b> This research proposes a three-phased framework to recognize the constituent control <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> and their interrelationship for a Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) process model.

5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of its vast oceanic expanse.|$|E
5|$|On September1, the Venezuelan tanker Acosta relayed an SOS signal while {{near the}} {{hurricane}} 200mi (320km) {{southeast of the}} Frying Pan Shoals. United States Coast Guard stations in Norfolk, Virginia and Morehead City, North Carolina dispatched cutters to aid the ship. Off of the East Coast, {{an offshoot of the}} hurricane resulted in the drownings of two people. In the Mid-Atlantic states, the passing hurricane's outflow interacted with a cold front that had become quasi-stationary over the area. The cyclone's <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> enhanced the moisture environment over the region, resulting in locally heavy rainfall, particularly in New Jersey, where precipitation peaked at 24in (610mm) in Ewan in a nine-hour period on September1. This would make the hurricane the wettest tropical cyclone in state history. Most of the rain was in western portions of the state, however, with minimal rainfall at the coast. The floods caused small rivers to overflow, breaching dams. An overflowed creek inundated parts of Lumberton Township, rendering 2,000people homeless. Rail service between Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and areas of southern New Jersey was suspended as a result of washed out tracks. Resulting damage to infrastructure totaled $4,000,000in the southwestern quarter of New Jersey alone. Damage to roads in Burlington County amounted to $2,500,000. In Camden County, damage was estimated at $1million. Four fatalities were reported {{as a result of the}} floods. In Delaware, rainfall was comparatively less. However, rough seas generated by the hurricane offshore caused $50,000 in damages and one death. Further north, strong gusts were reported across New England. Winds of 60 mph (95 km/h) were recorded by a weather station in Nantucket. Peak winds in Massachusetts were estimated at 65 mph (100 km/h). In Eastport, Maine, winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) were reported.|$|E

It is found that different <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> in ascending pipe have large relations {{with the performance of}} bubble pump. In this paper, effects of <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> of two-phase <b>flow</b> on lifting capacity are analyzed in two-stage bubble pump with lithium bromide solution. Different <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> of two-phase <b>flows</b> in ascending pipe are observed by high-speed camera. Velocities of the liquid-phase in different <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> in vertical pipe with lithium bromide solution are measured. The gas production of the system and the lifting capacity of bubble pump under different <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> are obtained by calculation. The changes of concentration of working fluid in different <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> are also calculated. The main <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> observed include bubble flow, slug flow, churn flow and annular flow at different concentrations of lithium bromide solution. The comparison of different concentrations of lithium bromide shows a tendency that the corresponding velocity for the same pattern with low concentration solution is little greater than that with high concentration.

Early on September4, analysis showed that the system had developed a well-defined low-level circulation center. At 0000UTC the following day, the JTWC upgraded the low-pressure area to tropical depression intensity, while the storm system was situated roughly 1,300km (800mi) east of Manila in the Philippines.

25|$|The high {{latitude}} magnetosphere {{is filled}} with plasma as the solar wind passes the Earth. The flow of plasma into the magnetosphere increases with additional turbulence, density and speed in the solar wind.

The <b>flow</b> <b>pattern</b> of magnetospheric plasma is mainly from the magnetotail toward the Earth, around the Earth {{and back into the}} solar wind through the magnetopause on the day-side. In addition to moving perpendicular to the Earth's magnetic field, some magnetospheric plasma travels down along the Earth's magnetic field lines, gains additional energy and loses it to the atmosphere in the auroral zones. The cusps of the magnetosphere, separating geomagnetic field lines that close through the Earth from those that close remotely allow a small amount of solar wind to directly reach the top of the atmosphere, producing an auroral glow.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{vertical}} slot fishway {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used fish passage facilities in Germany. The flow conditions within fishway play an important role in the establishment of ecological connectivity, because they determine whether fish can pass, with regard of their given swimming performance. Earlier studies have shown that two different types of <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> separated by a transition area, may develop in the pools depending on the width-to-length (B/L) ratio of the pools and the slope of the fishway. In order to gain insight in the formation of different <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> an extensive study of different geometric parameters was performed, with a total of 60 different designs. Different pool geometries and slopes were installed in a physical model at Theodor-Rehbock-Laboratory of the Institute for Water and River Basin Management (IWG) in Karlsruhe. <b>Flow</b> <b>patterns</b> were recorded photo-optically by long time exposure, water depths were measured with an ultrasonic distance sensor and flow velocities by ADV. The measurements were analysed to obtain quantitative information about <b>flow</b> <b>patterns,</b> velocities, energy budget of the pools, relationship between discharge and flow depth and water level difference between adjacent pools. Unlike in previous studies, not only the B/L ratio but the entire pool geometry was varied in accordance to the German guidelines. Small slope ranges between 2. 8 and 5 %, typical for Federal German waterways, were studied for the first time. Both <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> could be observed under identical B/L and slope. The results show that parameters apart from the B/L ratio and slope are essential for determining the formation of <b>flow</b> <b>patterns.</b> Especially the variation of the slot angle had a large influence on the <b>flow</b> <b>patterns.</b> The <b>flow</b> velocity measurements show differences between the two <b>flow</b> <b>patterns</b> in terms of position and magnitude of maximum velocities in the pools...|$|R
