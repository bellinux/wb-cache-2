5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes {{of uranium}} {{are estimated to}} be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E

5|$|Before modern whaling {{began in}} the late 19th century, blue whales were obscure and very poorly understood.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to determine the infection status of anisakid larvae in marine fish collected <b>from</b> 3 <b>sea</b> areas of the Republic of Korea.

Among the total of 349 fish examined, 213 (61. 0 %) were infected with 8 species of anisakid larvae, i. e., Anisakis simplex, 6 types of Contracaecum spp., and Raphidascaris sp., and the mean larval density was 13. 8 per infected fish. Anisakid larvae were detected in 45 fish (52. 3 %) <b>from</b> the East <b>Sea,</b> 131 fish (76. 6 %) <b>from</b> the South <b>Sea,</b> and 37 fish (40. 2 %) <b>from</b> the Yellow <b>Sea.</b> The average numbers of larvae detected were 4. 0, 16. 6, and 15. 9, respectively. Anisakis simplex larvae were detected in 149 fish (42. 7 %), and the mean larval density was 9. 0 per infected fish. They were found in 26 fish (30. 2 %) collected <b>from</b> the East <b>Sea,</b> 96 fish (56. 1 %) <b>from</b> the South <b>Sea,</b> and 27 fish (29. 3 %) <b>from</b> the Yellow <b>Sea.</b> The average numbers of larvae detected were 2. 9, 10. 3, and 10. 5, respectively. Conclusively, the present study suggests that the infection rate and density of anisakid larvae {{are more or less}} higher in the fish <b>from</b> the South <b>Sea</b> than those <b>from</b> the East <b>Sea</b> or the Yellow Sea...|$|R

5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its technological advances in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E

5|$|Quarrels between Denmark and Sweden {{led to the}} Northern Seven Years' War in 1563, {{which ended}} in 1570 with the Treaty of Stettin.

When Danish-held Varberg surrendered to Swedish forces in 1565, 150 Danish mercenaries escaped the subsequent massacre of the garrison by defecting to Sweden. Among them was Pontus de la Gardie, who thereafter became an important Swedish commander in the Livonian War. Livonia was also affected by the naval campaign of Danish admiral Peter or Per Munck, who bombarded Swedish Reval <b>from</b> <b>sea</b> in July 1569.|$|E
5|$|The Fiji parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} Fiji, {{where it is}} found on the four largest islands (Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, Taveuni and Kadavu) {{and also in the}} smaller western islands of the Mamanuca and the Yasawa groups.

It appears to be less common on Taveuni than the larger islands. It has adapted well to man-made habitats, and is seen in grasslands, pasture, rice paddies, parks and gardens. Many parrotfinch species are mainly forest birds, but American ornithologist Jared Diamond has suggested that in the central Pacific, where there are no seed-eating munias occupying the open habitats, species such as Vanuatu's blue-faced parrotfinch and its Fijian relative have expanded into grassy areas of their islands to exploit the supply of seeds.|$|E
