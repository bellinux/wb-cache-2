50|$|In November 1908, Hunt {{was elected}} prosecuting {{attorney}} for Hamilton County. During Hunt's term, Boss Cox tried to obstruct him at every turn. Nevertheless, Hunt prevailed {{more often than}} not, closing gambling rooms and <b>driving</b> <b>slot</b> machines out of the county. In 1910, Hunt was re-elected to another two-year term. In 1911, Hunt's persistence and successes prompted Cox to issue a surprising announcement. Later that year, he would retire from political life.|$|E
50|$|Backplanes {{have grown}} in {{complexity}} from the simple Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) (used in the original IBM PC) or S-100 style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus. Due to limitations inherent in the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) specification for <b>driving</b> <b>slots,</b> backplanes are now offered as passive and active.|$|R
50|$|Their {{products}} include arcade games, pool tables, snooker tables, {{table tennis}} tables, jukeboxes, pinball machines, retro gaming, air hockey, dartboards, casino tables, outdoor products, <b>driving</b> simulators, <b>slot</b> machines, football tables, and various novelty game products, including multi-game tables, football coffee tables, LED pool tables. They also manufacture retro products, including old-fashioned jukeboxes and old-school arcade machines. Liberty Games products are {{often found in}} liquor stores, supermarkets, and restaurants around the UK. Liberty Games is currently the biggest amusement purveyor in the UK market.|$|R
5000|$|Once again, the TWR Vitesse {{cars were}} entered for the ETCC in 1986 where Percy {{finished}} 2nd in the Drivers' Championship. He {{had originally been}} declared the champion until {{a month after the}} championship the FIA amended the results (suddenly remembering that drivers had to drop their lowest scoring race) which gave the championship to BMW driver Roberto Ravaglia. However, 1986 also saw TWR running Jaguar's works Group C1 entry for the 24 Hours of Le Mans race; Percy was a natural choice for one of the <b>driving</b> <b>slots.</b> Percy's Jaguar XJR-6 lasted for 10 of the 24 hours, partnered by Gianfranco Brancatelli and Hurley Haywood at the wheel, before a drive-shaft failure dropped the car out of the race from second place. Percy entered Le Mans again the following year, but suffered a horrific crash when a tyre exploded at full speed (approximately 240 mph) on the long Mulsanne Straight, tearing off the rear bodywork and flipping the car into the air [...] "up above the trees". The wreckage finally came to a halt 600 metres down the road but, despite almost obliterating the vehicle, Percy walked away from the crash with nothing more than a badly battered helmet.|$|R
50|$|Lego Stunt Rally {{features}} <b>driving</b> with a <b>slot</b> car-esque control; {{the player}} controls the acceleration and braking, but steering is controlled automatically (although the player can change lanes and influence how their vehicle takes corners). There are also powerups which the player {{can pick up}} and use at any time, much like kart racers.|$|R
5000|$|NMTB is a [...] "self releasing" [...] or [...] "fast" [...] taper. Unlike {{the more}} acute self holding tapers above, such tapers are not {{designed}} to transmit high torque; high torques are carried by <b>driving</b> keys engaging <b>slots</b> on the flange. The purpose is to allow a quick and easy change between different tools (either automatically or by hand) while ensuring the tool or toolholder will be tightly and rigidly connected to the spindle, and accurately coaxial with it. The larger end adjacent to the tool makes for more rigidity than is possible with Morse or RT tapers fitted to comparable machines.|$|R
50|$|A {{slot antenna}} {{consists}} of a metal surface, usually a flat plate, {{with one or more}} holes or slots cut out. When the plate is driven as an antenna by a <b>driving</b> frequency, the <b>slot</b> radiates electromagnetic waves in a way similar to a dipole antenna. The shape and size of the slot, as well as the driving frequency, determine the radiation pattern. Often the radio waves are provided by a waveguide, and the antenna consists of slots in the waveguide. Slot antennas are often used at UHF and microwave frequencies instead of line antennas when greater control of the radiation pattern is required. Slot antennas are widely used in radar antennas, for the sector antennas used for cell phone base stations, and are often found in standard desktop microwave sources used for research purposes. A slot antenna's main advantages are its size, design simplicity, and convenient adaptation to mass production using either waveguide or PC board technology.|$|R
