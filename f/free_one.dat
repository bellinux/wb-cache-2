The second enforces the duty of charity on Æthelstan's reeves, specifying the amount to be given to the poor and requiring reeves to <b>free</b> <b>one</b> penal slave annually. His religious outlook is shown in a wider sacralization of the law in his reign.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, an {{agreement}} was reached between TV Tokyo and the streaming video service Crunchyroll. Crunchyroll would stream English-subtitled episodes for <b>free</b> <b>one</b> week after they had aired in Japan. Paying subscribers can watch new episodes an hour after they air in Japan. On January 8, 2009, Crunchyroll uploaded their first episode (episode 129) to the service. Alongside new episodes each week, Crunchyroll also uploads episodes {{from the beginning of}} the series. The anime is licensed in North America by Sentai Filmworks, with distribution from Section23 Films. Section23 Films' Chris Oarr commented that only the first two seasons were licensed, with an option on the rest. The first collection containing thirteen English-subtitled episodes was released on DVD, April 27, 2010. Only 49 episodes were released before the releases stalled. However, shortly after licensing the Gin Tama film, Sentai Filmworks announced that based on the film's performance, they would consider releasing more of the series in North America, possibly with an English dub. An English subtitled version of the series began airing on Shorts HD on July 12, 2015. On July 1, 2016, Crunchyroll announced that they will re-release the series on Blu-ray and DVD with an English dub.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the felt}} hat {{industry}} in Denton and Haughton was prosperous and {{an integral part}} of the town, working conditions in the factories were not risk <b>free.</b> <b>One</b> of the problems workers faced was mercury poisoning; mercury was used to separate the fur from the rabbit hide and workers were in regular contact with fur impregnated with mercury or exposed to mercury vapour. Inadequate ventilation in some parts of the hat making process led to other sorts of dangers; solvents were also used and on 14 January 1901 there was an explosion at the factory of Joseph Wilson & Sons in Denton, killing 13 people and injuring many more. The explosion was of vapour from methylated spirits used in the dying process.|$|E
25|$|Barking geckos {{were common}} in shrublands {{all around the}} Wellington region up until the 1960s and 1970s but populations have {{declined}} enormously since then. DOC has tried to establish populations of this species on Mana Island {{but there are so}} few animals left in wild populations in the region that they have had to resort to transferring animals taken either from the jaws of pet cats or captive bred animals from private collections. Both the Naultinus released on Mana and a natural population on Kapiti Island have failed to thrive, which is mysterious, because these habitats are rodent <b>free.</b> <b>One</b> suggested cause about which little research has been done is vespid wasp predation, as these insects have been observed killing both adult and baby Naultinus. Naultinus gemmeus are known from the mainland of Southland from a few sightings by members of the public but despite numerous searches in recent years, not a single animal has been sighted or photographed here and it is speculated that this population is either critically endangered or already functionally extinct.|$|E

25|$|Fai's {{real name}} is , and {{he was born with}} his {{identical}} twin brother, Fai, in Valeria Country. The birth of twins in the country was a bad omen, which led to many misfortunes upon the country. The king imprisoned them within a tower, just before he killed everybody in the country. Eventually, Fei-Wang Reed appeared and offered to <b>free</b> <b>one</b> of them. Fai chose to save Yūi, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death, though Fei-Wang tampered with Yūi's memory to make him think that he chose his own life over Fai. Promising to return Fai to life if Yūi becomes his pawn, Fei-Wang bestowed two curses upon him. The curses are to kill whoever is a stronger magician than he is, and another curse will use his magic to collapse the world around them. He was soon found by Ashura-ō, who took in Yūi, having adopted the name Fai. Ashura conforted Fai, and gave him his tattoo to suppress the first curse. Fai eventually learned that Ashura's purpose was to be killed by Fai's first curse, as Ashura killed people in order to make his magic stronger.|$|E

500|$|The {{major issue}} of the Sixteenth Congress (1819–21) was whether Missouri should be {{admitted}} to the Union, and whether slavery would be permitted in the new state. [...] Acknowledging the ills of slavery, he hoped that by letting it expand, there would be fewer slaves in the east as slave and master journeyed west, making it feasible to consider abolishing the institution in Virginia. Thus, slavery would be abolished through the action of individual states as the practice became rare, as had been done in some Northern states. Tyler believed that Congress {{did not have the}} power to regulate slavery and that admitting states based on whether they were slave or free was a recipe for sectional conflict; therefore, the Missouri Compromise was enacted without Tyler's support. It admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a <b>free</b> <b>one,</b> and it also forbade slavery in states formed from {{the northern part of the}} territories. Throughout his time in Congress, he voted against bills which would restrict slavery in the territories.|$|E
