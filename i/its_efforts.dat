5|$|Airbus's first airliner, the A300, was envisioned {{as part of}} {{a diverse}} family of {{commercial}} aircraft. In pursuit of this goal, studies began in the early 1970s into derivatives of the A300. Before introducing the A300, Airbus identified nine possible variations designated B1 through B9. A tenth variant, the A300B10, was conceived in 1973 and developed into the longer range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> on single-aisle (SA) studies, conceiving a family of airliners later known as the Airbus A320 family, the first commercial aircraft with digital fly-by-wire controls. During these studies Airbus turned its focus back to the wide-body aircraft market, simultaneously working on both projects.|$|E

The same year, India's president Rajendra Prasad acted on the Pant Committee's recommendations and issued orders for preparation of Hindi glossaries, translating procedural literature and legal codes to Hindi, imparting Hindi education to government employees and other efforts for propagating Hindi.|$|E

Beginning in 1916, the Navy began building larger, ocean-going vessels for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic. With six of the larger submarines under construction, the Navy considered either building German Type UB III submarines under license or implementing the Type 1916 S 1 design submitted by Ungarische Unterseebotsbau AG (UBAG) of Fiume.|$|E
5|$|For the {{remainder}} of its deployment, the first contingent focused most of <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> on providing accommodations for electoral centres and police stations. These were typically manned by {{only two or three}} police (or civilian) electoral staff and were almost always in small, remote villages. Buildings were leased, a large number of caravans purchased and deployed and prefabricated buildings constructed in about 50 locations. Much of this was done by the Resources Troop (under Lieutenant Stuart Graham), centrally controlled by squadron construction officer Captain Shane Miller.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, the First Vatican Council {{declared}} the dogma of papal infallibility and the Kingdom of Italy annexed {{the city of}} Rome, the last portion of the Papal States to {{be incorporated into the}} new nation.

In the Second World War, the Church condemned Nazism, and protected hundreds of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust; <b>its</b> <b>efforts,</b> however, have been criticised as inadequate.

Norway sent two major expeditions to the territory in the 1940s and 1950s, but <b>its</b> <b>efforts</b> declined after that. On 21 June 1957, Queen Maud Land became subject to Norwegian sovereignty as a dependency (biland), and the Antarctic Treaty officially came into force on 23 June 1961. Norwegian activity during the 1960s was limited to some minor co-expeditions with the United States, until it gradually picked up again following a larger expedition to western Queen Maud Land and the eastern Weddell Sea by the Norwegian Polar Institute in 1976–77.|$|E

He recovered after three weeks, but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcohol addiction.

At the same time, the Project's aircraft were {{nearing the end of}} their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3's were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons there. This action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E
