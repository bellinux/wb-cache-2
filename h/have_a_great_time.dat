Ever since that first shooting experience, I continued to pursue my interest in firearms.|$|E

500|$|In the subplot, Homer and Marge attend their [...] "Class of 1974" [...] {{high school}} reunion, where they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> and Homer wins {{a variety of}} humorous awards.

Determined to win back the accolades, Homer retakes the course and passes the final exam, finally graduating.|$|E
500|$|... "When in Rome", {{the opening}} track on Why Should the Fire Die?, {{was chosen as}} the album's only single. The song's title alludes to the American proverb [...] "When in Rome, do as the Romans do", [...] and Chris Thile, the song's author, said [...] "The idea behind the song– and I do love it! - is if there is {{something}} better, it's worth leaning towards just a little bit because you'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> here regardless." [...] Critics commented on the song favorably, with George Graham saying that [...] "When in Rome" [...] has [...] "rock energy level and some sonic manipulation, with hints of old-time Appalachian music in the fiddle, while the lyrics are definitely in the rock mode." ...|$|E
500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} I very much wanted". He added that his vision was for [...] "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed {{a couple of big}} ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E

500|$|When Bart and Lisa {{arrive at}} their parents' home, they stay there [...] with their children. Unfortunately for Lisa, she only gets unhelpful advice from Marge {{on how to}} be a better mother and Zia {{continues}} to go into the Ultranet.

The boys become angry with their father for not spending time with them, but the two <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> with their grandfather.

After exchanging inspirational advice, they realize that they need to try harder to connect with their children. Meanwhile, upon arriving in Springfield, Maggie starts experiencing contractions and Kearney, now a taxi driver, drives her to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|The opening track, [...] "Sure Hope You Mean It", {{features}} slightly off-beat percussion, tambourine shakes, {{and lyrics}} {{about a man}} who awaits a sign of approval from the woman he admires. [...] "Keep Marchin", which evoked socially conscious and positive sentiments, was composed in the vein of the Civil Rights Movement era soul music by artists such as Sam Cooke and the Staple Singers. Gail Mitchell from Billboard compared the song to Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions' 1968 song [...] "We're a Winner". Saadiq said [...] "Keep Marchin" [...] was also inspired by his journey in the music industry. [...] "Big Easy", featuring New Orleans-style brass playing, was sung {{from the point of view}} of a man in New Orleans who reacts to Hurricane Katrina and looks for his lost lover. J. Gabriel Boylan of The New York Observer remarked that the song [...] "manages to cast Hurricane Katrina as the villain in a romance, tearing lovers apart." [...] Its composition—mixing a blissful sound with disheartening lyrics—is similar to the songwriting technique used by Holland–Dozier–Holland. Saadiq was inspired to write [...] "Big Easy" [...] after watching the 2006 documentary film When the Levees Broke. He explained its upbeat composition in an interview for All Things Considered: [...] "In New Orleans, when they mourn, they really celebrate and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time.</b> I wanted to give it that same spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Matt Whittaker of Hardcore Gamer {{gave the}} game a 3.5/5 and wrote: [...] "Evaluating NBA 2K16 {{as a whole}} is {{actually}} an interesting challenge. On one hand, this is arguably the most mechanically sound sports game on the market and the gameplay improvements that Visual Concepts made are downright superb. The issue here lies with the decision to make Livin ‘Da Dream the focus and backbone of MyCareer falling flat. There are some moments throughout Spike Lee’s in-game film that might bring a smile to your face, but this story doesn’t lend itself to this franchise’s gameplay or the video game medium itself. Yes, basketball fans will likely <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> playing NBA 2K16 for hours on end, but there are too many small steps back here that can’t be ignored. The good news for fans of sports games is that the first misstep in this great franchise is still a very good game, which speaks to how truly fun its gameplay is." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{definitely}} {{had a story}} for it – a specific story – that's why I {{felt that it was}} important for her and I to co-direct this particular video and song and she completely got it. She got my vision for it. She [...] got where I was trying to go and what she brings to the table is so incredible and she's so creative and outstanding. And I always <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>time</b> working with her. There was no ego involved, you know, me - that was the first video that I'd ever {{stepped up to the plate}} to literally co-direct. I'd always been very opinionated and very you know, I always voice my ideas and whatnot in my videos, but this was the first one I actually took credit for in co-directing. And she was just so great and generous in teaching me some of the ropes and learning about the different camera angles and you know, all the facets and details that go into making a video. So, she was really great and we had such fun with that. [...] And she's amazing. I can't you know, she came to the set dressed in different outfits that related to the circus everyday, so she's such an imaginative, creative spirit that I just have such fun working with energy like that.|$|E
