50|$|In bowing, {{the three}} most {{prominent}} factors under the player's immediate control are bow speed, downward force, and location of the sounding point where <b>hair</b> <b>crosses</b> string. The desired sounding point will generally move closer to the bridge as the string is stopped to a shorter sounding length. The player may also vary the amount of hair {{in contact with the}} string by tilting the bow stick more or less away from the bridge. Violinists are trained to keep the bow perpendicular to the string in most cases, as other angles may adversely affect the sound.|$|R
25|$|An {{individual}} hair's {{shape is}} never completely circular. The cross-section of a hair is an ellipse, which can tend towards a circle or be distinctly flattened. Asiatic heads of straight hair are formed from almost-round hairs, and Caucasian <b>hair's</b> <b>cross</b> sections form oval shapes. Afro-textured hair has a flattened cross-section and is finer, and its ringlets can form tight circles with diameters {{of only a}} few millimeters. In humans worldwide, Asiatic hair is the most common, whereas afro-textured hair is the least common. This is because the former hair texture is typical of the large populations inhabiting East Asia as well as the indigenous peoples of the Americas.|$|R

40|$|Background: Because {{deep brain}} {{stimulation}} (DBS) implantations and other stereotactic and functional surgical procedures require accurate, precise, and safe targeting of the brain structure, the technical aids for preoperative planning, intervention, and postoperative follow-up have become increasingly important. In this paper, we compare the outcomes of advanced Parkinson′s disease (PD) patients at our center who received frame-based DBS surgery involving {{the use of a}} <b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> with those for patients who received the surgery without the application of the <b>cross</b> <b>hair.</b> A preliminary outcomes analysis is also provided. Methods and Techniques: Seventeen patients (10 male and 7 female; mean age: 64. 8 ± 9. 0 years) with advanced PD underwent frame-based DBS surgery, 8 with noncross hair and 9 with <b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> frame-based stereotaxy. After identifying the coordinates of the subthalamic nuclei, the DBS electrodes were implanted with or without crosshair application and connected to an implanted programmable generator in all patients. Programming started 1 month after the operation, and the patients were followed-upon regularly for at least 6 months. Results: After 12 months of follow-up, the patients who received DBS surgery showed improvements in clinical outcome, especially those in the frame-based <b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> group, which resulted in a significantly higher degree of improvement in both the "On" and "Off" states of the postoperative state (<b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> Unified PD Rating Scale [UPDRS] in the "Off" state : p 0 reoperative: 82. 3 ± 15. 4 vs. postoperative: 37. 9 ± 9. 4; P 0. 05, paired t-test). Conclusion: Targeting accuracy can be increased by detailed preoperative planning and good facilitating equipment. Crosshair application with a frame-based system provides higher accuracy in the postoperative lead position survey and target deviation measurements compared with the preoperative planning image. Furthermore, the outcomes of the DBS group with <b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> application were better than those of the noncross hair application group...|$|R
5000|$|The play {{begins with}} a dreamlike {{sequence}} {{of a woman in}} a white nightgown with long, dark <b>hair</b> <b>crossing</b> the stage. The woman (who we later learn is Sarah's mother) carries a bald head in her hands as a white curtain opens, revealing Sarah's bedroom. The entire play takes place in Sarah's mind. Sarah's room acts a symbol for her idolization of whiteness. [...] The enormous, white statue of Queen Victoria is the prime example of this. The first scene is between Queen Victoria and the Duchess of Hapsburg, with the room acting as the Queen's chambers. This gives us an immediate glimpse into the permeability of the set—it constantly takes on new forms for its various inhabitants. The two women primarily discuss whiteness, as Queen Victoria states, [...] "My mother was the light. She was the lightest one. She looked like a white woman.".|$|R

Next, turn the focusing screw until the image of the object appears clear and sharp as the observer looks through properly focused eye-piece. If focusing has been done properly, there will be no parallax i.e., there will be no apparent movement of the image relative to the <b>cross</b> <b>hairs</b> if the observer moves his eye {{from one side to the}} other or from top to bottom.|$|R

50|$|The {{instrument}} consists essentially of an accurately {{graduated scale}} and a horizontal telescope {{capable of being}} moved {{up and down a}} rigid vertical column. The position of the telescope can be read by means of an attached Vernier scale. In measuring the vertical distance between two points, the instrument must first be leveled. Next, the <b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> in the eyepiece of the horizontal telescope is brought into coincidence with the image of one point and the position of the telescope noted; the <b>cross</b> <b>hair</b> is then brought into coincidence with the image of the other point and the new position of the telescope noted.

50|$|The tribrach is {{attached}} to the tripod and placed over the monument. Looking through the optical plummet pick up two of the tripod legs and position the <b>cross</b> <b>hairs</b> over the monument. Tread all three legs into the grass, bitumen, concrete. Look through the optical plummet and using the thumbscrews put the <b>cross</b> <b>hairs</b> back over the monument. Adjust the level of the tribrach by slackening the tripod screws and sliding the legs. Re-center the <b>cross</b> <b>hairs</b> using the thumb screws, then fine-tune the level using the tripod legs. Once the tribrach is nearly centered over the monument, level the tribrach the last little bit using the thumbscrews. Slacken the tribrach from the tripod head and slide it the last 4-5mm so that it is centered over the monument and level. If the target over which the instrument is to be placed is roughly at the same elevation as the tripod feet, the preceding technique is applicable. However, if there is a considerable difference between the elevation of the target and the elevation of the tripod feet, such as when the target is in a deep hole or raised on a shelf or wall, it will not work, as the target will appear to move laterally by a large distance in the optical plummet as the tripod legs are raised or lowered.|$|R

5000|$|In {{nearly every}} {{region of the}} world, the Border Collie is now also a breed which is shown in ring or bench shows. For the people who {{participate}} in these events, the Border Collie {{is defined by the}} breed standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with the longer double coat (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined , semi-pricked ears, as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the hock. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes, and must be intelligent. It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a very strong herding instinct. [...] Away from breed standards, short haired Border collie variants are also found, offering householders a less demanding task clearing year-round shed <b>hair.</b> <b>Crossing</b> collies with German shepherd dogs produces a strong intelligent hybrid of intermediate size, popularly named a [...] "shollie", used as a working dog with livestock and as an animal companion.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a {{combined}} experimental and theoretical investigation of the dynamics of water-walking insects and spiders. Using high-speed videography, we describe their numerous gaits, some analogous to those of their terrestrial counterparts, others specialized for life at the interface. The critical role of the rough surface of these water walkers in both floatation and propulsion is demonstrated. Their waxy, hairy surface ensures that their legs remain in a water-repellent state, that the bulk of their leg is not wetted, but rather contact with the water arises exclusively through individual hairs. Maintaining this water-repellent state requires that the speed of their driving legs does not exceed a critical wetting speed. Flow visualization reveals that the wakes of most water walkers are characterized by a series of coherent subsurface vortices shed by the driving stroke. A theoretical framework is developed in order to describe the propulsion in terms of the transfer of forces and momentum between the creature and its environment. The application of the conservation of momentum to biolocomotion at the interface confirms that the propulsion of water walkers may be rationalized in terms of the subsurface flows generated by their driving stroke. The two principal modes of propulsion available to small water walkers are elucidated. At driving leg speeds in excess of the capillary wave speed, macroscopic curvature forces are generated by deforming the meniscus, and the surface behaves effectively as a trampoline. For slower speeds, the driving legs need not substantially deform the surface but may instead simply brush it: the resulting contact or viscous forces acting on the leg <b>hairs</b> <b>crossing</b> the interface serve to propel the creature forward. 1...|$|R
