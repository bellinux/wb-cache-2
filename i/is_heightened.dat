5|$|In {{an echo of}} the Iliad, Achilles drags {{the corpse}} behind his horse. Thus, the {{comparison}} with the Homeric Hector <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> and, at the same time, aspects of the classical Troilus's fate are echoed.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} scenes <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> by {{alternating}} between objective and subjective perspectives, the warm {{face of the}} Earth and the depths of dark space, the chaos and unpredictability of the debris field, and silence in the vacuum of space with the background score giving the desired effect. The film uses very long, uninterrupted shots throughout to draw the audience into the action, but contrasts these with claustrophobic shots within space suits and capsules.|$|E
5|$|In this series, the Clan’s {{survival}} is {{put at risk}} as humans begin to destroy the forest with machinery. To combat this, one cat from all four Clan’s is chosen to journey and find a new home for the cats to live. These cats are Tawnypelt of ShadowClan, Crowpaw of WindClan, Feathertail of RiverClan, and Brambleclaw of ThunderClan, the latter of whom also struggles with his heritage as the late Tigerstar’s son. Feathertail’s brother Stormfur and the ThunderClan apprentice Squirrelpaw also accompany them. After a long journey, the group discover a lake {{that they can use}} as their new territory, which they name ‘sun-drown-place.’ Whilst journeying back to report their finding to the Clans, the travelling cats meet a new community called The Tribe of Rushing Water, who are being terrorized by a mountain lion. Feathertail sacrifices her life to kill the mountain lion and save the Tribe. The remaining cats return to their Clans and relay the message. Together, the four Clans travel to their new territory, although many cats perish along the way. During this journey, the boundaries between the Clans begin to blur. Crowfeather (formerly Crowpaw) falls in love with the ThunderClan medicine cat Leafpool; however, as they are from different Clans, they are forbidden from being together. Additionally, Leafpool’s status as a medicine cat dictates she can never have a mate or give birth to kits. They decide to secretly run away together, but return when the ThunderClan camp is attacked by badgers. Leafpool’s mentor, Cinderpelt, dies in the battle, and Leafpool decides that she must remain with her Clan. Meanwhile, Brambleclaw is torn between his loyalty to his Clan and his loyalty to his dead father. He dreams of one day becoming Clan deputy, an ambition that <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> when he discovers that his father, Tigerstar, can visit him in his dreams. Furthermore, Brambleclaw learns that he has a RiverClan half-brother named Hawkfrost. The two grow close, much to the disdain of Squirrelflight (formerly Squirrelpaw). However, Hawkfrost’s bloodthirsty nature is revealed when he traps the ThunderClan leader Firestar, and orders Brambleclaw to murder him. Brambleclaw instead kills Hawkfrost. In return, Firestar accepts the young warrior for who he is, and Brambleclaw is appointed the new deputy of ThunderClan. He later begins a relationship with Squirrelflight.|$|E

25|$|The castle {{appears to}} stand upon a motte; its massive walls were, unusually for the period, sunk {{deep into the}} {{original}} motte. The effect <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> by a surrounding ringwork, subsequently filled in {{on the inner side}} so as to appear to heap against the castle wall. This may have occurred in the castle's later history to provide a garden walk around the ruin.|$|E
25|$|The {{major cause}} of DLB is not well {{understood}} yet, but a genetic link with the PARK11 gene has been described. As with Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, most cases of DLB appear sporadically and DLB is not thought {{to have a strong}} hereditary link. As with Alzheimer's disease, the DLB risk <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> with inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE).|$|E
25|$|Although {{historically}} {{there have}} been rivalries between Northern California and Southern California supporters, a bitter rivalry exists between the San Jose Ultras and the Angel City Brigade, who support Los Angeles. Supporters from both teams taunt each other with elaborate tifo displays and chants due to the passion and hate there <b>is.</b> <b>Heightened</b> security is used to ensure no violence between the opposing groups. Social networking sites such as Facebook have also been used to jeer rival fans ensuring the rivalry continues outside of soccer.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the exact}} {{mechanism}} is unknown, scientists hypothesize that the helper T cells are key players. Allergic diseases, which are immunological responses to normally harmless antigens, {{are driven by}} a TH2-mediated immune response. Bacteria, viruses, and parasites, on the other hand, elicit a TH1-mediated immune response which inhibits or down-regulates the TH2 response. TH1 also inhibits the activity of TH17 which <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> in numerous inflammatory diseases including multiple sclerosis and asthma. More research is currently being performed {{to better understand the}} possible mechanism for the hygiene hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Over time, Moroccan {{women have}} gained {{more access to}} employment. However, this {{quantitative}} increase in labor participation for women has not been accompanied by higher qualitative standards of labor. The labor of rural women in Morocco remain unacknowledged and unpaid. Women are put into {{a higher risk of}} poverty as their domestic workload is added onto their unpaid labor. This balance of domestic labor and work outside the home imposes a burden on rural women. Since the socioeconomic exclusion of women deprive them of the capabilities to be educated and trained for certain employment skills, their susceptibility to poverty <b>is</b> <b>heightened.</b> Low educational skills of women directly relate to the limited employment options they have in society. Although both men and women are affected by unemployment, {{women are more likely to}} lose their jobs than men. Recent research in Morocco shows that economic recessions in the country affect women the most.|$|E
25|$|The {{music by}} Torrejón conserves {{much of the}} {{character}} and the idiosyncrasies contained in the comedies of Calderón as previously set by Juan Hidalgo. It is speculated that Torrejón {{may have been one}} of Hidalgo's pupils and that his work was possibly a source of inspiration for Torrejón in the composition of his own version. The score makes use of a variety of Spanish song types and Latin American musical influences, incorporating Latin American melodies and rhythms into the overall European dramatic and harmonic structure. The erotic nature of the text <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> by the use of dance rhythms, musical repetitions, and sensual lyrical lines. The ornamental writing is also used deftly to emphasize the drama of the text. The exact instrumentation has not been found in Torrejón y Velasco's surviving original scores. However, the scores of other late seventeenth century musical plays in Spain suggest that the instruments would include harps, guitars, viols, violins, clarino and regular trumpets, drums, and castanets.|$|E

500|$|In a {{description}} whose pathos <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> {{by the fact}} that it is seen through a compatriot's eyes, Troilus is infelix puer ("unhappy boy") who has met Achilles in [...] "unequal" [...] combat. Troilus' horses flee while he, still holding their reins, hangs from the chariot, his head and hair trailing behind while the backward-pointing spear scribbles in the dust. (The First Vatican Mythographer elaborates on this story, explaining that Troilus's body is dragged right to the walls of Troy.) ...|$|E
500|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{is another}} risk {{that may not}} display the usual symptoms (pain, urgency and frequency); it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity. The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> by use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheterization may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder's ability to empty when it gets too full, which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage the bladder permanently. [...] The use of intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world, {{but it is still}} a serious problem in developing countries.|$|E
500|$|Morrison's [...] "Shaman's Blues" [...] and {{the title}} track were both {{examples}} of his penchant for using symbolism and autobiographical insights. The latter song, a stylistic return to a lengthy track closing a Doors album, was penned {{with the help of}} Rothchild who organized pieces of Morrison's poetry with him to align rhythmically and conceptually. Introduced with a mock-fiery sermon by Morrison, [...] "The Soft Parade" [...] displays his Southern roots through his portrayal as a preacher. The song's ambiance <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> by the striking imagery which outlines a need for sanctuary, escape, and pleasure. With the song's display of acid rock and sunshine pop influences, band analyzer Doug Sundling noted that [...] "The Soft Parade" [...] is more diverse than any other Morrison composition.|$|E

500|$|In The Slave Community, Blassingame uses {{psychologist}} Harry Stack Sullivan's interpersonal {{theory to}} interpret the behavior of slaves on antebellum plantations. Sullivan claims that [...] "significant others", persons with the most power to reward and punish individual behavior, were primarily responsible for determining behavior. Interpersonal theorists argue that [...] "behavioral patterns {{are determined by the}} characteristics of the situation, how the person perceives them, and his behavioral dispositions at the time." [...] The most important component of personality is self-esteem. Blassingame explains, [...] "Our sense of self-esteem <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> or lowered by our perception of the images others have of us." [...] Interpersonal behavior revolves around the dominant-submissive axes: [...] "One form of behavior tends to elicit its complement: dominance leads to submission and vice versa. The extent of submissiveness often depends on the structure of the group to which the person belongs." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{risk that}} a person will develop PTE <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> but not 100% if PTS occur. Because many of the risk factors for both PTE and early PTS are the same, it is unknown whether the {{occurrence}} of PTS is a risk factor in and of itself. However, even independent of other common risk factors, early PTS {{have been found to}} increase the risk of PTE to over 25% in most studies. A person who has one late seizure is at even greater risk for having another than one who has early PTS; epilepsy occurs in 80% of people who have a late seizure. [...] Status epilepticus, a continuous seizure or multiple seizures in rapid succession, is especially strongly correlated with the development of PTE; status seizures occur in 6% of all TBIs but are associated with PTE 42% of the time, and quickly halting a status seizure reduces chances of PTE development.|$|E
500|$|Stereotypes {{of alcoholics}} are {{often found in}} fiction and popular culture. The [...] "town drunk" [...] is a stock {{character}} in Western popular culture. Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on racism or xenophobia, as in the fictional depiction of the Irish as heavy drinkers. Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America. Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there <b>is</b> <b>heightened</b> drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near {{as high as it}} is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption. In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur. [...] They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.|$|E
