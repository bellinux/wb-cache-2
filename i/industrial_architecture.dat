Meadow Lane in Hunslet was also home to Christ Church, an architecturally notable Gothic church, which has since been demolished.|$|E

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Leeds, {{a city and}} metropolitan borough in West Yorkshire, England, encompasses {{a wide range of}} architectural styles and notable buildings. As with most northern industrial centres, much of Leeds' prominent architecture is of the Victorian era. However, the City of Leeds also contains buildings from as early as the Middle Ages such as Kirkstall Abbey, one of Britain's best preserved ruined Cistercian monasteries, as well as examples of 20th century <b>industrial</b> <b>architecture,</b> particularly in the districts of Hunslet and Holbeck.|$|E
5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century <b>industrial</b> <b>architecture.</b> It was designed in an industrial Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E

25|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>architecture</b> {{includes}} several factories converted into leisure and business space, {{primarily on the}} Isle of Nantes. The former Lefèvre-Utile factory {{is known for its}} Tour Lu, a publicity tower built in 1909. Two cranes in the former harbour, dating to the 1950s and 1960s, have also become landmarks. Recent architecture is dominated by postwar concrete reconstructions, modernist buildings and examples of contemporary architecture such as the courts of justice, designed by Jean Nouvel in 2000.|$|E

25|$|After {{this brief}} synthesis, Neo-Classical {{reaction}} was totally dominant until 1955. Rationalist buildings were still common in <b>industrial</b> <b>architecture,</b> but extinct in urban projects. Last isolated constructivist buildings were launched in 1933–1935, such as Panteleimon Golosov's Pravda building (finished 1935), the Moscow Textile Institute (finished 1938) or Ladovsky's rationalist vestibules for the Moscow Metro. Clearly Modernist competition entries {{were made by}} the Vesnin brothers and Ivan Leonidov for the Narkomtiazhprom project in Red Square, 1934, another unbuilt Stalinist edifice. Traces of Constructivism can also be found in some Socialist Realist works, for instance in the Futurist elevations of Iofan's ultra-Stalinist 1937 Paris Pavilion, which had Suprematist interiors by Nikolai Suetin.|$|E
500|$|Most of Greater Manchester's listed {{buildings}} {{date from}} the Victorian and Edwardian periods. According to an Association for Industrial Archaeology publication, Greater Manchester is [...] "one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain, {{the result of a}} combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries: a phenomenal rise in population, the appearance of the specialist industrial town, a transport revolution, and weak local lordship". Much of the region, historically a part of Lancashire, was at the forefront of textile manufacturing from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, and the county includes several former mill towns. Greater Manchester has a wealth of industrial heritage, represented by <b>industrial</b> <b>architecture</b> found throughout the county, but most of its Grade I listed buildings have a municipal, ecclesiastic or other cultural heritage.|$|E

In 1974, it was recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building in recognition of its importance {{as an example of a}} large-scale industrial malting complex in which [...] "considerations of form, massing, symmetry and scale have produced a design of high aesthetic quality combined with clear functional expression"; it also represents the importance of the English brewing industry in the late-19th and early 20th centuries and large-scale malting at its peak. Owing to its derelict state, the building was also placed on English Heritage's [...] "at risk" [...] register in 2011.|$|E
