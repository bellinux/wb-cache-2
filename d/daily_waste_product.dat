40|$|Sites {{containing}} anthropogenic <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> or dumps {{are currently}} treated as refugia {{by a lot}} of animal groups, including ants. In this study the population structure of Myrmica rubra (L.) ants was compared between habitats containing and lacking anthropogenic <b>waste</b> <b>products.</b> The density of colonies and individual nests, number of queens and of workers both per colony and per nest, and queen size were analyzed. Twenty plots with <b>waste</b> <b>products</b> and 20 control (natural) plots (paired, each 10 Ã— 10 m in size) were established and compared. Results show a significant increase in colony and nest density on the plots with waste compare to the control plots. However, the number of workers, queens and queen size did not differ significantly between plot types. Overall number, as well as proportion of polycalic colonies was higher on plots with <b>waste</b> <b>products.</b> These results suggest that when M. rubra has more potential nest site opportunities created by human activity, the density of its colonies increases. Moreover, the anthropogenic <b>waste</b> <b>product</b> are strongly preferred nest sites for this species on the human-disturbed plots, as only them were used as nest loci there in contrast to control plots...|$|R
