It is used in quality control, dynamic measurement, and monitoring applications such as the long-term unattended measurement of CO2 concentrations in greenhouses and growth chambers by <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most FluxNet {{sites have}} at minimum sensors to {{accurately}} measure the wind speed {{as well as}} the concentration of the trace gases in question. To obtain the necessary data, it is common for the towers to employ a sonic anemometer, an <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> and some sensor to measure humidity. These tools are necessary because they provide the necessary variables to be put into the eddy covariance model of gas flux in the biosphere.|$|E
50|$|An <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> {{measures}} trace gases {{by determining}} {{the absorption of}} an emitted infrared light source through a certain air sample. Trace gases found in the Earth's atmosphere get excited under specific wavelengths found in the infrared range. The concept behind the technology {{can be understood as}} testing how much of the light is absorbed by the air. Different molecules in the air absorb different frequencies of light. Air with lots of a certain gas will absorb more of a certain frequency, allowing the sensor to report a high concentration of the corresponding molecule.|$|E
50|$|The hygrogemeter is an {{essential}} tool used {{to figure out the}} concentration of water vapor in the air. Unfortunately, water vapor absorbs several frequencies of light in the infrared range and most of these bands overlap that of the trace gases. Without accounting for water vapor, the <b>Infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> would give false data. To solve this problem, an accurate water vapor measurement is needed. Solid state hygrometers are designed to have two metal plates separated by a small air gap. Differing levels of humidity in the air change the capacitance of the air gap. This can be measured by applying a high frequency AC voltage to the plates and measuring the capacitance through an RC circuit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> {{usually have}} two chambers, {{one is a}} {{reference}} chamber while the other chamber is a measurement chamber. Infrared light is emitted from some type of source {{on one end of}} the chamber, passes through a series of chambers that contains given quantities of the various gases in question.|$|R

The [...] concentrations is measured by the <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer.</b> The IRGA shines infrared light through a gas sample onto a detector. [...] in the sample absorbs energy, so the reduction in the level of energy that reaches the detector indicates the [...] concentration. Modern IRGAs take account of the fact that [...] absorbs energy at similar wavelengths as [...] Modern IRGAs may either dry the gas sample to a constant water content or incorporate both a [...] and a water vapour IRGA to assess the difference in [...] and water vapour concentrations in air between the chamber entrance and outlet.|$|E
5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a photosynthetic system are the leaf chamber, <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> (IRGA), batteries and a console with keyboard, display and memory. Modern 'open system' photosynthesis systems also incorporate miniature disposable compressed gas cylinder and gas supply pipes. This is because external air has natural fluctuations in [...] and water vapor content, which can introduce measurement noise. Modern 'open system' photosynthesis systems remove the [...] and water vapour by passage over soda lime and Drierite, then add [...] at a controlled rate to give a stable [...] concentration. Some systems are also equipped with temperature control and a removable light unit, so {{the effect of these}} environmental variables can also be measured.|$|E
50|$|The {{principle}} {{behind the}} eddy covariance technique is that parcels of air have eddy like characteristics in the atmosphere. In other words, when trace gases are respired by vegetation, their velocity {{can be represented}} by a 3D vector. The purpose of using such a precise anemometer is to measure value of the wind velocity component in three dimensions. Using the <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> and the humidity sensor, the concentration of water vapor and trace gases in the air sample is measured and sent to a computer which quickly figures out the mass flux of the gas in question. This mass flux makes the FluxNet project a valuable tool to scientists trying to monitor long term changes in trace gas flux within the atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Absorption {{spectroscopy}} {{is useful}} in chemical analysis because of its specificity and its quantitative nature. The specificity of absorption spectra allows compounds to be distinguished from {{one another in a}} mixture, making absorption spectroscopy useful in wide variety of applications. For instance, <b>Infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> can be used to identify the presence of pollutants in the air, distinguishing the pollutant from nitrogen, oxygen, water and other expected constituents.|$|R
50|$|Like earlier <b>{{infrared}}</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers,</b> modern analyzers {{also use}} nondispersive infrared technology {{to detect a}} certain gas by detecting the absorption of infrared wavelengths that is characteristic of that <b>gas.</b> <b>Infrared</b> energy is emitted from a heated filament. By optically filtering the energy, the radiation spectrum {{is limited to the}} absorption band of the gas being measured. A detector measures the energy after the infrared energy has passed through the gas to be measured. This is compared to the energy at reference condition of no absorption.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the speed}} of sound varies with temperature, and is {{virtually}} stable with pressure change, ultrasonic anemometers are also used as thermometers.Two-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as weather stations, ship navigation, aviation, weather buoys and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3 Hz, easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the eddy covariance method when used with fast-response <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> or laser-based analyzers.|$|R
5000|$|Gas {{exchange}} {{measurements are}} important tools in plant science: this typically involves sealing the plant (or {{part of a}} plant) in a chamber and measuring changes in the concentration of carbon dioxide with an <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer.</b> If the environmental conditions (humidity, [...] concentration, light and temperature) are fully controlled, the measurements of [...] uptake and water release reveal important information about the [...] assimilation and transpiration rates. The intercellular [...] concentration reveals important information about the photosynthetic condition of the plants. Simpler methods {{can be used in}} specific circumstances: hydrogencarbonate indicator can be used to monitor the consumption of [...] in a solution containing a single plant leaf at different levels of light intensity, and oxygen generation by the pondweed Elodea can be measured by simply collecting the gas in a submerged test-tube containing a small piece of the plant.|$|E
5000|$|This sensor {{works because}} Infrared light is absorbed {{by a variety}} of gases at {{different}} wavelengths within the spectrum including methane, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and oxygen. To measure the concentration, a beam of light is emitted into the air sample. By measuring the difference between the input and output of the infrared beam, the sensor can determine the amount of the trace gases in the sample. [...] It is common for an <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> to have two configurations. The [...] "open design" [...] operates by shooting a beam of infrared light through the air outside of the sensor body. Meanwhile, the closed design works by sucking air into the sensor body measuring the concentration of trace gases inside of a sealed chamber. Usually, open sensors are placed within half a meter of the anemometer while closed sensors use a collection tube mounted inside the anemometer to get their air sample.|$|E

50|$|The {{efficiency}} of both {{light and dark}} reactions can be measured but {{the relationship between the}} two can be complex. For example, the ATP and NADPH energy molecules, created by the light reaction, can be used for carbon fixation or for photorespiration in C3 plants. Electrons may also flow to other electron sinks. For this reason, it is not uncommon for authors to differentiate between work done under non-photorespiratory conditions and under photorespiratory conditions. Chlorophyll fluorescence of photosystem II can measure the light reaction, and <b>Infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> can measure the dark reaction. It is also possible to investigate both at the same time using an integrated chlorophyll fluorometer and gas exchange system, or by using two separate systems together. <b>Infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> and some moisture sensors are sensitive enough to measure the photosynthetic assimilation of CO2, and of ΔH2O using reliable methods CO2 is commonly measured in μmols/m2/s−1, parts per million or volume per million and H20 is commonly measured in mmol/m2/s−1 or in mbars. By measuring CO2 assimilation, ΔH2O, leaf temperature, barometric pressure, leaf area, and photosynthetically active radiation or PAR, it becomes possible to estimate, “A” or carbon assimilation, “E” or transpiration, “gs” or stomatal conductance, and Ci or intracellular CO2. However, it is more common to used chlorophyll fluorescence for plant stress measurement, where appropriate, because the most commonly used measuring parameters FV/FM and Y(II) or F/FM’ can be made in a few seconds, allowing the measurement of larger plant populations.|$|R

The stability of the calibration coefficients is examined, and it is shown that frequent calibration of the <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> is required. Differences in the physical design of the analyzer models discussed here, such as sampling volume and sensitivity of the electronics to thermal drift, influence the precision of the flux estimates.

40|$|Open {{flow-through}} systems {{coupled to}} <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> have been frequently {{employed in the}} study of CO 2 exchange transients such as the postillumination burst observed in leaves of C 3 plants. A major limitation associated with use of such systems is their non-steady state response to rapid changes in leaf CO 2 exchange rate. A previous publication outlined a numerical approach to model the analyzer response as a function of CO 2 exchange rate and thus permit estimation of the postillumination burst (Peterson 1983 Plant Physiol 73 : 978 - 982). The model is critically analyzed {{within the framework of the}} physics of solute dispersion as previously described for linear flow systems. Thus, the numerical simulation is validated on the basis of physical principle. Additional improvements to the previous model are described which enhance the accuracy and efficiency of use of this technique for estimation of photorespiration...|$|R

40|$|Lacking {{knowledge}} about the spatial heterogeneity of heterotrophic soil respiration (Rh) hampers the prediction of larger-scale soil CO 2 efflux in patchy landscapes. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish a cost-efficient method for the rapid and simultaneous assessment of cumulative heterotrophic soil respiration (CO 2) at different sample spots. For this purpose, we adapted the laboratory-based, fully-automated Respicond VIII respirometer (Respicond) to detect CO 2 emission under field condition, installed the device in two temperate grasslands, and compared the Rh flux data with those obtained using the so-called dynamic chamber method with <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> (IRGA). The results revealed good agreement between both Rh measurements (Slope = 0. 89, R 2 = 0. 99). We conclude that adapting the Respicond for detection of CO 2 under field conditions is principally feasible, thus providing a new tool for the simultaneous assessment of CO 2 fluxes from different soil ecosystems...|$|R

In the laboratory, an original dynamic calibration bench was developed {{in order to test}} the frequency attenuation and pressure drop generated by filters. In the field, IRGAs equipped with different filters or different rain cups were installed and run and the real frequency response of the complete set-up was tested. The main results are that: – Filters may have a strong impact on the pressure drop in the GSS and this impact increases with flow rate. – On the contrary, no impact of the tested filters on cut off frequency was found, GSS with and without filters presenting similar cut off frequencies. – The main limiting factor of cut off frequency in the field was found to be the rain cup design. In addition, the impact of this design on pressure drop was also found noteworthy...|$|R
50|$|Photosynthesis systems use <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> (IRGAS) for {{measuring}} photosynthesis. CO2 concentration changes in leaf chambers are measured to provide carbon assimilation values for leaves or whole plants. Research {{has shown that}} the rate of photosynthesis {{is directly related to the}} amount of carbon assimilated by the plant. Measuring CO2 in the air, before it enters the leaf chamber, and comparing it to air measured for CO2 after it leaves the leaf chamber, provides this value using proven equations. These systems also use IRGAs, or solid state humidity sensors, {{for measuring}} H2O changes in leaf chambers. This is done to measure leaf transpiration, and to correct CO2 measurements. The light absorption spectrum for CO2 and H2O overlap somewhat, therefore, a correction is necessary for reliable CO2 measuring results. The critical measurement for most plant stress measurements is designated by “A” or carbon assimilation rate. When a plant is under stress, less carbon is assimilated. CO2 IRGAs are capable of measuring to approximately +/- 1 µmol or 1ppm of CO2.|$|R

40|$|Campbell Scientific Inc. has {{developed}} a new system for measuring CO 2 and H 2 O flux near {{the surface of the}} earth. This system, the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Gas</b> <b>Analyzer</b> and Sonic Anemometer (IRGASON) consists of two components. The first component is an <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzer</b> which measures the amount of the CO 2 and H 20 in the atmosphere at that point. The second component is a sonic anemometer, which measures wind speed in all three spatial directions. Though the IRGASON was designed for minimal interference with the wind, it was possible that the gas analyzer was affecting the air current, making the quality of the anemometeras measurements suspect. This experiment was designed to compare the anemometer on the IRGASON with a industry accepted anemometer, the CSAT 3, {{over the course of several}} months.

Energy balance closure was evaluated by statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes (sensible and latent heat (LE)) against available energy (net radiation, less the energy stored) and by solving for the energy balance ratio, the ratio of turbulent energy fluxes to available energy. These methods indicate {{a general lack of}} closure at most sites, with a mean imbalance in the order of 20 %. The imbalance was prevalent in all measured vegetation types and in climates ranging from Mediterranean to temperate and arctic. There were no clear differences between sites using open and closed path <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers.</b> At a majority of sites closure improved with turbulent intensity (friction velocity), but lack of total closure was still prevalent under most conditions.

This review focuses on the flux measurements of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) for agricultural systems and the development of standards and protocols for measuring them. Agroecosystems present unique challenges because they undergo large leaf area index (LAI) and canopy architecture changes in {{a relatively short period of}} time (i. e., months) coupled with the fact that many of the greenhouse gas sources are diffuse. This review examines all aspects of the theory and application of the micrometeorological techniques, with focus on the flux gradient, eddy accumulation and eddy covariance techniques. Instrument placement, sens or response and noise characteristics are also explored. Innovative applications of micrometeorological methods are discussed for closed- and open-path trace gas sensors and commonly used meteorological instrumentation. The use of fast response single-pass optical tunable diode laser (i. e., CH₄, N₂O) and <b>infrared</b> <b>gas</b> <b>analyzers</b> (i. e., CO₂, H₂O) is described.
