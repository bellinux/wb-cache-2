25|$|Pyridine {{is harmful}} if inhaled, {{swallowed}} or absorbed through the skin. Effects of acute pyridine intoxication include dizziness, headache, lack of coordination, nausea, salivation, {{and loss of}} appetite. They may progress into abdominal pain, pulmonary congestion and unconsciousness. One person died after accidental ingestion of <b>half</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> pyridine. The lowest known lethal dose (LDLo) for the ingestion of pyridine in humans is 500mg·kg−1. In high doses, pyridine has a narcotic effect and its vapor concentrations of above 3600ppm pose a health risk. The oral LD50 in rats is 891mg·kg−1. Pyridine is flammable.|$|E

When he had the water boiling, he put the tea into a tin pot and poured the water over it, and when it had stood a few minutes served it out. The verdict was universally unfavourable, and the chief, in disgust at having brought a tin of useless stuff so far, kicked it over and over. Seeing that Edgar had drunk up his portion with satisfaction, the sheik's wife told him that if he liked the nasty stuff he might keep it for himself, a permission of which he very thankfully availed himself.|$|E

50|$|A basic cacciatore recipe usually {{begins with}} a couple of tablespoons of olive oil heated in a large frying pan. Chicken parts, dusted with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The {{remaining}} fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> dry red wine.

Case Summary The patient, a 53 year-old married white female, was referred to a major university medical center in Kansas for evaluation of a chronic cough productive of large volumes of grossly purulent sputum. She had a history of recurrent respiratory infections that had resulted in five hospitalizations in the past year. In the months preceding her visit to the clinic, the patient reported producing one to one and <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>cups</b> <b>of</b> sputum daily and requiring 2. 5 liters of supplemental oxygen per minute for 12 hours each night. During her visit, she complained of a stabbing chest pain, believed by the examining physician to be pleuretic. Shortness of breath limited her daily activity considerably. Depleted by her illness, the patient reported an inability to perform most daily activities. As a result, she felt discouraged and experienced episodes of depression. Significant medical history included asthma, diagnosed 20 years earlier, an episode of pneumothorax, and suspected COPD. Although the patient had quit smoking eleven years previously, her smoking history was estimated at 60 - 70 pack years. Family history revealed that both parents had been smokers and were diagnosed with emphysema; the patient’s mother died of lung cancer at the age of 64. Upon pulmonary examination, bilateral breath sounds were audible with a few expiratory wheezes at the lung bases; there were no rales. Chest x-rays revealed very prominent bronchial markings consistent with chronic bronchitis and possibly bronchiectasis; no acute infiltrates were identified. Pulmonary function tests (Table 1) indicated a markedly increased residual volume, slightly elevated total lung capacity, and moderately decreased transport factor (diffusion capacity). 1...|$|R
