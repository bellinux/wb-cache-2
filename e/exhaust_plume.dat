5|$|The United States Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) and the United States Department of Defense Space Test Program (STP) {{conducted}} the Charged Aerosol Release Experiment (CARE) on September 19, 2009, using exhaust particles from a Black Brant XII suborbital sounding rocket launched from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility {{to create an}} artificial noctilucent cloud. The cloud was to be observed {{over a period of}} weeks or months by ground instruments and the Spatial Heterodyne IMager for MEsospheric Radicals (SHIMMER) instrument on the NRL/STP STPSat-1 spacecraft. The rocket's <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> was observed and reported to news organizations in the United States from New Jersey to Massachusetts.|$|E

(2009) {{contend that}} the impact {{was caused by a}} comet because of the {{sightings}} of noctilucent clouds following the impact, a phenomenon caused by massive amounts of water vapor in the upper atmosphere. They compared the noctilucent cloud phenomenon to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> from NASA's Endeavour space shuttle.|$|E

40|$|Supersonic {{travel is}} not allowed over {{populated}} areas due to the disturbance caused by the sonic boom. Research has been performed on sonic boom reduction and has included {{the contribution of the}} <b>exhaust</b> nozzle <b>plume.</b> Plume effect on sonic boom has progressed from the study of isolated nozzles to a study with four <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> integrated with a wing-body vehicle. This report provides a baseline analysis of the generic wing-body vehicle to demonstrate the effect of the nozzle exhaust on the near-field pressure profile. Reductions occurred in the peak-to-peak magnitude of the pressure profile for a swept wing-body vehicle. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> also had a favorable effect as the nozzles were moved outward along the wing-span...|$|R
40|$|Electric-field (EF) and {{radio-frequency}} (RF) emissions {{generated in}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> of the diagnostic testbed facility thruster (DTFT) and the SSME are examined briefly for potential applications to plume diagnostics and engine health monitoring. Hypothetically, anomalous engine conditions could produce measurable changes in any characteristic EF and RF spectral signatures identifiable with a 'healthly' plumes. Tests to determine the presence of EF and RF emissions in the DTFT and SSME <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> were conducted. EF and RF emissions were detected using state-of-the-art sensors. Analysis of limited data sets show some apparent consistencies in spectral signatures. Significant emissions increases were detected during controlled tests using dopants injected into the DTFT...|$|R
25|$|Infrared shoulder-fired {{missiles}} {{are designed to}} home-in on a heat source on an aircraft, typically the engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume,</b> and detonate a warhead {{in or near the}} heat source to disable the aircraft. These missiles use passive guidance, meaning that they do not emit signals to detect a heat source, which makes them difficult to detect by targeted aircraft employing countermeasure systems.|$|E
25|$|Shuttle Exhaust Ion Turbulence Experiments (SEITE) – The crew of Atlantis {{carried out}} the SEITE burn on Flight Day 11. SEITE uses {{instrumentation}} on The Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite for in situ observations of density and electric field disturbances caused by the shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume.</b> The scope of the research is to enhance the surveillance of space, real-time characterization, detection and tracking and timely surveillance of high interest objects.|$|E
25|$|An {{increase}} in cloud droplet number {{due to the}} introduction of aerosol acts to reduce the cloud droplet size, as the same amount of water is divided between more droplets. This has the effect of suppressing precipitation, increasing the cloud lifetime, known as the cloud lifetime aerosol effect, second indirect effect or Albrecht effect. This has been observed as the suppression of drizzle in ship <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> compared to ambient clouds, and inhibited precipitation in biomass burning plumes. This cloud lifetime effect is classified as a climate feedback (rather than a radiative forcing) by the IPCC due to the interdependence between it and the hydrological cycle. However, it has previously been classified as a negative radiative forcing.|$|E

40|$|Results are {{presented}} on the aerodynamic {{characteristics of the}} Magellan spacecraft during the October 1994 Termination Experiment, including {{the effects of the}} thruster engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> upon the molecular free stream around the spacecraft and upon the aerodynamics coefficients. As Magellan passed through the Venusian atmosphere, the solar arrays were turned in opposite directions relative to the free stream creating a torque on the spacecraft. The spacecraft control system was programmed to counter the effects of this torque with attitude control engines to maintain an inertially fixed attitude. The orientation and reaction engine telemetry returned from Magellan are used to create a model of the aerodynamic torques. Geometric models of the Magellan spacecraft are analyzed with the aid of both free molecular and Direct Simulation Monte Carlo codes. The simulated aerodynamic torques determined are compared to the measured torques. The Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method is also used to model the attitude engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes,</b> the free stream disturbance caused by these plumes, and the resulting torques acting on the spacecraft compared to no-exhaust plume cases. The effect of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> was found to be sufficiently large that thrust reversal is possible...|$|R

25|$|More bands {{provide more}} {{discrete}} information, or greater resolution. The characteristic emission and absorption spectra serve to fingerprint or define {{the makeup of}} the feature that was observed. A radiometric plot represents the radiant intensity versus time; there can be plots at multiple bands or wavelengths. For each point along a time-intensity radiometric plot, a spectral plot can be generated {{based on the number of}} spectral bands in the collector, such as the radiant intensity plot of a missile <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> as the missile is in flight. The intensity or brightness of the object is a function of several conditions including its temperature, surface properties or material, and how fast it is moving. Remember that additional, non-electro-optical sensors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, can correlate with these bands.|$|E
25|$|In {{the interim}} and {{following}} {{two days of}} debriefings, EPA representatives granted permission on July 27, 1977, {{to proceed with the}} de-drumming of the HO stored at Johnston Atoll. This authorization specified that only half of the capacity of the Vulcanus could be loaded without a formal go-ahead from the EPA, because if the data from the first burn did not meet EPA specifications, {{the second half of the}} ship would have to be loaded with diesel fuel and a burn of 50 percent HO and 50 percent diesel would have to be conducted. During the first burn, the incinerator was extinguished by an unknown liquid at which time a cloud of <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> engulfed the ship. To insure no harm occurred to the crew or monitors, complete physicals were given to 26 people at the Johnston Atoll dispensary while the ship was being loaded for the second burn.|$|E
500|$|By 1 July, the {{regiment}} had 18 Pe-8s for deployment {{during the early}} phase of the Battle of Kursk. The long-range aviation units continued to attack targets in the German rear areas at night, supporting the Soviet ground offensive in the Orel Bulge, called Operation Kutuzov, that began on 12 July. The Germans had transferred the nightfighters of the Fourth Group of Nightfighter Wing 5 (IV./Nachtjagdgeschwader 5), flying a mix of Junkers Ju 88 and Dornier Do 217 aircraft, to counter the Soviet raids near the Orel area. Initially, the night fighters were ineffective against the Soviet raids, until the deployment of their ground radar [...] "eyes". Once the Germans had use of their radar, after the night of 17–18 July, Soviet losses increased sharply. Although the Germans flew only fourteen sorties that night, they claimed eight kills. On the night of 20–21 July, Captain (Hauptmann) Heinrich Prinz zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, commander of IV./NJG 5, shot down three himself. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> of the ASh-82 engine {{may have been a}} contributing factor; the engines lacked flame dampening exhausts, making their plume visible from a distance. Despite its losses, the 746th was re-designated as the 25th Long-Range Guards Aviation Regiment (GAPDD) on 18 September 1943 in recognition of its achievements.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s Dr. Huffman was Program Manager for Project Chaser, {{a series of}} {{launches}} of Aerobee 170 sounding rockets from Vandenberg AFB Probe Launch Complex C. The purpose of Project Chaser was to measure <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> from anti-ballistic missile systems launched simultaneously with Project Chaser.|$|R
50|$|Missile Defense Alarm System was {{a series}} of Air Force {{satellites}} flown between 1960 and 1966 for infrared detection of ballistic missile <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> on Atlas-Agena A, B, and D. There were several failures and overall program performance was poor, but it would give way to the more successful DSP satellites.|$|R
2500|$|Maxime Faget, the {{designer}} of the Mercury LES, {{was on the other}} hand less-than-enthusiastic about this setup. Aside from the possibility of the ejection seats seriously injuring the astronauts, they would also only be usable for about 40 seconds after liftoff, by which point the booster would be attaining Mach 1 speed and ejection would no longer be possible. He was also concerned about the astronauts being launched through the Titan's <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> if they ejected in-flight and later added that [...] "The best thing about Gemini was that they never had to make an escape." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Autolycus {{detected}} fumes {{from the}} submarine, {{rather than the}} hull, it could detect {{the passage of a}} submarine for some time after it had passed. This aided searching, as it did not need to pass directly overhead. [...] A zig-zag search pattern was flown, passing at right-angles over the likely direction of submarine movements. When an <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume</b> was detected, the aircraft would begin to fly a tracking pattern of progressively shorter zig-zags. Each crossing of the plume trail would be plotted, giving a map plot of the submarine's likely track. As the track was narrowed down, the aircraft would switch sensors to a more precise method, such as centimetric radar or dropping sonobuoys before potentially closing for an attack.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combustion}} burner {{reached a}} temperature of [...] The alcohol-water fuel was pumped along the double wall of the main combustion burner. This regenerative cooling heated the fuel and cooled the combustion chamber. The fuel was then pumped into the main burner chamber through 1,224 nozzles, which assured the correct mixture of alcohol and oxygen at all times. Small holes also permitted some alcohol to escape directly into the combustion chamber, forming a cooled boundary layer that further protected {{the wall of the}} chamber, especially at the throat where the chamber was narrowest. The boundary layer alcohol ignited on contact with the atmosphere, accounting for the long, diffuse <b>exhaust</b> <b>plume.</b> By contrast, later, post-V-2 engine designs not employing this alcohol boundary layer cooling show a translucent plume with shock diamonds.|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} few seconds {{of the space shuttle}} trajectory, the solid rocket {{boosters}} will be in the proximity of the launch pad. Because of the launch pad structures and the surface of the earth, the turbulent mixing experienced by the exhaust gases will be greatly increased over that for the free flight situation. In addition, a system will be present, designed to protect the lifting vehicle from launch structure vibrations, which will inject quantities of liquid water into the hot plume. The effects of these two phenomena on the temperatures, chemical composition, and flow field present in the afterburning solid rocket motor <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> of the space shuttle were studied. Results are included from both a computational model of the afterburning and supporting measurements from Titan 3 <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> taken at Kennedy Space Center with infrared scanned radiometers...|$|R

40|$|A {{radiant heat}} {{transfer}} computer {{program has been}} developed by R-AERO-A to calculate radiation from inhomogeneous gases prevalent in Saturn-type <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes.</b> The radiating species considered in this computer program are water vapor, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and carbon particles. The infrared spectral absorption characteristics of these species have been determined under NASA contract. Band model parameters {{have been used to}} represent the infrared spectral absorption coefficients over 25 cm-I increments. A modified Curtis-Goodson approximation is used in the inhomogeneous heat transfer calculation. This has been shown to give satisfactory results over the temperature and pressure range of interest in Saturn <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes.</b> Results are shown for the Saturn-type engines for specific flow field assumptions. Some comparison with experimental spectroscopic data will also be presented.

40|$|Lightning Attach Point {{tests were}} {{conducted}} for the space shuttle launch configuration (Orbiter, External Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters).

The orbiter main engine and SRB <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> were simulated electrically with physical models coated with graded resistance paints. The tests showed that the <b>exhaust</b> <b>plumes</b> from the SRB provide additional protection for the main engine nozzles. However, the tests showed that the Orbiter Thermal Protection System (TPS), which has also been shown to be vulnerable to lightning damage, may be struck during launch. Therefore further work is indicated in the areas of swept stroke studies on the model and on TPS panels. Further attach point testing is also indicated on the free-flying orbiter. Photographs of the test setup are shown...|$|R
