5|$|When {{asked how}} he, {{as the son}} of Holocaust survivors, felt about Israel’s {{operation}} in Gaza, Finkelstein replied:It {{has been a long time}} since I <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> emotional connection with the state of Israel, which relentlessly and brutally and inhumanly keeps these vicious, murderous wars. It is a vandal state. There is a Russian writer who once described vandal states as Genghis Khan with a telegraph. Israel is Genghis Khan with a computer. I feel no emotion of affinity with that state. I have some good friends and their families there, and of course I would not want any of them to be hurt. That said, sometimes I feel that Israel has come out of the boils (sic) of the hell, a satanic state.|$|E

Although most agreed that Iraq was years away {{from being able to}} build a nuclear weapon, the Iranians and the Israelis <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent nuclear fallout. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the United Nations Charter (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.|$|E
25|$|Granger {{was first}} noticed {{in a small}} stage {{production}} in Hollywood by a Goldwyn casting director, and given {{a significant role in}} The North Star, a controversial film praising the Soviet Union at the height of World War II, but later condemned for its political bias. Another war film, The Purple Heart, followed, before Granger's naval service in Honolulu, in a unit that arranged troop entertainment in the Pacific. Here he made useful contacts, including Bob Hope, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. It was also where he began exploring his bisexuality, which he said he never <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> need to conceal.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1910s and early 1920s, tribal revolt led by Kurdish {{chieftain}} Simko Shikak swept across Iranian Kurdistan. Although elements of Kurdish nationalism {{were present in}} the movement, historians agree they were hardly articulate enough to justify a claim that recognition of Kurdish identity was a major issue in Simko's movement, and he had to rely heavily on conventional tribal motives. Government forces and non-Kurds were not the only ones to have allegedly been attacked, the Kurdish population was also robbed and assaulted. The fighters do not appear to have <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> sense of unity or solidarity with fellow Kurds. Kurdish insurgency and seasonal migrations in the late 1920s, along with long-running tensions between Tehran and Ankara, resulted in border clashes and even military penetrations in both Iranian and Turkish territory. Two regional powers have used Kurdish tribes as tool for own political benefits: Turkey has provided military help and refuge for anti-Iranian Turcophone Shikak rebels in 1918–1922, while Iran did the same during Ararat rebellion against Turkey in 1930. Reza Shah's military victory over Kurdish and Turkic tribal leaders initiaded with a brutally repressive era toward non-Iranian minorities. Government's forced detribalization and sedentarization in the 1920s and 1930s resulted with many other tribal revolts in Iranian regions of Azerbaijan, Luristan and Kurdistan. In particular case of the Kurds, this repressive policies partly contributed to developing nationalism among some tribes.|$|E

[...] According to Bill Bishop {{in his account}} of Stengel, [...] "Casey did use language that would certainly be considered offensive today, but was quite common vernacular in the fifties. He was effusive in his praise of black players like Satchel Paige, Larry Doby and Howard." [...] Conscious of changing times, Stengel was more careful in his choice of words while with the Mets.|$|E
500|$|When {{industrial}} metal {{climbed the}} charts {{of the late}} 1990s, its sudden popularity was met with negative reactions from the early innovators of industrial music.

500|$|In 132, Zhang Heng {{presented}} to the Han court what many historians consider to be his most impressive invention, the first seismoscope. A seismoscope records the motions of Earth's shaking, but unlike a seismometer, it does not retain a time record of those motions. It was named [...] "earthquake weathervane" [...] (houfeng didongyi 候風地動儀), and {{it was able to}} roughly determine [...] the direction (out of eight directions) where the earthquake came from. According to the Book of Later Han (compiled by Fan Ye in the 5thcentury), his bronze urn-shaped device, with a swinging pendulum inside, was able to detect the direction of an earthquake hundreds of miles/kilometers away. This was essential for the Han government in sending quick aid and relief to regions devastated by this natural disaster. The Book of Later Han records that, on one occasion, Zhang's device was triggered, though no observer had <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> seismic disturbance; several days later a messenger arrived from the west and reported that an earthquake had occurred in Longxi (modern Gansu Province), the same direction that Zhang's device had indicated, and thus the court was forced to admit the efficacy of the device.|$|E
500|$|He {{explained}} [...] "the {{goal is to}} try to make it {{an engaging}} movie where you get some of the psychology and kind of bring a freshness but also keep the classic nature of Alice." [...] On prior versions, Burton said [...] "It was always a girl wandering around from one crazy character to another, and I never really <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> real emotional connection." [...] His goal with the new film is to give the story [...] "some framework of emotional grounding" [...] and [...] "to try and make Alice feel more like a story as opposed to a series of events." [...] Burton focused on the poem [...] "Jabberwocky" [...] as part of his structure, and refers to the described creature by the name of the poem rather than by the name [...] "Jabberwock" [...] used in the poem. Burton also stated that he does not see his version as either a sequel to any existing Alice film nor as a [...] "re-imagining". However, the idea of the climax of the story being Alice's battle with the Queen's champion, the Jabberwocky, was first added in the video game American McGee's Alice, and the landscape, tower, weapons and appearance of Alice in those scenes of the film are very reminiscent of the same scenes in the game.|$|E
500|$|Sherlock Holmes {{has been}} adapted {{numerous}} times for both films and plays, {{and the character}} has been played by over 70 different actors in more than 200 films. A number of film and television series have borne the title [...] "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes", but {{some of these are}} either original stories, combinations of a number of Doyle's stories, or in one case, an adaptation of The Sign of the Four. Irene Adler, who is in the first short story, [...] "A Scandal in Bohemia", is prominent in many modern adaptations, despite only appearing in one story. Often in modern adaptations, she is portrayed as a love interest for Holmes, as in Robert Doherty's Elementary and the BBC's Sherlock, even though in the story itself, the narration claims: [...] "It was not that he <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> emotion akin to love for Irene Adler." [...] Many of the stories from the collection were included as episodes in the Granada Television series, Sherlock Holmes which ran from 1984 until 1994. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1990–1991, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Bert Coules was the head writer, but stories were also written by Vincent McInerny and Peter Mackie, and directed by Patrick Rayner and Enyd Williams.|$|E

500|$|The Quatermass Experiment was a six-part serial {{broadcast}} by BBC Television in 1953. Written by Nigel Kneale, {{it was an}} enormous success with critics and audiences alike, later described by film historian Robert Simpson as [...] "event television, emptying the streets and pubs". Among its viewers was Hammer Films producer Anthony Hinds, who was immediately keen to buy the rights for a film version. Incorporated in 1934, Hammer had developed a niche for itself making second features, {{many of which were}} adaptations of successful BBC Radio productions. Hammer contacted the BBC on 24 August 1953, two days after the transmission of the final episode, to enquire about the film rights. Nigel Kneale also saw the potential for a film adaptation and, at his urging, the BBC touted the scripts around a number of producers, including the Boulting Brothers and Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. [...] Kneale met with Sidney Gilliat to discuss the scripts but Gilliat was reluctant to buy the rights as he <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> film adaptation would inevitably receive an ‘X’ Certificate from the British Board of Film Censors (BBFC), restricting admission to persons over the age of sixteen. Hammer were not so reticent, deciding from the outset that they would deliberately pursue an ‘X’ Certificate. Hammer's offer met some resistance within the BBC, with one executive expressing reservations that The Quatermass Experiment was not suitable material for the company, but the rights were nevertheless sold for an advance of £500.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} by video game journalists upon its release. ZX Spectrum magazines Crash and ZX Computing awarded Cauldron II their top accolades: [...] "Crash Smash" [...] and [...] "Monster Hit", respectively. Similar {{to the first}} Cauldron, praise from the video game press focused on the graphical quality, and criticism directed at the gameplay was mixed. Computer and Video Games reviewer Paul Boughton praised {{the size of the}} game world, but criticized the audio quality of the Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum versions, citing the limited capabilities of the two systems. In concluding his review, Boughton <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> version of the game would be worth purchasing. Phil South of Your Sinclair praised the game's presentation and design, calling the graphics [...] "lovely" [...] and the platform gameplay [...] "original". ZX Computing reviewer praised the audio-visuals, and recommended the title for fans of the previous game. A Crash magazine reviewer lauded the audio-visuals of the ZX Spectrum version and commented that the gameplay offered more than its predecessor's. The reviewer described Cauldron II as difficult, but felt that the sense of accomplishment gained from successful completion outweighed the negative aspect. Computer Gamers reviewer criticized the bouncing gameplay, citing unpredictable reactions and difficulty in navigating around tough enemies. Rich Pelley and Jon Pillar of Your Sinclair echoed similar comments. Retro Gamer writer Craig Grannell described the game's difficulty as the [...] "only real criticism". The ZX Computing reviewer also criticized the bouncing aspect, but praised the overall game design as enjoyable. Phil King, another Crash reviewer, praised the Silverbird re-release. He called the graphics [...] "colorful" [...] and [...] "well-animated", and felt that the game was of good value despite an excessive difficulty.

[...] Mayor Tom Bradley's office announced that he would no longer attend meetings at either the Jonathan or the California clubs.

2500|$|Neon Ballroom was an {{overhaul}} of the band's musical style found on its first two albums, Frogstomp and Freak Show.

Eight years after the album's release, Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns said: [...] "To me, I honestly feel like our first record was Neon Ballroom. I've never <b>felt</b> <b>any</b> different.
