50|$|Hydrostatic {{transmissions}} {{have many}} benefits; however, {{they are not}} usually suited to machines that travel at higher speeds over longer distances. The hydrostatic drive {{may have been a}} contributing factor in abandoning the project. Changes in the way earthmoving is done, including the use of excavators and <b>dumptrucks,</b> has also eroded the market for scrapers. Therefore, this machine exhibited many revolutionary design concepts but was probably too costly to put into production in a declining market sector.|$|R

50|$|The {{existence}} in Alberta of {{large quantities of}} surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand {{has been known for}} many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of synthetic crude oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as Syncrude, began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the oil sand was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and <b>dumptrucks</b> to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, hydroprocessing, hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand {{in the world and the}} largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.|$|R

5000|$|In 2016 the XCMG company {{launched}} their modern <b>dumptruck</b> model called the XCMG DE400 {{which is no}} less than 400 tonnes (empty) making it apparently the most massive land vehicle ever and its also the largest Chinese construction vehicle ever built in production today considered by many a World Record in 2017.|$|E
5000|$|After {{almost three}} years (and $40,000 in legal fees) <b>Dumptruck</b> {{received}} a default judgment against Big Time Records when the label's attorneys failed {{to appear in court}} for a hearing.

5000|$|In 1973 {{the firm}} {{designed}} and produced an allnew massive 60 Ton (when empty) original <b>dumptruck</b> model locally called the JIEFANG CA-390 {{much of it}} was inspired by former large Russian dumptrucks such as the largest models produced by BELAZ and MOAZ of the 1970s. The then large JIEFANG CA-390 was powered with a Chinese Chingfa C2956 V12 [...] diesel engine that produced enough power to match several other similar dumptrucks at that time and its production was targeted as a quarry and mine vehicle, these are designed to carry 105 Tonnes of material when fully loaded so it became quite popular as the largest mining <b>dumptruck</b> available in China during the 1970s and 1980s. This was also the biggest original road vehicle ever made in China at that time until its production ended some time in the late 1970s of which some are still used as a cheap alternative mining <b>dumptruck</b> to run. Later FAW JMC or also known as Jiefang Motor Company also manufactured under licence from the Mitsubishi Motors of Japan, the former original Japanese MITSUBISHI Fuso F-Series heavy lorry 1980s-1990s model range with some minor changes but powered by modern Chinese made running gear & mechanicals for the Asian/Oriental market and it is now one of China's most important and successful heavy vehicle manufacturers and JMC has cooperated and worked closely with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries or MHI of Japan ever since.|$|E
