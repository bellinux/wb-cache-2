5|$|In March 2015, NASA {{scientists}} reported that, for {{the first}} time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the Universe, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds, according to the scientists.|$|E

5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, {{have also been}} formed in the laboratory under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E

5|$|In theory, radon is more {{reactive}} than xenon, {{and therefore}} should form chemical bonds {{more easily than}} xenon does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in practice.|$|E
5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the cross-sectional {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch. Sea stacks and pinnacles, such as Old Harry Rocks at Handfast Point, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> by erosion of the chalk cliffs.|$|E
50|$|Standard Steel Propeller <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in 1918 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Hamilton Aero Manufacturing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in 1920 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by Thomas F.

5|$|In March 2015, complex DNA and RNA nucleotides, {{including}} uracil, cytosine and thymine, {{were reportedly}} {{formed in the}} laboratory under outer space conditions, using starter chemicals, such as pyrimidine, an organic compound commonly found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), {{is one of the}} most carbon-rich compounds found in the Universe and may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in red giants or in interstellar dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a dry period during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} the dust {{responsible}} for the nebulosity is not uniformly distributed, but is concentrated mainly in two layers {{along the line of}} sight to the cluster. These layers may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> by deceleration due to radiation pressure as the dust has moved towards the stars.|$|E

5|$|The North Complex is a {{collection}} of several landforms, including craters, that were thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> by volcanic activity. Although the Apollo 15 astronauts were to visit this feature, they were unable to do so due to time constraints and time-consuming issues in obtaining core samples.|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} show {{extremely}} low chemical reactivity; consequently, {{only a few}} hundred noble gas compounds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed.</b> Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not been formed (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor reactivity. The reactivity follows the order Ne < He < Ar < Kr < Xe < Rn.|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> {{near the}} Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris may have been triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests {{that it would have been}} in the vicinity of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle. As a result of these threats, Edward was moved around to other locations in secret for a period, before returning to permanent custody at the castle in the late summer of 1327. The political situation remained unstable, and new plots appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> to free him.|$|E
5|$|Fra Mauro {{is thought}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> from ejecta, or debris, from the impact which formed Mare Imbrium. During Apollo 14, the crew members sampled ejecta from Cone crater, a feature close in {{proximity}} to the immediate landing site of the mission, which provided insight into the composition of material deep inside the formation. Data from the mission has helped to determine the approximate age of Mare Imbrium, suggesting {{that it is no}} more than about 4.25 billion years old.|$|E
5|$|Fumarolic {{activity}} affects {{surrounding rocks}} and pyroclastics. Carbonates, opal, and white covers of possibly aluminum sulfate and calcium sulfate <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed.</b> Gypsum formed from the sulfur {{of the volcano}} {{is found in the}} form of crystals in the upper valleys of Taftan. Sinter and hydrothermally altered rocks are found farther down. Minerals formed by alteration processes include alunite, calcite, cristobalite, illite, jarosite, kaolinite, pyrophyllite, quartz, smectite, sulfur and tridymite. Some epithermal mineralizations have been identified around Taftan. Other secondary factors at Taftan include lahars.|$|E

5|$|In Scotland, {{where she}} {{is also known as}} Beira, Queen of Winter, she is {{credited}} with making numerous mountains and large hills, which are said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> when she was striding across the land and accidentally dropped rocks from her creel or wicker basket. In other cases she is said to have built the mountains intentionally, to serve as her stepping stones. She carries a hammer for shaping the hills and valleys, and {{is said to be the}} mother of all the goddesses and gods.|$|E
5|$|In Western societies, the {{domestic}} guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household pet since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature; friendly, even affectionate responsiveness to handling and feeding; {{and the relative}} ease of caring for them, continue to make guinea pigs a popular pet. Organizations devoted to competitive breeding of guinea pigs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> worldwide, and many specialized breeds of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, {{giving rise to}} many impacts {{over a period of}} a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> 300,000 years apart.|$|E
