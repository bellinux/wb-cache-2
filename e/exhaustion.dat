5|$|Bowman {{argued that}} the {{authorized}} sale of the seeds extinguished the patent, and that Bowman merely used seeds legitimately purchased from the silo. He claimed that the Federal Circuit had created {{an exception to the}} <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine, and that this decision was properly for Congress to decide. Monsanto {{argued that the}} second-generation seeds were not subject to <b>exhaustion</b> because they had not existed until Bowman created them and had not been sold at the time of infringement. He noted that even when <b>exhaustion</b> applied, it did not allow one to create new copies of the patented product, which the second-generation seeds were.|$|E
5|$|Commentators noted, however, {{that the}} Court's ruling was narrow in scope, {{and did not}} set a broad legal {{precedent}} {{with respect to the}} applicability of the doctrine of patent <b>exhaustion</b> to self-replicating technologies.|$|E
5|$|Innis's war was over. His biographer, John Watson, {{notes the}} {{physical}} wound took {{seven years to}} heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous <b>exhaustion</b> because of his military service.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Keyblade War begins and the player battles four Foretellers before {{collapsing}} in <b>exhaustion.</b> The war ends with numerous Keyblades {{planted in the}} ground, forming the Keyblade Graveyard and with the player's character laying {{in the middle of}} the graveyard (presumably dying) while Chirithy, Skuld, and Ephemer approach them.|$|E
5|$|A ridge soaring pilot uses upward air {{movements}} caused {{when the wind}} blows on {{to the sides of}} hills. It can also be augmented by thermals when the slopes also face the sun. In places where a steady wind blows, a ridge may allow virtually unlimited time aloft, although records for duration are no longer recognized because of the danger of <b>exhaustion.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{its journey}} across the {{maritime}} plain to Isdud, the Anzac Mounted Division captured many prisoners but met no large organised Ottoman force. As the day progressed, the captured Ottoman units {{were found to}} be increasingly disorganised with many soldiers suffering severely from thirst and <b>exhaustion</b> and some from dysentery.|$|E
5|$|He {{was treated}} for <b>exhaustion</b> during 2011 and then was hospitalized after a serious fall in December 2011 {{on his way to}} {{participate}} in a live C-SPAN program about his 1972 presidential campaign. By January 2012, he was promoting his latest book, What It Means to Be a Democrat. He was hospitalized again in April 2012 due to fainting spells.|$|E
5|$|His head {{hangs in}} <b>exhaustion,</b> {{and his hands}} bleed from the {{puncture}} wounds suffered during his nailing to the cross. His arms are placed higher above his head and strain to carry {{the weight of his}} body, which visibly slumps. His body takes on a dramatic, almost feminine curve, the result of the contortions forced upon a body nailed to a vertical support.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{evacuations}} continued {{from other}} area hospitals that were flooded or damaged. Reports from the Methodist Hospital indicated {{that people were}} dying of dehydration and <b>exhaustion</b> while the staff worked unendingly in horrendous conditions. The {{first floor of the}} hospital flooded and the dead were stacked in a second floor operating room. Patients requiring ventilators were kept alive with hand-powered resuscitation bags.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Berry toured Europe, with {{stops in}} Sweden, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Ireland, Switzerland, Poland and Spain. In mid-2008, he {{played at the}} Virgin Festival in Baltimore, Maryland. During a concert on New Year's Day 2011 in Chicago, Berry, {{suffering}} from <b>exhaustion,</b> passed out {{and had to be}} helped off stage.|$|E
5|$|In April 2012 Edwards {{announced}} his resignation {{at the end}} of his twelfth season with the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra, citing <b>exhaustion</b> from the commutes between Olympia and Portland as the reason. He has been named Conductor Emeritus and Principal Guest Conductor and returned for the 2012–2013 season finale concert.|$|E
5|$|In the water, {{several of}} the crew — most notably Lieutenant, junior grade, Stanton F. Kalk, the officer-of-the-deck when the torpedo struck — began to get men {{out of the water}} and into the life rafts. Kalk worked in the cold Atlantic water to {{equalize}} the load among the various rafts, but died of <b>exhaustion</b> and exposure.|$|E
5|$|Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle's {{grave in}} the forest, but is frightened {{away by the}} arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. The Wilis, led by their merciless queen Myrtha, haunt the forest at night to seek revenge on any man they encounter, forcing their victims to dance until they die of <b>exhaustion.</b>|$|E
5|$|On June 10, 2012, Jackson took {{a medical}} {{leave of absence}} from the House, citing <b>exhaustion.</b> On July 11, 2012, Jackson's office said he was being treated for a mood {{disorder}} at a residential treatment facility. His office denied speculation that he was being treated for alcoholism. On August 13, 2012 it was confirmed by numerous news outlets that Jackson was being treated for bipolar disorder.|$|E
5|$|Some {{have speculated}} that a {{contributor}} to nouvelle cuisine was World War II when animal protein was in short supply during the German occupation. By the mid-1980s food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached <b>exhaustion</b> and many chefs began returning to the haute cuisine style of cooking, {{although much of the}} lighter presentations and new techniques remained.|$|E
5|$|The Hessian forces lost 22 {{killed in}} action, 83 wounded, and 896 capturedincluding the wounded. The Americans {{suffered}} only two deaths from bare feet causing frostbite and five wounded from battle, including a near-fatal wound to future president James Monroe. Other losses incurred by the Patriots due to <b>exhaustion,</b> exposure, and illness {{in the following}} days may have raised their losses above those of the Hessians.|$|E
5|$|The Royal party {{arrived at}} the Gare de l'Est train station in Paris in the pre-dawn hours of August 10, rejoined by Macfarlane. Most {{of the first day}} they {{remained}} in their suite, recovering from travel <b>exhaustion.</b> They soon ventured out to see to the Auteuil Hippodrome, and stopped by various concert halls.|$|E
5|$|The {{analysis}} of the satellite communication relies on {{a limited number of}} data points that were analysed using innovative techniques that were only developed after the incident. The analysis has worked to determine useful information about in-flight events and the location of Flight370 at the 08:19MYT signal—believed to have occurred near the time of fuel <b>exhaustion</b> and thus is close to the final location of Flight370.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} had by {{now been}} fighting almost continuously throughout the summer. According to divisional commander Hampel, {{it had been}} exhausted even before Operation Hackfleisch began. The cumulative effect of this <b>exhaustion,</b> the deteriorating situation that the Germans faced on all fronts and rumours probably spread among members by the Partisans and Ustaše, was that the division began to disintegrate in early September 1944.|$|E
5|$|The log-on message {{sent from}} the {{aircraft}} at 08:19:29 {{was not immediately}} well understood. The 02:25 handshake was also initiated by the aircraft. Only a few reasons that the SDU would transmit a log-on message exist, such as a power interruption, software failure, loss of critical systems providing input to the SDU, or a loss of the link due to aircraft attitude. Investigators consider the most likely reason to be that they were sent during power-up after an electrical outage. At 08:19, the aircraft had been airborne for 7h 38min; the typical Kuala Lumpur-Beijing flight is 5hours and fuel <b>exhaustion</b> was likely. In the event of fuel <b>exhaustion</b> and engine flame-out, the aircraft's ram air turbine would deploy, providing power to various instruments and flight controls, including the SDU. Approximately 90seconds after the 02:25 handshake, communications from the aircraft's inflight entertainment system were recorded in the ground station log. Similar messages would be expected following the 08:19 handshake but none were received, supporting the fuel starvation scenario.|$|E
5|$|These {{polarization}} detectors {{are sensitive}} in the ultraviolet {{region of the}} light spectrum. In some army ant species, a group of foragers who become separated from the main column may sometimes turn back on themselves and form a circular ant mill. The workers may then run around continuously until they die of <b>exhaustion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vegetation {{is typical}} of the Sahara-Sahel region, and is mainly desert with thorny steppe land. Soil erosion is a problem, as many {{previously}} wooded areas have disappeared as the locals use wood for fuel, and inadequate farming practices have sometimes resulted in soil <b>exhaustion.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the {{remnants}} of Khal Drogo's khalasar, Daenerys Targaryen crosses the Red Waste hoping to find shelter. The trip is hard, with her newborn dragons unwilling to eat the meat they are offered, and horses dying of <b>exhaustion.</b> Finally, Daenerys sends riders on their remaining horses to explore in three separate directions.|$|E
5|$|After {{performing}} three warm-up {{shows at}} Cafe Wha? in New York City, Henson Studios in Hollywood, California, and The Forum in Inglewood, California, Van Halen began their A Different Kind of Truth Tour in Louisville, Kentucky on February 18. This tour consisted of 46 shows, ending on June 26 in New Orleans, {{and was the}} eighth most lucrative concert tour of 2012, with a total gross of $54,425,548 and attendance of 522,296. A second North American leg was cancelled, with the band claiming <b>exhaustion.</b> This {{was followed by the}} postponement of three Japanese concerts, as Eddie underwent emergency surgery to treat diverticulitis.|$|E
5|$|Agharta {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan by CBS/Sony in August 1975 just before Davis temporarily retired due to increasingly poor health and <b>exhaustion.</b> At the record label's suggestion, it was titled after the legendary subterranean city. Davis enlisted Japanese artist Tadanori Yokoo to design its artwork, which depicted the cityscape of an advanced civilization with elements inspired by Eastern subterranean myths and Afrofuturism. An alternate cover was produced for its 1976 release in North America by Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} patient, {{the partner}} of an injured person {{frequently}} needs support and counseling. It can help with adjustment to a new relationship dynamic and self-image (such as being placed {{in the role of}} caretaker) or with stresses that arise in the sexual relationship. Frequently, partners of injured people must contend with feelings like guilt, anger, anxiety, and <b>exhaustion</b> while dealing with the added financial burden of lost wages and medical expenses. Counseling aims to strengthen the relationship by improving communication and trust.|$|E
5|$|At a {{scheduled}} layover in Chicago, they disembarked {{only long enough}} for breakfast and to answer some brief media questions before the train resumed its route. In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed <b>exhaustion</b> from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined the group at Ogden, Utah.|$|E
5|$|Ataxia {{released}} its second and final studio album, AW II in 2007. Following the Stadium Arcadium tour (early May 2006 to late August 2007), the Red Hot Chili Peppers {{agreed to a}} hiatus of indefinite length. In early 2008, Anthony Kiedis finally confirmed this, citing <b>exhaustion</b> from constant work since Californication as the main reason. Frusciante quit the group on July 29, 2009, but did not publicly announce his departure until December 2009, {{two months after the}} band ended their hiatus in October 2009 and began work on their next album with Josh Klinghoffer as their new guitarist.|$|E
5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew exponentially {{following his}} death. Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on Corfu, where thousands of soldiers succumbed to disease and <b>exhaustion</b> and were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets of the Romantic period.|$|E
5|$|Bowman v. Monsanto Co., 569 U.S. ___ (2013) was a United States Supreme Court patent {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court unanimously affirmed {{the decision of the}} Federal Circuit that the patent <b>exhaustion</b> doctrine does not permit a farmer to plant and grow saved, patented seeds without the patent owner's permission. The case arose after Vernon Hugh Bowman, an Indiana farmer, bought transgenic soybean crop seeds from a local grain elevator for his second crop of the season. Monsanto originally sold the seed from which these soybeans were grown to farmers under a limited use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer from using the seeds for more than a single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting. The farmers sold their soybean crops (also seeds) to the local grain elevator, from which Bowman then bought them. After Bowman replanted the crop seeds for his second harvest, Monsanto filed a lawsuit claiming that he infringed on their patents by replanting soybeans without a license. In response, Bowman argued that Monsanto's claims were barred under the doctrine of patent <b>exhaustion,</b> because all future generations of soybeans were embodied in the first generation that was originally sold.|$|E
5|$|By 26 December, strong German defences had stalled Canadian {{forces in}} Ortona and British and New Zealand forces in Orsogna. Although both Ortona and Villa Grande were {{captured}} {{by the end of}} December, general <b>exhaustion</b> among the Allied forces prevented the capture of Orsogna and an advance to Pescara. When harsh winter weather set in, it became clear to the Allied commanders that no further progress would be made and General Alexander called off the offensive.|$|E
5|$|During {{the week}} before his death, {{he was dealing with}} two pending lawsuits, one a {{paternity}} case and the other a recording contract dispute that was due to be heard by a UK High Court the following week. He was also troubled with wanting to leave his manager, Michael Jeffery. Hendrix was fatigued and suffering from poor health, due in part to severe <b>exhaustion</b> caused by overworking, a chronic lack of sleep, and a persistent illness assumed to be influenza-related. Lacking trusting personal relationships, his insecurities about the future and disillusionment with the music industry contributed to his frustration.|$|E
5|$|For long afterwards, Grant and Buell quarreled over Grant's {{decision}} not to mount an immediate pursuit with another hour of daylight remaining. Grant cited the <b>exhaustion</b> of his troops, although the Confederates were certainly just as exhausted. Part of Grant's reluctance to act {{could have been the}} unusual command relationship he had with Buell. Although Grant was the senior officer and technically was in command of both armies, Buell made it quite clear throughout the two days that he was acting independently.|$|E
5|$|He {{enlisted in}} 1781 and, in his 30-year career, he saw {{action at the}} major French defeats and {{victories}} in Europe. He fought in André Masséna's Army of Switzerland, where he participated in the Winterthur and First and Second Battles of Zürich, the campaigns of 1806 against Prussia, and Napoleon's invasion of Russia. After the Russian and Saxon campaign, while suffering from <b>exhaustion,</b> he contracted typhus and died in Kusel, in the Saarland. He was buried at the Panthéon, and his name is listed on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, the team's decline continued, and the {{pitchers}} began to complain of <b>exhaustion</b> and accused management of overuse. A second consecutive last-place finish, along with declining talent, their fans stopped attending home games, with attendance numbers averaging 50 paid spectators. John Clarkson, {{who went on}} to win 328 games in a 12-season career, and was the only Hall of Famer to have played for the franchise, began his career for the 1881 Ruby Legs. When the season ended, the NL decided to drop the team from the league, replacing them with the Philadelphia Quakers, who later became the Phillies.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Osborn helped secure Beebe a new {{research}} station in Guiana to replace Kalacoon: Beebe was offered Kartabo Point, an outpost of a New York-based mining corporation. Beebe was {{enthusiastic about the}} new station, and it proved very successful for conducting the same detailed analyses of wildlife within small areas that had been performed at Kalacoon. At Kartabo Beebe discovered the phenomenon known as an ant mill, a column of ants following itself in an endless loop until {{nearly all of them}} died of <b>exhaustion.</b>|$|E
