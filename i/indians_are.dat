5|$|I am {{of opinion}} {{that by the}} terms and spirit of the statute under which this {{proceeding}} has been had, no other than the district attorney of the county of Genesee (in which the lands intruded upon are situated) could regularly be a relator.

It is made the duty of the district attorney to make complaint of all intrusions upon Indian lands forbidden by the act, {{and from time to time}} to make inquiries whether any persons other than <b>Indians</b> <b>are</b> settled upon such lands, and to cause them to be removed in the manner therein prescribed. Without the act, John Blacksmith or any other person could not claim such summary proceedings to remove intruders upon Indian lands; and with the act, no other person is authorized by its provisions to make complaint of such intrusions, or to cause the intruders to be removed, but the district attorney of the county in which the lands are situated.|$|E
