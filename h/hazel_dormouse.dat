5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community Habitats Directive. Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of Seorsumuscardinus are known from {{isolated}} teeth, which show that they were medium-sized dormice with flat teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the anterotropid, distinguishes the two species, as it {{is present in the}} lower molars of S.alpinus, but not in those of S.bolligeri. Another crest, the centroloph, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in S.bolligeri, but not in S.alpinus. Seorsumuscardinus may be related to Muscardinus, the genus of the living <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse,</b> which appears at about the same time, and the older Glirudinus.|$|E
5|$|The fourth upper premolar (P4) {{has four}} main, {{transversely}} placed crests; {{the description of}} S.bolligeri mentions an additional, centrally placed small crest. De Bruijn interpreted the four main crests as the anteroloph, protoloph, metaloph, and posteroloph {{from front to back}} and wrote that these crests are not connected {{on the sides of the}} tooth. Prieto and Böhme note that the posteroloph is convex on the back margin of the tooth. In Muscardinus, the number of ridges on P4 ranges from five in Muscardinus sansaniensis to two in M.pliocaenicus and the living <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse,</b> but the protoloph and metaloph are always connected on the lingual (inner) side of the tooth. P4 is two-rooted in S.alpinus and three-rooted in S.bolligeri.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether the pathogenic Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia spielmanii is adapted exclusively to garden dormice, we compared the reservoir competence of various rodent species for this spirochete, including sympatric and peridomestic rodents. The different kinds of rodents varied in their attractiveness to nymphal ticks and their level of susceptibility to tick-borne B. spielmanii infection, but only the edible dormouse appeared to be refractory. Although <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice</b> and Norway rats became infectious to ticks somewhat later than did garden dormice, they remained infectious {{for a longer period}} of time. During the course of a tick season, garden and <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice</b> contributed theoretically more than twice as many B. spielmanii-infected ticks than the somewhat less susceptible Norway rats and wood or yellow-necked mice. <b>Hazel</b> <b>dormice</b> appeared to be extraordinarily competent as reservoir hosts for B. spielmanii. Because peridomestic rodents proved to be reservoir competent, urban foci of transmission of B. spielmanii may affect the health of townspeople...|$|R
50|$|Hazel is the {{principal}} food source, supports insects, forms an understory of poles, especially when coppiced, which makes it useful for its arboreal activity. The <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse's</b> Latin name avellanarius means 'hazel'.|$|R
50|$|PTES {{maintains}} the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP). This {{is based on}} around 400 woodland sites where at least fifty dormouse nest boxes have been put up, per site, that are inspected by licensed volunteers at monthly intervals between May and October. In 2014, PTES collated 6,827 <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice</b> records from 387 sites.|$|R
25|$|The rocks {{around the}} Zugspitze are a habitat for chamois, whilst marmots are {{widespread}} {{on the southern}} side of the massif. At the summit there are frequently alpine choughs, drawn there by people feeding them. Somewhat lower down the mountain there are mountain hare and the <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse.</b> Alpine birds occurring on the Zugspitze include the golden eagle, rock ptarmigan, snow finch, alpine accentor and brambling. The crag martin which has given {{its name to the}} Schwalbenwand ("Swallows' Wall") at Kreuzeck is frequently encountered. The basins of Mittenwald and Seefeld, as well as the Fern Pass are on bird migration routes.|$|E
25|$|The forest {{contains}} a somewhat reduced fauna and flora. Due to human influence (encroachment {{from all sides}} of the outer edges as well as the long-established thoroughfare roads and highways cutting deep through the forest) and impoverishment of the ecosystem, various plants and animals have become extinct. The forest was home to 46 different mammal species. Of these, seven have disappeared altogether: the brown bear (around 1,000), the wolf (around 1810), the <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> (around 1842), the Red Deer, the badger, and the hare. The boar was thought to have been extinct since 1957, but in 2007, new specimens were discovered roaming the wood. According to the Flemish Agency for Nature and Forest (ANB), this is unlikely to be a natural spread, but probably two to four animals that most likely were either released or escaped from captivity.|$|E
500|$|Because of its derived and {{specialized}} morphology, {{the relationships of}} Seorsumuscardinus are obscure. However, it shows some similarities with Muscardinus, a genus which includes the living <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse,</b> and may share a common ancestor with it, such as the earlier fossil genus Glirudinus. All three {{are part of the}} dormouse family, which includes many extinct forms dating back to the early Eocene (around 50 million years ago), as well as a smaller array of living species. The generic name Seorsumuscardinus combines the Latin seorsum, which means [...] "different", with Muscardinus and the specific name alpinus refers to the occurrence of S.alpinus close to the Alps. Heissigia honored paleontologist Kurt Heissig for his work in Bavaria on the occasion of his 65th birthday and bolligeri honors Thomas Bolliger for his early description of material of this dormouse.|$|E
50|$|The site is {{a mixture}} of woodland, scrub and {{grassland}} on a south facing chalk slope. Some of the beech woodland dates back 400 years, and there is younger cherry, holly, yew and ash. Ground plants include wood spurge and goldilocks buttercup, and there are mammals such as roe deer and <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice.</b> There is a wide variety of fungi.|$|R
50|$|Another major {{success has}} been the {{reintroduction}} of captive-bred <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice,</b> {{with a large number}} of Wildwood stock transferred to sites in the Midlands and Yorkshire. Other on-going projects include DNA and behavioural research on pine martens with Waterford Institute of Technology in Éire; funding for the pool frog reintroduction with Herpetological ConservationTrust/English Nature; water shrew husbandry with Imperial College, London; and in-situ breeding of harvest mice with Chester Zoo.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1992, {{woods and}} {{agricultural}} land surrounding Stupinigi have been preserved as the Parco naturale di Stupinigi. Included in the communal territories of Nichelino, Candiolo and Orbassano, {{it has an}} area of [...] that includes {{a part of the}} region's original lowland forest, where visitors can admire some rare plant species no longer widely found elsewhere. Wildlife includes beech martens, weasels, foxes, <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouses,</b> European hares, white storks, tree squirrels and others.|$|R
2500|$|In the {{northern}} extremes of their range, Eurasian eagle-owls {{tend to have}} a less varied diet than those to the south and the need to catch significant numbers of rodents rises as they are often the only regularly accessible prey in sparse sub-Arctic environments. In northern Sweden, more than 60% of the food was made up of microtine rodents, i.e. the [...] Norway lemming (Lemmus lemmus), the field vole, the European water vole and the [...] grey red-backed vole (Myodes rufocanus). In one study from western Russia, rodents comprised more than 90% of the diet of the eagle-owls, led by the [...] steppe lemming (Lagurus lagurus) at 24% by number, the [...] narrow-headed vole (Microtus gregalis) at 21% and the European water vole at 17.9%. Similarly in high altitude tundra of the East Austrian Alps, nearly 90% of the food was found to be comprised by microtine rodents, the [...] European snow vole (Chionomys nivalis) being the most frequently identified species in the diet. In Spain, the [...] Algerian mouse (Mus spretus), at up to 41.8% of the prey by number, and [...] wood mouse (Apodemus sylvaticus), at up to 10.5% by number, are often regularly taken, especially in regions where rabbit numbers have declined. In Romania, the [...] Romanian hamster (Mesocricetus newtoni) and [...] European hamster are the most prominent species found in the eagle-owl’s diet, alongside the brown rat. The Romanian hamster is also dominated the prey list per a study in Bulgaria, only the European water vole follows distantly in number. [...] Dormice are readily taken when available in Europe, especially the [...] edible dormouse from central Europe to the eastern countries. In Slovenia, the edible dormouse was the most regularly-recorded prey species, making up 20.2% of the food but it comprised 9.4% of the biomass. The edible dormouse was also the most regular prey species in Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Italy, making up 22.5% of the diet. The smaller [...] garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) and considerably smaller [...] <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> (Muscardinus avellanarius) are also occasionally predated in Europe, plus at least a half dozen other dormouse species in eastern Europe, Asia Minor and several points to the east.|$|E

50|$|Most {{vertebrates}} of {{the park}} are the typical representatives of the broadleaf and mixed forests in Europe (white stork, lesser spotted eagle, edible, forest and <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice,</b> wildcat). The proportion of species of Mediterranean origin is insignificant, common representatives are: fire salamander, European tree frog, Aesculapian snake, etc. There is also {{a small amount of}} typical mountain species (yellow-bellied toad, rock pipit, grey wagtail, etc.) and boreal species (western capercaillie, boreal owl, Ural owl, lynx, brown bear, etc.).|$|R
50|$|Consisting {{mainly of}} sweet chestnut, silver birch and English oak, {{one area of}} Wildwood {{includes}} a former conifer plantation ofCorsican pine and Western hemlock.

The natural wildlife in the park includes red foxes, <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice,</b> wood and yellow-necked mice, bank andfield voles, common and pygmy shrews, nightingales, woodpeckers (all three species), tawny owls, jays, tits (four species), thrushes, stag beetles, dragonflies, wood ants, bumblebees and butterflies.|$|R
50|$|Briddlesford Copses—the {{woodland}} {{areas that}} make up the majority of the woodland in the reserve—were designated a SAC in 1995 in recognition of the internationally important breeding population of Bechstein's bats that are resident there. The rare barbastelle bat also breeds in the woods, contributing to a total of eight bat species recorded at the site. These animals are particularly associated with woodpecker holes and crevices in mature ash trees at this site. The woods support both <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice</b> and red squirrels, and alongside the bats form a mammal assemblage that is unique to the UK. The dormice have been monitored in the woodland since at least 1996. Over 530 nest boxes are arranged in two grids that contribute data to the National Dormouse Monitoring Programme (NDMP) and inform the management of the woodlands.|$|R

50|$|The <b>hazel</b> <b>{{dormouse}}</b> or common dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) {{is a small}} mammal and {{the only}} living species in the genus Muscardinus.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{considered}} endangered in the Czech Republic and as rare in {{a majority of}} the other European countries. The population is mostly threatened by the destruction of forests which is their habitat. There are many programs in place to help maintain and increase the forest dormice population. There is an international law to protect this species and it is under the EU Habitats and Species Directive (Annex IV) and the Berne Convention (Appendix III). All countries must abide by this law. In addition, a country may choose to create a national law or program in order to further provide methods to make sure this species is protected. For example, the English government rewards farmers who replant hedges. Hopefully, this will increase available shrubbery for dormice to occupy. Another program is administered by English Nature. This is a reintroduction program whose purpose is to place captive-bred dormice in locations where the population has been dwindling. In addition to these programs, the UK has created a National Dormouse Monitoring Programme. Its main purpose is to observe <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice.</b> However, the program components are used to observe and track all species of dormice.|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{hibernation}} is a natural, fully reversible hypometabolic state {{characterized by}} a drastic reduction of body temperature and metabolic activity, which ensures survival to many species under adverse environmental conditions. During hibernation, many hibernators rely for energy supply almost exclusively on lipid reserves; the shift from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism implies profound rearrangement of the anabolic and catabolic pathways of energetic substrates. However, the structural counterpart of such adaptation is not known. In this study we investigated, by using immunoelectron microscopy, the fine intracellular distribution of two key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, namely, the fatty acid synthase (FAS) and the long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL), in hepatocytes of euthermic, hibernating and arousing <b>hazel</b> <b>dormice.</b> Our {{results show that the}} two enzymes are differentially distributed in cellular compartments (cytoplasm, mitochondria and cell nuclei) of hepatocytes during euthermia. Quantitative redistribution of both enzymes among cellular compartments takes place during hibernation and arousal, in accordance with the physiological changes. Interestingly, this redistribution follows different seasonal patterns in cytoplasm, mitochondria and nuclei. In conclusion, our data represent the first quantitative morphological evidence of lipid enzyme distribution in a true hibernator throughout the year cycle, thus providing a structural framework to biochemical changes associated with the hypometabolism of hibernation...|$|R
40|$|Dormouse {{numbers are}} declining in the UK due to habitat loss and fragmentation. We know that dormice are nocturnal, arboreal, and avoid {{crossing}} open spaces between habitats, yet how they navigate around their canopy is unknown. As other rodents use whisker touch sensing to navigate and explore their environment, this study investigates whether <b>Hazel</b> <b>dormice</b> (Muscardinus avellanarius) employ their whiskers to cross between habitats. We analysed high-speed video footage of dormice exploring freely in flat and climbing arenas in near darkness and using infrared light illumination. We confirm that, like rats and mice, dormice move their whiskers {{back and forth}} continuously (~ 10 Hz) in a motion called whisking and recruit them to explore small gaps (< 10 cm) by increasing the amplitude and frequency of whisking and also the asymmetry of movement between {{the left and right}} whisker fields. When gaps between platforms are larger than 10 - 15 cm dormice spend more time travelling on the floor. These findings suggest that dormice can actively and purposively move their whiskers to gather relevant information from their canopy at night. As this species is vulnerable to threats on the ground, we also provide evidence that joining habitat patches between dormouse populations is important for promoting natural behaviours and movement between patches...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> is {{native to}} {{northern}} Europe and Asia Minor. It is the only dormouse native to the British Isles, and is therefore often referred to simply as the [...] "dormouse" [...] in British sources, although the edible dormouse, Glis glis, has been accidentally introduced and now has an established population. Though Ireland has no native dormouse, the <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> has recently been found in County Kildare, {{and appears to be}} spreading rapidly, helped by the prevalence of hedgerows in the Irish countryside. The first record of the dormouse in Ireland was noted in Co. Kildare in 2010.|$|E
50|$|Also {{currently}} {{thriving in}} Brampton Wood is the <b>hazel</b> <b>dormouse</b> population. The species was reintroduced in 1992 {{and live in}} low densities across the wood. They thrive on hazel, bramble {{and a variety of}} flowers.|$|E
