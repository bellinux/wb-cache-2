James Bond <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> and gambling heavily and making mistakes on his assignments when, as a last resort, he is sent to Japan on a semi-diplomatic mission. Whilst there he is challenged by the Head of the Japanese Secret Service to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Bond realises that Shatterhand is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and sets out on a revenge mission to kill him and his wife, Irma Bunt.|$|E

Despite their {{seemingly}} close relationship, {{he actually}} dislikes Roritor {{to the point}} that his happiest memory is having someone urinate in his boss' latte (Roritor's happiest moment, ironically, <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> the concoction).|$|E
500|$|Gavin Hood has {{announced}} that multiple [...] "secret endings" [...] exist for the film and that the endings will differ from print to print of the film. One version shows Wolverine drinking in a Japanese bar. The bartender asks if he <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> to forget, to which Logan replies that he <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> to remember. The other ending shows Weapon XI on {{the rubble of the}} destroyed tower, trying to touch his severed head.|$|E
50|$|Drug use, {{especially}} alcohol, {{is frequently}} involved in rape. A study (only of rape victims that were female and reachable by phone) reported detailed findings related to tactics. In 47% of such rapes, both {{the victim and}} the perpetrator had <b>been</b> <b>drinking.</b> In 17%, only the perpetrator had been. 7% of the time, only the victim had <b>been</b> <b>drinking.</b> Rapes where neither the victim nor the perpetrator had <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> <b>were</b> 29% of all rapes.|$|R

500|$|One of Æthelberht's laws {{seems to}} {{preserve}} a trace of a very old custom: the third item in the code states that [...] "If the king <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> at a man's home, and anyone commits any evil deed there, he is to pay twofold compensation." [...] This probably refers to the ancient custom of a king traveling the country, being hosted, and being provided for by his subjects wherever he went. The king's servants retained these rights for centuries after Æthelberht's time.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode title}} [...] "Do Shapeshifters Dream of Electric Sheep" [...] {{refers to the}} Philip K. Dick science fiction novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, which was later adapted into the film Blade Runner. The novel dealt with {{what it means to}} be human, {{exploring}} how faking an emotion long enough can actually develop into real feelings, much like in the episode where two shapeshifters first pretended but then developed feelings for their victims' families. While Peter <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> in a bar, science fiction movie The Invisible Boy is playing on a television in the background, with the character Robby the Robot visible. During the episode, Walter makes two requests in order to provide [...] "brain stimulation" [...] to the deceased Senator Van Horn: a portrait of former president George W. Bush, and a copy of Hump Magazine.|$|E
50|$|Alcohol {{expectations}} {{can operate}} {{in the absence of}} actual consumption of alcohol. Research in the United States over a period of decades has shown that men tend to become more sexually aroused when they think they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol, — even when they have not <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> it. Women report feeling more sexually aroused when they falsely believe the beverages they have <b>been</b> <b>drinking</b> contained alcohol (although one measure of their physiological arousal shows that they became less aroused).|$|R

500|$|Rapper Ghostface Killah {{made his}} second {{appearance}} as {{himself on the}} show, having appeared in the episode [...] "Jack-Tor", in which he and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) perform the song [...] "Muffin Top". In one scene of [...] "The Source Awards", Ghostface Killah <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> Donaghy Estate Sparkling Wine as a music video is shooting, but cannot stand drinking the wine, which makes him sick. This episode featured guest appearances from actors LL Cool J and Wayne Brady.

500|$|The Pawnee Parks and Recreation Department {{considers}} a potential sponsorship deal with Sweetums, a local candy manufacturer hoping to market [...] "nutritious" [...] snack bars to park visitors. Ron (Nick Offerman) supports the deal as he advocates governmental privatization and emphasizes consumer choice over public safety. Leslie (Amy Poehler) initially supports the deal as well, until Ann (Rashida Jones) informs her they {{are filled with}} unhealthy corn syrup. Leslie arranges a public forum for Pawnee park visitors {{so they can make}} an informed choice about Sweetums products. Ron is unhappy with the arrangement, and gets angry with Leslie worrying about how much he <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> during a recent outing, feeling she is stifling his personal freedoms. During the forum, Sweetums representatives screen propaganda films, highlighting consumer satisfaction, while Leslie responds by screening a 30-year-old Sweetums film which discusses how corn syrup and other snack bar ingredients make cattle unhealthy. At the end of Leslie's screening, Sweetums brings in its commercial's primary actor, the company's CEO Nick Newport Jr. (Gary Weeks) and his son and daughter, Denver and Dakota. Denver instructs the forum audience members to look under their seats for candy. The forum audience exclaims with excitement and ultimately votes in favor of the sponsorship deal. Ron taunts Leslie by eating two unhealthful servings of steak ("turf and turf"), but she remains genuinely concerned for his health. Ron later apologizes to Leslie for having [...] "been a horse's ass".|$|E

500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big part of who she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she <b>is</b> <b>drinking.</b> That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the course}} of events, the well and its water seem to have {{acquired}} religious significance {{to the people of}} Ayyavazhi. The act of bathing, drinking a few drops of it, and cooking the food with this water came to be repeated with a ritual fervour. People began to consider the well a sacred one, and the water as having miraculous powers to heal sickness. A couplet from the Saattu Neettolai of Arul Nool reads as, [...] "every one <b>is</b> <b>drinking</b> the milk of the well around which miracles are growing." [...] And by these quote it seems that Akilam itself accredit the well as a sacred one. People consider it a religious obligation to bathe and drink at least a few drops of water from this well.|$|E

She reminds Tobias of the time when he prevented her from getting pregnant after the death of their son. Claire, Julia, Tobias, and Agnes all discuss their versions of why Harry and Edna are there and what they should do about it. Harry and Edna join them, and everyone in the room <b>is</b> <b>drinking.</b> Edna announces that Harry wants to talk to Tobias alone, and the women exit. Harry tells Tobias that if the circumstances were reversed, he and Edna don’t think they would allow Tobias and Agnes to live at their house, {{in spite of the fact}} that they are best friends. Harry asks Tobias, “You don’t want us, do you, Toby?” [...] Tobias answers that he does not really want Harry and Edna to stay there but that because they are friends, Harry and Edna have the right to be there. [...] He goes with Harry to get their suitcases and put them back in their car. Agnes says to Edna, “Everything becomes… too late, finally.” The play ends on Agnes’s rumination that people sleep at night because they are afraid of the dark: “They say we sleep to let the demons out—to let the mind go raving mad…And when the daylight comes again... comes order with it.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Stolle, Sack and Thomasius define binge {{drinking}} as episodic excessive drinking. There is currently no worldwide consensus {{on how many}} drinks constitute a [...] "binge", but in the United States, the term has been described in academic research to mean consuming five or more standard drinks (male), or four or more drinks (female), over a 2-hour period. In 2015, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, citing the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, defines {{binge drinking}} as [...] "a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. This typically happens when men consume 5 or more drinks, and when women consume 4 or more drinks, in about 2 hours." [...] and estimated that about 16% of American adults met these binge drinking criteria four times per month. One 2001 definition from the publication Psychology of Addictive Behavior states that 5 drinks for men and 4 drinks for women must be consumed on one occasion {{at least once in}} a two-week period for it to be classed as binge drinking. This is colloquially known as the [...] "5/4 definition", and depending on the source, the timeframe can vary. In the United Kingdom, binge drinking is defined by one academic publication as drinking more than twice the daily limit, that <b>is,</b> <b>drinking</b> eight units or more for men or six units or more for women (roughly equivalent to five or four American standard drinks, respectively). In Australia, binge drinking is also known as risky single occasion drinking (RSOD) and can be classified by the drinking of seven or more standard drinks (by males) and 5 or more standard drinks (by females) within a single day. When BEACH (Bettering the Evaluation of care and health) conducted a study which gathered information of people over the age of 18, it defined binge drinkers as those who consumed six or more standard drinks on one occasion whether that be weekly or monthly.|$|E
