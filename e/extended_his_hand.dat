25|$|Joshua and the Israelites {{were able}} to defeat the people at Ai because Joshua {{followed}} the divine instruction to extend his sword (Josh 8:18), just as the people {{were able to}} defeat the Amalekites as long as Moses <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> that held the staff of God (Ex. 17:8–13).|$|E
25|$|El Shehaby {{lost his}} first match to Israel's Or Sasson, {{but refused to}} bow or shake hands with him, {{resulting}} to a loud jeer from the crowd. When Sasson <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to shake after the match, El Shehaby backed away, shaking his head. The referee called El Shehaby back to the mat and obliged him to bow, at which point El Shehaby gave a quick nod of his head. El Shehaby's conduct was widely condemned as unsportsmanlike. It is unclear what potential punishment El Shehaby or Egyptian judo as a whole could face, but his hopes of medaling were dashed regardless due to Sasson's decisive performance in the quarterfinals.|$|E
500|$|Though it was {{initially}} feared {{he would not}} survive his injuries, Bailey recovered enough {{to participate in the}} benefit game. He presented gifts and shook the hands of each player as they were introduced. Among them was Eddie Shore himself, who was playing for the NHL all-stars. [...] The crowd fell silent as Shore approached, then erupted into loud cheering when Bailey <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> toward his attacker. The Maple Leafs announced during the ceremonies that no player on their team would again wear Bailey's number 6, marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player's uniform number.|$|E

500|$|The {{game was}} held on February 14, 1934, and {{featured}} a lavish pre-game ceremony that first saw the players assemble at centre ice to have photographs taken in their regular sweaters. [...] They were then presented with their all-star jerseys by Frank Calder, Lester Patrick, Leaf officials and Ace Bailey himself. Gardiner stepped out first to receive his number 1 uniform, and was then followed by Shore, who wore number 2. The crowd of over 14,000 fans went completely silent as Shore slowly skated toward Bailey. [...] After a moment, Bailey <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> towards Shore, and the crowd erupted in loud cheering as the two shook hands.|$|E
500|$|To {{raise money}} for Bailey's recovery, Maple Leaf Gardens hosted the Ace Bailey All-Star Benefit Game on February 14, 1934. [...] The Maple Leafs {{defeated}} an all-star team of players {{from the rest of}} the league 7–3 while raising over $20,000. Prior to the game, the Leafs announced that no Toronto player would ever wear Bailey's #6 again, marking the first time in NHL history that a team retired a player's jersey number. [...] Before the game, each player came out and shook Bailey's hand as they received their all-star jersey. [...] The last player to do so was Eddie Shore. [...] The crowd, which had fallen silent as Shore approached, erupted into loud cheering as Bailey <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> towards his attacker. [...] Elmer Ferguson described the moment as [...] "the most completely dramatic event I ever saw in hockey".|$|E
500|$|Midway {{through the}} first period, with Montreal already down 2–0, Campbell arrived with three {{secretaries}} from his office (one of whom he would later marry). The 15,000 spectators immediately started booing Campbell. Some fans began pelting him and his group with eggs, vegetables, and various debris for six straight minutes. At {{the end of the}} first period, Detroit had taken a 4–1 lead, and the barrage began again. Despite police and ushers' attempts to keep fans away from Campbell, one fan, pretending to be a friend of Campbell's, managed to elude security. As he approached, the fan <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> as if to shake Campbell's. When Campbell reached out to shake his hand, the fan slapped him. As Campbell reeled from the attack, the fan reached back and delivered a punch. Police dragged the attacker away while he attempted to kick the NHL president. Shortly after the fan attack, a tear gas bomb was set off inside the Forum, not far from Campbell's seat. Montreal Fire Chief Armand Pare mandated that the game be suspended for [...] "the protection of the fans", and the Forum was evacuated. Following the evacuation, Campbell took refuge in the Forum clinic, where he met with Canadiens general manager Frank Selke. The two wrote a note to Adams declaring the Red Wings the winner of the game due to the Forum's ordered closure.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the events}} of WrestleMania 21, the next night on Raw, Muhammad Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault Michaels. On the April 11 episode of Raw, Michaels {{approached}} authority figure Eric Bischoff, in which he demanded a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari, a match consisting of one wrestler or team of wrestlers facing off against a team of wrestlers with numerical superiority such as two against one, or three against two. Bischoff refused to schedule the match, but informed Michaels to find a partner and he would grant him the match. Michaels then made a plea for Hulk Hogan {{to come back and}} team with him. On the April 18 episode of Raw, Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared to save Michaels and accept his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels when Daivari was pinned. On the July 4 episode of Raw, Michaels and Hulk Hogan had a tag team match, which they won. During the post-match pose, Michaels hit Hogan with his superkick, knocking Hogan to the ground and making Michaels a villain {{for the first time since}} returning in 2002. The following week on Raw, Michaels appeared on Piper's Pit where he superkicked Roddy Piper and then challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam. Hogan defeated Michaels at SummerSlam, and after the match Michaels <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to him, saying [...] "I needed to know, and I found out" [...] and he and Hogan shook hands. Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd, and Michaels once again became a fan favorite.|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{shortly before}} dawn on May 12, Union forces {{comprising}} three full divisions (Major General Winfield S. Hancock's II Corps) attacked the Mule Shoe through heavy fog, taking the Confederate forces by surprise. Exhaustion, inadequate food, lack of artillery support, and wet powder from the night's rain {{contributed to the}} collapse of the Confederate position as the Union forces swarmed out of the mist, overwhelming Steuart's men and effectively putting an end to the Virginia Brigade. Confederate muskets would not fire due to damp powder, and apart from two remaining artillery pieces, the Southerners were effectively without firearms. During the thick of the fierce hand-to-hand fighting that followed, Steuart was forced to surrender to Colonel James A. Beaver of the 148th Pennsylvania Infantry. Beaver asked Steuart [...] "Where is your sword, sir?", to which the general replied, with considerable sarcasm, [...] "Well, suh, you all waked us up so early this mawnin' that I didn't have time to get it on." [...] Steuart was brought to General Hancock, who had seen Steuart's wife Maria in Washington before the battle and wished to give her news of her husband. He <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> asking [...] "how are you, Steuart?" [...] But Steuart refused to shake Hancock's hand; although the two men had been friends before the war, they were now enemies. Steuart said: [...] "Considering the circumstance, General, I refuse to take your hand", to which Hancock is said to have replied, [...] "And under any other circumstance, General, I would have refused to offer it." [...] After this episode, an offended Hancock then left Steuart to march to the Union rear with the other prisoners.|$|E
2500|$|Lloyd George (Memoirs Vol i. p467) accused Robertson {{of having}} [...] "a {{profound}} and disturbing suspicion of all foreigners", {{but this is}} an exaggeration – with Britain and France allies {{for only the second time}} in their history, Robertson had played a leading role in instigating the Chantilly Conference at the end of 1915, and <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to reach agreement with Nivelle in March 1917 and Petain in summer 1917.|$|E

2500|$|What {{happened}} next shocked Carp, and ruined {{his friendship with}} Maiorescu. In April 1912, the latter <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Ionescu and Filipescu, and a new coalition was created against both Brătianu and Carp. Once Maiorescu took over as Premier, Carp handed in his resignation from the post of party leader (stating [...] "I'll not sacrifice immortal ideas for a passing chairmanship"), but his colleagues refused to accept it; he did not present himself for the 1912 elections, and became the only head of a parliamentary party not to hold a seat. In 1913, he tried to reaffirm his position in the Conservative Party by convening an irregular Party Congress, but effectively lost the leadership.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was in the}} 2000 Western Conference Finals that a {{defining}} moment of O'Neal's and Bryant's on-court success together occurred. The Lakers had led the Portland Trail Blazers three games to one, before dropping Game 5 at home and Game 6 in Portland. The Blazers were leading the decisive Game 7, putting the Lakers {{on the brink of}} elimination. [...] Portland led by 15 points early in the fourth quarter, before the Lakers mounted a 25–4 rally to take the lead. The comeback run culminated as Bryant drove the lane and threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal for a one-handed slam dunk after which O'Neal ran upcourt with his mouth agape and both index fingers waving. [...] Bryant <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to O'Neal for a high five, but O'Neal in his celebration did not notice.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, Republicans {{who favored}} civil service reform, {{including}} Theodore Roosevelt, supported Edmunds for President over incumbent President Chester Alan Arthur and former Senator James G. Blaine, hoping {{to build a}} groundswell for Edmunds if the two stronger candidates deadlocked. [...] Revelations about Edmunds' legal work for railroads and corporations while sitting in the Senate prevented Edmunds from attaining wide support from reformers. On the first ballot he received 93 votes, but his support declined, and the nomination went to Blaine on the fourth ballot. [...] Edmunds was among the Republicans who gave lukewarm support to Blaine (some backed Cleveland outright), and Blaine lost the general election to Grover Cleveland. [...] At Arthur's funeral in 1886, Edmunds <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Blaine. [...] Blaine, recalling the 1884 campaign, refused to shake it.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout the Voinovich years, neighborhoods {{began to}} see some {{improvement}} starting with the Lexington Village housing project, $149 million in Urban Development Action Grants, and $3 billion of construction underway or completed. In particular, the neighborhoods of Hough and Fairfax, then two of Cleveland's worst east side neighborhoods, {{began to see}} new houses built and lesser amount of criminal activity. Voinovich also quietly moved to reconcile the warring groups of the 1970s. He made peace with business leaders and even posed with them in photographs that ran in New Cleveland Campaign ads in business magazines, captioned with the Voinovich slogan: [...] "Together, we can do it." [...] He refined the neighborhood groups, which, with {{the breakdown of the}} Democratic Party, became the most potent political force in the city. He also <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to unions as well, in particular the Teamsters truck union.|$|E
2500|$|Nancy's grave {{is located}} {{in what has been}} named the Pioneer Cemetery, also known as the Nancy Hanks Lincoln Cemetery. Her headstone was {{purchased}} by P.E. Studebaker, an industrialist from South Bend, in 1878. At least twenty unmarked and eight marked graves are at the site; Nancy Lincoln is buried next to Nancy Rusher Brooner, a neighbor who died a week earlier than she from milk sickness. [...] Henry Brooner, Nancy Brooner's son and best childhood friend of Abraham Lincoln later recalled, [...] "I remember very distinctly that when Mrs. Lincoln's grave was filled, my father, Peter Brooner, <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Thomas Lincoln and said, 'We are brothers now', meaning that they were brothers {{in the same kind of}} sorrow. [...] The bodies of my mother and Mrs. Lincoln were conveyed to their graves on sleds." [...] Her aunt and uncle, also her childhood caregivers, Elizabeth (Hanks) and Thomas Sparrow are buried nearby. The cemetery is located on the grounds of the Lincoln Boyhood National Memorial, a National Historic Landmark District managed by the National Park Service in present-day Lincoln City, Indiana.|$|E
2500|$|Hogan then {{appeared}} on July 4 episode of Raw, as the special guest of Carlito on his talk-show segment Carlito's Cabana. After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter Brooke, Hogan attacked Carlito. Kurt Angle then also appeared, making comments about Brooke, which further upset Hogan, who was eventually double teamed by Carlito and Angle, but was saved by Shawn Michaels. Later that night, Michaels and Hogan defeated Carlito and Angle in a tag team match; during the post-match celebration, Michaels performed the Sweet Chin Music on Hogan and walked off. The following week on Raw, Michaels {{appeared on}} Piper's Pit and challenged Hogan {{to face him}} one-on-one for the first time. Hogan appeared on Raw one week later and accepted the challenge. The match took place at SummerSlam, which Hogan won. After the match, Michaels <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to him, telling him that he [...] "had {{to find out for}} himself", and Hogan and Michaels shook hands as Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd.|$|E

2500|$|The {{main event}} was between Shawn Michaels and Hulk Hogan. This was Hogan's first SummerSlam {{appearance}} since 1991. During Hogan's entrance, a huge American flag unrolled {{from the top}} of the stage and covered the entire set. The match started slow, until Hogan sent Michaels outside. Hogan performed a scoop slam on the announce table and sent Michaels into the ringpost. Michaels reversed another attempt and sent Hogan into the ringpost twice. Michaels continued to attack his head with punches and mounted punches and applied the sleeper hold. Hogan fought out of it with a belly to back suplex, but failed to gain the advantage as Michaels performed a flying forearm smash. Michaels then missed a diving elbow drop, and Hogan fought back briefly. Michaels performed another flying forearm smash and applied the sharpshooter. Hogan broke the hold and avoided another attempt by kicking Michaels into the referee. Michaels performed a low blow and hit Hogan with a steel chair. Michaels then performed a diving elbow drop and a superkick. Michaels attempted a pinfall but Hogan kicked out at a two count. Hogan then delivered a big boot and a leg drop to win the match. After the match, Michaels <b>extended</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> to Hogan saying, [...] "I needed to know and I found out," [...] and Hogan shook his hand. It has been suggested that Michaels deliberately made a mockery of the match by over-selling throughout the contest, allegedly because he was unhappy about being asked to job to an inferior opponent.|$|E
