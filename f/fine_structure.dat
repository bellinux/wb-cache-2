5|$|The {{properties}} of the main ring {{can be explained by}} the hypothesis that it contains significant amounts of dust with 0.1–10μm particle sizes. This explains the stronger forward-scattering of light as compared to back-scattering.

This article is concerned with numerical modeling for PDE-based denoising models that can preserve/recover <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> in the restored image. The essentially non-dissipative schemes are considered to minimize nonphysical diffusion during the removal of impulse noise. For the removal of mean-zero noises, effective strategies are studied for variable constraint parameters that can recover <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> and optimal timestep sizes that can reduce the noise components more rapidly than other components. Here {{the goal is to}} remove combinations of impulse and Gaussian noises, with no useful <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> lost in the residual.

40|$|Standing sausage modes are {{important}} in interpreting quasi-periodic pulsations in the lightcurves of solar flares. Their periods and damping times {{play an important role}} in seismologically diagnosing key parameters like the magnetic field strength in regions where flare energy is released. Usually such applications are based on theoretical results neglecting unresolved <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> in magnetized loops. However, the existence of <b>fine</b> <b>structuring</b> is suggested on both theoretical and observational grounds. Adopting the framework of cold magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we model coronal loops as magnetized cylinders with a transverse equilibrium density profile comprising a monolithic part and a modulation due to <b>fine</b> <b>structuring</b> in the form of concentric shells. The equation governing the transverse velocity perturbation is solved with an initial-value-problem approach, and the effects of <b>fine</b> <b>structuring</b> on the periods P and damping times τ of global, leaky, standing sausage modes are examined. A parameter study shows that <b>fine</b> <b>structuring,</b> be it periodically or randomly distributed, brings changes of only a few percent to P and τ when there are more than about ten shells. The monolithic part, its steepness in particular, plays a far more important role in determining P and τ. We conclude that when measured values of P and τ of sausage modes are used for seismological purposes, it is justified to use theoretical results where the effects due to <b>fine</b> <b>structuring</b> are neglected.

5|$|The Voyager 2 {{spacecraft}} {{observed a}} strange {{signal from the}} ε ring during the radio occultation experiment. The signal looked like a strong enhancement of the forward-scattering at the wavelength 3.6cm near ring’s apoapsis. Such strong scattering requires {{the existence of a}} coherent structure. That the ε ring does have such a <b>fine</b> <b>structure</b> has been confirmed by many occultation observations. The ε ring seems to consist of a number of narrow and optically dense ringlets, some of which may have incomplete arcs.|$|E
5|$|These {{ideas were}} {{initially}} taken as postulates, but {{today there are}} efforts to test each of them. For example, the first assumption has been tested by observations showing that largest possible deviation of the <b>fine</b> <b>structure</b> constant {{over much of the}} age of the universe is of order 10−5. Also, general relativity has passed stringent tests on the scale of the Solar System and binary stars.|$|E
5|$|The rings were {{thoroughly}} investigated {{during the}} Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Uranus in January 1986. Two new faint rings—λ and 1986U2R—were discovered {{bringing the total}} number then known to eleven. Rings were studied by analysing results of radio, ultraviolet and optical occultations. Voyager 2 observed the rings in different geometries relative to the sun, producing images with back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the complete phase function, geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Two rings—ε and η—were resolved in the images revealing a complicated <b>fine</b> <b>structure.</b> Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of eleven inner moons of Uranus, including the two shepherd moons of the ε ring—Cordelia and Ophelia.|$|E

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a <b>fine</b> <b>structure</b> splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is an interaction between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of the Jovian rings was inferred from observations of the planetary radiation belts by Pioneer 11 spacecraft in 1975. In 1979 the Voyager 1 spacecraft obtained a single overexposed image of the ring system. More extensive imaging was conducted by Voyager 2 in the same year, which allowed rough determination of the ring’s structure. The superior quality of the images obtained by the Galileo orbiter between 1995 and 2003 greatly extended the existing knowledge about the Jovian rings. Ground-based observation of the rings by the Keck telescope in 1997 and 2002 and the HST in 1999 revealed the rich structure visible in back-scattered light. Images transmitted by the New Horizons spacecraft in February–March 2007 allowed observation of the <b>fine</b> <b>structure</b> in the main ring for the first time. In 2000, the Cassini spacecraft en route to Saturn conducted extensive observations of the Jovian ring system. Future missions to the Jovian system will provide additional information about the rings.|$|E

It occurs most efficiently with abundant atoms having <b>fine</b> <b>structure</b> levels close to the fundamental level such as: CII and OI in the neutral medium and OII, OIII, NII, NIII, NeII and NeIII in HII regions. Collisions will excite these atoms to higher levels, and they will eventually de-excite through photon emission, which will carry the energy out of the region.|$|E

40|$|The rugose coral genus Spinophyllum Wedekind, 1922, {{occurs in}} Moravia (S. conicum Kettnerová, 1932 and S. ondra sp. nov.).

25|$|Later, it was {{discovered}} that when the spectral lines of the hydrogen spectrum are examined at very high resolution, they are found to be closely spaced doublets.

The quantum fluctuations caused by zero-point energy have the effect of screening electric charges: owing to (virtual) electron-positron pair production, the charge of the particle measured far from the particle is far smaller than the charge measured when close to it.|$|E

The observed <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> {{are similar to}} fiber bursts {{in terms of the}} drift rates and the existence of emission and absorption stripes. Statistical analysis of the drift rates, however, shows that the observed <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> are different from the ordinary fiber bursts as regards the sense and the magnitude of their drift rates. First, the observed drift rates include both positive and negative rates, whereas ordinary fiber bursts are usually characterized by negative drift rates. Second, the absolute values of the observed drift rates are tens of MHz s− 1, whereas the typical drift rate of fiber bursts at 325 MHz is approximately − 9 MHz s− 1. In addition, all <b>fine</b> <b>structures</b> analyzed have narrow emission bands of less than 17 MHz. We also show that the observed narrowband emission features with drift rates of approximately 40 MHz s− 1 can be interpreted as the propagation of whistler-mode waves, which is the same process as that underlying fiber bursts.|$|R
