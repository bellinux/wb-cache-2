5|$|A {{similarly}} <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of lac bugs {{are needed}} to make a kilogram of shellac, a brush-on colourant and wood finish. Additional uses of this traditional product include the waxing of citrus fruits to extend their shelf-life, and the coating of pills to moisture-proof them, provide slow-release or mask the taste of bitter ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of records about land {{property}} {{in order to assess}} taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of organobromine {{compounds}} include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as Tyrian {{purple and}} the indicator bromothymol blue), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, {{as well as}} some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of applications (e.g. silver bromide for photography). Zinc–bromine batteries are hybrid flow batteries used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.|$|E

50|$|One {{can often}} find these bubble snails in <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{burrowing}} in mud on intertidal and sublittoral beds of green algae such as for example, the sea lettuce, Ulva lactuca.|$|R
50|$|Although {{individually}} small, insects {{exist in}} <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> - they number {{over a million}} described species {{and some of those}} species occur in <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers.</b> Accordingly, insects make up a very large part of the animal biomass in almost all non-marine, non-polar environments. It has been estimated that the global insect biomass is in the region of 1012 kg with an estimated population of 1018 organisms. Many creatures depend on insects as their primary diet, and many that do not (and are thus not technically insectivores) nevertheless use insects as a protein supplement, particularly when they are breeding.|$|R
5|$|Shinra pursue Zack and Cloud, {{and catch}} up with them just outside Midgar. Leaving the still semi-conscious Cloud hidden away, Zack fights off an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of Shinra troops, but is {{ultimately}} fatally wounded. Cloud manages to crawl to Zack's body after Shinra has left, and Zack, in his dying breath, bequeaths the Buster Sword to Cloud, as Angeal had done to him. Cloud then begins to walk to Midgar. The epilogue recreates the opening scenes of Final Fantasy VII, as Cloud, his memories confused, {{claims to be a}} former SOLDIER.|$|E
5|$|Structure 86 is to {{the west}} of Structure 32, at {{the western edge of the}} West Group. The first phase of {{construction}} dates to the Early Classic, between 150 and 300 AD, when it took the form of a sunken patio, with stairways descending in the middle of its perimeter walls. At the centre of the patio were placed a clay altar and a stone, around which and across the rest of the patio were deposited an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of offerings consisting of ceramic vessels, mostly from the Solano tradition.|$|E
5|$|Wines {{from the}} Languedoc can carry an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of names, ranging from broad {{regional}} designations like Vin de Pays d'Oc to very specific geographical classifications with restrictions on grape variety, like Corbières and Minervois. Since the 1990s, the INAO has been creating smaller AOC classifications which {{take into account}} the intricate microclimates and soil variations in the Languedoc-Roussillon. Younger appellations like the Cabardes and subregions like Minervois la Livinière, Corbières-Boutenac and St-Chinian-Berlou are much smaller in scope. While these new appellations have been praised for consistently improving their product, others have criticized the additions for further complicating an already esoteric system of classification.|$|E
50|$|At the beginning, SJ {{believed}} {{there would be}} <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of exported X2-trains. Norway, Finland, Germany, Austria, France, China, Australia, Portugal and the US were mentioned as candidates. Only one X2-trainset was exported (China).|$|R
50|$|The {{hospital}} offers <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of postgraduate educational activities, including weekly professorial case discussion meeting, grand round, daily morning registrars teaching round, intern training sessions, advanced {{life support}} forums, {{and many other}} individual department-based educational sessions.|$|R
50|$|Houma, {{also known}} as Xintian in ancient time, was {{the capital of the}} state of Jin from 585 BC to 376 BC. Ancient bronzeware {{workshops}} have been found here. <b>Enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of historical relics have been excavated here.|$|R
5|$|There are {{numerous}} different microhabitats in a wood; coniferous forest, broad-leafed forest, open woodland, scattered trees, woodland verges, clearings and glades; tree trunk, branch, twig, bud, leaf, flower and fruit; rough bark, smooth bark, damaged bark, rotten wood, hollow, groove and hole; canopy, shrub layer, plant layer, leaf litter and soil; buttress root, stump, fallen log, stem base, grass tussock, fungus, fern and moss. The greater the structural {{diversity in the}} wood, the greater the number of microhabitats that will be present. A range of tree species with individual specimens of varying sizes and ages, {{and a range of}} features such as streams, level areas, slopes, tracks, clearings and felled areas will provide suitable conditions for an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of biodiverse plants and animals. For example, in Britain {{it has been estimated that}} various types of rotting wood are home to over 1700 species of invertebrate.|$|E
5|$|As the Mk. IVA was {{modified}} into its improved Mk. V, the Mk. VI followed suit. But by early 1941 {{it was decided}} to make the Mk. VI an entirely new design, to more easily fit in small aircraft. EMI had already been awarded a contract for a dozen prototype units in October 1940 for delivery in February, but these continued changes made this impossible. Nevertheless, they presented a production contract for 1,500 units in December. Between December and March, production examples began arriving and displayed an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of problems, which the engineers worked through one-by one. By July the systems were ready for use, and began being installed in the new Defiant Mk. II early in August, but these demonstrated a problem where the system would lock-on to transmissions from other AI aircraft in the area, which resulted in further modifications. It was not until the beginning of December 1941 that these issues were fully solved and the units were cleared for squadron use.|$|E
25|$|Apparently greed largely {{determined}} the battle's outcome. The Comanches {{would have never}} been caught had they not been herding such an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of captured and heavily laden mules and horses. Thomas J. Pilgrim {{took part in the}} Battle of Plum Creek.|$|E

50|$|However, earlier {{published}} {{accounts of}} the periodical cicada's life cycle describe the history of cicada sightings differently. These accounts cite descriptions of fifteen- to seventeen-year recurrences of <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of noisy emergent cicadas that people had written as early as 1733, when Banneker was two years old.|$|R
50|$|Corrupt {{politicians}} simply line {{their own}} pockets. Honest idealist politicians cripple the people's freedom through <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of laws. So corrupt politicians are preferable according to Celine, despite {{the possibility of}} an honest politician who honestly opposes the formation of new laws (or wants to do away with some).|$|R
25|$|Small {{errors in}} floating-point {{arithmetic}} can grow when mathematical algorithms perform operations an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of times. A few examples are matrix inversion, eigenvector computation, and differential equation solving. These algorithms {{must be very}} carefully designed, using numerical approaches such as Iterative refinement, {{if they are to}} work well.|$|E
25|$|Pretoria in South Africa is {{popularly known}} as The Jacaranda City due to the <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of jacaranda trees planted as street trees and in parks and gardens. In {{flowering}} time the city appears blue/purple in colour when seen from the nearby hills {{because of all the}} jacaranda trees.|$|E

He also holds two Guinness World Records: one for receiving the most curtain calls (165) {{and another for}} the best-selling classical album (In Concert by the Three Tenors; the latter record is thus shared by fellow tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras).|$|E
50|$|Dafeng borders four {{counties}} including Dongtai, Sheyang, Yancheng and Xinghua. The {{county has}} a coastline of 112 km and a magnificent {{size of the}} wetland along its coastline, which is around near 800,000 hectares, sheltering <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of species of insects, fish, wild animals, and millions of migrating birds.|$|R
5000|$|The genus was {{introduced}} by the English naturalist James Francis Stephens in 1826. Anous is Ancient Greek for [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "foolish".

5000|$|The case is infamous within Korea {{for being}} the first truly {{identifiable}} strings of murders with a modus operandi. Police officers involved spent two million man-days on the case. [...] The total number of suspects also grew to <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers,</b> eventually ending with a total count of 21,280 individuals.|$|R
25|$|The {{first part}} of Einstein's {{argument}} was to determine how far a Brownian particle travels in a given time interval. Classical mechanics is unable to determine this distance because of the <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of bombardments a Brownian particle will undergo, roughly {{of the order of}} 1014 collisions per second. Thus Einstein was led to consider the collective motion of Brownian particles.|$|E
25|$|From {{early in}} his career, Alma-Tadema was {{particularly}} concerned with architectural accuracy, often including objects that he would see at museums – such as the British Museum in London – in his works. He also read many books and took many images from them. He amassed an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of photographs from ancient sites in Italy, which he used for the most precise accuracy {{in the details of}} his compositions.|$|E
25|$|An <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of cultivars have, {{like the}} sweet orange, {{a mix of}} pomelo and {{mandarin}} ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the tangor and ponkan tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. clementines). Mandarin traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic. Pomelo traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.|$|E
50|$|Features of the {{wind-pollination}} syndrome {{include a}} lack of scent production, {{a lack of}} showy floral parts (resulting in inconspicuous flowers), reduced production of nectar, {{and the production of}} <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of pollen grains. This distinguishes them from entomophilous and zoophilous species (whose pollen is spread by insects and vertebrates respectively).|$|R
50|$|During a {{conversation}} with Cole Gagne in the early 1990s, Dlugoszewski expressed ambivalence at having composed so many collaborative pieces, pointing out that while writing for film and dance allowed her music to be heard by <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of listeners, those audiences could not give her music their undivided attention.|$|R
25|$|The {{desert locust}} has natural enemies such as predatory wasps and flies, {{parasitoid}} wasps, predatory beetle larvae, birds and reptiles. These may be effective at keeping solitary populations in check but are of limited effects against gregarious desert locusts {{because of the}} <b>enormous</b> <b>numbers</b> of insects in the swarms and hopper bands.|$|R
25|$|The {{growth of}} the railway network had an immense effect on people's lives, but {{although}} the <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of bridges and other work undertaken by Eiffel were {{an important part of}} this, the two works that did most to make him famous are the Statue of Liberty and the Eiffel Tower, both projects of immense symbolic importance and today internationally recognized landmarks. The Tower is also important because of its role in establishing the aesthetic potential of structures whose appearance is largely dictated by practical considerations.|$|E
25|$|Some Byzantines {{tried to}} repulse the cavalry charge {{but they were}} also {{attacked}} by the infantry. Tsar Simeon personally took part in the fight, his white horse killed {{at the height of the}} battle. The Byzantines were completely routed. Leo Phocas was saved by fleeing to Mesembria (modern Nesebar) in Bulgaria, but in the thick of the battle Constantine Lips, John Grapson and many other commanders (archontes) were cut down along with an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of soldiers and officers. By the end of the day the Bulgarians overwhelmed the defenders of Mesembria and captured the town. Leo Phocas barely escaped by boarding a ship.|$|E
25|$|On the government's side, al-Muwaffaq was {{in command}} of an <b>enormous</b> <b>number</b> of men and ships, and his troops used naphtha {{in an attempt to}} burn down enemy structures. In addition, he ordered the {{construction}} of a new city, al-Muwaffaqiyyah, which provided provisions and other services for his men. Throughout the siege he utilized a carrot and stick approach with the rebels; Zanj troops that voluntarily surrendered were granted guarantees of safety and rewards, and were paraded in front of al-Mukhtarah to convince others to join them, while rebel soldiers that were killed in battle were at times decapitated and their heads were displayed in view of the defenders.|$|E
