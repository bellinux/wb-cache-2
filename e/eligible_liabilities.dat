40|$|Lead {{poisoning}} is the Nation’s {{number one}} children’s environmental health problem. Children are poisoned primarily by ingesting lead from household dust in older, low-rent housing. The {{best way to}} prevent this situation is to make housing in which young children live or are likely to live lead safe. The Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction and Financing Task Force recommended a set of lead-safe standards that would protect children and would be feasible for property owners. It also proposed that, if a resident child {{were found to have}} an elevated blood lead level, owners who could document compliance with the standards be afforded some liability relief. Complying owners would then become <b>eligible</b> for <b>liability</b> insurance and financing. HUD is working with State and local governments and the real estate, lending, and insurance industries to develop programs to implement the Task Force’s recommendations. This article was prepared as background information for the Symposium on State an...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} risk weighting in the determination of minimum requirements for <b>eligible</b> bail-in-able <b>liabilities</b> of banks (MREL), i. e. liabilities that are not exempt from the bail-in tool in bank resolution {{and that can be}} written down or converted into equity if losses on assets exceed the available equity and such bailing-in is required to re-establish bank solvency so as to provide a basis for maintaining systemically important operations in resolution. The paper begins with a general discussion of the reasons for introducing bank resolution as a special procedure outside of insolvency law, of the reasons for having the bail-in tool and of the frictions that may {{stand in the way of}} successful and frictionless resolution. This discussion emphasizes the importance of having sufficient bail-in-able liabilities available; in contrast, for large institutions that have access to bond markets, the social costs of such requirements are small (unlike the private costs to the banks themselves). However, neither risk weighted nor total assets provide proper guidance for determining MREL. Risk-weighting suffers from a lack of a proper statistical basis and a certain manipulability. Moreover, the risk weighting that is used for capital regulation is not well suited for determining MREL; whereas capital regulation focuses on the probability of bad results, MREL is concerned with the extent of losses conditional on results being bad. "Total assets" suffer from not truly representing total assets because various rules, e. g. for netting, allow banks to keep certain assets and liabilities off their balance sheets...|$|R
40|$|Liability for a cyber {{attack is}} not limited to the attackers. An attack may be {{foreseeable}} in some circumstances, and the failure of the target or the other entities to take steps to prevent the attack can constitute a breach of duty to injured victims. In the absence of the protections provided by the Support Anti-Terrorism By Fostering Effective Technologies (SAFETY) Act, a cyber attack on a chemical facility could give rise to a number of common-law tort and contract claims against the target of the attack and other entities, potentially including the target’s cyber security vendors. This article discusses claims that might arise in various cyber attack scenarios and the effect of the SAFETY Act on these potential claims. The SAFETY Act is a tort liability management statute that was passed as part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002. Under the SAFETY Act, entities that sell or otherwise deploy products that can be used to deter, defend against, respond to, mitigate, or otherwise combat “acts of terrorism” are <b>eligible</b> to receive <b>liability</b> protections. These liability protections can take the form of jurisdictional defenses, a cap on liability, or a presumption of immediate dismissal of third-party liability claims. This article reviews several scenarios to examine whether liability could be found against companies that make cyber security tools or against entities that purchase such tools. The article then examines how the SAFETY Act could be utilized to mitigate or eliminate such liability...|$|R

40|$|Multiple {{objectives}} are {{being pursued by}} the European Commission with its amendments to prudential rules in the banking reform package. On the core capital requirements side, there is the further alignment of EU rules with the Basel rules, in the leverage and net stable funding ratio, for example, and the softening of capital requirements for trading positions. On the resolution side, there is the alignment of bail-in standards TLAC (total loss-absorbing capacity) and MREL (minimum requirement for own funds and <b>eligible</b> <b>liabilities)</b> – an issue for large globally active banks. And on the bank business models side, there is the recalibration of the capital requirements for bank exposures to SMEs {{and the introduction of}} proportionality in rules – the first time this has been formally invoked...|$|E
40|$|From {{the start}} of 2016, new rules for bank {{resolution}} are in place – as {{spelled out in the}} Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) – across the EU, and a new authority (the Single Resolution Board, or SRB) is fully operational for resolving all banks in the eurozone. The implementation issues of the new regime are enormous. Banks need to develop recovery plans, and authorities need to create resolution plans as well as set the minimum required amount of own funds and <b>eligible</b> <b>liabilities</b> (MREL) for each bank. But given the diversity in bank structures and instruments at EU and global level, this will be a formidable challenge, above all with respect to internationally active banks. In order to explore ways in which the authorities and banks can meet this challenge, CEPS formed a Task Force composed of senior experts on banking sector reform and chaired by Thomas Huertas, Partner and Chair, EY Global Regulatory Network. This report contains its policy recommendations...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the bail-in tool under the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and predicts {{that it will}} not reach its policy objective. To make this argument, this paper first describes the policy rationale that calls for mandatory private sector involvement (PSI). From this analysis, the key features for an effective bail-in tool can be derived. These insights serve as the background {{to make the case that}} the European resolution framework is likely ineffective in establishing adequate market discipline through risk-reflecting prices for bank capital. The main reason for this lies in the avoidable embeddedness of the BRRD’s bail-in tool in the much broader resolution process, which entails ample discretion of the authorities also in forcing private sector involvement. Moreover, the idea that nearly all positions on the liability side of a bank’s balance sheet should be subjected to bail-in is misguided. Instead, a concentration of PSI in instruments that fall under the minimum requirements for own funds and <b>eligible</b> <b>liabilities</b> (MREL) is preferable. Finally, this paper synthesized the prior analysis by putting forward an alternative regulatory approach that seeks to disentangle private sector involvement as a precondition for effective bank-resolution as much as possible form the resolution process as such...|$|E
40|$|The bail-in tool as {{implemented}} in the European bank resolution framework suffers from severe shortcomings. To some extent, the regulatory framework can remedy the impediments to the desirable incentive effect of private sector involvement (PSI) that emanate {{from a lack of}} predictability of outcomes, if it compels banks to issue a sufficiently sized minimum of high-quality, easy to bail-in (subordinated) liabilities. Yet, even the limited improvements any prescription of bail-in capital can offer for PSI’s operational effectiveness seem compromised in important respects. The main problem, echoing the general concerns voiced against the European bail-in regime, is that the specifications for minimum requirements for own funds and <b>eligible</b> <b>liabilities</b> (MREL) are also highly detailed and discretionary and thus alleviate the predicament of investors in bail-in debt, at best, only insufficiently. Quite importantly, given the character of typical MREL instruments as non-runnable long-term debt, even if investors are able to gauge the relevant risk of PSI in a bank’s failure correctly at the time of purchase, subsequent adjustment of MREL-prescriptions by competent or resolution authorities potentially change the risk profile of the pertinent instruments. Therefore, original pricing decisions may prove inadequate and so may market discipline that follows from them. The pending European legislation aims at an implementation of the already complex specifications of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) for Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) by very detailed and case specific amendments to both the regulatory capital and the resolution regime with an exorbitant emphasis on proportionality and technical fine-tuning. What gets lost in this approach, however, is the key policy objective of enhanced market discipline through predictable PSI: it is hardly conceivable that the pricing of MREL-instruments reflects an accurate risk-assessment of investors because of the many discretionary choices a multitude of agencies are supposed to make and revisit in the administration of the new regime. To prove this conclusion, this chapter looks in more detail at the regulatory objectives of the BRRD’s prescriptions for MREL and their implementation in the prospectively amended European supervisory and resolution framework...|$|E
