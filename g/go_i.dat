5|$|Following {{the release}} of It's a Feedelity Affair in 2006, Lindstrøm had become tired of {{producing}} dance remixes and average length vocal pieces. He began giving the artists and labels mixes with slower tempos. Lindstrøm also felt he was unwisely incorporating musical ideas into remixes instead of original works, which led to experiments with lengthier tracks for an original album. Four to five tracks were originally envisioned for Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too, but only three were chosen.|$|E
5|$|Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too was {{released}} by Smalltown Supersound on August 18, 2008 in the United Kingdom, and August 19 in the United States. A special edition was issued on December 23, 2008. The album featured a bonus disc with edited versions of the original tracks by frequent Lindstrøm collaborator Prins Thomas. Lindstrøm toured in Austria, Germany, Spain, and the United States that fall.|$|E
25|$|The {{second section}} ("Why {{she had to}} <b>go</b> <b>I</b> don't know...") is, {{according}} to Pollack, less musically surprising on paper than it sounds. Starting with Em7, the harmonic progression quickly moves through the A-major, D-minor, and (closer to F-major) B, before resolving back to F-major, {{and at the end}} of this, McCartney holds F while the strings descend to resolve to the home key to introduce the restatement of the first section, before a brief hummed closing phrase.|$|E

500|$|Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too debuted at No. 11 on the Norwegian music chart. The {{following}} week {{it fell to}} No. 27 before leaving the list. The record did not chart internationally. In 2009, Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too received a Spellemannprisen award for [...] "best electronica album". The album was well received by critics and received an 82 out of 100 on the aggregate website Metacritic, which signifies [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E
500|$|Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too is {{the first}} studio album by Norwegian electronica artist Hans-Peter Lindstrøm. It was first {{released}} in the United Kingdom on August 18, 2008 and was subsequently released {{the next day in}} the United States. The album comprises three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 minutes in length. Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too is usually labeled [...] "space disco" [...] due to its [...] "spacey, psychedelic" [...] feel and four-to-the-floor beats.|$|E

Merrick was unable to bring himself to see the horse before he was put down. He said, [...] "I couldn't <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> just couldn't see him like that. He was too good a friend". Easy Jet was {{inducted}} into the AQHA Hall of Fame in 1993.|$|E
500|$|The two bonus {{tracks were}} {{included}} on the album because [...] "they proved very popular with the fans of the special event".

The 35th Infantry was now surrounded by forces of the NK 6th and 7th Divisions, with an estimated three battalions of them behind its lines. Speaking later of the situation, Fisher said, [...] "I never intended to withdraw. There {{was no place to}} <b>go.</b> <b>I</b> planned to go into a regimental perimeter and hold." ...|$|E
500|$|Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too {{comprises}} three tracks, roughly 30, 10, and 15 {{minutes in}} duration, which seamlessly flow {{into each other}} in transitions that were described as [...] "gradual and subtle". The songs grow and develop independent musical traits, such as motifs, polyrhythms, and melodies. According to The Guardian, some musical changes are pronounced, such as {{the introduction of a}} synthesizer, while others, such as small tempo changes, remain [...] "almost insensible". Some critics have noted the album conjures the feeling of a journey.|$|E
500|$|Jim Brackpool of Yahoo! Music felt {{audience}} reactions {{would be}} polarized; some {{would find it}} [...] "sophisticated and lovingly crafted", while others might be put off by its [...] "unabashed opulence". No Ripcord writer Sam Draper christened the record [...] "one of the finest pieces of music [...] heard in years." [...] Pitchfork editor Tim Finney believed Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too showed signs of a masterpiece, but also possessed [...] "bloat, excess, and splendor" [...] reminiscent of disco revivalists. Pitchfork named {{it one of the}} best albums of 2008.|$|E

Where you <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> go." [...] They sat down in a pair of deck chairs and waited for the end. The industrialist Benjamin Guggenheim changed out of his life vest and sweater into top hat and evening dress and declared his wish to go down with the ship like a gentleman.|$|E
500|$|During Williams and Ledger's time together, {{they lived}} in Brooklyn, New York. By September 2007, the couple {{amicably}} ended their three-year relationship. Of the break-up, People quoted her telling Elle magazine, [...] "I didn't know where to <b>go.</b> <b>I</b> couldn't imagine any {{place in the world}} that was gonna feel good to me." [...] After Ledger's death from a combined drug intoxication (CDI) in January 2008, the usually under-the-radar actress and her daughter became an interest of the media and were often followed by paparazzi. As a result, Williams rarely gave interviews until the end of 2009.|$|E
500|$|The {{music is}} a collage of {{electronic}} music, characterized by synthesized melodies, layered sounds, live performances, and [...] four-to-the-floor beats. Pitchfork editor Dominique Leone {{described it as a}} [...] "seamless combination of digital production, analog synthesizers and live instrumentation." [...] Lindstrøm has been heavily influenced by music from the 1970s and 1980s, particularly disco progenitors Jean-Marc Cerrone and Giorgio Moroder. Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too is often classified as [...] "space disco" [...] due to these influences and because it possesses a [...] "spacey, psychedelic" [...] sound. Lindstrøm listened to the Beach Boys, the Eagles, and Kirsty MacColl while writing the album.|$|E

500|$|AllMusic writer K. Ross Hoffman {{declared}} the record an [...] "entirely satisfying display" [...] of Lindstrøm's talents and positively {{commented on the}} textured instrumentation. Hoffman concluded the music was an [...] "expansive, exploratory journey" [...] worth experiencing. Andy Battaglia of The A.V. Club disagreed, believing the album to be narrow minded and a missed opportunity to exploit the lengthy tracks and deliver more musical depth. Praise was given by Alex Macpherson of The Guardian, who stated [...] "Every aspect of the record seems tailor-made to produce maximum pleasure [...] Where You <b>Go</b> <b>I</b> Go Too would make even the most hellish of journeys seem like a first-class trip." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean's father, Albert Balukas, {{along with}} his partner, {{professional}} player Frank McGown, was the proprietor of a forty-eight-table pool hall called the Ovington Lounge in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, New York. Balukas's introduction to play was at 4 years of age, not {{on one of her}} father's tables but on a 4-1⁄2by9foot pool table in the cellar of her childhood home, purchased by her parents to keep her four billiards-playing brothers out of local pool rooms. In later years Balukas explained that she [...] "almost never went to the pool hall and if I did <b>go,</b> <b>I</b> didn't play. I felt uncomfortable, and besides, girls didn't go in those days." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{cast members}} of the show took the news about the show ending well. Hayes said: [...] "I'm proud of {{being a part of}} {{something}} in history and I'm proud to have been given a platform to make people laugh." [...] McCormack added, [...] "We have never taken ourselves or this show too seriously but now that it's over I take our collective achievement very, very seriously." [...] The actors were satisfied with the episode and thought the viewers would find it satisfying as well. [...] "It's daring and ambitious and more far-reaching than most finales <b>go.</b> <b>I</b> think people will be quite surprised," [...] McCormack said. Messing added: [...] "I think Will & Grace fans will be satisfied. Ultimately, [...] was done beautifully and it ties up loose ends for all of the characters in a way that's wonderful." ...|$|E
