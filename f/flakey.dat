500|$|Throughout the 1980s, SRI {{developed}} Zylon, stealth technologies, {{improvements to}} ultrasound imaging, two-dimensional laser fluorescence imaging, and order-sorted algebra. In computing and software, SRI developed a {{multimedia electronic mail}} system, a theory of non-interference in computer security, a multilevel secure (MLS) relational database system called Seaview, LaTeX, Open Agent Architecture (OAA), a network intrusion detection system, the Maude system, a declarative software language, and PacketHop, a peer-to-peer wireless technology to create scalable ad hoc networks. [...] SRI's research in network intrusion detection led to the patent infringement case SRI International, Inc. v. Internet Security Systems, Inc. The AI center's robotics research led to Shakey's successor, <b>Flakey</b> the robot, which focused on fuzzy logic.|$|E
500|$|When {{the film}} was released, the {{distributor}} did not promote it heavily, and most reviewers disliked it. Because {{the film was}} X-rated, The New York Times refused to run the film's advertisement. [...] This was a somewhat awkward situation, as the ad included a positive review from The New York Times. According to Swenson, [...] "it didn't have a big following, ... {{but it is still}} in video stores." [...] The film played for about two weeks in New York City. Jerry Beck wrote a review in which he called the film [...] "raunchier than Ralph Bakshi's films." [...] He {{went on to say that}} the humor of the film [...] "is good, but the design and drawing is downright awful. It seems to be sort of a cross between Jules Feiffer and Gahan Wilson, if that can be imagined." [...] Beck also stated that the film was [...] "very similar to R. Crumb's Mr. Natural and <b>Flakey</b> Foont. There is no reason that the duck should be a duck. Every character in the film is human, and he just seems to be a duck just to give the film a catchy title. There are some highly imaginative animated ideas here, but the film's entertainment value is at a minimum." [...] Beck later called the film [...] "one of the most overlooked animated features of the 1970s, a glorious experimental mess of a film, which, from today’s vantage point, looks incredibly creative and daring, and something current Hollywood studios would never attempt." ...|$|E

2500|$|In his book, Russia at War 1941 to 1945, Alexander Werth {{reported}} that while visiting Gdańsk (Danzig) in 1945 shortly after its liberation by the Red Army, {{he saw an}} experimental factory outside the city for making soap from human corpses. According to Werth it had been run by [...] "a German professor called Spanner" [...] and [...] "was a nightmarish sight, with its vats full of human heads and torsos pickled in some liquid, and its pails full of a <b>flakey</b> substance [...] human soap".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Flakey</b> Dove was a bay mare with a {{small white}} star, bred and owned by the Price family of Herefordshire. Shortly after the Second World War, Tom Price paid £25 for a broken down {{point-to-point}} mare of uncertain parentage named Cottage Lass. She became a successful broodmare, becoming the ancestor of three generations of racehorses, all of whom included the word [...] "Dove" [...] in their names. As Cottage Lass's pedigree could not be traced {{to any of the}} Foundation mares recorded in the General Stud Book, her descendant could not be registered as Thoroughbreds. Tom Price's grandson, Richard, who ran a 400 acre livestock farm near Leominster, trained Cottage Lass's great-granddaughter <b>Flakey</b> Dove threoughout her racing career. <b>Flakey</b> Dove was sired by the Oats, a successful National Hunt stallion whose other progeny included the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Master Oats.|$|E
