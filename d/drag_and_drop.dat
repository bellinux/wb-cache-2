5|$|As in its predecessor, System Shock, {{gameplay}} in System Shock 2 is an amalgamation of {{the action}} role-playing game and survival horror genres. The developers achieved this gameplay design by rendering the experience as a standard first-person shooter and adding a character customization and development system, which are considered as signature role-play elements. The player uses melee and projectile weapons to defeat enemies, while a role-playing system allows the development of useful abilities. Navigation is presented from a first-person view and complemented with a heads-up display that shows character and weapon information, a map, and a <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> inventory.|$|E
5|$|The {{game has}} local two-player {{multiplayer}} with a divided iPad screen, and asynchronous online multiplayer where players construct levels for their opponents to complete. Players spin a wheel {{at the beginning}} of their turn to determine how many hazards they get to place via <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop.</b> A few of the items are unlocked at first, and more are available with progress through the game or in-app purchases. Gasketball uses a colorful palette and features a cranky robot, who provides a tutorial and resets the ball. It was released as free-to-play with the tutorial unlocked, and four to five chapters available as additional paid downloads.|$|E
5|$|The user {{interface}} and game controls are unified across the PC and home console versions. Players {{have the option}} of using any combination of a keyboard, mouse, and game controller to play; the former two are achieved on PlayStation 4 via wireless or USB keyboard and mouse. By default, the system is navigated through <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> windows on PC. Navigation on the PlayStation version of Final Fantasy XIV is accomplished with a XrossMediaBar-like interface due to platform users' familiarity with the set-up. This bar is used to access all menus, maps, logs, and configuration options. The head-up display for both versions includes a message log, party status menu, mini-map, and action bar. The player may customize the location of all of these elements.|$|E

5000|$|The SHS file {{extension}} is primarily associated with Shell Scrap Object Files produced by Microsoft Windows. They {{are created by}} selecting part of a document content <b>and</b> then <b>dragging</b> <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> it outside the document program window (e.g. selecting some lines of text in a Word document, <b>dragging</b> <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> them on the desktop). The operating system will create an [...]shs file with the selected content, which will be useless alone, and only readable by <b>dragging</b> the icon <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> it in a program which supports this mechanism.|$|R

It {{is used to}} author user interfaces targeting Windows Presentation Foundation. It supports all WPF functionality including data binding and automatic layout management. It generates XAML code for the UI. The generated XAML file is compatible with Microsoft Expression Design, the designer-oriented product. The XAML code is linked with code using a code-behind model.|$|E
25|$|In January 1981, Steve Jobs {{completely}} {{took over}} the Macintosh project. Jobs {{and a number of}} Apple engineers visited Xerox PARC in December 1979, three months after the Lisa and Macintosh projects had begun. After hearing about the pioneering GUI technology being developed at Xerox PARC from former Xerox employees like Raskin, Jobs negotiated a visit to see the Xerox Alto computer and Smalltalk development tools in exchange for Apple stock options. The final Lisa and Macintosh operating systems use concepts from the Xerox Alto, but many elements of the graphical user interface were created by Apple including the menu bar, pull-down menus, and the concepts of <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> and direct manipulation.|$|E
25|$|The Start screen {{no longer}} {{supports}} several previously available features. A list of recently launched program or shortcuts to special folders no longer {{appears on the}} Start screen. It no longer supports more than one level of nesting for groups in All Programs view. <b>Drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> support for adding new items to the menu as well as reorganizing the contents of All Programs view is no longer available. In addition, {{for the first time}} in the history of Windows, the Start menu in a stock installation of Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 does not provide any facility for shutting down, restarting or activating sleep mode or hibernation, forcing users to use the settings button in the charms bar to perform these actions. An April 2014 update for Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012 R2 restores the latter.|$|E

Dolphin now supports previews of files in toolbars and {{has gained a}} slider to zoom in and out on file item views. It can now also show the full path in the breadcrumb bar. Konqueror offers increased loading speed by prefetching domain name data in KHTML. A find-as-you-type bar improves navigation in webpages. KMail has a new message header list, and reworked attachment view. The KWrite and Kate text editors can now operate in Vi input mode, accommodating those used to the traditional UNIX editor. Ark, the archiving tool has gained support for password-protected archives and is accessible via a context menu from the file managers now. KRDC, the remote desktop client improves support for Microsoft’s Active Directory through LDAP. Kontact has gained a new planner summary and support for <b>drag</b> <b>and</b> <b>drop</b> in the free/busy view. KSnapshot now uses the window title when saving screenshots, {{making it easier to}} index them using search engines.|$|E

50|$|Dragging {{requires}} more physical effort than moving the same pointing device without holding down any buttons. Because of this, a user cannot move as quickly <b>and</b> precisely while <b>dragging</b> (see Fitts' law). However, drag-and-drop operations {{have the advantage}} of thoughtfully chunking together two operands (the object to <b>drag,</b> <b>and</b> the <b>drop</b> location) into a single action.Extended <b>dragging</b> <b>and</b> <b>dropping</b> (as in graphic design) can stress the mousing hand.|$|R
