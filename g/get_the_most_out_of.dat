500|$|A dive {{profile is}} a {{description}} of a diver's pressure exposure over time. [...] It may be as simple as just a depth and time pair, as in: [...] "sixty for twenty," [...] (a stay of 20 minutes at a depth of 60 feet) or as complex as a second by second graphical representation of depth and time recorded by a personal dive computer. Several common types of dive profile are specifically named, and these may be characteristic of the purpose of the dive. For example, a working dive at a limited location will often follow a constant depth (square) profile, and a recreational dive is likely to follow a multilevel profile, as the divers start deep and work their way up a reef to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the available breathing gas. The names are usually descriptive of the graphic appearance.|$|E

Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to {{those who want to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, but if I had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate."

500|$|On the Turkish side, by {{that night}} the 2nd Battalion 57th Infantry were on Baby 700, the 3rd Battalion, reduced to only ninety men, were at The Nek, and the 1st Battalion on Mortar Ridge. Just south {{of them was the}} 77th Infantry, next was the 27th Infantry {{opposite}} 400 Plateau. The last regiment, the 72nd Infantry, were on Battleship Hill. As for manpower, the Turks were in a similar situation to the ANZACs. Of the two regiments most heavily involved, the 57th had been destroyed, and the 27th were exhausted with heavy casualties. Large numbers of the 77th had deserted, and the regiment was in no condition to fight. The 72nd was largely intact, but they were a poorly trained force of Arab conscripts. The III Corps, having to deal with both landings, could not assist as they had no reserves available. It was not until 27 April that the 33rd and 64th Infantry Regiments arrived to reinforce the Turkish forces. The ANZACs, however, had been unable to achieve their obectives, and therefore dug in. Gallipoli, like the Western Front, turned into a war of attrition. The German commander, Liman von Saunders, was clear about the reasons for the outcome. He wrote that, [...] "on the Turkish side the situation was saved by the immediate and independent action of the 19th Division." [...] The division commander, Kemal, became noted as [...] "the most imaginative, most successful officer to fight on either side" [...] during the campaign. As a commander he was able to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> his troops, typified by his order to the 57th Infantry Regiment; [...] "Men, I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. In the time that it takes us to die, other forces and commanders can come and take our place." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics have {{described}} the anime adaptation as having a very slow pace but having a beautiful musical score. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network faulted the director, Koichi Mashimo, for [...] "downshifting the plot's energy" [...] and as having [...] "too many flashbacks, too many slow pans over inexpressive eyes", that create an end-product that is [...] "tediously formulaic". Active Anime's Christopher Seaman had mixed feelings, finding the romantic themes mature and the magical themes appealing to younger audiences; he concluded that [...] "teens would <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the series." [...] He recommended the series in general, praising its plot and its themes. DVDTalk's Todd Douglass Jr. ranked the anime DVD box as [...] "Highly Recommended"; he liked how, despite borrowing elements from other series, it was [...] "entirely self-contained". Douglas pointed out that following its second season, the anime kept entertaining viewers, and felt they would not find a reason to dislike it. Douglas enjoyed the anime's storytelling. He liked its characters, but found it sometimes dragging due to its episodic nature. Kimlinger praised the musical score as being beautiful, as Yuki Kajiura's work has always been. Chris Beveridge from Mania Entertainment made similar comments, praising the series' score and animation, while commenting on the series' accessibility. He said that people unrelated with Clamp's works would like Tsubasa, in contrast to other people who would [...] "get out of the series". Its episodic nature was praised by Luther, who commented how the main plot was connected {{to each of the}} story arcs. The English cast for the anime has been labelled as [...] "done and very solid". IGN's Jeffrey Harris felt Christopher Sabat was its best actor. Harris called the anime [...] "a nice looking and at times elegant looking show", pointing to the traits of the main characters. He criticized the lack of extras in the DVDs releases. Reviewing the anime's and xxxHolics films, IGN writer N.S. Davidson said the Tsubasa film would be appealing to viewers of the series, despite its short length. He liked how both films' storylines interacted, allowing parts of the plot of Tsubasa to be explained in the xxxHolic film, and he found artistic similarities between the two films. Carlo Santos was more critical of the film but still called it [...] "good art". In a TV Asahi poll, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was ranked as the fifty-ninth most popular anime in Japan. It ranked ninth in Animages Anime Grand Prix anime popularity poll from 2005, while it was also listed as a [...] "Honorable Mention" [...] in IGN's [...] "Top Ten Anime of 2007" [...] feature.|$|E

The album received critical acclaim, with Allmusic saying [...] "Fortress is a driving album that not only doesn't feel tired or stale, but is a monster of an album that makes a pretty solid case for being some of Alter Bridge's strongest and most dynamic work to date." [...] Their second and third singles [...] "Cry of Achilles" [...] and [...] "Waters Rising" [...] performed relatively well at the charts, achieving 27 and 15 place at US Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.|$|E

6000|$|Vanity Fair (1847--1848) is {{the best}} known of Thackeray's novels. It was his first great work, and was {{intended}} to express his own views of the social life about him, and to protest against the overdrawn heroes of popular novels. He takes for his subject that Vanity Fair to which Christian and Faithful were conducted {{on their way to the}} Heavenly City, as recorded in Pilgrim's Progress. In this fair there are many different booths, given over to the sale of [...] "all sorts of vanities," [...] and as we go from one to another we come in contact with [...] "juggling, cheats, games, plays, fools, apes, knaves, rogues, and that of every kind." [...] Evidently this is a picture of one side of social life; but the difference between Bunyan and Thackeray is simply this,--that Bunyan made Vanity Fair a small incident in a long journey, a place through which most of us pass on our way to better things; while Thackeray, describing high society in his own day, makes it a place of long sojourn, wherein his characters spend the greater part of their lives. Thackeray styles this work [...] "a novel without a hero." [...] The whole action of the story, which is without plot or development, revolves about two women,--Amelia, a meek creature of the milk-and-water type, and Becky Sharp, a keen, unprincipled intriguer, who lets nothing stand in the way of her selfish desire to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the fools who largely constitute society. On the whole, it is the most powerful but not the most wholesome of Thackeray's works.|$|E
60|$|I think so. If I {{may make}} a {{suggestion}} without seeming {{to be trying to}} teach my grandmother to suck eggs, I will offer it. In our days we have learned the value of combination. We apply it everywhere--in railway systems, in trusts, in trade unions, in Salvation Armies, in minor politics, in major politics, in European Concerts. Whatever our strength may be, big or little, we organise it. We have found out that that {{is the only way to}} <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it that is in it. We know the weakness of individual sticks, and the strength of the concentrated faggot. Suppose you try a scheme like this, for instance. In England and America put every Jew on the census-book as a Jew (in case you have not been doing that). Get up volunteer regiments composed of Jews solely, and when the drum beats, fall in and go to the front, so as to remove the reproach that you have few Massenas among you, and that you feed on a country but don't like to fight for it. Next, in politics, organise your strength, band together, and deliver the casting-vote where you can, and, where you can't, compel as good terms as possible. You huddle to yourselves already in all countries, but you huddle to no sufficient purpose, politically speaking. You do not seem to be organised, except for your charities. There you are omnipotent; there you compel your due of recognition--you do not have to beg for it. It shows what you can do when you band together for a definite purpose.|$|E
