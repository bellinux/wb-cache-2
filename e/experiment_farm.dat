25|$|Until 1931, the <b>Experiment</b> <b>Farm</b> {{fell into}} some disrepair, so Stark Bro’s sent emissaries to {{retrieve}} the most promising fruit, nut and ornamental shrubs, and in 1931 sold the flowers, vegetables and seeds to Burpee Seed Co. J. B. Keil came from Stark Bro’s to coordinate the efforts and worked there from 1931 to 1934. Over the following years, Elizabeth worked with the Stark brothers to patent 16 Burbank fruits and flowers. The patents name Luther Burbank, deceased, as “inventor” by Elizabeth Waters Burbank, executrix of his estate. In 1935, Stark ended the agreement with Mrs. Burbank (or vice versa).|$|E

40|$|A {{substantial}} part of the finishing pigs in the Netherlands is infected with Salmonella. Infection of pigs with Salmonella can occur already on the farm. Pigs can also get infected or contaminated during transport, lairage or slaughter. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of separating pigs from Salmonella-infected farms from pigs from Salmonella-free farms during transport, lairage and slaughter on the prevalence of Salmonella on pork after slaughter. Two experiments were carried out. In the first <b>experiment,</b> <b>farms</b> were selected to participate, based on serology of the pigs (Dutch Salmonella ELISA). The pigs were slaughtered at the beginning of the day: firstly, sero-negative herds, secondly, sero-positive herds and thirdly, again sero-negative herds. The latter were slaughtered to investigate the effect of a contaminated slaughterline due to a previously slaughtered positive herd. In the second <b>experiment,</b> <b>farms</b> were selected to participate, based on both serology and bacteriology of the pigs on the farm. Two hundred pigs from Salmonella-free farms were slaughtered after 200 pigs from Salmonella-infected farms. Results showed that the prevalence of Salmonella in pork samples of sero-negative herds was lower than in samples of sero-positive herds. Results also showed that Salmonella contamination of carcasses after slaughter was partially caused by Salmonella-infected herds that were slaughtered before, and partially by residential flora of the slaughterhouse. It is concluded that separate slaughter of sero-negative pig herds can be useful to decrease the prevalence of Salmonella-contaminated pork after slaughter. To avoid cross-contamination by residential flora from trucks, lairage and slaughterline, cleaning and disinfection have to be improved...|$|R

50|$|The Hatch Act of 1887 {{authorized}} agricultural experiment {{stations in}} the U.S. and its territories to provide science-based research information to farmers.

Stations in Kenai (1899-1908), Rampart (1900-1925), Copper Center (1903-1908), and Fairbanks (1906-present) followed quickly.

Surgeon John Harris, who had already received land grants {{in the area in}} 1793 and 1805, bought the farm and built a cottage on the site in c1795. Harris Park is named after John Harris.

The Parramatta area was also the site of the pioneering of the Australian wool industry by John Macarthur's Elizabeth Farm in the 1790s. Philip Gidley King's account of his visit to Parramatta on 9 April 1790 is one of the earliest descriptions of the area. Walking four miles with Governor Phillip to Prospect, he saw undulating grassland interspersed with magnificent trees and a great number of kangaroos and emus.|$|E
