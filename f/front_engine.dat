The three engines and the reduction gearbox are mounted on a horizontal bulkhead and firewall which forms {{the roof of the}} cabin and upper structural member of the fuselage. The engines are isolated by multiple firewalls, including transverse firewalls separating <b>front</b> and rear <b>engines</b> from the rotor gearbox, and zonal engine firewalls. Eight sturdy hinged doors provide access to the compact Turmo engines, which have ample space around them to enable ground crew to service them without using external platforms.|$|R
25|$|The prototypes of the Mizar {{were made}} by mating the rear portion of a Cessna Skymaster to a Ford Pinto. The pod-and-twin-boom {{configuration}} of the Skymaster was a convenient starting point for a hybrid automobile/airplane. The passenger space and <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> of the Skymaster were removed, leaving an airframe ready to attach to a small car. AVE planned {{to have their own}} airframe purpose-built by a subcontractor for production models, rather than depending on Cessna for airframes.|$|E
25|$|Before the Primula, all Fiat Group {{passenger}} cars were rear-wheel drive; the larger models followed the classic FR layout (<b>front</b> <b>engine</b> powering the rear axle), and small cars were rear-engined. Meanwhile, a practical concept emerged, namely the front-wheel drive layout {{with the engine}} mounted transversely, which allowed for very efficient space utilization. Although invented by Fiat, it was first popularized by the Mini, it also {{found its way to}} other, bigger models, starting with BMC's Austin/Morris 1100.|$|E
25|$|The Lexus SC (Japanese: レクサス・SC, Rekusasu SC) {{is a grand}} tourer {{that was}} retailed by Lexus, and built from 1991 through 2010. It {{features}} a <b>front</b> <b>engine,</b> rear-wheel drive design and seating for up to four passengers. The first-generation SC debuted as the V8-powered SC 400 in 1991, and the I6-powered SC 300 was added in 1992. Both first-generation models were produced until 2000. The second-generation model, the SC 430, went into production in 2001. The SC 430 features a hardtop convertible design and a V8 engine. The first-generation SC was largely styled in California at Calty, and the second-generation SC was mainly conceived at design studios in Europe.|$|E

25|$|LeSabres were {{rear-drive}} six-passenger vehicles from 1959 to 1985 (station wagons through 1990) featuring separate body-on-frame construction {{along with}} a longitudinally mounted <b>front</b> <b>engine.</b> The first downsized generation of LeSabres introduced in 1977 retained the rear-drive and body-on-frame construction, while the later-generation models introduced in 1986 switched to front-wheel-drive, unit-body construction and transversely mounted engine. Convertibles were offered each year through 1975 while two- and four-door hardtops were dropped after 1976 and only pillared body styles were offered from 1977 to 2005. Station wagons were offered through 1964 and then dropped for several years until being reintroduced in 1970 and continued until 1990 after which year they were moved to the revived Roadmaster series. LeSabres come in two versions: Custom and Limited.|$|E
2500|$|To {{allow for}} the tight curves, {{including}} [...] radius bends with [...] superelevation without any intermediate tangent and the steep, twisting nature of the line, the <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> unit's pivot bearing was spherical, with its alignment controlled by sprung rollers. The rear pivot was the usual Beyer, Peacock flat adjustable type.|$|E
2500|$|The engines were {{connected}} to a common gearbox that was mounted in the nose. The rear engine {{was connected to the}} nose-mounted gearbox by a long drive shaft similar to the American Bell P-39 Airacobra. [...] The gearbox did not combine the power output of the two engines. [...] Instead, the rear engine drove the forward controllable-pitch propeller, while the <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> independently drove the rearward fixed-pitch propeller.|$|E

The engine exceeds Euro V emissions. The engine is installed with a front mid-engine placement. According to Chief Engineer Haruhiko Tanahashi a <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> layout was selected instead of a mid engine layout as it is inherently more forgiving dynamically, affording less experienced drivers a wider safety net.|$|E
2500|$|Voyager had {{front and}} rear propellers, powered by {{separate}} engines. It was originally flown on June 22, 1984, powered by Lycoming O-235 engines with fixed-pitch propellers. In November 1985, the aircraft was rolled out, fitted with world-flight engines, an air-cooled Teledyne Continental O-240 in the forward location and a liquid-cooled Teledyne Continental IOL-200 in the aft location. [...] Both were fitted with wooden, variable-pitch electrically actuated MT-Propellers. [...] The plan was for the rear engine to be operated throughout the flight. The <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> was intended to provide additional power for takeoff and the initial part of the flight at heavy weights.|$|E

50|$|When {{referring}} to cars, the left-hand {{side of the}} car is the side that corresponds with the driver's left, as seen from the driver's seat.

The crew and passengers were carried {{in a pair of}} flat-bottomed floats suspended on struts underneath the lower wing. [...] It was powered by three 50hp (37kW) Gnome Omega rotary engines arranged in line above the wing centre section, each connected by a roller chain to a long shaft at the rear of which was a four-bladed propeller 9ft 10in (3m) diameter.

2500|$|Mallet {{also worked}} out schemes for {{compounds}} with independent divided drive for HP and LP, some {{with a single}} rigid chassis that were never built, others with a rigid rear chassis on which the HP cylinders were mounted and an articulated LP <b>front</b> <b>engine</b> unit. The latter arrangement was adopted worldwide. The first application {{was a series of}} 600mm gauge locomotives specially built by the Decauville Company for the Paris Exposition of 1889; the design was introduced to the North American railroading in 1900 with B No. 2400, and rapidly became popular there.
