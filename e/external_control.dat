Individuals learn the difference between <b>external</b> <b>control</b> {{of the group and}} personal control of their own behavior. They learn that controlling the group is something that everyone in the group contributes to. They learn about different techniques to influence group success. They gain skills in balancing the group's versus the individual's needs.|$|E

25|$|Postcolonialism or postcolonial {{studies is}} an {{academic}} discipline that analyzes, explains, and {{responds to the}} cultural legacy of colonialism and imperialism. Postcolonialism speaks about the human consequences of <b>external</b> <b>control</b> and economic exploitation of native people and their lands. Drawing from postmodern schools of thought, postcolonial studies analyze the politics of knowledge (creation, control, and distribution) by examining the functional relations {{of social and political}} power that sustain colonialism and neocolonialism—the imperial regime's depictions (social, political, cultural) of the colonizer and of the colonized.|$|E
25|$|Teachers play {{a crucial}} role in the {{implementation}} of strategies aimed at improving academic success and classroom functioning in individuals with executive dysfunction. In a classroom environment, the goal of intervention should ultimately be to apply <b>external</b> <b>control,</b> as needed (e.g. adapt the environment to suit the child, provide adult support) in an attempt to modify problem behaviours or supplement skill deficits. Ultimately, executive function difficulties should not be attributed to negative personality traits or characteristics (e.g. laziness, lack of motivation, apathy, and stubbornness) as these attributions are neither useful nor accurate.|$|E
25|$|The {{late eighteenth}} and early nineteenth centuries are {{typically}} seen as decisive in {{the emergence of}} new attitudes towards the management and treatment of the insane. Increasingly, the emphasis shifted from the <b>external</b> <b>control</b> of the mad through physical restraint and coercion to their moral management whereby self-discipline would be inculcated through a system of reward and punishment. For proponents of lunacy reform, the Quaker-run York Retreat, founded in 1796, functioned as an exemplar of this new approach that would seek to re-socialise and re-educate the mad. Bethlem, embroiled in scandal from 1814 over its inmate conditions, would come to symbolise its antithesis.|$|E

25|$|The {{components}} {{include the}} yoke, the magnetic coil, the poles, the polepiece, and the <b>external</b> <b>control</b> circuitry. The pole piece must be manufactured {{in a very}} symmetrical manner, as this provides the boundary conditions for the magnetic field that forms the lens. Imperfections {{in the manufacture of}} the pole piece can induce severe distortions in the magnetic field symmetry, which induce distortions that will ultimately limit the lenses' ability to reproduce the object plane. The exact dimensions of the gap, pole piece internal diameter and taper, as well as the overall design of the lens is often performed by finite element analysis of the magnetic field, whilst considering the thermal and electrical constraints of the design.|$|E
25|$|A {{fundamentally}} different mechanism for memristive behavior {{has been proposed}} by Pershin and Di Ventra. The authors show that certain types of semiconductor spintronic structures belong to a broad class of memristive systems as defined by Chua and Kang. The mechanism of memristive behavior in such structures is based entirely on the electron spin degree of freedom which allows for a more convenient control than the ionic transport in nanostructures. When an <b>external</b> <b>control</b> parameter (such as voltage) is changed, the adjustment of electron spin polarization is delayed because of the diffusion and relaxation processes causing hysteresis. This result was anticipated {{in the study of}} spin extraction at semiconductor/ferromagnet interfaces, but was not described in terms of memristive behavior. On a short time scale, these structures behave almost as an ideal memristor. This result broadens the possible range of applications of semiconductor spintronics and makes a step forward in future practical applications.|$|E
25|$|The ISS {{employs a}} total of four CMGs as primary {{actuating}} devices during normal flight mode operation. The objective of the CMG flight control system is to hold the space station at a fixed attitude relative {{to the surface of the}} Earth. In addition, it seeks a Torque Equilibrium Attitude (TEA), in which the combined torque contribution of gravity gradient, atmospheric drag, solar pressure, and geomagnetic interactions are minimized. In the presence of these continual environmental disturbances CMGs absorb momentum in an attempt to maintain the space station at a desired attitude. The CMGs will eventually saturate (absorbing momentum to the point where they can absorb no more), resulting in loss of effectiveness of the CMG array for control. Some kind of momentum management scheme (MMS) is necessary to allow the CMGs to hold a desired attitude and at the same time prevent CMG saturation. Since the CMGs are momentum-exchange devices, <b>external</b> <b>control</b> torques must be used to desaturate the CMGs, that is, bring the momentum back to nominal value. Some methods for unloading CMG momentum include the use of magnetic torques, reaction thrusters, and gravity gradient torque. For the space station, the gravity gradient torque approach is preferred because it requires no consumables or external hardware and because the gravity-gradient torque on the ISS can be very high.|$|E

500|$|Franklin {{argues that}} in modern society, control-related and {{prescriptive}} technologies are dominant. [...] "When work is organized as {{a sequence of}} separately executable steps, the control over the work moves to the organizer, the boss or manager," [...] she writes. [...] "In political terms, prescriptive technologies are designs for compliance." [...] For Franklin, workers accustomed to following prescriptive rules become used to seeing <b>external</b> <b>control</b> and internal compliance as normal and necessary. They also {{come to believe that}} there is only one prescribed way of performing a wide variety of tasks. [...] "While we should not forget that these prescriptive technologies are often exceedingly effective and efficient, they come with an enormous social mortgage. The mortgage means that we live in a culture of compliance, that we are ever more conditioned to accept orthodoxy as normal, and to accept {{that there is only one}} way of doing 'it'." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{sample holder}} {{held up to}} 4 cells. Cells could be moved into the light path via an <b>external</b> <b>control,</b> {{allowing}} the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment. As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a blank, or standard, [...] "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent." [...] The standard could be a cell filled with a solvent such as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration. At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, transmittance, to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to absorbance which {{is proportional to the}} solute concentration according to Beer's law. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.|$|E

In 2012, co-director Chris Mercogliano, who arrived in 1973, continued to receive the same pay as a new teacher. Teachers report high interest in their work and less interest in the low pay. Younger teachers have expressed more of an interest in racial and social justice, and have tried to increase the school's diversity. Within the school community, some have [...] "half-jokingly" [...] expressed a mix of philosophies between the school's [...] "young anarchists and ... old liberals".|$|E

For many authoritarian socialist countries, regimes were a mix of this form of external-control based totalitarianism (for intellectually and ideologically active members of society) and traditional or cultural authoritarianism (for the majority of the population).|$|R
