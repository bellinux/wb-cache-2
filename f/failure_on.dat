30|$|The {{network has}} an {{exponential}} degree distribution {{in terms of}} suppliers’ in-, out-, total degrees {{as well as the}} product distribution among suppliers.

The network, however, will be robust to random failures. As a comparison, the network will be more robust to <b>failures</b> <b>on</b> such hubs than on a scale-free network, but more vulnerable than on a randomly organized network.|$|R
