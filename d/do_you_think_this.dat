500|$|Critic {{and writer}} Kim Newman {{described}} Vampyrs style as {{closer to the}} experimental features such as Un chien andalou than a [...] "quickie horror film" [...] made {{after the release of}} Dracula (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film Vampyr in what he described as a [...] "heavy style" [...] but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him one shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the film through a piece of gauze held threefeet (.9m) away from the camera to re-create this look. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration from the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Gisèle, said that Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings of Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, Henry Hellsen wrote in detail about the film and the artworks it appeared to draw on. When being asked about the intention of the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he [...] "had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all. And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> intention has succeeded? Yes, I have broken new ground". The filming of Vampyr was completed the middle of 1931.|$|E

2500|$|Alstat {{lived in}} a JTS {{dormitory}} for forty-three years, serving as a counselor and mentor for generations of rabbinical students. [...] He would share both his knowledge of Jewish subjects, and the practical techniques he had developed over the years for filing {{bits and pieces of}} information that later helped him with his columns, and could help rabbis with their articles and sermons. He was well known for speaking with rabbinic students upon their return from student pulpit positions during the Jewish High Holy Days, greeting them with the question, [...] "How was your success?" [...] This question would lead to serious discussions about the difference between success during a short visit and a successful rabbinic career that would span years. When rabbinical students were having a hard time putting together a eulogy for a funeral, he would advise them to ask the relatives, [...] "What kind of a report card <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>this</b> person would have received from God?" [...] In his talks and even in the eulogies he delivered, he would teach that the way to [...] "appraise and evaluate the life achievements of a rabbi" [...] come from the Talmudic verse, where it is taught that we will be asked two questions: the second, whether we engaged in studies that were [...] "Jewishly cultural and creative?"; but the very first, whether we dealt with others faithfully—with integrity. In Alstat's own eulogy, he was called [...] "the friend, confidant and adviser to several generations of rabbinical students. Over the years he became the rabbi's rabbi as colleagues sought his counsel and advice." ...|$|E
