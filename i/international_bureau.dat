5|$|In 1930, the Imperial Scout Headquarters {{granted the}} {{complete}} {{independence of the}} Scout Movement in South Africa. Work started on yet another constitution which was finalised in 1936 at Bloemfontein during the visit of Baden-Powell. During 1937, the Boy Scouts Association of South Africa {{became a member of}} the International Scout Conference (now World Scout Conference) and was registered with the <b>International</b> <b>Bureau</b> (now World Scout Bureau) on 1 December 1937. South Africa was the first of the Commonwealth countries to achieve independence for its Scout Movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{melting point}} of gallium, at 302.9146K (29.7646°C, 85.5763°F), is just above room temperature, and is {{approximately}} {{the same as the}} average summer daytime temperatures in Earth's mid-latitudes. This melting point (mp) is one of the formal temperature reference points in the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90) established by the <b>International</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Weights and Measures (BIPM). The triple point of gallium, 302.9166K (29.7666°C, 85.5799°F), is used by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in preference to the melting point.|$|E
5|$|The International Prototype Kilogram was {{commissioned}} by the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) {{under the authority of}} the Metre Convention (1875), and in the custody of the <b>International</b> <b>Bureau</b> of Weights and Measures (BIPM) who hold it on behalf of the CGPM. After the International Prototype Kilogram had been found to vary in mass over time relative to its reproductions, the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) recommended in 2005 that the kilogram be redefined in terms of a fundamental constant of nature. At its 2011 meeting, the CGPM agreed in principle that the kilogram should be redefined in terms of the Planck constant. The decision was originally deferred until 2014; in 2014 it was deferred again until the next meeting. There are currently several different proposals for the redefinition (some of which have been abandoned); these are described in the Proposed Future Definitions section below.|$|E

5|$|This {{position}} was contested by Andrés Nin {{and some other}} members of the League who did not support the call for a new International. This group prioritised regroupment with other communist oppositions, principally the International Communist Opposition (ICO), linked to the Right Opposition in the Soviet Party, a regroupment which eventually {{led to the formation of}} the <b>International</b> <b>Bureau</b> for Revolutionary Socialist Unity. Trotsky considered those organisations to be centrist. Despite Trotsky, the Spanish section merged with the Spanish section of ICO, forming the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM). Trotsky claimed the merger was to be a capitulation to centrism. The Socialist Workers' Party of Germany, a left split from the Social Democratic Party of Germany founded in 1931, co-operated with the International Left Opposition briefly in 1933 but soon abandoned the call for a new International.|$|E
