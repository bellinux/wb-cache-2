The golden sun on the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> is pivot-mounted so that it always faces up. Below the clock face one sees an idealised profile of city founder Duke Berchtold V of Zähringen. While the exact decoration of the clockface has varied from renovation to renovation, the current (post-1983) layout is generally that of 1770.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, clocks {{primarily}} served religious purposes; {{the first}} employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood {{on top of}} the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber). It was {{the first of its kind}} to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an <b>hour</b> <b>hand.</b> The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks. A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George.|$|E
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an <b>hour</b> <b>hand,</b> making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E

Five bells were provided, the largest one weighing 15 hundredweight (approximately 765 kilograms). Each clock face was 2.5 metres in size, the <b>hour</b> <b>hands</b> are 1 metre long, and the minute hands 1.25 metres long.|$|R
25|$|These twelve {{directions}} {{correspond to}} the twelve hours on a clock: The orthogonals {{correspond to the}} odd hours (the direction of the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 o'clock), and the diagonals correspond to the even hours (the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> at 12, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 o'clock). Only the promoted king {{has the power to}} move in all twelve.|$|E
25|$|A {{mechanism}} {{housed in}} the stone pedestal that supports the clock moves its hands. The mechanism is composed of six gears and an electrical meter. Every sixty seconds, the minute hand moves , and the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> moves proportionately. Every hour, an additional control mechanism makes any necessary corrections to the displayed time and is capable of resetting the clock {{in the event of}} a power failure.|$|E

At the same moment, each man stared at his neighbor blankly. All watches were upheld. All hour-hands were at--had passed--the figure 1. No bell-stroke from the tower.

25|$|The {{identity}} of the sailor as George Mendonsa has been challenged by physicists Donald W. Olson and Russell Doescher of Texas State University and Steve Kawaler of Iowa State University based on astronomical conditions recorded by the photographs of the incident. According to Mendonsa's account {{of the events of}} the day, the kiss would have occurred at approximately 2 p.m. However, Olson and Doescher argue that the positions of shadows in the photographs suggest that it was taken after 5 p.m. They further point to a clock seen in the picture, its minute hand near the 10 and its <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> pointing virtually vertically downward, indicating a time of approximately 5:50; and to Victor Jorgensen's account of the circumstances of his own picture; concluding that Mendonsa's version of events is untenable.|$|E

50|$|The {{discipline}} {{imposed by}} these public clocks still remained lax by contemporary standards. A clock that only strikes the hours can only record the nearest hour that has passed; most early clocks had only <b>hour</b> <b>hands</b> in any case. Minute hands {{did not come}} into widespread use until the pendulum enabled a large leap in the accuracy of clocks; for watches, a similar leap in accuracy was not made possible before {{the invention of the}} balance spring. Before these improvements, the equation of time, the difference between apparent and mean solar time, was not even noticed.|$|R

25|$|The Bats wings {{were also}} {{accompanied}} by a clock, which featured a simplified Bats wings design, with the clock face replacing the globe and eyes, and the intrequate lines {{that made up the}} bats wing removed. The noticeable thing about this clock design is the length of the second hand. While the minute and <b>hour</b> <b>hands</b> never went outside the circle at the centre, the second hand went out as far as the bats wings themselves, making the second hand easily twice as long as the minute hand. The clock was occasionally accompanied by the BBC Pips when a programme started on the hour.|$|R
2500|$|In most locations, {{the largest}} {{constituent}} is the [...] "principal lunar semi-diurnal", {{also known as}} the M2 (or M2) tidal constituent. Its period is about 12 hours and 25.2 minutes, exactly half a tidal lunar day, which is the average time separating one lunar zenith from the next, and thus is the time required for the Earth to rotate once relative to the Moon. Simple tide clocks track this constituent. The lunar day is longer than the Earth day because the Moon orbits in the same direction the Earth spins. This is analogous to the minute hand on a watch crossing the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> at 12:00 and then again at about 1:05½ (not at 1:00).|$|E

2500|$|Esher is {{mentioned}} in the Domesday Book, {{but there is no}} mention of a church; the first record of a patron and rector appears in 1292, but little remains of any previous building, except a doorway on the south side of the nave and the priest’s door (now walled in) on the north side of the chancel, both probably 15th century. [...] A rare example of an English church built during the Reformation, the present building was built about 1540 of a jumbled assortment of chequered sandstone, clunch, undressed flint and brick, and roofed with both stone and clay tiles, with a small oaken timber bell- or clock-turret with pyramid spire. [...] Inside, the Tudor open roof remains, with timber tie and collar beams; referring to its vernacular construction, Simon Jenkins says: [...] "[...] [...] St. George's cannot decide whether it is a barn masquerading as a chapel, or a chapel masquerading as a barn." [...] The wooden clock-turret houses the original clock mechanism from the early 17th century, the face and <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> being added in 1783. [...] Various additions made in the 18th and early 19th centuries include the three-decker pulpit and reredos of 1722 with fine carving, the Newcastle Pew (1725-26), and the brick north aisle with crenellated gables (1812).|$|E

2500|$|For {{an ocean}} {{in the shape}} of a {{circular}} basin enclosed by a coastline, the cotidal lines point radially inward and must eventually meet at a common point, the amphidromic point. The amphidromic point is at once cotidal with high and low waters, which is satisfied by zero tidal motion. (The rare exception occurs when the tide encircles an island, as it does around New Zealand, Iceland and Madagascar.) Tidal motion generally lessens moving away from continental coasts, so that crossing the cotidal lines are contours of constant amplitude (half the distance between high and low water) which decrease to zero at the amphidromic point. For a semi-diurnal tide the amphidromic point can be thought of roughly like the center of a clock face, with the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> pointing in the direction of the high water cotidal line, which is directly opposite the low water cotidal line. High water rotates about the amphidromic point once every 12 hours in the direction of rising cotidal lines, and away from ebbing cotidal lines. This rotation is generally clockwise in the southern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere, and is caused by the Coriolis effect. The difference of cotidal phase from the phase of a reference tide is the epoch. The reference tide is the hypothetical constituent [...] "equilibrium tide" [...] on a landless Earth measured at 0° longitude, the Greenwich meridian.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the north}} end of the Palace rises the most famous of the towers, Elizabeth Tower, {{commonly}} known as Big Ben. At 96metres (316ft), it is only slightly shorter than Victoria Tower but much slimmer. Originally known simply as the Clock Tower (the name Elizabeth Tower was conferred on it in 2012 to celebrate the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II), it houses the Great Clock of Westminster, built by Edward John Dent on designs by amateur horologist Edmund Beckett Denison. Striking the hour to within a second of the time, the Great Clock achieved standards of accuracy considered impossible by 19th-century clockmakers, and it has remained consistently reliable since it entered service in 1859. The time is shown on four dials [...] in diameter, which are made of milk glass and are lit from behind at night; the <b>hour</b> <b>hand</b> is [...] long and the minute hand [...] The Clock Tower was designed by Augustus Pugin and built after his death. Charles Barry asked Pugin to design the clock tower because Pugin had previously helped Barry design the Palace. In the 2012 BBC Four documentary, Richard Taylor gives a description of Pugin's Clock Tower: [...] "It rises up from the ground in this stately rhythm, higher and higher, before you reach the clock face, picked out as a giant rose, its petals fringed with gold. Medieval windows above that and then it hits the grey slate roof, its greyness relieved by those delicate little windows again picked out in gold leaf. And then rises up again in a great jet of gold to the higher roof that curves gracefully upwards to a spire with a crown and flowers and a cross. It's elegant and grand and has fairy tale qualities." ...|$|E
