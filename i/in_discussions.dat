The dynamic nature of discussion threads poses interesting and challenging problems for computer scientists.

5|$|Blamey was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> {{with the government}} over {{the size of the}} Army to be maintained. Now that the danger of invasion of Australia had passed, the government reconsidered how the nation's resources, particularly of manpower, should be distributed. Blamey pressed for a commitment to maintain three AIF divisions, as only they could legally be sent north of the equator where the final campaigns would be fought. He urged that the Empire Air Training Scheme be curtailed, and opposed MacArthur's proposal to use the Australian Army primarily for logistic support and leave combat roles principally to American troops.|$|E

5|$|In December 2000, Ben Stiller was <b>in</b> <b>discussions</b> to star as Chuck Barris, with Bryan Singer {{directing}} and Clooney still aboard.

Renaissance Pictures was holding international distribution rights, but the filmmakers still needed more financing {{as well as a}} studio to cover distribution duties in the United States.|$|E

5|$|After Sorkin's {{completion}} of the script in January 2014, development on the project began to heat up when David Fincher entered negotiations to direct the film, with Fincher selecting Christian Bale as his choice for Jobs.
