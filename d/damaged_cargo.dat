I confess I take an enormous pleasure in the fact of the exposure of the sensitive plate of your imagination, your tremendous attention, to all these wonderful and terrible things. What impressions you are getting, verily--and what a breach must it all not make with the course of history you are practising up to the very eve. I rejoice that you finished and snipped off, or tucked in and wound up, something self-contained there--for how could you ever go back to it if you hadn't?--under that violence of rupture with the past which makes me ask myself what will have become of all that material we were taking for granted, and which now lies there behind us like some vast <b>damaged</b> <b>cargo</b> dumped upon a dock and unfit for human purchase or consumption. I seem to fear that I shall find myself seeing your recently concluded novel as through a glass darkly--which, however, will not prevent my immediately falling upon it when it appears; as I assume, however, that it is not now likely to do before the summer's end--by which time God knows what other monstrous chapters of history won't have been perpetrated! What I most want to say to you, I think, is that I rejoice for you with all my heart in that assurance of health which has enabled you so to gird yourself and go forth. If the torrid south has always been good for you there must be no amount of it that you are now not getting--though I am naturally reduced, you see, to quite abjectly helpless and incompetent supposition. I hang about you at any rate with all sorts of vows and benedictions. I feel that I mustn't make remarks about the colossal undertaking you are engaged in beyond saying that I believe with all my heart in the final power of your push.

40|$|Autophagy is an {{intracellular}} trafficking pathway seques-tering cytoplasm {{and delivering}} excess and <b>damaged</b> <b>cargo</b> to the vacuole for degradation. The Atg 1 /ULK 1 kinase {{is an essential}} component of the core autophagy machinery possibly activated by binding to Atg 13 upon starvation. Indeed, we found that Atg 13 directly binds Atg 1, and specific Atg 13 mutations abolishing this interaction inter-fere with Atg 1 function in vivo. Surprisingly, Atg 13 bind-ing to Atg 1 is constitutive and not altered by nutrient conditions or treatment with the Target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC 1) -inhibitor rapamycin. We identify Atg 8 as a novel regulator of Atg 1 /ULK 1, which directly binds Atg 1 /ULK 1 in a LC 3 -interaction region (LIR) -depen-dent manner. Molecular analysis revealed that Atg 13 and Atg 8 cooperate at different steps to regulate Atg 1 function. Atg 8 targets Atg 1 /ULK 1 to autophagosomes, where it may promote autophagosome maturation and/or fusion with vacuoles/lysosomes. Moreover, Atg 8 binding triggers vacuolar degradation of the Atg 1 –Atg 13 complex in yeast, thereby coupling Atg 1 activity to autophagic flux. Together, these findings define a conserved step in auto-phagy regulation in yeast and mammals and expand the known functions of LIR-dependent Atg 8 targets to include spatial regulation of the Atg 1 /ULK 1 kinase...|$|E

40|$|Multivesicular bodies (MVBs) are spherical organelles {{that are}} {{surrounded}} by a single membrane and contain small vesicles in their lumen. They are involved in degradation of cell components as an intermediary of the endosomal pathway. They also recycle cell components {{and are able to}} insert receptors in membranes that are far away from the neural soma. MVBs can fuse to plasma membrane and release exosomes that are essential for cell-to-cell communication. It has recently been described that MVBs store and transport <b>damaged</b> <b>cargo</b> from mitochondria and break it down by fusing with lysosomes. MVBs are also known to accumulate the protein aggregates that are involved in pathological conditions like Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson disease. We used three dimensional electron microscopy with combined focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to reconstruct MVBs in the rodent somatosensory cortex. We obtained ten stacks of serial sections from the neuropil of layer III. Using specifically developed software (Espina), we segmented and three-dimensionally reconstructed 678 MVBs. This revealed differences in their size and content (dark or clear vesicles). Some of them (7 %) contained dark electron-dense laminar material in addition to the usual vesicles. We then classified MVBs based on their location. Our preliminary results indicate that MVBs located in dendrites outnumber those located on axons in approximately a 3 : 1 proportion. We also determined whether MVBs were related to other subcellular organelles, with special attention to mitochondria. We found that 19 % were in contact with mitochondria. These MVBs are probably incorporating the damaged protein cargo contained in mitochondrial-derived vesicles, thereby acting as a defense mechanism that helps maintain normal mitochondrial function. The quantitative method that we have developed here will help determine the possible alterations of the endosomal pathway in pathological conditions...|$|E
40|$|The Convention on Contracts for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea (the “Rotterdam Rules”) is {{the latest}} convention, even though not yet in force, {{governing}} carriage by sea. ”The project is ambitious {{in that it is}} not confined to the familiar territory of the sea carrier’s liability for cargo. ” ”It also covers multimodal carriage involving sea carriage, which raises difficult issues of how the new Convention will interact with existing carriage conventions such as United Nations Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (“CMR”). The convention will come into force one year after the twentieth ratification by a UN member state. Currently only two UN member states have ratified the Rotterdam Rules even though 24 states has signed the convention. However, it is not a far-fetched thought that the Convention would come into force in the coming years thus possibly considerably extending the period of responsibility for the sea carrier from today’s port-to-port approach to the Rotterdam Rules’ door-to-door approach. Despite the Rotterdam Rules’ much broader approach than its predecessors’ the main focus of the Rotterdam Rules is to regulate the carrier’s liability for lost or <b>damaged</b> <b>cargo</b> or goods as it may be named. Even though with a broader approach the new convention builds directly on the previous conventions for carriage of goods by sea: the Hague Rules, the Hague-Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules. This thesis will focus on examining some of the implications of this possibly extended period of responsibility and potential conflicts with other conventions governing, or aiming to govern, other legs of the carriage. More precisely the thesis will examine the possible liability of the sea carrier in relation to secondary failure and evolving, un-localised damage occurring during one or more legs of carriage during a multimodal transport for which the sea carrier might become responsible even though the goods is not in the sea carrier’s custody under the Rotterdam Rules. The main goal of the thesis is to present and high light possible conflicts along the way in the text...|$|E
40|$|Deviation {{occurring}} {{in the course of}} a maritime voyage and its effect on the carrier's liability is a controversial issue whether under the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules or under the COGSA of the United Kingdom and the United States. The thesis is divided into six chapters. Chapter one is aimed at defining the concept of `lq deviation and clarifying the classification of `lq deviation. Any attempt to classify the terminology of deviation into reasonable and unreasonable is considered an essential factor in deciding whether the deviation {{occurring in}} the course of the maritime voyage is a deviatory breach of contractual obligations or not. Chapter two is divided into two sections. The first one is devoted to explaining the main principles of the carrier's liability concerning the seaworthiness and the proper care of the goods by loading, handling, and stowing the goods carried. I also discussed the degree of the seriousness of the carrier's fault or his servant or agent and the effect of serious fault on the doctrine of deviation which might displace the carriage contract when such deviation occurs deliberately. Whereas, the immunities of the carrier, whether under the International Convention, i. e. The Hague/Visby Rules and The Hamburg Rules or, in the national laws and the immunities which are based on a contractual basis, are the subject of section two. I have however reached the conclusion, in this chapter, that the carrier's liability, under the Hague/Visby Rules and the Hamburg Rules, is based on the principles of presumed fault or neglect. On the other hand, I have adopted the risk approach as the best theory for introducing an explanation for holding a deviating carrier liable providing that the deviation is wrongful and increasing the risk of loss beyond that permitted by the contract and endeavours to prevent the carrier from creating unauthorized risks. Chapter three deals with the effect of deviation on the contract of carriage and its characteristics as a serious breach of the contractual obligations. I have therefore divided the chapter into two sections. Section one is concerned with the characterization of the breach of contract of carriage by explaining the distinction between the conditions and warranties under the general principles of the contract law, and the breach of fundamental term or the fundamental breach, while section two is devoted to explaining the effect of unreasonable deviation on the obligations of the contracting parties. I have however tried in this chapter to find a legal characterization for unreasonable deviation. I believe that such a serious breach is considered a breach of the substantive rules and therefore the doctrine of deviation has still the same effects on the contractual obligations as it had under the pre-Hague Rules regime. I also endeavoured to base such a breach in the carriage contract on the test of reasonableness which determines whether or not a breach of contract is fundamental or material. Thus, any exaggeration in the drastic effect of an unreasonable deviation should be isolated from the carrier's duties to provide a seaworthy ship and to load, stow, and discharge the cargo properly and carefully. The innocent party has merely a right to compensation for such loss of or damage to the cargo. Recovery of losses and damages resulting from an unreasonable deviation is the subject of chapter four. This chapter is divided into three sections which deal with the compensatory nature of losses and damages and whether the innocent party is entitled to recover the physical and the economic loss by establishing the causal relationship between the unreasonable deviation and the loss of or damage to the cargo which could be shown by adopting two doctrines, i. e. remoteness and mitigation of damage, which have tried to limit the damages. The court is however entitled to have a special method to estimate such loss of or damage to the cargo. Unless the nature and the value of the goods have been declared by the shipper before shipment and inserted in the bill of lading, the cargo-owner is entitled to recovery for full damages caused to the cargo which may exceed the statutory limitation. Chapter five is concerned with the procedures of action for lost or <b>damaged</b> <b>cargo.</b> This chapter is divided into four sections. These sections are concentrated on the principles of notice of loss, damage and delay in delivery, time limitation for suit, jurisdiction clauses, and the burden of proof under the International Conventions and COGSA. These four points are, however, classified into formal and substantive conditions. The first three conditions are formal conditions which the court must enquire as a matter of form that these conditions have been instituted before hearing the case. The last condition is a substantive condition when the court must show who bears the burden of proof at a particular point in the litigation. Finally chapter six is devoted to describing and analyzing the main principles of the Iraqi and Egyptian legal systems concerning the liability of the carrier. Iraq and Egypt have broadened their horizons by adopting the principles of the International Conventions, i. e. Egypt ratified the Hague Rules since May 29 th 1944, whereas, the Iraqi Draftsman embodied the principles of the Hamburg Rules in the Iraqi Transport Law in 1983. That indicates that both apply the international rules in order to establish a joint understanding for the principles of carriage of goods by sea and to obtain some benefit of the precedents and experience of the United Kingdom and the United States in the field of maritime law...|$|E
