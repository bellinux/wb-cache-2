When caught the fishermen are usually charged with trespassing in Philippine territories.|$|R

This time, they were joined by more than 200 Kickapoos, a people who had often allied with the Sauks. Black Hawk and his followers became known as the [...] "British Band" [...] because they sometimes <b>flew</b> <b>a</b> British <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> defy claims of U.S. sovereignty, and because they hoped to gain the support of the British at Fort Malden in Canada.|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} the Coast Guard {{standard}} are very obscure. One theory states {{that it might have}} evolved from an early jack http://www.uscg.mil/history/Coast_Guard_Flags.html. There is at least one contemporary painting supporting this theory. In an 1840 painting, the Revenue cutter Alexander Hamilton <b>flies</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> very similar <b>to</b> that of today’s Coast Guard as <b>a</b> jack. This <b>flag,</b> like the union jack, appears to be the canton or upper corner of the Revenue cutter ensign.|$|R
25|$|The Buddhists {{pushed for}} a five-point agreement: freedom <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> {{religious}} <b>flags,</b> <b>an</b> end <b>to</b> arbitrary arrests, compensation for the Huế victims, punishment for the officials responsible and religious equality. Diệm then banned demonstrations, and ordered his forces to arrest those who engaged in civil disobedience. On 3 June 1963, protesters attempted to march towards the Từ Đàm pagoda. Six waves of ARVN tear gas and attack dogs failed to disperse the crowds, and finally brownish-red liquid chemicals were doused on praying protesters, resulting in 67 being hospitalised for chemical injuries. A curfew was subsequently enacted.|$|R

This time, they were joined by more than 200 Kickapoos, a people who had often allied with the Sauks. Black Hawk and his followers became known as the [...] "British Band" [...] because they sometimes <b>flew</b> <b>a</b> British <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> defy claims of U.S. sovereignty, and because they hoped to gain the support of the British at Fort Malden in Canada.When the British Band once again returned to Saukenuk in 1831, Black Hawk's following had grown to about 1,500 people, and now included some Potawatomis, a people with close ties to the Sauks and Meskwakis. American officials determined to force the British Band out of the state. General Edmund P. Gaines, commander of the Western Department of the United States Army, assembled troops with the hope of intimidating Black Hawk into leaving. The army had no cavalry to pursue the Sauks should they flee further into Illinois on horseback, and so on June 5 Gaines requested that the state militia provide a mounted battalion. Illinois governor John Reynolds had already alerted the militia; about 1,500 volunteers turned out. Meanwhile, Keokuk convinced many of Black Hawk's followers to leave Illinois.|$|R
5000|$|Popular myth {{has it that}} John Quelch <b>flew</b> <b>a</b> pirate <b>flag</b> {{referred}} <b>to</b> as Old Roger by his crew. It {{is sometimes}} {{considered to be the}} origin of the name Jolly Roger. It is alleged that his theme was later borrowed by Blackbeard and also Bartholomew [...] "Black Bart" [...] Roberts. There is no evidence whatsoever that Quelch flew any flag other than the Flag of St. George or possibly <b>a</b> privateer's <b>flag</b> of St. George quartered on a red background similar to today's British merchant colors. Courtroom testimony from the crew maintained that the flag of England had been flown at all times. The origin of this myth of Quelch's flag being described as having [...] "in the middle of it an Anatomy with an Hourglass {{in one hand and a}} dart in the Heart with three drops of Blood proceeding from it in the other." [...] most likely stems from the poetic license of Ralph D. Paine, a popular writer at the turn of the 20th century. None of the principals involved in the affair, not even the Governor or the prosecution, ever mentioned such colors being employed by Quelch.|$|R
500|$|The {{exhibits}} featured some of Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești's own drawings, {{which he}} intended to use as illustrations for his book of French-language poems, Sensations internes ("Internal Sensations"). He planned for his art movement to reach outside Romania, and, also in 1896, financed an international exhibition of independent and avant-garde artists. Salonul was known for its public protest against academic art: located just outside the Romanian Athenaeum building (a main venue for local Neoclassicism), it put up Petrescu Găină's huge caricature of academic artist C. I. Stăncescu, and <b>flew</b> <b>a</b> red <b>flag</b> next <b>to</b> it. This call to socialist rebellion attracted public attention, and the flag was urgently taken down by agents of the Romanian Police. The subsequent exhibitions were viewed with sympathy by {{a section of the}} press, including the leftist newspaper Adevărul. It republished pieces ridiculing Stăncescu in his role of official curator, and made favorable comments on all of the Salonul Independenților artists. Noting the leader's own anarchist past, Adevărul art columnist Gal wrote: [...] "Bogdan has all the qualities and flaws of a sincere French revolutionary, but one who is not entirely clear and scientific. He has an extraordinary love for all things independent and hates to the point of excess all sectarian people, and all schools." [...] In June 1896, the group of [...] "secessionists" [...] was commissioned to decorate Bragadiru Garden, where Romania's press held its annual fair. The show, attended by Bogdan-Pitești, prominently featured Stăncescu's caricature at the entrance.|$|R
50|$|Brooks B. Harding (1896-1959), an American, {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of United States President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill in December 1941 by presenting {{each with a}} Victory V symbol embossed in leather with the slogan Absolute Victory by delivery at the White House {{at a time when}} Churchill was in the United States for the Arcadia Conference to sign the Declaration by United Nations. Churchill's recognition to Harding noted a need for a symbol of the wartime Allies. In October 1942, Harding traveled to Washington, DC with six cloth designs. In his meeting at the United States Department of State, he learned that since there was no United Nations committee to present his designs to, he would have to obtain approvals from all 29 signatory nations individually. Upon meeting with Dr. Vladimir Palic, First Secretary of the Czechoslovakian Embassy, a single specific design involving four bars was determined to be the appropriate candidate to put forth. All 29 nations subsequently agreed to the four vertical bar design. However, the flag was determined not to be used as an official emblem of the organization, but rather a symbol of the people and governments. It was flown at Dumbarton Oaks in June 1943 in the presence of United Nations military attaches from all United Nations embassies in full uniform. The Honor flag was also flown throughout Washington at private buildings in August 1943 during the Atlantic Charter week, where it also <b>flew</b> as <b>a</b> secondary <b>flag</b> <b>to</b> national emblems throughout the war. It gradually flew at more and more government offices and was distributed to various of the United Nations, and it was officially adopted in several countries starting with New Zealand. By a motion in the United States Senate, the flag was flown in thousands of towns to celebrate V-E Day. At the United Nations Conference on International Organization, where there was a golden motif, the red bars were substituted with gold, while some nations preferred green and blue bars.|$|R

5000|$|In the Royal Navy, {{there is}} a {{distinction}} between [...] "flag officer" [...] and [...] "officer of flag rank". Formerly all officers promoted <b>to</b> <b>flag</b> rank {{were considered to be}} [...] "flag officers" [...] and the term is still widely used to refer to any officer of flag rank. Present usage is that all rear-admirals and above are officers of flag rank, but only those officers of flag rank who are authorised <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> are formally called [...] "flag officers", and have different flags for different ranks of admiral. Of the 39 officers of flag rank in the Royal Navy in 2006, very few were [...] "flag officers" [...] with entitlement <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag.</b> For example, Commander-in-Chief Fleet <b>flies</b> <b>an</b> admiral's <b>flag</b> whether ashore or afloat and is a [...] "flag officer"; the chief of staff (support), a rear admiral, is not entitled <b>to</b> <b>fly</b> <b>a</b> <b>flag</b> and is <b>an</b> [...] "officer of flag rank" [...] rather than a [...] "flag officer".
