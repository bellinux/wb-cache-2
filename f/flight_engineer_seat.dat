25|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> licence {{allows the}} holder {{to be an}} {{aeroplane}} <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b> Generally, this will be on a large transport aircraft. Being a pilot is not a prerequisite to earning a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> licence, though many <b>flight</b> <b>engineers</b> do hold a commercial pilot licenceaeroplane or airline transport pilot licence.|$|R
25|$|Some airliners are {{flown by}} a third crew member in {{addition}} to the pilot and co-pilot, a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b> The <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> is responsible for monitoring aircraft systems in flight and for inspecting the aircraft before and after each flight. The Boeing 747-300 is an example of an airliner that employs a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b> Recent airliners from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus are designed for a two pilot crew with flight management functions previously the responsibility of a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> now handled by automation. Many older airliners flying require a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Nobumasa Yokokawa- 31 year-old Nobumasa Yokokawa {{was hired}} by Japan Airlines on April 1, 1960. On November 20, 1960 he {{received}} his <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> DC-8 type rating. Yokokawa was also certified to serve as <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> on Convair-880 and Boeing 747 aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Certifications are {{applicable}} to large transportation aircraft (more than 80,000 lb). <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Certificates are further Rated {{by type of}} engine they are trained and tested on: Turbojet Powered, Turbopropeller Powered, Reciprocating Engine Powered. <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineers</b> are becoming less common as modern jets move towards two person flight crews.|$|R
50|$|In November 1950, aged 20, Barnes {{transferred}} {{with the}} 4th Troop Carrier Squadron to Ashiya, Japan, {{in support of}} the Korean War. Shortly after arrival in Japan, he completed on-the-job training for <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> duties. Then, due to low unit manning, he performed both <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> and hydraulic specialist duties. In September 1951 he transferred to Tachikawa, Japan, and continued <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> duties.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Hiroshi Fukuda (Fukuda Hiroshi) from Kyoto, the 46-year-old veteran <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> of the <b>flight</b> who had {{approximately}} 9,800 total flight hours, {{of which}} roughly 3,850 were accrued flying 747s.|$|R
40|$|Footage of the STS- 111 Endeavour {{landing at}} Edwards Air Force base in California is shown. Shots {{of the mission}} control room, the shuttle's {{re-entry}} into Earth's atmosphere and the landing strip at Edwards Air Force base are seen. The STS- 111 flight crew (Pilot Paul Lockhart; Mission Specialist Franklin Chang-Diaz; Mission Specialist Phillippe Perrin) delivered the Expedition Five crew (ISS Commander Valery Kozun; <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Peggy Whitson; <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Sergei Treschev) to the International Space Station and returned the Expedition Four crew (ISS Commander Yury Onufrienko; <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Daniel Bursch; <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Carl Walz) to Earth...|$|R
5000|$|The flight's {{first officer}} and <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> were named Arthur Dovey and Gordon Brooks, not Russ Mann and Warren Banks. The second {{qualified}} navigator is the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> {{instead of one}} of the passengers.|$|R
50|$|Nineteenth Air Force also {{provided}} enlisted aircrew {{training for a}} wide variety of aircrew specialties including <b>flight</b> <b>engineers,</b> air-to-air refueling boom operators, loadmasters, aerial gunners, airborne communications specialists and weapons directors. <b>Flight</b> <b>engineers</b> and boom operators train at Altus AFB, loadmasters train at Sheppard AFB, helicopter <b>flight</b> <b>engineers</b> and aerial gunners train at Kirtland AFB, airborne communications specialists train at Keesler AFB, and weapons directors train at Tyndall AFB.|$|R
50|$|In earlier days, most larger {{aircraft}} {{were designed}} and built with a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer's</b> position. For U.S. civilian aircraft that require a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> {{as part of the}} crew, the FE must possess an FAA <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Certificate with reciprocating, turboprop, or turbojet ratings appropriate to the aircraft. Whereas the four-engine Douglas DC-4 did not require an FE, the FAA type certificates of subsequent four-engine reciprocating engine airplanes (DC-6, DC-7, Constellation, Boeing 307 and 377) and early three- and four-engine jets (Boeing 707, 727, early 747, DC-10) required <b>flight</b> <b>engineers.</b> Later three- and four-engine jets (MD-11, B-747-400 and later) were designed with sufficient automation to eliminate the position.|$|R
500|$|Second, {{the person}} who was {{actually}} sitting in the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer's</b> position was a trainee, a [...] "student flight engineer", under supervision of the official <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> assigned to the flight, who was sitting next to him.|$|R
50|$|Oleg Dmitriyevich Kononenko (Олег Дмитриевич Кононенко) is a Russian cosmonaut. He {{has flown}} to the International Space Station three times, as a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> for Expedition 17 aboard Soyuz TMA-12, as a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> on Expedition 30 and {{commander}} of Expedition 31 aboard Soyuz TMA-03M, {{and as a}} <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> on Expedition 44 and Expedition 45 aboard Soyuz TMA-17M. Kononenko has accumulated over 533 days in orbit during three long duration flights to ISS.|$|R

25|$|The {{remaining}} {{flight crew}} consisted of First Officer Gregory Slader, age 48, and <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Randal Thomas, age 46, and 15 flight attendants. The first officer and <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> had logged 14,500 flight hours and 20,000 flight hours, respectively.|$|R
50|$|Kaleri took a {{training}} course for a spaceflight aboard the Mir orbital station {{as a backup}} crew <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Mir-3 mission from 1 April to 9 December 1987. He took {{a training}} course for a spaceflight aboard the Mir as a backup crew <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> of the Mir-9 mission from January to April 1991. From 8 October 1991 to 25 February 1992, Kaleri was training as a primary crew <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> for the Mir-11 mission.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> (FE), a {{position}} originally called an 'Air Mechanic'. On older aircraft, typically between the late-1920s and the 1970s, the <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> was the crew member responsible for engines, systems and fuel management. As aircraft became increasingly sophisticated and automated, this function has been mostly assumed by the primary pilots (Captain and FO), {{resulting in a}} continued downsizing {{in the number of}} aircrew positions on commercial <b>flights.</b> The <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer's</b> position is commonly staffed as a Second Officer. <b>Flight</b> <b>engineers</b> can still be found in the present day (in greatly diminished numbers), used on airline or air freight operations still flying such older aircraft. The position is typically crewed by a dual-licensed Pilot-Flight Engineer in the present day.|$|R
50|$|On 22 June 1942, a {{separate}} Air Gunner's and <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer's</b> badge (Fliegerschützenabzeichen für Bordschützen und Bordmechaniker) was introduced. It was awarded after an air gunner, mechanic (<b>flight</b> <b>engineer)</b> or aircrew meteorologist completed the same criteria which {{was required for}} this badge.|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{flight crew}} consisted of First Officer Gregory Slader, age 48, and <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Randal Thomas, age 46, {{and a total}} of 15 flight attendants.

50|$|The <b>Flight</b> <b>Engineer</b> Badge was a {{qualification}} {{badge of}} the United States Army Air Forces authorized {{late in the}} Second World War on 19 June 1945. It was awarded to those military officers and NCOs who had qualified as <b>flight</b> <b>engineers</b> on board a military aircraft. As aircraft grew increasingly complex, the need arose for an in-flight specialist dedicated to monitoring and operating the various systems. However, prior {{to the creation of}} their own distinctive wings, <b>flight</b> <b>engineers</b> wore aircrew wings.|$|R
50|$|In a {{twist of}} fate, Ryszard Chmielewski, the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer,</b> was {{scheduled}} to fly to Warsaw on that day; because he suffered from jet lag and insufficient rest after the previous flight, he switched shifts {{with one of his}} colleagues and flew out of New York one day later. Seven years later, as a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> and instructor, monitoring the progress of <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> Wojciech Kłossek, he was on board LOT Flight 5055, which crashed killing all 183 people on board.|$|R
25|$|There is no blanket {{aircraft}} type rating {{associated with the}} <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> licence. The licence must be endorsed with an individual type rating for each aeroplane type. When issued the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> rating for the aeroplane type used by a person for training is issued.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{investigators}} found, the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> entered a DC-8 first officer upgrade training in June 1979; however, the instructors found his abilities less than adequate {{and the training}} was terminated two months later. The <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> resumed his first officer training in February 1980, this time for the Boeing 737; while improving, his abilities were still inadequate—as his instructor stated, [...] "...his attitude could not be better {{and he is a}} very hard worker, however, he has not made normal progress in his first full year as a first officer." [...] After several failed en-route and proficiency checks, the training manager and the <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> made an agreement not to bid anymore for pilot vacancies and remain a <b>flight</b> <b>engineer</b> for the balance of his career.|$|R
