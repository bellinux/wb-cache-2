Walter {{maintains}} the ship while the colonists are in cryosleep, {{when there is an}} unexpected neutrino flare from a nearby star, which damages the ship, forcing him to awaken the crew. After Christopher Oram orders the ship to divert from Origae-6 for the closer and more habitable Engineer home world, Walter joins the expedition force that lands on the planet. In the ensuing Alien outbreak, he is attacked by a Neomorph, which bites off his hand. He joins the survivors in taking refuge at David's base, where he becomes acquainted with David and their differences in programming are revealed <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Walter surmises that David killed Shaw and when he confronts him about this fact and refuses David's offer to join him, David impales him with a flute, seemingly destroying him. Walter temporarily recovers and engages David in a melee – David emerges victorious and assumes Walter's identity.|$|E

25|$|When V. crabro sexual {{behaviors}} were first studied, the colony {{seemed to be}} under pheromone control by the queen because none of the workers reproduced. However, new evidence has shown that though each of the workers has the machinery to reproduce, they only do so after weighing {{the costs and benefits}} of laying eggs versus the queen laying eggs. In a colony with a queen, the workers are more related to the queen’s larvae than their own. Contrary to previous assumptions, the workers were actually enforcing sterility <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> Worker policing is the behavior exhibited to prevent other workers within the colony from producing males. This can be completed by either physically destroying worker-laid eggs or by discriminating against those workers that wish to reproduce.|$|E
500|$|The {{two ships}} had <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another</b> {{about as close}} a match in size and force as was possible, given the {{variations}} in ship design and armament existing between contemporary navies. [...] USS Chesapeakes (rated at 38 guns) armament of 28 18-pounder long guns was an exact match for HMS Shannon. Measurements proved the ships {{to be about the}} same deck length, the only major difference being the ships' complements: Chesapeakes 379 against the Shannons 330.|$|E

[...] Expanding on the love triangle that forms between Wilkes, Sousa, and Carter, Austin said, [...] "we’re very nice to each other. We’re professional. I think that Sousa likes Wilkes enough and it’s the same the other way".|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} less positive reviews as well. Rahul Gairola of PopMatters wrote that while [...] "the pilot lays the usual groundwork by showing how the characters' lives are intertwined, it also demonstrates immediately the sitcom's major drawback, that the stereotypical gay character is the stand-out comic figure." [...] A reviewer for the Los Angeles Times said [...] "there's something {{not quite right}} about this show's approach to homosexuality... It {{has everything to do}} with Will's attitude. It approaches asexual, his gayness appearing to exist solely as a device to give him the moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic." [...] Suite101.com's Hana Lewis thought it was [...] "regrettable" [...] that the pilot's jokes revolved [...] "solely around gay stereotypes and sexual innuendo". Some reviewers were also skeptical about the future of the show. [...] One such review said, [...] "If Will & Grace can somehow survive a brutal time period opposite football and Ally McBeal, it could grow into a reasonably entertaining little [...] — that is, a series about a man and a woman who have no sexual interest <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> But don't bet on it. If it's a doomed relationships viewers want, they'll probably opt for Ally." ...|$|E
500|$|George O'Malley is {{introduced}} {{as a fellow}} surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); the five of them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). O'Malley and Stevens move in with Meredith, for whom he has romantic feelings but did not express them due to his fear of rejection {{and the fact that}} she and one of the attendings Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) had a mutual interest <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname [...] "007" [...] because of almost killing a patient in such a simple operation (referring to James Bond's [...] "licence to kill"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator with a patient who begins to bleed out.

When Meredith tells him that sleeping together was a mistake, O'Malley begins avoiding her and starts dating orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Bethune was {{inducted}} into the National Women's Hall of Fame. On July 10, 1974, the anniversary of her 99th birthday, the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial, by artist Robert Berks, was erected in her honor in Lincoln Park (Washington, D.C.) It was the first monument honoring an African American or a woman to be installed in a public park in the District of Columbia. At least 18,000 people attended the unveiling ceremony (although one estimate claims that approximately 250,000 people attended) including Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress. The funds for the monument were raised by the National Council of Negro Women. [...] The inscription on the pedestal reads [...] "let her works praise her," [...] while the side is engraved with a passage from her [...] "Last Will and Testament":I leave you love. I leave you hope. I leave you the challenge of developing confidence <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> I leave you a thirst for education. I leave you a respect for the use of power. I leave you faith. I leave you racial dignity. I leave you a desire to live harmoniously with your fellow men. I leave you a responsibility to our young people.In 1985 the US Postal Service issued a stamp in Bethune's honor. [...] In 1989 Ebony Magazine listed her as one of [...] "50 Most Important Figures in Black US History."

500|$|The {{season began}} in Australia. Jenson Button took an early lead from pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton and the Red Bull cars {{while the rest}} of the field was bottle-necked by contact in the first corner. Button {{remained}} unchallenged throughout, even after a mid-race safety car to retrieve the stricken Caterham of Vitaly Petrov. Button went on to take his third victory at the Melbourne circuit, ahead of Sebastian Vettel, who profited from the safety car to pass Hamilton. McLaren team principal Martin Whitmarsh later admitted that Button was [...] "more than marginal" [...] on fuel after the team made a mistake in calculating their fuel loads for the race, forcing Button to use a [...] "severe fuel-saving mode" [...] from the eighth lap of the race. Hamilton came under threat from Mark Webber in the late stages of the race, but held on to secure third place. Webber finished fourth – his best result in his home Grand Prix – while Fernando Alonso finished fifth, having endured pressure from Pastor Maldonado for the last half of the race. Maldonado's race ended when he crossed onto the astroturf on the final lap and spun into the wall. Kimi Räikkönen finished seventh after a poor qualifying session saw him start the race seventeenth, taking advantage of a chaotic final lap to make up two places, while Felipe Massa and Bruno Senna both retired after a bizarre collision that saw their cars tangled up <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>another.</b> HRT failed to qualify for the race for the second consecutive season after drivers Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan failed to set a lap time within 107% of the fastest qualifying time.|$|E
