5|$|Kepler-8 {{was named}} {{the way it was}} because it is home to the eighth {{planetary}} system confirmed {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA-directed program tasked with searching a region of the sky for terrestrial planets that transit, or cross in front of (and thereby, for a while, make dimmer) the stars that they orbit with respect to Earth. The planet <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements. Kepler-8b's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., alongside planets <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, and Kepler-7.|$|E

5|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{inherent in}} the IAU's definition was highlighted in December 2005, when the Spitzer Space Telescope observed Cha 110913-773444 (above), only eight times Jupiter's mass with {{what appears to be}} the beginnings of its own planetary system.

5|$|In 2001 an {{extrasolar planet}} similar {{in size to}} Jupiter {{designated}} HD 28185 b was discovered <b>in</b> <b>orbit</b> <b>around</b> the star with a period of 1.04 years. Unlike many long-period extrasolar planets, it has a low orbital eccentricity. The planet experiences similar insolation to Earth, {{which has led to}} speculations about the possibilities for habitable moons. In addition, numerical simulations suggest that low-mass planets located in the gas giant's Trojan points would be stable for long periods. The planet's existence was independently confirmed by the Magellan Planet Search Program in 2008.|$|E
