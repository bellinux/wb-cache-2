25|$|Frying French fries in beef tallow, lard, {{or other}} animal fats adds {{saturated}} fat to the diet. Replacing animal fats with tropical vegetable oils, such as palm oil, simply substitutes one saturated fat for another. Replacing animal fats with partially <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>oil</b> reduces cholesterol but adds trans fat, {{which has been}} shown to both raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. Canola/Rapeseed oil, or sunflower-seed oil are also used, as are mixes of vegetable oils, but beef tallow is generally more popular, especially amongst fast food outlets that use communal oil baths. Accordingly, many restaurants now advertise their use of unsaturated oils; for example, both Five Guys and Chick-fil-A advertise that their fries are prepared with peanut oil.|$|E

2500|$|Hydrogenated {{vegetable}} oils differ in two major ways from other oils which are equally saturated. During hydrogenation, {{it is easier}} for hydrogen to come into contact with the fatty acids {{on the end of the}} triglyceride, and less easy for them to come into contact with the center fatty acid. This makes the resulting fat more brittle than a tropical oil; soy margarines are less [...] "spreadable" [...] The other difference is that trans fatty acids (often called trans fat) are formed in the hydrogenation reactor, and may amount to as much as 40 percent by weight of a partially <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>oil.</b> Hydrogenated oils, especially partially hydrogenated oils with their higher amounts of trans fatty acids are increasingly thought to be unhealthy.|$|E

25|$|Partially <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>oils</b> {{have been}} used in food for many reasons. Hydrogenation {{increases}} product shelf life and decreases refrigeration requirements. Many baked foods require semi-solid fats to suspend solids at room temperature; partially <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>oils</b> have the right consistency to replace animal fats such as butter and lard at lower cost. They are also an inexpensive alternative to other semi-solid oils such as palm oil.|$|R

2500|$|The use of <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>oils</b> {{in foods}} {{has never been}} {{completely}} satisfactory. Because the center arm of the triglyceride is shielded somewhat by the end fatty acids, most of the hydrogenation occurs on the end fatty acids, thus making the resulting fat more brittle. A margarine made from naturally more saturated oils will be more plastic (more [...] "spreadable") than a margarine made from <b>hydrogenated</b> soy <b>oil.</b> While full hydrogenation produces largely saturated fatty acids, partial hydrogenation results in the transformation of unsaturated cis fatty acids to unsaturated trans fatty acids in the oil mixture due to the heat used in hydrogenation.

40|$|<b>Hydrogenated</b> <b>oils</b> {{tend to have}} {{a higher}} trans fatty acid (TFA) content than oils that do not contain {{hydrogenated}} fats. Prospective epidemiological and case-control studies support a major role of TFAs in the risk of cardiovascular disease. In the partially <b>hydrogenated</b> soybean <b>oil,</b> which is the major source of TFAs worldwide, the main isomer is trans- 10 C 18 : 1. In the European countries with the highest TFA intake (the Netherlands and Norway), consumption of partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fish <b>oils</b> was common until the mid- 1990 s, after which they were omitted from the dietary fat intake. These partially <b>hydrogenated</b> fish <b>oils</b> included a variety of very long-chain TFAs. Recent findings from Asian countries (India and Iran) have indicated a very high intake of TFAs from partially <b>hydrogenated</b> soybean <b>oil</b> (4 % of energy). Thus TFAs appear to be a particular problem in developing countries, where soybean oil is used. In 2003, the United States Food and Drug Administration issued a final ruling that required food manufacturers to list the TFAs in their foods on the nutritional facts label. One way to produce 'zero' levels of TFAs is the trans-esterification reaction between vegetable oils and solid fatty acids, like C 8 : 0, C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0 and C 16 : 0...|$|R
