5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the tank the artillery was no longer required to aid the infantry by destroying obstacles and machine gun positions. Instead, the artillery assisted by neutralising the German artillery with Counter battery fire. British Army researchers under Lieutenant William Lawrence Bragg developed sound ranging, a method of determining the location of hostile artillery <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> its guns firing. A Counter Battery Staff Officer (CBSO) was appointed at each corps to co-ordinate the counter battery effort, collating reports from sound ranging and Royal Flying Corps observers. By the end of the war, it was realised that the important effect of the barrage was to demoralise and suppress the enemy, rather than physical destruction; a short, intense bombardment immediately followed by an infantry assault was more effective than the weeks of grinding bombardment used in 1916.|$|E

5|$|When it was re-released in 1947, {{it earned}} an {{impressive}} $5 million rental in the United States and Canada, {{and was one}} of the top ten releases of the year. Successful re-releases in 1954 and 1961 enabled it to retain its position as the industry's top earner, despite strong challenges from more recent films such as Ben-Hur, but it was finally overtaken by The Sound of Music in 1966. The 1967 reissue was unusual in that MGM opted to roadshow it, a decision that turned it into the most successful re-release in the history of the industry. It generated a box-office gross of $68 million, making it MGM's most lucrative picture after Doctor Zhivago from the latter half of the decade. MGM earned a rental of $41 million from the release, with the U.S. and Canadian share amounting to over $30 million, placing it second only to The Graduate for that year. Including its $6.7 million rental from the 1961 reissue, it was the fourth highest-earner of the decade in the North American market, with only The Sound of Music, The Graduate and Doctor Zhivago making more for their distributors. A further re-release in 1971 allowed it to briefly recapture the record <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Music, bringing its total worldwide gross rental to about $116 million by the end of 1971—more than trebling its earnings from its initial release—before losing the record again the following year to The Godfather.|$|E

Bartlett's brigade to reinforce Sheridan. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been wrecked by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan.|$|E
25|$|Strings were {{historically}} made {{of animal}} gut, usually {{from the small}} intestine of sheep (sometimes in combination with metal) and are still made of gut or a synthetic substitute, with metal windings on the lower-pitched strings. Modern manufacturers make both gut and nylon strings, and both are in common use. Gut is more authentic for playing period pieces, though unfortunately it is also more susceptible to irregularity and pitch instability due to changes in humidity. Nylon offers greater tuning stability, but is seen as anachronistic by purists, as its timbre differs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> earlier gut strings. Such concerns are moot when more recent compositions for the lute are performed.|$|E
25|$|In 1963, Kelly joined Universal Pictures for {{a two-year}} stint. He joined 20th Century Fox in 1965 but {{had little to}} do—partly due to his {{decision}} to decline assignments away from Los Angeles for family reasons. His perseverance finally paid off, with the major box-office hit A Guide for the Married Man (1967) where he directed Walter Matthau. Then, a major opportunity arose when Fox – buoyed by the returns <b>from</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> Music (1965) – commissioned Kelly to direct Hello, Dolly! (1969), again directing Matthau along with Barbra Streisand. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and won three.|$|E

25|$|In {{the ancient}} Andean civilizations such as Inca Empire, slings {{were made from}} llama wool. These slings {{typically}} have a cradle that is long and thin and features a relatively long slit. Andean slings were constructed from contrasting colours of wool; complex braids and fine workmanship can result in beautiful patterns. Ceremonial slings were also made; these were large, non-functional and generally lacked a slit. To this day, ceremonial slings are used {{in parts of the}} Andes as accessories in dances and in mock battles. They are also used by llama herders; the animals will move away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a stone landing. The stones are not slung to hit the animals, but to persuade them to move in the desired direction.|$|E

General Grant officially transferred Warren's Corps to Sheridan's command at 6:00a.m. After Pickett's withdrawal, Sheridan planned to attack the Confederates at Five Forks as soon as possible.|$|E
