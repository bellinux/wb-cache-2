Also in May is the Lilac Festival which honors the military, celebrates youth, and showcases the region. Spokane's nickname, the [...] "Lilac City", refers to a <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> that has flourished since its introduction to {{the area in the}} early 20th century. In June the city hosts Spokane Hoopfest, a 3-on-3 basketball tournament, among the largest of its kind. One of Spokane's most popular local events is Pig Out in the Park, an annual six-day food and entertainment festival where attendees may eat a variety of foods and listen to free live music concerts featuring local, regional, and national recording artists in Riverfront Park.|$|E
60|$|Behind a great <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> Hanson lay {{gazing at}} the stars and waiting. He had lain thus and there many nights before. For what was he waiting, or for whom? He heard the girl approaching, and half raised himself to his elbow. A dozen paces away, the reins looped over a fence post, stood his pony.|$|E

As he bent above them he was probably some hundred yards from his plane and it was at this instant that Numabo, chief of the Wamabo, chose to leap from his ambush and lead his warriors in a sudden rush upon the white man.|$|E
6000|$|Thus ended--as Earth's best {{men have}} too often ended--the good Don Alonzo Chacon. His only {{monument}} {{in the island}} is one, after all, 'aere perennius;' namely, that most beautiful <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> which bears his name; Warsewiczia, some call it; others, Calycophyllum: [...] but the botanists of the island continue loyally the name of Chaconia to those blazing crimson spikes which every Christmas-tide renew throughout the wild forests, of which {{he would have made}} a civilised garden, the memory of the last and best of the Spanish Governors.|$|E
60|$|Some half-mile or so away, to {{the left}} of the town, where the sea had encroached a little upon the shore of the island, there was a nook of {{peculiar}} loveliness. Here the giant hand of Nature had cleft a ravine in the mountains that make Madeira, down which a crystal streamlet trickled to the patch of yellow sand that edged the sea. Its banks sloped like a natural terrace, and were clothed with masses of maidenhair ferns interwoven with feathery grasses, whilst up above among the rocks grew aloes and every sort of <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub.</b>|$|E

60|$|Eve {{thought she}} had never beheld a more wild or beautifully {{variegated}} foliage, than that which the whole leafy mountainside presented. More {{than half of the}} forest of tall, solemn pines, that had veiled the earth when the country was first settled, had already disappeared; but, agreeably to one of the mysterious laws by which nature is governed, a rich second growth, that included nearly every variety of American wood, had shot up in their places. The rich Rembrandt-like hemlocks, in particular, were perfectly beautiful, contrasting admirably with the livelier tints of the various deciduous trees. Here and there, some <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> rendered the picture gay, while masses of the rich chestnut, in blossom, lay in clouds of natural glory among the dark tops of the pines.|$|E
60|$|Hurrying out to {{see what}} was the matter, I was met by a ludicrous sight. The little Frenchman was running up the {{courtyard}} at an extraordinary speed, and after him sped Umslopogaas like a great greyhound. Just as I came out he caught him, and, lifting him right off his legs, carried him some paces to a beautiful but very dense <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> which bore a flower not unlike the gardenia, but was covered with short thorns. Next, despite his howls and struggles, he with one mighty thrust plunged poor Alphonse head first into the bush, so that nothing but the calves of his legs and heels remained in evidence. Then, satisfied with what he had done, the Zulu folded his arms and stood grimly contemplating the Frenchman's kicks, and listening to his yells, which were awful.|$|E
60|$|Soon the primroses {{are strong}} on the ground. There is {{a bank of}} small, frail crocuses {{shooting}} the lavender into this spring. And then the tussocks and tussocks of primroses are fully out, there is full morning everywhere on the banks and roadsides and stream-sides, and around the olive roots, a morning of primroses underfoot, with an invisible threading of many violets, and then the lovely blue clusters of hepatica, really like pieces of blue sky showing through a clarity of primrose. The few birds are piping thinly and shyly, the streams sing again, there is a strange <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> full of incense, overturned flowers of crimson and gold, like Bohemian glass. Between the olive roots new grass is coming, day is leaping all clear and coloured from the earth, it is full Spring, full first rapture.|$|E

6000|$|By the Hawaiian tongue, {{the slope}} of these steep islands is parcelled out in zones. As we mount from the seaboard, we pass by the region of Ilima, named for a <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub,</b> and the region of Apaa, named for a wind, to Mau, the place of mist. This has a {{secondary}} name, the Au- or Wao-Kanaka, [...] "the place of men" [...] by exclusion, man not dwelling higher. The next, accordingly, is called the Waoakua, region of gods and goblins; other names, some apparently involving thoughts of solitude and danger, follow till the top is reached. The mountain itself might be a god or the seat of a god; {{it might be a}} volcano, the home of the dread Pele; and into desert places few would venture but such as were adroit to snare the whispering spirits of the dead. To-day, from the Waoakua or the Waomaukele, the gods have perhaps fled; the descendants of Vancouver's cattle fill them with less questionable terrors.|$|E
6000|$|I {{never saw}} the Crab-Apple till May, 1861. I had heard of it through Michaux, but more modern botanists, so far as I know, have not treated it as of any {{peculiar}} importance. Thus it was a half-fabulous tree to me. I contemplated a pilgrimage to the [...] "Glades," [...] a portion of Pennsylvania where it was said to grow to perfection. I thought of sending to a nursery for it, but doubted if they had it, or would distinguish it from European varieties. At last I had occasion to go to Minnesota, and on entering Michigan I began to notice from the cars a tree with handsome rose-colored flowers. At first I thought it some variety of thorn; {{but it was not}} long before the truth flashed on me, that this was my long-sought Crab-Apple. It was the prevailing <b>flowering</b> <b>shrub</b> or tree to be seen from the cars at that season of the year,--about the middle of May. But the cars never stopped before one, and so I was launched on the bosom of the Mississippi without having touched one, experiencing the fate of Tantalus. On arriving at St. Anthony's Falls, I was sorry to be told that I was too far north for the Crab-Apple. Nevertheless I succeeded in finding it about eight miles west of the Falls; touched it and smelled it, and secured a lingering corymb of flowers for my herbarium. This must have been near its northern limit.|$|E
