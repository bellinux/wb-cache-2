50|$|The Torx design {{allows for}} a higher torque to be exerted than a {{similarly}} sized conventional hex socket head without damaging the head and/or the tool. The diagram on the right depicts {{the interaction between the}} male and female components of a conventional <b>hex</b> <b>drive</b> and a Torx drive. The clearance between the components is exaggerated for clarity. The diagram does not show a true Torx profile, but illustrates the general shape and geometry.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to attach the socket or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a hog ring which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger impact wrenches, typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. Pin retainers used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a positive lock. ¼" [...] female <b>hex</b> <b>drive</b> is becoming increasingly popular for small impact wrenches, especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|E
50|$|According to one source, New Britain Machine {{was founded}} in New Britain, Connecticut in 1887. However, {{according}} to Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J. Dodd Research Center, it {{was founded in}} 1895 subsequent to the J.T. Case Engine Company, a manufacturer of steam engines. The first product the new company produced was a chainsaw mortising machine. In 1917, it registered the None Better trademark to sell its line of sockets and tools. Much of New Britain Machine's early tool production was done under the None Better line. Many of the early tools were carbon steel, offering a lower cost alternative to the higher price alloy steels of the day. Early tool sets consisted of <b>hex</b> <b>drive</b> sockets and an ell bar for the drive tool. Beginning in the 1930s, the None Better line consisted {{of a wide variety of}} 1/2 square drive tools with a Cadmium finish. At this time, New Britain Machine was also supplying tools for Sears in their Craftsman line of tools. These tools are easy to distinguish as they either have a BE or an H in a circle stamped into the tools. The New Britain Machine line was also created at this time as a higher priced alloy steel alternative.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909-1910, William G. Allen {{patented}} {{a method}} of cold-forming screw heads around a hexagonal die (...) [...] Published advertisements for the [...] "Allen safety set screw" [...] by the Allen Manufacturing Company of Hartford, Connecticut, exist from 1910. Although {{it is unlikely that}} Allen {{was the first person to}} think of a <b>hex</b> socket <b>drive,</b> his patent for a manufacturing method and his realized product appear to be the first.|$|R
5000|$|Headless {{set screws}} {{have been around}} for a long time, with the {{straight}} slot being the oldest drive type (due to its ease of machining), but the demand for headless set screws experienced a marked increase in the first and second decades of the 20th century, when a penchant for better industrial safety, a campaign with the slogan [...] "safety first", swept the industrialized nations of North America and Europe as a part of the larger Progressive Movement. This surge in safety consciousness was a backlash against the often-atrocious industrial safety standards of the era. H.T. Hallowell, Sr., a U.S. industrialist whose corporation was one of several that pioneered the commercialization of the <b>hex</b> socket <b>drive,</b> noted in his memoir that line shafting, which was [...] in the industrial practice of the time, often had headed set screws (with external-wrenching square drive) holding the many pulleys to the line shafts, and collars holding the shafts from axial movement. Gear trains of exposed gears were also common at the time, and those, too, often used headed set screws, holding the gears to the shafts. His company's chief products at the time were shaft hangers and shaft collars of pressed-steel construction. The [...] "safety craze" [...] created a burgeoning demand for headless set screws on pulleys, gears, and collars to replace the headed ones, so that workers' clothing and fingers were less likely to catch on the exposed rotating screw head. It was this heightened demand that prompted Hallowell's firm to get into the screw-making business and to explore socket-head drive designs. With P.L. Robertson holding fresh patent rights on a practical-to-make square-socket drive, the firm soon pursued the <b>hex</b> socket <b>drive.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In his autobiography, {{the founder}} of the Standard Pressed Steel Company (SPS; now SPS Technologies, Inc.), Howard T. Hallowell Sr, {{presents}} a version of events in which SPS developed a <b>hex</b> socket <b>drive</b> in-house, independently of Allen, circa 1911. From this came the [...] line of products. This account from Hallowell does not mention the Allen patent of 1910, nor the Allen safety set screw product line. Hallowell does describe, however, the same inspiration also mentioned in connection with Allen for a wave of adoption of the hex socket head, beginning with set screws and followed by cap screws. This was an industrial safety campaign, part of the larger Progressive Movement, to get headless set screws onto the pulleys and shafts of the line shafting that was ubiquitous in factories of the day. The headless set screws {{would be less likely to}} catch the clothing of workers and pull them into injurious contact with the running shaft.|$|R
5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a <b>hex</b> socket screw <b>drive</b> was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|R
50|$|Throughout the 19th century, {{the most}} {{commonly}} used forms of screw head (that is, drive types) were simple internal-wrenching straight slots and external-wrenching squares and hexagons. These were easy to machine and served most applications adequately. Rybczynski describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s through 1890s, but explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. In 1908, Canadian P. L. Robertson was the first to make the internal-wrenching square socket drive a practical reality by developing just the right design (slight taper angles and overall proportions) to allow the head to be stamped easily but successfully, with the metal cold forming as desired rather than being sheared or displaced in unwanted ways. Practical manufacture of the internal-wrenching hexagon <b>drive</b> (<b>hex</b> socket) shortly followed in 1911.|$|R
5000|$|Tamiya has marketed several {{updated version}} of the Blackfoot. The Super Blackfoot {{was based on the}} same basic space frame chassis, with the most {{important}} improvements being a better gearbox and double wishbone rear suspension with dogbone driveshafts instead of the original's vulnerable and quickly wearing ORV-type gearbox, trailing arm suspension and <b>hex</b> type <b>drive</b> shafts and sockets. The body was basically {{the same as that of}} the Blackfoot, but with a different grill design and new decals. Later, the Super Blackfoot was replaced by the King Blackfoot, this time with an improved front suspension with longer suspension arms. The styrene body for the King Blackfoot was still clearly derived from a Ford design, but no longer identified as being a Ford by Tamiya and a totally new development. Tamiya currently (2005) markets a completely updated model called the [...] "Blackfoot Xtreme." [...] The [...] "Xtreme" [...] has a totally different chassis design than previous versions, but retains the body of the King Blackfoot, just mildly modified with a hood scoop, a modernized grill and new decals. The BX is the final incarnation of the Blackfoot name. The [...] "Xtreme" [...] can even be modified for 4WD with the addition of a front gearbox and a second motor. As a matter of fact, Tamiya markets the 4WD [...] "Wild Dagger", 4WD [...] "Twin Detonator", and the 4WD [...] "Double Blaze" [...] all based on the same basic chassis as the [...] "Xtreme".|$|R
