40|$|AbstractGraphics design {{education}} should aim {{to prepare the}} student for the existing graphics and advertising market. It is assumed that it does. However, <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> today is fairly wide, flexible and experimental. Such experimentalism may carry <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> far beyond conventional two-dimensional design. Combining three-dimensional design with computer games, website interface requirements and the discipline of animation, new products can be created. This study deals with the developing <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> world, <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> education and different levels of <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> requirements within the sector. Differences between the education in {{the university and the}} requirements within the sector will be analyzed...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been {{increasing}} interest {{in the design of}} user interfaces that take advantage of graphics when presenting information. Since it is impossible to anticipate the needs and requirements of each potential user in an infinite number of presentation situations, it is more reasonable to automatically <b>design</b> <b>graphics</b> on the fly in a context-sensitive way. In this paper, we present components for <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> and <b>graphics</b> realization as parts of the multimodal presentation system WIP. After a short overview of WIP, we introduce our basic assumptions about how to describe surface aspects and the meaning of complex graphics. We then describe the graphics realization component and sketch the <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> process. By means of a generation example we show <b>graphics</b> <b>design</b> is interleaved with graphics realization...|$|R

5|$|The Madchester {{scene of}} the 1980s, from which groups {{including}} New Order, The Smiths, The Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, 808 State, James and The Charlatans emerged, was based on clubs such as the world-famous The Haçienda. The period {{was the subject of}} the film 24 Hour Party People. Many of the big clubs suffered problems with organised crime at that time; Haslam describes one where staff were so completely intimidated that free admission and drinks were demanded (and given) and drugs were openly dealt. Following a series of drug-related violent incidents, The Hacienda closed in 1998. In 1988, Manchester was often referred to as Madchester for its rave scene. Owned by Tony Wilson's Factory Records, it was given the catalogue number FAC51 and official club name, FAC51 The Hacienda. Known for developing many talented 1980s influential acts, it also influenced the <b>graphic</b> <b>design</b> industry via Factory artists such as Peter Saville (PSA), Octavo (8vo), Central Design Station, etc. The memorabilia from this club holds a high value among collectors and fans of these artists and the club. Peter Saville was most notable for his minimalistic influence that still affects contemporary <b>graphic</b> <b>design</b> everywhere.|$|E
