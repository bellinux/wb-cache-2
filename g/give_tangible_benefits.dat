It involved 34 second-year students, divided into 12 small working groups. The {{data were collected}} by means of group interviews carried out in English after all groups finished writing an argumentative essay using the collaborative process writing method. In their responses, students maintained that they still experienced some writing difficulties in English in connection with planning, organization, cohesion and coherence and grammar. However, by combining collaborative process writing with the reflective exercises and classroom reporting strategies introduced by their instructor, students were enabled to spot persistent writing difficulties and plan {{a course of action}} to tackle them. <b>Given</b> the <b>tangible</b> learner-focused <b>benefits</b> that are likely to accrue from the implementation of the method, the study suggests that more practice be initiated by the instructors so that students become aware of those benefits...|$|R

40|$|We {{started out}} with a focus on how {{companies}} act when considering the environment in business, but the research took us further than that and led us to the root of our research focus. We are discussing aspects pertaining to the relation of society – and business life, and how human beings perceive the connection to nature. Our initial thought was to study business and how companies handle the environmental context, but the social context appeared to us as well with its strong connection to the environment. The master thesis is written with a respect for the environment and with an aspiration to give a sense of the larger context wherein nature and human itself exist. The environment is a complex issue for companies to handle. The benefits of improving the environmental performance are not always clear, which induces companies with insecurity as to what strategic action should be taken. The development of environmental performance over the years has resulted in certain environmental deeds, which have become institutionalized in different industries. What is considered to be ethically acceptable is not easily established, but it is a term companies are facing more often, especially when companies take actions that give them higher influence on society. Every company can claim to be environmentally friendly, at the same time, consumers are skeptical towards these claims, which complicates sincere attempts of environmental improvements. A company’s reality is constructed by people, and the company has to adjust to the demands people have outside and inside the organization. It is people’s perception of the environment that will state the demands of a company. We have studied three companies and how they handle their environmental performance that is determined by the business context, and the perception the interviewees have thereof. In the environmental area of sustainability, ISO-certification is an industry norm that is created, sustainable forestry is another, but we have realized that the environmental area is not balanced. The norms and expectations of society conflict with business and environmental considerations. That is why some companies are hesitant in initiating environmental action, because environmental initiatives cost, as any investment does, and might not <b>give</b> back <b>tangible</b> <b>benefits...</b>|$|R

In our field experiment, Vietnamese students performed significantly better on an English test when they were told their rankings than when they were not.

40|$|A large {{network of}} {{spatially}} contiguous, yet anatomically distinct regions in medial frontal cortex {{is involved in}} reward processing. Although it is clear these regions {{play a role in}} critical aspects of reward-related learning and decision-making, the individual contributions of each component remains unclear. We explored dissociations in reward processing throughout several key regions in the reward system and aimed to clarify the nature of previously observed outcome-related activity in a portion of anterior medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). Specifically, we tested whether activity in anterior mOFC was related to processing successful actions, such that this region would respond similarly to rewards with and without <b>tangible</b> <b>benefits,</b> or whether this region instead encoded only quantifiable outcome values (e. g., money). Participants performed a task where they encountered monetary gains and losses (and non-gains and non-losses) during fMRI scanning. Critically, in addition to the outcomes with monetary consequences, the task included trials that provided outcomes without <b>tangible</b> <b>benefits</b> (participants were simply told that they were correct or incorrect). We found that anterior mOFC responded to all successful outcomes regardless of whether they carried <b>tangible</b> <b>benefits</b> (monetary gains and non-losses) or not (controls). These results support the hypothesis that anterior mOFC processes rewards in terms of a common currency and is capable of providing reward-based signals for everything we value, whether it be primary o...|$|R
