5|$|Some rulers {{handled this}} {{arrangement}} with less subtlety than others. Domitian {{was not so}} subtle. From the outset of his reign, he stressed the reality of his autocracy. He disliked aristocrats and had no fear of showing it, withdrawing every <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> from the Senate, and instead relying on a small set of friends and equestrians to control the important offices of state.|$|E
50|$|Under the autocratic {{leadership}} style, all <b>decision-making</b> <b>powers</b> are centralized in the leader, as with dictators.|$|R

50|$|Reporting {{directly}} to the council, the executive committee exercises <b>decision-making</b> <b>powers</b> {{similar to those of}} the cabinet in a parliamentary system and is responsible for preparing various documents including budgets and by-laws, submitted to the council for approval. The <b>decision-making</b> <b>powers</b> of the executive committee cover, in particular, the awarding of contracts or grants, the management of human and financial resources, supplies and buildings. It may also be assigned further powers by the city council.|$|R
5|$|The Central Committee {{was not a}} {{permanent}} institution. It convened plenary sessions. Seven CC plenary sessions and two plenary sessions held {{in conjunction with the}} convening of the Central Control Commission were held between the 16th Congress and the 17th Congress. When the CC was not in session, <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> was vested in the internal bodies of the CC itself; that is, the Politburo, Secretariat and Orgburo. None of these bodies were permanent either; typically they convened several times a month.|$|E
5|$|During Mao's rule (1949–1976), Chinese {{women were}} needed for their manual labor for farming and for urban industrialization. To {{compensate}} for their hard work, they were provided {{access to education}} and politics. The Chinese government supported women's education. The percentage of girls attending school was 96.2% compared to below 20% before the People's Republic (1949). The Chinese government has tried to decrease {{the number of women}} illiterates while promoting adult and vocational schools. The percentage number of illiterates has gone down from 90% in 1949 and 32% from 1993. In the first 30 years of Communist rule women's discrimination was decreasing, but they did not have jobs that had real <b>decision-making</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Subject matter. First, the {{justiciability}} of {{an issue}} depends on the subject matter at hand and not the source of <b>decision-making</b> <b>power.</b> This was the principle stated in GCHQ and reiterated in Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Where the executive has the best access to available materials, its views should be decisive or at least highly persuasive. It was acknowledged in Singapore Airlines {{that there may be}} matters of fact not in the public domain which may be known only to the executive. Where sensitive facts are concerned, Singapore's adversarial system is undesirable as parties must adduce evidence at a trial. Furthermore, not all pertinent facts might be presented before the court.|$|E

25|$|The Supreme Court of Canada, {{the federal}} courts, the various appellate courts from the provinces and territories, and the {{numerous}} low-level provincial courts are statutory courts whose <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> is granted {{by either the}} federal parliament or a provincial legislature.|$|E
25|$|Justiciability depends not on {{the source}} of the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power,</b> but on the {{subject-matter}} that is in question. Where it is the executive that has access to the best materials available to resolve the issue, its views should be regarded as highly persuasive, if not decisive.|$|E

40|$|Our paper {{proposes a}} {{comparative}} {{analysis of the}} degree of administrative and financial decentralization inthe European countries. Decoupling local government from a centralized system to a decentralized one involved withtheir investment <b>decision-making</b> <b>powers</b> backed by important financial resources. Increased local government capacityand accountability meant the effective and efficient management and administration of local public funds. However,most times their own financial resources proved insufficient leading to completion of the budget amounts. Our researchshows that, although legally the local authorities were entrusted with <b>decision-making</b> <b>powers</b> in managing local publicfunds, lack of financial resources makes their dependence on central authority are still extremely strong...|$|R
25|$|A liberal {{democracy}} is a representative democracy in which {{the ability of the}} elected representatives to exercise <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> is subject to the rule of law, and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals, and which places constraints on the leaders and {{on the extent to which}} the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities (see civil liberties).|$|E
25|$|Little {{economic}} <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> was {{concentrated in}} the cities. The small urban upper middle class was composed of professionals and branch managers of national banks and corporations or heads of small local manufacturing or trading organizations. The banks were mostly branch offices with headquarters far to the east; the leading stores were branches of national chains, especially Eaton's, Simpson's, the Hudson's Bay Company. To the farmer and urbanite alike, the names symbolize the world of eastern business that controls their fate, and became the target of political fears.|$|E
25|$|Two {{weeks after}} the National Summit, an {{agreement}} was reached in Havana on political participation, wherein both parties formally recognized the important role that women play in conflict-prevention, conflict-resolution, and peacebuilding. Subsequently, President Santos appointed two women with greater <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> {{on behalf of the}} Colombian Government at the talks. In August 2014, delegations of survivors of the conflict addressed negotiating parties, 60% of whom were women. This may be the first time that women negotiating {{on both sides of the}} table met with women affected by conflict. Representatives of women's organizations and the LGBTI community also addressed negotiators as gender experts.|$|E

50|$|Active {{labour market}} {{policies}} are important. Instead, trade unions have smaller <b>decision-making</b> <b>powers</b> {{than in the previous}} models, {{this is one of the}} reasons explaining their higher income dispersion and their higher number of low-wage employments.|$|R
25|$|The {{administration}} initially {{denied the}} union recognition. While the university discouraged {{the formation of}} labor unions, arguing that “it can do more ‘for’ the employee than a union,” Local 77 denounced this idea as “deepening the basic problem,” suggesting that “Employees {{need to have a}} voice in their own future; and that voice can only come through collective bargaining...Only then may employees negotiate and sign a contract as mutual, equal participants rather than dependents of a paternal employer with unilateral <b>decision-making</b> <b>power.</b> Only then will the psychology of dependence be overcome.” The black work force had little power in the grievance procedures.|$|E
25|$|Concerns were {{expressed}} over {{the lack of}} checks on the Minister's power to issue a prohibiting or restraining order. It was suggested that the Minister's decision {{should be subject to}} judicial review or an appeal process since a decision made by a single minister could be fairly subjective, and if the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> lay solely within the Minister's purview this might may fail to convince the public that any decision made was just and fair. Another suggestion raised in Parliament was to widen the purely advisory powers of the PCMR and grant it a more substantial power to act as a check and balance to the powers of the Minister.|$|E
25|$|Francione {{has also}} criticized PETA for having caused {{grassroots}} animal rights groups to close, groups that he argues were {{essential for the}} survival of the animal rights movement, which rejects the centrality of corporate animal charities. Francione writes that PETA initially set up independent chapters around the United States, but closed them in favor of a top-down, centralized organization, which not only consolidated <b>decision-making</b> <b>power,</b> but centralized donations too. Now, local animal rights donations go to PETA, rather than to a local group. Some members of the animal-rights movement have responded that Francione's position with respect to groups engaged in actual fieldwork is unnecessarily divisive and hurts animal advocacy.|$|E

25|$|In general, {{men have}} most of the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> in Ghanaian society. In labor and delivery, husbands and heads of the {{households}} also make most of the decisions {{in collaboration with the}} birth attendant, and sometimes a soothsayer. During labor, the husband will usually make the decision about where to deliver because a woman in labor is considered unable to think clearly due to the pain, although the head of the household will have the final say. In some cases, women, especially those who can afford to go to a hospital, will make their own decision about where to give birth without waiting for the approval of their husband or household heads.|$|E
25|$|It {{was created}} by Jimmy Wales on December 4, 2003, as an {{extension}} of the <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> he formerly held as owner of the site. The committee acts as a court of last resort (described in the media variously as 'quasi-judicial' or a Wikipedian 'High/Supreme Court', though the Committee makes it clear that it is not, nor pretends to be, a court of law in the formal sense) for disputes among editors. It has decided several hundred cases in its history. Members of the Committee are appointed by Wales either in person or email following advisory elections; Wales generally chooses to appoint arbitrators who were among those who received the most votes.|$|E
25|$|The Ministry of Education, {{with its}} {{expanded}} administrative scope and power, {{was responsible for}} formulating guiding principles for education, establishing regulations, planning the progress of educational projects, coordinating the educational programs of different departments, and standardization educational reforms. Simplification of administration and delegation of authority were made the bases for improving the education system. This devolution of management to the autonomous regions, provinces, and special municipalities meant local governments had more <b>decision-making</b> <b>power</b> {{and were able to}} develop basic education. State-owned enterprises, mass organizations, and individuals were encouraged to pool funds to accomplish education reform. Local authorities used state appropriations and a percentage of local reserve financial resources (basically township financial revenues) to finance educational projects. Distance education is promoted not only within the educational sector but among basic service sectors such as agriculture and health.|$|E
