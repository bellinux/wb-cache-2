25|$|The Sunderland {{restaurant}} firm, Tavistock, purchased The Grotto {{in a poor}} condition. The premises {{were totally}} refurbished and The Grotto opened as a high class seafood restaurant and bar. Following its purchase of the Roker Hotel in Sunderland, Tavistock was made an offer it could not refuse and The Grotto was sold to London Inns & Restaurants in 2003. The Grotto later passed to Oxford Hotels and Inns Management Ltd.. In September 2007, South Tyneside Council, who are responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> adjacent to the pub, closed them off due to a damaged step, pending repair. Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service ordered the pub be temporally {{closed to the public}} until the stairs reopen as they are the only means of safe evacuation from the pub, especially at high tide. The Grotto reopened on 21 March 2008.|$|E
2500|$|Inside, {{the house}} was divided into two {{principal}} rooms per floor, with a central hallway <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> [...] Few original fittings survive; the mantels and wainscoting were removed, as were some floorboards from the second floor. [...] Part of the first-level floor had fallen in. [...] Portions of the stairway survived, as did the north-exterior door. [...] The walls were once plastered, {{but much of the}} covering has disintegrated over time.|$|E
60|$|But the Doctor did not answer. He {{had already}} turned away, and was making <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
50|$|Being {{the tallest}} {{building}} in Adelaide, it {{was chosen as}} <b>the</b> venue <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> race events at the 2007 World Police and Fire Games.|$|R
50|$|Advance Steel {{provides}} {{instruments for}} modeling complex {{structures such as}} straight and spiral stairs, railings, ladders, etc. The program creates all necessary documents (including NC files) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> fabrication.|$|R
50|$|The {{focal point}} of the {{interior}} is the magnificent solid granite <b>stair</b> at <b>the</b> center of the first floor. It is constructed so that each step locks into the next without obvious perpendicular support. A massive granite octagonal column at the basement level provides the necessary structural support <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> <b>The</b> <b>stair's</b> distinctive cast-iron railing consists of balusters displaying the same closed tobacco leaf motif seen on the exterior and newel posts replicating the massive granite columns on the primary exterior elevation. A semi-circular rotunda encases the stairwell and original wood panel doors follow the curvature of the surrounding walls.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle Lange," [...] said Armand boldly, as without {{hesitation}} he walked quickly past the lodge making straight <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{passages}} wound like a maze, and he threaded them blindly in a vain search <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> If {{he could}} get down and open the hall door---- ...|$|E
60|$|The tough person {{released}} Pugsy, and, having eyed Smith keenly for a moment, made a dash <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> {{leaving the}} guardian of the gate rubbing his ear resentfully.|$|E
60|$|Christian groped <b>for</b> <b>the</b> bottom <b>stair,</b> and Greta {{felt her}} arm shaking.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 the LCC {{approved}} a design <b>for</b> <b>the</b> King's <b>Stairs</b> riverside walk, which was opened in November 1962. In January 1963 the LCC approved <b>the</b> name King's <b>Stairs</b> Gardens.|$|R
6000|$|Her falt'ring hand {{upon the}} balustrade, [...] 190 [...] Old Angela was feeling <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> [...] When Madeline, St. Agnes' charmed maid, [...] Rose, like a mission'd spirit, unaware: [...] With silver taper's light, and pious care, [...] She turn'd, {{and down the}} aged gossip led [...] To a safe level matting. Now prepare, [...] Young Porphyro, for gazing on that bed; [...] She comes, she comes again, like ring-dove fray'd and fled.|$|R
60|$|As {{they started}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> Jethro and Cynthia leading the way, Wetherell felt a touch on his elbow {{and turned to}} confront Mr. Bijah Bixby--at very close range, as usual.|$|E
60|$|They started <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> (there was no elevator, {{as in all}} better-class hotels), {{and were}} soon comfortably seated in Andrew Dilks' room, an {{apartment}} on the third floor, in the rear.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us go to {{the deck}} an' see what's doing," [...] {{returned}} Luke, and both started <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> But scarcely had they appeared on the deck when they were ordered below again.|$|E
50|$|The {{top floor}} of the {{building}} has a similar plan to that of the second floor, with halls running parallel to Quay Street from <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> foyer, and then parallel to Fitzroy Street at the ends of the buildings. From the halls access is provided to the many bedrooms. This floor is less ornate than the first floor and the timber boarded ceilings are slightly lower. The rooms facing Quay Street have access to the second floor verandah through half glazed French doors. The verandah awning is ceiled with fibrous cement sheeting. Except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> area there are no overhead archways and very simple cornices and skirtings on this floor.|$|R
50|$|In the Roman Catholic Church, a plenary indulgence {{has been}} conceded <b>for</b> {{climbing}} <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> on <b>the</b> knees. Pope Pius VII on 2 September 1817 granted those who ascend <b>the</b> <b>Stairs</b> in <b>the</b> prescribed manner an indulgence of nine years for every step. Finally, Pope St. Pius X, on 26 February 1908, conceded a plenary indulgence {{as often as}} <b>the</b> <b>Stairs</b> are devoutly ascended after Confession and Holy Communion.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} the captives themselves were suffering, as {{may well be}} believed, agonies of suspense. Their loophole did not look out towards the gateway, but they heard the peals of the trumpet, started up with joy, and thought their deliverance was come. Eleanor threw herself on her knees; Lady Lindsay began to collect their properties; Jean made a rush <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> leading to <b>the</b> top of the turret, but she found her way barred {{by one of the}} few men-at-arms, who held his pike towards her in a menacing manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, sir." [...] Webster withdrew like a {{plenipotentiary}} who {{has been}} handed his papers on the declaration of war, and Mr. Bennett, sprang to intercept Mr. Mortimer, who had slipped by and was making <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was a {{back door}} to close, {{and one of the}} negroes started for this. But just as he got close to the door he saw the bear coming, and, uttering a wild yell, he too made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|Up this we backed, Victory {{just behind}} me, {{as the first}} of the {{remaining}} lions leaped from the throne room and sprang <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Again I fired, but others of the ferocious beasts leaped over their fallen fellows and pursued us.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> wooden <b>stairs</b> {{provide access}} up the cliff to Amesbury Street and St Mary's Anglican Church {{which has been}} <b>the</b> Naval Chapel <b>for</b> many years. <b>The</b> <b>stairs</b> have been {{extended}} over the years.|$|R
2500|$|... "Dangerous Passes": This {{theme is}} used {{whenever}} the Ringbearer traverses dangerous and mountainous passes. It scores the Caradhras scenes, but returns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> secrets <b>stairs</b> in Return of the King, albeit being muted in the film.|$|R
6000|$|But seeming may {{be false}} or true. It is false in this case; <b>for,</b> <b>the</b> moment <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> have ceased to creak under his tread, she glides after him, muttering emphatically: ‘I’ll not miss ye twice!’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you behave yourself," [...] growled the {{guardian}} of the peace, and Dick was glad enough {{to get away with}} this reprimand. He saw Cuffer running <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and made after him as rapidly as the density of the crowd permitted.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if this isn't the queerest yet," [...] he murmured, and pinched himself, to {{make certain}} that he was not dreaming. He walked to one end of the saloon and then to the other, and then started <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading out on deck.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{three is}} the price"--and I started <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{without waiting for}} any further argument, for Clinton had said {{that that was the}} amount that the Lord would provide, {{and it seemed to me}} that it would be sacrilegious to take a penny more than was promised.|$|E
50|$|Work on {{the tower}} was {{immediately}} begun after {{the construction of}} the temporary quarters. The dwellings and accessory buildings were also made with reinforced concrete. A contract had been let in Hong Kong <b>for</b> <b>the</b> iron <b>stairs,</b> which were delivered in August 1905.|$|R
5000|$|Pohl was {{probably}} born in Vienna, {{and he probably}} created sculptures of children's <b>for</b> <b>the</b> side <b>stairs</b> to <b>the</b> side wings of the [...] "Julius-Tandler-Familienzentrum" [...] in Vienna (around or before 1925). He {{was probably}} {{a member of the}} [...] "Wiener Werkstatte".|$|R
50|$|Baby walkers {{have also}} led to many {{preventable}} injuries. These include injuries from falling down stairs while moving around in the baby walker, often with injuries that are worse than typical <b>for</b> falling down <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
6000|$|She hit {{his head}} a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let on to be whimpering as we struck <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Up in his room he hugged me, he was so {{out of his head}} for gladness because he was going traveling. And he says: ...|$|E
60|$|She gave {{a sort of}} hiccup and, darting forward, {{kissed me}} on the forehead. Unpleasant, of course, but, as Anatole would say, I can take a few smooths with a rough. The next moment she was legging it for the dining-room, while I, having bunged the bicycle into a bush, made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
60|$|And {{he began}} to walk. Mr. Van Wyk, jumping up, saw the full meaning of the rigid head, the hesitating feet, the vaguely {{extended}} hand. His heart was beating fast; he moved a chair aside, and instinctively advanced as if to offer his arm. But Captain Whalley passed him by, making <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> quite straight.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so {{startled by}} the {{discovery}} that I ran out with the nightgown in my hand, and made <b>for</b> <b>the</b> back <b>stairs,</b> and locked myself into my own room, {{to look at it}} in a place where nobody could intrude and interrupt me.|$|R
