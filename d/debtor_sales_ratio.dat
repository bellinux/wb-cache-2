As a result, {{we found that the}} lower cost to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio</b> projects had the higher relative effort ratio in external design phase, which indicates that spending less effort in external design can cause decrease of profit. We also found that high outsourcing ratio projects had higher cost to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio,</b> and that projects having moderate code reuse ratio had lower and disperse cost to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio,</b> which suggests troubles in code reuse can damage the profit of a project.

The high cash flow to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio</b> in 2002 had been unexpected, given the sluggish growth prospects. A survey among major firms conducted by the Federation of Austrian Industrialists confirms the figures for 2002. For 2003, companies have reported a slight fall. International comparative data are available only for the years up to 2001.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{economic}} growth and services have a positive association. In particular, the more developed an economy is, the higher the share of the services sector. While most research has focused on service output, this study also examines services as input. Recently, the need for taking services a separate input in the production function has come to the fore. Therefore, the OECD productivity manual generalizes the KLEM model to KLEMS (capital-labor-energy-materials-services) model by including the services as an input. We use KLEMS data in this study. In addition, we augmented the standard production function with other variables such as the inventory to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio,</b> R&D to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio,</b> education expenditure to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio,</b> and the debt to <b>sales</b> <b>ratio.</b> The findings are encouraging and lead us to formulate some important conclusions; for example, after the 1998 Financial Crisis, the Korean economy has increased in efficiency and this is partly due to an increased importance of services as both output and input.
