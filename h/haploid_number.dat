25|$|In Genetics and the Origin of Species, {{polyploidy}} {{is considered}} {{as a type of}} mutation. Polyploid cells have a chromosome number that is more than twice the <b>haploid</b> <b>number.</b> The effects of polyploidy between two different species causes hybridization and even greater evolution.|$|E
25|$|Some {{animal and}} plant species are {{polyploid}} : They have more than two sets of homologous chromosomes. Plants important in agriculture such as tobacco or wheat are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> of seven chromosomes, still seen in some cultivars {{as well as the}} wild progenitors. The more-common pasta and bread wheat types are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.|$|E

25|$|A healthy egg and/or {{sperm cell}} {{contains}} individual chromosomes, {{each of which}} contributes to the 23 pairs of chromosomes needed to form a normal cell with a typical human karyotype of 46 chromosomes. Numerical errors can arise at {{either of the two}} meiotic divisions and cause the failure of a chromosome to segregate into the daughter cells (nondisjunction). This results in an extra chromosome, making the <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> 24 rather than 23. Fertilization of eggs or insemination by sperm that contain an extra chromosome results in trisomy, or three copies of a chromosome rather than two.|$|E
25|$|Polysomy is a {{condition}} found in many species, including fungi, plants, insects, and mammals, in which an organism {{has at least one}} more chromosome than normal, i.e., there may be three or more copies of the chromosome rather than the expected two copies. Most eukaryotic species are diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes, whereas prokaryotes are haploid, containing a single chromosome in each cell. Aneuploids possess chromosome numbers that are not exact multiples of the <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> and polysomy is a type of aneuploidy. A karyotype is the set of chromosomes in an organism and the suffix -somy is used to name aneuploid karyotypes. This is {{not to be confused with}} the suffix -ploidy, referring to the number of complete sets of chromosomes.|$|E
50|$|Most cat {{species have}} a <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> of 18 or 19. New World cats (those in Central and South America) have a <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> of 18, {{possibly}} {{due to the}} combination of two smaller chromosomes into a larger one.|$|E

50|$|In {{the case}} of wheat, the origin of its <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> of 21 {{chromosomes}} from three sets of 7 chromosomes can be demonstrated. In many other organisms, {{although the number of}} chromosomes may have originated in this way, this is no longer clear, and the monoploid number is regarded as the same as the <b>haploid</b> <b>number.</b> Thus in humans, x = n = 23.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: In {{the first}} stage of sexual reproduction, [...] "meiosis", the number of {{chromosomes}} is reduced from a diploid number (2n) to a <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> (n). During [...] "fertilization", haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} {{found in a}} single complete set of chromosomes is called the monoploid number (x). The <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> (n) is unique to gametes (sperm or egg cells), and refers to {{the total number of}} chromosomes found in a gamete, which under normal conditions is half the total number of chromosomes in a somatic cell.|$|E
50|$|Euploidy is {{the state}} of a cell or {{organism}} having one or more than one set of the same set of chromosomes, possibly excluding the sex-determining chromosomes. For example, most human cells have 2 of each of the 23 homologous monoploid chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes. A human cell with an extra set out of the 23 normal ones would be considered euploid. Euploid karyotypes would consequentially be a multiple of the <b>haploid</b> <b>number,</b> which in humans is 23. Aneuploidy {{is the state}} where one or more chromosomes of a normal set are missing or present in more than their usual number of copies. Unlike euploidy, aneuploid karyotypes will not be a multiple of the <b>haploid</b> <b>number.</b> In humans, examples of aneuploidy include having a single extra chromosome (such as Down syndrome), or missing a chromosome (such as Turner syndrome). Aneuploid karyotypes are given names with the suffix -somy (rather than -ploidy, used for euploid karyotypes), such as trisomy and monosomy.|$|E
2500|$|Gillenia has a <b>haploid</b> {{chromosome}} <b>number</b> of 9, while Maleae have a <b>haploid</b> chromosome <b>number</b> of 17 (which {{was probably}} produced from a Gillenia-like ancestor by doubling the genome and then losing a chromosome). Flower structure and fossil evidence {{also point to}} Gillenia sharing distinctive features with the Maleae. Another similarity between Gillenia and Maleae is susceptibility to Phragmidium fungus. [...] Differences between Gillenia and Maleae include the chromosome number and the latter being solely woody pome bearing plants, while Gillenia is herbaceous and has a dry follicular fruit.|$|R

50|$|In the {{alternate}} segregation pattern, the two translocation chromosomes (T1 and T2) {{go to one}} pole, while the two normal chromosomes (N1 and N2) move to the opposite pole. Both kinds of gametes resulting from this segregation (T1, T2, and N1, N2) carry the correct <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> of genes; and the zygotes formed by union of these gametes with normal gamete will be viable.|$|E
50|$|The {{nucleus of}} a {{eukaryotic}} cell is haploid {{if it has}} a single set of chromosomes, each one not being part of a pair. By extension a cell may be called haploid if its nucleus is haploid, and an organism may be called haploid if its body cells (somatic cells) are haploid. The number of chromosomes in a single set is called the <b>haploid</b> <b>number,</b> given the symbol n.|$|E
50|$|Crocus sativus has a corm, {{which holds}} leaves, bracts, bracteole, and the {{flowering}} stalk. These {{are protected by}} the corm underground. C. sativus generally blooms with purple flowers in the autumn. The plant grows about 10 to 30 cm high. C. sativus is a triploid with 24 chromosomes, which means it has three times the <b>haploid</b> <b>number</b> of chromosomes. This makes the plant sterile due to its inability to pair chromosomes during meiosis.|$|E
50|$|Subtribe Traubiinae (Clade A) {{includes}} about 20 endemic Chilean taxa, {{but only}} about 10% of the species within tribe Hippeastreae. Characterisation includes a <b>haploid</b> chromosome <b>number,</b> x=8, lack of polyploidy and a capitate stigma.|$|R
50|$|The diploid {{chromosome}} number of C. labiata has been variously determined as 2n = 40, 41, and 46. The <b>haploid</b> chromosome <b>number</b> of C. labiata has been variously determined as n = 21 and 21.|$|R
