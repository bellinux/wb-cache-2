5|$|One of {{the notable}} maqamat {{close to the}} modern town of Bani Zeid is Maqam al-Khawwas (var.

The maqam honored what was locally {{considered to be the}} meditation site of al-Khawass, believed to be a Sufi holy man (wely) from Egypt who often visited the residents of the area.|$|E
5|$|Nanmadol {{developed}} from an <b>isolated</b> <b>area</b> of convection south-southwest of Pohnpei that became {{classified as a}} tropical depression on November28. Within highly conducive conditions for development, the system reached tropical storm intensity the following day, followed by typhoon intensity on November30. Quickly pacing towards the north-northwest about the periphery of a nearby subtropical ridge, Nanmadol reached its peak intensity on December1 with winds of 165km/h (105mph) and a minimum barometric pressure of 935mbar (hPa; 27.61inHg). Shortly after, the typhoon made landfall at a similar intensity on Casiguran, Aurora, quickly moving over Luzon before reaching the South China Sea, where it recurved northward into hostile atmospheric conditions. Over the next few days, Nanmadol weakened and later transitioned into an extratropical cyclone near Taiwan on December4, whereafter it merged with another extratopical system.|$|E

On 9 March 1945 one of its Sunderlands landed on a small lake in an <b>isolated</b> <b>area</b> of New Guinea to relieve an Army garrison force. No. 40 Squadron also undertook air sea rescue duties on several occasions. On 20 March 1945 a Sunderland located the survivors of a crashed C-47 and dropped them a dinghy. The Sunderland rediscovered the survivors the next day after contact was lost with them overnight, and maintained position over the dinghy until Allied naval vessels reached it.|$|E

The accident occurred in an <b>isolated</b> <b>area,</b> with bad weather and inaccessibility for search and rescue troops. The passengers stayed at the aircraft for a day, waiting to be rescued. Kirkvaag was aware of the dangers of the injured and frozen passengers if they should fall asleep. They introduced a roll-call every ten minutes and Kirkvaag improvised a radio program to keep up the spirits. The accident and rescue operations generated a large media interest and especially the radio was a popular media to follow the development of the situation. This was intensified with a celebrity being amongst the passengers.|$|E
25|$|Finally in 1925, Mary Breckinridge, a British-trained American {{public health}} nurse, formed the Frontier Nursing Service (FNS) in Kentucky. The mission of FNS {{was to provide}} nurse midwife care for mothers and infants who live in an <b>isolated</b> <b>area</b> without access to healthcare. Indeed, the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky where FNS was located {{had some of the}} highest {{maternal}} and infant mortality rates in the nation. Statistics on the maternal mortality rate of FNS is significantly lower compared to state- and nationwide data. In the late 1920s, FNS hired renowned statistician Louis Israel Dublin to compile their statistics. He showed that the maternal mortality rate (per 10,000) of FNS between 1925 and 1937 was 6.6 compared to 44 to 53 of Kentucky whites and 48.9 to 69.5 of the United States.|$|E

25|$|President James Buchanan {{was born}} into an Ulster Scots family on April 23, 1791, {{near the village of}} Cove Gap. He was born in a log cabin on {{property}} owned by his father. The complex was known as Stony Batter, named for the family home near Ramelton in County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland. At the time of Buchanan's birth, the Cove Gap area was {{on the edge of the}} American frontier. Today it is a quite <b>isolated</b> <b>area,</b> but when President Buchanan was born it was a center of frontier commerce. Stony Batter was a complex of cabins, barns, stables, storehouses, a general store, and an orchard. Pioneers travelling from the East Coast through Cove Gap stopped at Stony Batter to rest and replenish their supplies. Buchanan lived at Stony Batter until he was six years old, when his father moved his business to Mercersburg.|$|E
25|$|When {{moving through}} areas, the player mostly modifies the {{landscape}} so that new paths can be opened. For example, {{in order to}} reach an <b>isolated</b> <b>area,</b> the player might have to bring down a platform by casting a gust of wind, climb onto the platform, and then return the platform to its original position and jump off. The player is also given tools to help with puzzles. One such tool acts as a reef blower or vacuum cleaner, moving items out of the way or defeating enemies. Some tools or objects must first be created on the controller's touch pad. Here, the player can draw the shape of an object and choose the colours. When finished, the item is then used in the game world wherever it is necessary. One instance of this occurs when the player is asked to create a butterfly design. The butterfly design the player creates can then be seen numerous times throughout each level {{for the rest of the}} game.|$|E
25|$|Casement {{traveled}} to the Putumayo District, where the rubber was harvested deep in the Amazon Basin, and explored {{the treatment of the}} local Indians of Peru. The <b>isolated</b> <b>area</b> was outside the reach of the national government and near the border with Colombia, which periodically made incursions in competition for the rubber. For years, the Indians had been forced into unpaid labor by field staff of the PAC, who exerted absolute power over them and subjected them to near starvation, severe physical abuse, rape of women and girls by the managers and overseers, branding and casual murder. Casement found conditions as inhumane as those in the Congo. He interviewed both the Putumayo and men who had abused them, including three Barbadians who had also suffered from conditions of the company. When the report was publicised, there was public outrage in Britain over the abuses. Casement made two lengthy visits to the region, first in 1910 with a commission of investigators.|$|E

25|$|The segment between Peterborough and Perth {{was built}} in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works {{employment}} project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that {{was built in}} the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively <b>isolated</b> <b>area,</b> with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg dotting the landscape. It services the villages of Marmora, where it connects with the northern terminus of former Highway14, Madoc, where it intersect Highway62, Actinolite, where it meets the northern terminus of Highway37, and Kaladar, where it intersects Highway41.|$|E
25|$|Three Sites of Special Scientific Interest {{lie within}} the parish: Lewes Downs, Lewes Brooks and Southerham Works Pit. Lewes Downs is {{a site of}} {{biological}} interest, an <b>isolated</b> <b>area</b> of the South Downs. Lewes Brooks, also of biological importance, {{is part of the}} floodplain of the River Ouse, providing a habitat for many invertebrates such as water beetles and snails. Southerham Works Pit is of geological interest, a disused chalk pit displaying a wide variety of fossilised fish remains. The Railway Land nature reserve is {{on the east side of}} the town next to the Ouse, and contains an area of woodland and marshes, which now includes the Heart of Reeds, a sculpted reed bed designed by local land artist Chris Drury. The Winterbourne stream, a tributary of the Ouse, flows through it. This stream flows most winters and dries up in the summer, hence its name. It continues through Lewes going through the Grange Gardens and often travelling underground. The Heart of Reeds is one of the sites in East Sussex and Kent home to the marsh frog, an introduced species. It is popular with pond-dippers and walkers. A centre for the study of environmental change is due to be built at the entrance to the nature reserve.|$|E
