5000|$|Face frame: first, {{the face}} frame is a metal and plastic {{structure}} which is adjusted to fit onto the patient's face. The frame is normally stabilized on the child's {{face with the}} aid of a chin cup and a <b>forehead</b> <b>pad.</b> These are padded to ensure patient comfort. The frame typically has a horizontal bar or mouth-yoke, which the orthodontist will adjust so it is correctly positioned in front of the patient's mouth to get the elastics to apply the force in the desired direction. The mouth yoke has a number of hooks (four to six depending on type of appliance, see photo with six hooks), which allows the orthodontist to attach elastics or springs directly into from the facemask into the patient's mouth. The frame allows the patient to move his or her head freely and to talk. All other oral activities are typically limited or restricted, such as eating or playing sports or playing a wind musical instruments, although drinking is recommended using a straw so as not to remove the whole appliance at night or in the day when thirsty.|$|E
