5|$|Ripley's early {{television}} and film career was characterised by minor roles as prostitutes or mistresses; {{in what was}} to be her film debut, she filmed two scenes as a prostitute in the film Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh, 1994). In the first scene, her character was strangled by the creature (played by Robert De Niro's stand-in). The second scene featured De Niro himself, though Ripley's character was lying dead in a mortuary throughout. Pleased with what looked like her breakout role, Ripley bought a <b>dress</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> premiere, though she was distraught when Branagh sent her a card apologising for cutting her scenes from the finished film. The same year, she filmed the role of Karen Hughes, the sister of a mute character who believes she sees a murder, in the low-budget film Mute Witness (Anthony Waller, 1995). After Mute Witnesss British television premiere in 1999, a Daily Record critic wrote that Ripley's dramatic scenes were not as good as her comic ones.|$|E

25|$|The {{designs for}} all three dresses were {{entrusted}} by Siti to the duo. For the first dress, they used a red net cloth that comes with motifs sewn into it. For the second dress, inspired {{from the first time}} Siti worked with them, they used red lace and net to make the <b>dress.</b> <b>For</b> <b>the</b> final dress, which was a striped sequin gold dress with a red base and side panels, they used fabrics that are full of sequins to make it. Few adjustments were done to the designs after they saw her during the full rehearsals of the concert, including changing the colours of her tudungs. All three dresses were made from imported fabrics and materials. It took them three weeks to finish designing and creating all the dresses.|$|E
