500|$|Opponents of the light-rail project {{have argued}} that it was {{undertaken}} without sufficient consultation with the public. In February 2008, it was reported that the House of Commons committee on government operations would be looking into his involvement over the case. MP and committee member Mark Holland voiced a concern that Baird leaked information on the contract. Baird replied that he made the right decision and dismissed the investigation saying [...] "there is no evidence of anything". Speaking to reporters he added following the announcement of the investigation: [...] "If you want to avert a billion-dollar boondoggle, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> difficult decisions".|$|E
500|$|Becoming a {{restricted}} free {{agent for the}} second consecutive summer, Hansen was taken to salary arbitration by the Canucks. Following his hearing on 20 July 2010, he was awarded a one-year, one-way deal worth $850,000, which the Canucks agreed to. Recording career-highs of 9 goals, 20 assists and 29 points over 82 games in 2010–11, Hansen received the Canucks' Fred J. Hume Award as the team's [...] "unsung hero" [...] (voted by the Canucks' booster club). He added three goals and nine points over 25 games in the 2011 playoffs as the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. In the off-season, Hansen filed for salary arbitration. Prior to his hearing, Hansen and the Canucks avoided arbitration by agreeing to a three-year, $4.05 million contract. Many in the media, including those from the local Province newspaper, suggested that he ceded to the Canucks' negotiations, to which Hansen responded, [...] "If {{you want to be in}} a position to win, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> sacrifices." ...|$|E

500|$|Before {{the film}} was released, rumors and {{allegations}} began to circulate that Battlefield Earth contained subliminal messages promoting Scientology. Former Scientologist Lawrence Wollersheim, in a press release issued by his group Fight Against Coercive Tactics Network, said that the Church of Scientology [...] "has placed highly advanced subliminal messages in the Battlefield Earth film master to surreptitiously recruit new members from the movie audience {{and to get the}} audience to develop a revulsion for psychiatry and current mental health organizations and practices". Other critics said that the film [...] "is a veiled attempt to gain converts and influence", and that writers were gagged from making connections between Scientology and the film with threats of lawsuits. Warner Bros. dismissed the claims as [...] "silly nonsense", the Church of Scientology denounced them as [...] "hogwash" [...] and the media reacted with skepticism; as the Scottish journalist Duncan Campbell put it, [...] "the only subliminal voice I could detect came about 10minutes into this 121-minute film and it seemed to be saying Leeeaaave thisssss cinemmmaaa nooow". When asked about the similarities between the film and Scientology beliefs in intergalactic travel and aliens, church spokesman Aron Mason stated, [...] "That's a pretty crude parallel… You'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> serious leaps of logic to make that comparison." [...] John Travolta also stated that {{the film was}} not inspired by Scientology tenets.|$|E
500|$|The Ford-powered M2B {{made its}} debut driven by McLaren at the world {{championship}} season-opening Monaco Grand Prix. There he qualified 10th on the grid and ran as high as sixth but retired after nine laps due to an oil leak. After Monaco McLaren decided [...] "it looks as though we're going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> fairly drastic moves in the engine room", and so for the next race in Belgium the Serenissima engine was used. The replacement unit did not provide an immediate solution though, terminally damaging its bearings in practice. With no spare, McLaren was unable to start the race. The team missed the next race in France, but at the British Grand Prix at Brands Hatch the M2B finished sixth to score McLaren's first championship point. Another non-start resulted when the Serenissima failed again before the Dutch Grand Prix, and the entries for the German and Italian Grands Prix were withdrawn {{in anticipation of the}} improved Ford engine being readied. Thus equipped at the United States Grand Prix, McLaren drove to fifth place and two more points. At final event in Mexico, the rear bodywork was cut away to help prevent overheating but the engine failed during the race. McLaren had intended for Chris Amon, who was already racing sports cars for the team, to race a second car but the engine problems prevented this.|$|E

She stated, [...] "e are going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> tough decisions today. Thomas Paine, one of our Founders, had said, 'If {{there is to be}} trouble, let it be in my day, so that my child may have peace.' What he meant way back then was that there should be an expectation that some sacrifices will have to be made, in our generation, so that future generations can have the opportunities that we've had to grow and thrive and prosper, so that our private sector can do what a private sector does best in creating jobs. So, yeah, with some practical things that have to be made, some decisions here, with perhaps changing, in future years, not adversely affecting those who are reliant on retirement benefits today, for instance, Social Security benefits, but changing, perhaps, the eligibility in future years. That has to be something that we're brave enough, courageous enough, to start talking about." ...|$|E

[...] Morey also hoped Sonya could be happy in the future. Morey told the official UK Neighbours website in July 2011 that Sonya and Toadie would start to have some excitement and fun again following all the drama, but they would have to deal with a few issues first. When the subject of marriage comes up, Sonya and Toadie realise that they have different views about it. Morey explained, [...] "At this point Sonya wants to get married for the wrong reasons, and Toadie doesn't want to get married for the wrong reasons. They haven't both independently reached a healthy perspective on it. She wants to do it for security to protect Callum, and he doesn’t want to do it... He feels it will jinx , because his other marriages have gone that way."

60|$|Phineas Finn {{had been}} in the gallery of the House {{throughout}} the debate, and was greatly grieved at Mr. Daubeny's success, though he himself had so strongly advocated the disestablishment of the Church in canvassing the electors of Tankerville. No doubt he had advocated the cause,--but he had done so as an advanced member of the Liberal party, and he regarded the proposition when coming from Mr. Daubeny as a horrible and abnormal birth. He, however, was only a looker-on,--could be no more than a looker-on for the existing short session. It had already been decided that the judge who was to try the case at Tankerville should visit that town early in January; and should it be decided on a scrutiny that the seat belonged to our hero, then he would enter upon his privilege in the following Session without any further trouble to himself at Tankerville. Should this not be the case,--then the abyss of absolute vacuity would be open before him. He would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>some</b> disposition of himself, but he would be absolutely without an idea as to the how or where.
