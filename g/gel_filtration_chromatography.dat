25|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC) is {{also known}} as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography</b> and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).|$|E
25|$|However, chromatographic {{methods for}} {{separation}} started being {{adopted in the}} early 1980s. Developments were ongoing in the time period between when Cohn fractionation started being used, in 1946, and when chromatography started being used, in 1983. In 1962, the Kistler & Nistchmann process was created which was a spin-off of the Cohn process. Chromatographic processes {{began to take shape}} in 1983. In the 1990s, the Zenalb and the CSL Albumex processes were created which incorporated chromatography with a few variations. The general approach to using chromatography for plasma fractionation for albumin is: recovery of supernatant I, delipidation, anion exchange chromatography, cation exchange chromatography, and <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography.</b> The recovered purified material is formulated with combinations of sodium octanoate and sodium N-acetyl tryptophanate and then subjected to viral inactivation procedures, including pasteurisation at 60°C. This is a more efficient alternative than the Cohn process for four main reasons: 1) smooth automation and a relatively inexpensive plant was needed, 2) easier to sterilize equipment and maintain a good manufacturing environment, 3) chromatographic processes are less damaging to the albumin protein, and 4) a more successful albumin end result can be achieved. Compared with the Cohn process, the albumin purity went up from about 95% to 98% using chromatography, and the yield increased from about 65% to 85%. Small percentage increases make a difference in regard to sensitive measurements like purity. There is one big drawback in using chromatography, which {{has to do with the}} economics of the process. Although the method was efficient from the processing aspect, acquiring the necessary equipment is a big task. Large machinery is necessary, and for a long time the lack of equipment availability was not conducive to its widespread use. The components are more readily available now but it is still a work in progress.|$|E
2500|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC), {{also known}} as gel permeation chromatography or <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography,</b> separates particles {{on the basis of}} molecular size (actually by a particle's Stokes radius). It is generally a low resolution chromatography and thus it is often reserved for the final, [...] "polishing" [...] step of the purification. It is also useful for determining the tertiary structure and quaternary structure of purified proteins. SEC is used primarily for the analysis of large molecules such as proteins or polymers. SEC works by trapping these smaller molecules in the pores of a particle. The larger molecules simply pass by the pores as they are too large to enter the pores. Larger molecules therefore flow through the column quicker than smaller molecules, that is, the smaller the molecule, the longer the retention time.|$|E

50|$|Crystallins from a {{vertebrate}} {{eye lens}} are classified into three main types: alpha, beta and gamma crystallins. These distinctions {{are based on}} the order in which they elute from a <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography</b> column. These are also called ubiquitous crystallins. Beta- and gamma-crystallins (such as CRYGC) are similar in sequence, structure and domains topology, and thus have been grouped together as a protein superfamily called βγ-Crystallins. The α-crystallin family and βγ-crystallins compose the major family of proteins present in the crystalline lens. They occur in all vertebrate classes (though gamma-crystallins are low or absent in avian lenses); and delta-crystallin is found exclusively in reptiles and birds.|$|E

50|$|Agarose gel matrix {{is often}} used for protein purification, for example, in column-based preparative scale {{separation}} as in <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography,</b> affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. It is however not used as a continuous gel, rather it is formed into porous beads or resins of varying fineness. The beads are highly porous so that protein may flow freely through the beads. These agarose-based beads are generally soft and easily crushed, so they should be used under gravity-flow, low-speed centrifugation, or low-pressure procedures. The strength of the resins can be improved by increased cross-linking and chemical hardening of the agarose resins, however such changes may also result in a lower binding capacity for protein in some separation procedures such as affinity chromatography.|$|E
50|$|Dialysis {{is useful}} {{for many of the}} same {{desalting}} and buffer exchange applications performed with <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography,</b> as both methods are based on similar molecular weight cut-off limits. Gel filtration has the advantage of speed (a few minutes vs. hours for dialysis), though, along with the ability to remove contaminants from relatively small-volume samples compared to dialysis, an important feature when working with toxic or radioactive substances. Dialysis, on the other hand, is much less dependent on sample size as related to device format. For dialysis applications, achieving a high percentage sample recovery and molecule removal is generally straight forward with little optimization. For gel filtration applications it is important to select a column size and format that is suitable for your sample.|$|E

40|$|AbstractA novel lectin was {{isolated}} from Bothrops leucurus snake venom {{using a combination}} of affinity and <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatographies.</b> The lectin (BlL) agglutinated glutaraldehyde-treated rabbit and human erythrocytes with preference for rabbit erythrocytes. Galactose, raffinose, lactose, fetal bovine serum and casein inhibited lectin-induced rabbit erythrocyte agglutination. BlL, with a molecular mass of 30 kDa and composed of two subunits of 15 kDa, showed dependence on calcium. BlL is an acidic protein with highest activity over the pH range of 4. 0 – 7. 0 and stable under heating to 70 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra showed tryptophan residues partially buried within the lectin structure. The percentages of secondary structure revealed by circular dichroism were 1 % α-helix, 44 % β-sheet, 24 % β-turn and 31 % unordered. BlL showed effective antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and Bacillus subtilis with minimal inhibitory concentrations of 31. 25, 62. 25 and 125 μg/mL, respectively.

50|$|The {{molecular}} weight of AT {{was found to}} be 218 kDa by <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography.</b> AT is a glycoprotein. It has 86% carbohydrate content. It has been reported that the maturation of AT is a stepwise process beginning with a carbohydrate-free 41 kDa protein; this form is then core-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum to form a 76 kDa glycol-protein. In Golgi bodies, the protein is further glycosylated yielding a 180 kDa form, which ultimately attains a maturity in vacuoles, where its {{molecular weight}} becomes around 220 kDa. The 41 kDa carbohydrate free protein moiety of the enzyme was obtained by Endoglycosidase H treatment of purified AT, resulted after sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis27.

5000|$|Size-exclusion {{chromatography}} (SEC) is {{also known}} as gel permeation chromatography (GPC) or <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography</b> and separates molecules according to their size (or more accurately according to their hydrodynamic diameter or hydrodynamic volume).Smaller molecules are able to enter the pores of the media and, therefore, molecules are trapped and removed from the flow of the mobile phase. The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, [...] "polishing" [...] step of a purification.

5000|$|Hydrogenobacter thermophilus {{has several}} unique {{proteins}} that {{allow it to}} be viable in its environment. Cytochrome b and cytochrome c are present in all strains. H. thermophilus strains also possess a very distinctive sulfur containing quinone, 2-Methylthio-1,4-naphthoquinone. This is the first case of non-Calvin-type pathway that is utilized to convert carbon dioxide into cellular components. In addition to the unique quinone, novel types of phosphoserine phosphatase (PSPs) were discovered and have been analyzed by preliminary crystallization and X-ray diffraction. Both iPSP1 and iPSP2 proteins found in H. thermophilus employ metal-ion-independent pathways while typical PSPs need Mg2+ for activity and are considered {{to be part of the}} haloacid dehalogenase-like hydrolase superfamily. iPSP1 is composed of two PspA subunits, while iPSP2 is a heterodimer and has both PspA and PspB subunits. iPSP1 and iPSP2 were observed to share a strong binding affinity towards L-phosphoserine, which supports its activity as a PSP. Novel proteins such as citryl-CoA synthetase (CCS) and ciitryl-CoA (CLL)are utilized within the reductive TCA cycle (Reverse Krebs cycle). These proteins were discovered and characterized through activity purification, SDS-PAGE analysis, and <b>gel</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>chromatography.</b> [...] Additionally, oligionucleotide probes were employed in order to sequence and clone the related genes. The cleavage of citryl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate occurs in a two step process. First, citryl-coA synthetase catalyzes the formation of citryl-CoA, which is immediately cleaved by citryl-CoA lyase. It was also observed that there is significant level of protein sequence homology between the CCL protein and the C-terminal region of ATP citrate lyase (ACL), an enzyme commonly employed by the reductive TCA cycle.|$|E
