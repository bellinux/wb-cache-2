25|$|The {{successful}} rebellion led by Kabakçı Mustafa and the Janissary troops {{put an end}} to French diplomatic success. Sébastiani {{negotiated with}} Kabakçı, while the British sought support from various factions inside Constantinople — the <b>Dragoman,</b> Aleko Soutzos, eventually informed the French Ambassador on the parallel British projects. This resulted in Soutzos' beheading — that which, in Ion Ghica's version of events, caused the Soutzos family of Phanariotes to abandon their commitment to France and begin supporting Russia. According to the Revue des Deux Mondes biography, Sébastiani had betrayed Aleko Soutzos' confidence by revealing as many details of Anglo-Ottoman negotiations as to render it clear that the <b>Dragoman</b> had been acting as his spy, and by failing to respect the promise of French protection.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} role in the Turco-Ragusan relations was played by the Dubrovnik consuls and diplomats, together with the <b>dragomans,</b> interpreters for the Turkish language. Ragusan <b>dragomans</b> were professionals, often self-educated merchants who learned Turkish during long business stays in the Empire. Mainly, they operated in Istanbul, in neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the Turkish chancellery, situated in the Rector’s palace in the City of Dubrovnik...|$|R

40|$|Ottoman {{documents}} {{that were to}} be sent to rulers or officials of other states often were accompanied by translations made by the Ottoman <b>dragomans</b> at the Porte. Some others were translated at the addressee’s court by interpreters engaged there. There also are some examples of translations of European documents into Ottoman Turkish. The authorship of many translations thus being known, individual habits and abilities can be associated to specific <b>dragomans,</b> whose names and biographies, education and careers have been established long ago. On the basis of several published pairs of originals and translations, the focus of the present article lies on the way the <b>dragomans</b> tackled the texts, the level of their fluency, the accuracy of their translations, and political implications of deliberate and/or accidental misinterpretations...|$|R
25|$|After {{serving as}} <b>dragoman</b> of the Ottoman Empire's Fleet, Constantine amazed foreign diplomats through his {{appointment}} to the throne in Bucharest, in competition with the much more prestigious Alexander Ypsilantis.

25|$|The Xenopol {{brothers}} were of foreign origins: their father, {{known locally as}} Dimitrie (and allegedly born Xenopoulos), was a British and Greek subject of the Protestant faith, who settled in the port of Galați and converted to Romanian Orthodoxy. According to various sources, including Junimea memoirist Iacob Negruzzi and literary historian George Călinescu, {{he may have been}} Greco-Jewish. Dimitrie opened the way for his son's political, literary and diplomatic career: he was a <b>Dragoman</b> for the Prussian mission to Moldavia, a tutor of the Rosetti family children, a boarding house manager, and ultimately a prison warden. The Xenopols' mother, née Vasiliu, was of Greco-Romanian origins.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the Mourouzis family of Phanariotes {{and the son of}} Constantine Mourouzis (one of the few Ottoman-appointed Princes to die in office), he was educated to speak six {{languages}} in addition to his native Greek. Alexander was Great <b>Dragoman</b> under Sultan Selim III, in which capacity he helped mediate the 1791 Treaty of Jassy, ending the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–1792. Selim rewarded his service by appointing him to the throne in Iași (Moldavia) in January 1792, and transferred a year later to the throne of Bucharest (1793–1796), where his first year in office coincided with a bubonic plague outbreak (which he dealt with by quarantining and confining the ill to the village of Dudești).|$|E

25|$|However, the British were {{determined}} not to leave Talaat alone. The British had intelligence reports indicating that {{he had gone to}} Germany, and the British High Commissioner pressured Damad Ferit Pasha and the Sublime Porte to demand from Germany to return him to the Ottoman Empire. As a result of efforts pursued personally by (Sir) Andrew Ryan, a former <b>Dragoman</b> and now a member of the British intelligence service, Germany responded to the Ottoman Empire stating that it was willing to be helpful if official papers could be produced showing these persons had been found guilty, and added that the presence of these persons in Germany could not as yet be ascertained.|$|E

He lived among the sailors (for the rest of his life, he preferred to wear sailor's clothes in private), and was chosen <b>dragoman</b> of Hasan Pasha, the commander of the Ottoman fleet. Hasan, together with his friend, Grand Vizier Koca Yusuf Pasha, both important figures in the politics of the Ottoman Empire, convinced the Sultan Abdul Hamid I to name Mavrogenes prince of Wallachia on 6 April 1786. He left the Ottoman capital accompanied by a huge and ostentatious retinue.|$|E

40|$|Operating at the intersections of diplomacy, the Ottoman Empire and Europe, and the Muslim and non-Muslim {{communities}} in Istanbul, the Pisanis were a prolific family of <b>dragomans</b> with many members {{employed by the}} British Embassy in Istanbul in the nineteenth century. These non-Muslim interpreters and translators were intermediaries who facilitated diplomatic relations between Britain and the Ottoman Empire, and acted as brokers that bridged two worlds. Apart {{from the world of}} diplomacy, the Pisanis were a well-connected family whose members excelled in Istanbul’s Levantine community, and participated {{in a wide range of}} enterprises. But by virtue of family members’ occupation as <b>dragomans,</b> extra-territorial legal protection gained by their employment at the embassy, and membership in the Levantine community, the Pisanis, and <b>dragomans</b> in general, are often considered to be actors that were “in-between” empires. This dissertation revises that narrative and argues that the Pisanis were anything but in-between empires, and were rather firmly embedded in both the Ottoman Empire and British Empire. To do so, this study reconstructs their family history and social networks, their public activities in their roles as <b>dragomans</b> and their private activities as non-Muslim Ottoman subjects to examine how members of this family operated within Ottoman and British imperial spaces. In discussing the lives of the Pisanis, this dissertation intervenes in scholarly debates on non-Muslims living and operating in the Ottoman Empire by providing insight from the bottom up on the opportunities provided for this family, and what they did with them. It charts the tactics used to conserve their position in the embassy, the difference in self-representations of their identity among family members, and their use of British and Ottoman institutions to shape their lives within these empires...|$|R

She sat below on a fragment of stone, with the three <b>dragomans</b> standing around her as guards; but even with the three <b>dragomans</b> the attacks on her were so frequent, and as she declared afterwards she was so bewildered, that she never had time to remember that she had come there from England to see the Pyramids, and that she was now immediately under them.|$|R
25|$|On January 2, 1919, Gough-Calthorpe {{requested}} {{from the}} Foreign Office authority {{to obtain the}} arrest and handing over of all {{those responsible for the}} incessant breaches of the terms of the Armistice and the continued ill-treatment of Armenians. Calthorpe got together a staff of dedicated assistants, including a notable anti-Turkish Irishman, Andrew Ryan, later Sir, who in 1951 published his memoirs. In his new role as the chief <b>Dragoman</b> of the British High Commission and Second Political Officer, he found himself in charge of the Armenian question. He proved instrumental in the arrest {{of a large number of}} the (later to be) Malta deportees. These fell broadly into three categories: Those still breaching the terms of the armistice, those who had allegedly ill-treated Allied prisoners-of-war and those responsible for excesses against Armenians, in Turkey itself and the Caucasus. Calthorpe asked for a personal interview with Reshid Pasha, Ottoman Minister of Foreign Affairs, to impress on him how Britain viewed the Armenian affair and the ill-treatment of POWs as “most important” deserving “the utmost attention”. Two days later Calthorpe formally requested the arrest of seven leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP). While between 160 and 200 people were arrested, another 60 suspected of participating in the massacre of Armenians remained at large.|$|E

At Constantinople every body fell to telegraphing the American Consuls at Alexandria and Beirout to give notice that we wanted <b>dragomen</b> and transportation. We were desperate--would take horses, jackasses, cameleopards, kangaroos--any thing. At Smyrna, more telegraphing was done, to the same end. Also fearing for the worst, we telegraphed for a large number of seats in the diligence for Damascus, and horses for the ruins of Baalbec.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{changes in}} Ottoman national {{identity in the}} nineteenth century through the experiences of locally hired <b>dragomans</b> (translators) who worked for both British and American employers. <b>Dragomans</b> mediated between various groups in their work. Beyond carrying out consular activities they communicated new concepts to their local communities. With this in mind, this study concentrates on the experiences of two indigenous intermediaries, in particular a father and son working in and around Beirut, to compare how their association with the British and Americans at different ends of the century affected their position in Ottoman society. In so doing, a complex relationship of obligations and indebtedness is revealed that formed the basis of their connections with foreign residents. A significant factor in the formation of such patronage networks was prestige. Such prestige was measured in terms of power, wealth, and knowledge; the more a person had, the greater one’s ability to provide services to one’s clients. Gradually, however, {{over the course of the}} nineteenth century the basis upon which prestige and its related networks rested altered. At the beginning of the century, prestige had determined how far one’s networks stretched up and down a vertically-structured state (official) hierarchy. Towards the middle of the century, however, Ottoman reformers introduced the concept of equality along with centralizing measures, while the British were also centralising their imperial structures in an attempt to more effectively rule their vast empire. Both of these factors influenced the prestige and thus the position of <b>dragomans</b> within Ottoman society and the British “nation” resident in the sultan’s empire. Hence this thesis shows that events at the imperial peripheries influenced central policies and it grants us alternative visions of how issues of identity were framed for some Ottoman-born <b>dragomans.</b> As such it problematises the limited view of late Ottoman history that has arisen from a retrospective analysis framed all too often in terms dictated by the Empire’s successor states...|$|R
