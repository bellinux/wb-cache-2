500|$|Legal {{documents}} dated 1624 {{state that}} Milnrow consisted of six cottages; {{there were a}} further nine at Butterworth Hall, and three at Ogden. Milnrow did not expand until {{the introduction of a}} woollen weaving trade which began in the Late Middle Ages and continued until the 19th century. During this time nearby Rochdale—the local market town—was used as a central marketing, finishing and <b>fellmongering</b> hub. The handloom weaving of woollen cloth and flannels in the domestic system became the staple industry of Milnrow, facilitating the community's growth and prosperity. Between 40,000 and 50,000 sheep skins were needed every week to provide for Milnrow's industries, and as early as the 16th century, the demand for wool was so great it had outstripped the local supply of the region and had to be imported from Ireland and the English Midlands. As a consequence of the woollen trade, rows of [...] "fine stone domestic workshops" [...] or weavers' cottages were constructed beyond Milnrow's original core, with dwelling quarters on the lower floors and loom-shops on the top floor.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} <b>fellmongering</b> {{appears in the}} early 1850s in the Moreton Bay region. A {{different}} process to wool scouring, <b>fellmongering</b> processed sheepskins in order to remove the wool in preparation for tanning. The wool was washed and dried, and the skins were processed into leather.|$|E
50|$|Associated {{with the}} woollen {{industry}} was the leather one. The hides left after the <b>fellmongering</b> process were made into leather. Tanners, boot and shoe makers, glovers and saddlers {{were all in}} business in Newton Abbot. As with the wool industry business flourished over 600 years until after the Second World War.|$|E

50|$|John Dacey, a Sydney coachmaker and Member for Botany, {{where the}} <b>fellmongering</b> {{industry}} was concentrated, helped to organise the Wool and Basil Workers' Union in Sydney.

50|$|William {{commenced}} his tannery {{business in}} Grenfell Street in 1839, with a <b>fellmongering</b> facility at Adam Street, Hindmarsh. He had moved by 1868 to ThebartonHis {{was the first}} major tannery, ahead of both Dench & Co. and G. W. Bean, and the first to export acacia bark. The Adam Street property was sold in July 1903 to fellmongers Michell and Sons.|$|E
50|$|It {{was some}} 30 {{years before the}} site was again {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} fellmongery. Thomas Alford obtained a permit from the Cleveland Divisional Board in July 1894 to erect a wool scouring and <b>fellmongering</b> works on allotment 4 of section 100, the site of Stephens' earlier fellmongery. Although situated on the site of Stephens' earlier fellmongery, just a small section of his original holdings were taken up by Alford.|$|E

50|$|Ormiston Fellmongery is a heritage-listed {{archaeological site}} of a former wool scour and fellmongery at Sturgeon Street, Ormiston, City of Redland, Queensland, Australia.

The construction was expected to take six weeks to complete, and included the following: ...|$|E
50|$|The largest space, a long {{rectangular}} skylit shed, contains {{machinery and}} equipment for scouring, <b>fellmongering</b> and drying and a small office in the southwestern corner. To the east of this space, at the northern end, are the classing area and adjoining shearing board. These three attached sheds form the triple gable of the northern facade. The raised timber floor of the shearing board which is reached from the sheepyards by a timber ramp, steps down gradually to an earth floor in the scouring area.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} the Ormiston Fellmongery are {{important}} in demonstrating the pattern of Queensland's history as remnant evidence of the important secondary industry of wool processing. Physical evidence of wool scouring, <b>fellmongering</b> and tanning is today rare, despite {{the importance of the}} wool industry and the processing of wool to Queensland's history. The processing of wool was commonly undertaken in and around Brisbane in locations conveniently situated to fresh water sources and transport networks yet the {{remains of the}} Ormiston Fellmongery are the only known surviving elements in the region.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to Tyers {{securing}} a thirty year lease of New Spring Gardens from Elizabeth Masters in 1728, scant {{information is available}} about his early life, except that he had worked in Bermondsey trading skins for the <b>fellmongering</b> company owned by his family. According to the scholar John Lockman when Tyers leased the Gardens - for an annual payment of £250 - the venue {{was little more than}} a [...] "much frequented rural brothel". Under the management, and later ownership, of Tyers, the reputation of the Gardens evolved to one with a degree of respectability.|$|E
50|$|The Western Queensland Meat Export Company {{continued}} {{to operate the}} scour, mostly at a profit, until 1964 when it was sold to K Austin of Glencoe Station. In 1974 CF Thomas Pty Ltd bought the scour and it was closed in 1978 after a storm caused damage to the boiler. Subsidiary activities of the scour included <b>fellmongering,</b> the removal of wool from dead sheep skins; selling petrol for the C.O.R. Company and farming in the 1950s. Shearing was also carried out as a separate activity and wool could be classed and pressed without being scoured. The shearing board is still in use.|$|E
50|$|Origins of C. & J. Clark can {{be traced}} back to 1821 when Cyrus Clark (1801-1866) entered into a {{partnership}} with a Quaker cousin in the trade of <b>fellmongering,</b> woolstapling and tanning in Street, Somerset. By 1825, this partnership had been dissolved and Cyrus relocated to a site on the High Street in Street, utilising premises that belonged to his father-in-law to exploit his idea of making rugs out of sheepskins instead of pulling off the wool. C. & J. Clark recognise this as the beginning of their business and continue to occupy the site upon which Cyrus started to this very day.|$|E
50|$|Besides much agriculture, brewing, a tannery (Tanyard Lane) {{and to a}} small extent brickmaking, {{more than}} 25 men were {{employed}} in the sheep related trade as <b>fellmongers,</b> more than four were parchment makers, five were millers {{and there was a}} surgeon, an oil painter, James M. Burfield, and a watch maker in the town during the 1881 census.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} at Wakefield in Yorkshire. He ran a wool washing works at Botany Swamps before {{erecting}} a dam at Lachlan Swamps around 1849. He later expanded to become a <b>fellmonger.</b> In 1859 {{he was elected to}} the New South Wales Legislative Assembly for Central Cumberland, serving until his resignation in 1863. Atkinson died at Newtown in 1873.|$|R
5000|$|William Peacock married Elizabeth Everett, {{daughter}} of Joseph, another Bermondsey <b>fellmonger,</b> in 1816. He was widowed between 1834 and 1836 and remarried in 1836.

50|$|Woolscouring and <b>fellmongering</b> were {{sometimes}} {{located within the}} same operation, or tended to be clustered in close proximity, along with tanneries. Slaughteryards were also sometimes run in conjunction with fellmongeries. They tended to be located alongside a creek to enable a good supply of clean, fresh water - {{a key element in}} the processing of the skins and wool. A number of such operations occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries in Brisbane, including along Bulimba Creek in the vicinity of Carindale and Belmont, at Ekibin on Norman Creek, and Newmarket and Kelvin Grove on Enoggera Creek.|$|E
50|$|In {{medieval times}} Devon was an {{important}} sheep rearing county. Many towns had their own wool and cloth industries and Newton Abbot had woollen mills, fullers, dyers, spinners, weavers and tailors. In particular, <b>fellmongering</b> (where wool {{is removed from the}} sheepskin) was well established in the town. In 1724 Daniel Defoe wrote that Newton Abbot had a thriving serge industry that sent goods to Holland via Exeter. The annual cloth fair was the town's busiest fair. Over the 19th century Vicary's mills became an important employer in the town and by the 1920s they employed over 400 men. However, by 1972 business had declined and the works finally closed down.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in Newcastle-on-Tyne to William Henry Alderson and Barbara Maddison. He worked in the leather trade, and in 1835 married Isabel Milford, {{with whom he had}} {{thirteen}} children. He migrated to New South Wales in 1842, establishing a tannery. He expanded his holdings to include another tannery in Brisbane as well as boot and harness works and a <b>fellmongering</b> works. He was known as a prominent protectionist and an opponent of trade unions. In December 1881 he was appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council, but he never took his seat and resigned in August 1882. He was re-appointed later in that month, and served until his death at Darlinghurst in 1884.|$|E
25|$|William Peckitt {{was born}} in Husthwaite, a village near Easingwold, 15 miles North West of York, and was baptised on 13 April 1731; his parents were William, a <b>fellmonger</b> and glove maker, and Ann.

50|$|In 1877 John Bull, {{a farmer}} and grazier from Tarago NSW {{purchased}} from Charles Campbell, {{the son of}} Robert, 100 acres of land including the building known as ‘The Oaks’. He operated the inn as the ‘Elmsall Inn’. In the same year John Bull established Hazelbrook Works, a wool washing works and <b>fellmonger</b> near the junction of the Queanbeyan and Molonglo rivers.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fellmonger</b> was {{a dealer}} in hides or skins, {{particularly}} sheepskins, who might also prepare skins for tanning. The name {{is derived from}} the Old English ‘fell’ meaning skins and ‘monger’ meaning dealer. Fellmongery {{is one of the oldest}} professions in the world and since ancient times, man has used the skins of animals to clothe himself, and for making domestic articles.|$|R
50|$|He {{was born}} in County Cavan to farmer James Stephen and Jane Smith. He and {{his family moved to}} Australia in 1848, and after {{unsuccessful}} attempts at mining in New South Wales and Victoria he settled in Sydney as a gardener and fruitgrower. On 14 April 1857 he married Mary Montgomery, with whom he had seven children. After converting the swamps around Botany Bay into fertile land, he established a business in woolscouring and <b>fellmongering.</b> In 1887 {{he was elected to the}} New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the Free Trade member for Redfern. He was defeated in 1891, but returned to the Assembly in 1894 as the member for Botany. Defeated again in 1895, he contested the Assembly again in 1898 and 1901, and in 1901 was elected Mayor of Botany. He died at Botany in 1913.|$|E
5000|$|Butterworth, {{writing in}} 1828, {{described}} the area above Newhey, where Piethorne Brook enters the River Beal; {{he wrote that}} [...] "there are many woollen mills, supplied with numerous streams of water". The earliest woollen mills were established at farmhouses; Kitcliffe Farm had a fulling mill, powered by a wooden waterwheel, {{and some of the}} mill structure can still be seen. In the 19th century, larger mills were built below the brook's confluence with Wickenhall Brook, to use the waters for processing rather than power. The mills were Ogden Mill (bleaching and finishing), Wood Mill (<b>fellmongering),</b> Haugh Mill (woollen), Haugh Mill (cotton), and Salt Pye Mill (cotton waste spinning). Each mill, apart from Haugh Mill, had a reservoir or millpond fed by the brook; Ogden Mill had a reservoir and millpond. Another mill, Lower Two Bridges Mill, took water from the River Beal and also from the brook via the discharge from the Salt Pye Mill reservoir. The latter mill subsequently changed its name to Two Bridges Mill and, after 1919, to Coral Mill.|$|E
50|$|In 1859 Baynes joined Isaac and Hugh Moore on Barambah {{station in}} the Burnett {{district}} and on Condamine Plains on the Darling Downs. He {{was one of the}} pioneers of the meat-preserving industry and has seen the trade develop from its very beginning. He established a butchering business in South Brisbane in 1859 and expanded to wholesale trade. In 1880, with his brothers, Baynes established the Graziers Butchering Co. and the Graziers Meat Export Co. The companies were sold in 1885 to a new partnership of the three Baynes sons (Harry, George and Ernest) and George Hooper, who was replaced in 1888 by John V Francis. The firm undertook meat preserving in leased premises at Queensport and had nearly 30 suburban shops as well as a plant at Belmont for <b>fellmongering,</b> wool scouring and soap making. In 1894 they registered the Graziers Butchering and Meat Export Co. Ltd with power to take over the assets of the two older companies. Baynes sons were bankrupt for a time but were discharged in March 1898 and immediately registered a new firm, Baynes Bros. George left the firm in 1899 and Ernest in 1912. With a new partner John Stitt, Harry reorganised the firm in 1918 as Baynes Ltd.|$|E
