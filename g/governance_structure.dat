40|$|<b>Governance</b> <b>structures</b> {{constrain}} {{and enable}} {{the actions of}} public managers. Principal–agent theory has played a dominant role {{in our understanding of}} <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> This theory suggests that politicians create relatively static <b>governance</b> <b>structures</b> in a top-down fashion and hold man-agers accountable for mandated results. In other words, public managers are influenced by gov-ernance structures but do not affect <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> However, we argue that public manag-ers do affect <b>governance</b> <b>structures,</b> and, in order to understand how this influence takes place, we need a new way of thinking about <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> We propose thinking about <b>governance</b> <b>structures</b> as relationships created through the interactions of people in different and reciprocal roles that are relatively dynamic. Public managers are an important source of the multiple, recip-rocal, and dynamic interactions that produce <b>governance</b> (relationship) <b>structures.</b> As such, man-agers are accountable not only for policy outcomes, but also for the appropriateness of the rela-tionships they create and support.

Research Findings/Insights: Using both market- and accrual-based measures of conservatism and both composite and disaggregated governance indices, we document convincing evidence that well-governed banks engage in {{significantly higher levels of}} conditional conservatism in their financial reporting practices. For example, we find that banks with effective <b>governance</b> <b>structures,</b> particularly those with effective board and audit <b>governance</b> <b>structures,</b> recognize loan loss provisions that are larger relative to changes in nonperforming loans compared to their counterparts with ineffective <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> Theoretical/Academic Implications: We contribute to the extant literature on the relationship between corporate governance and quality of accounting information by providing evidence that banks with effective <b>governance</b> <b>structures</b> practice higher levels of accounting conservatism.

To cope with this transformation and to build competitive advantage, energy companies expand their businesses through downstream customer interfacing businesses in energy-related markts. These new markets are not the core business of energy companies, {{and as a consequence}} that energy companies do not have all the needed resources in-house to commercialize the energy-related products and services succesfully. Energy companies source the needed resources through organizational relationships. However, there is no garantueed success for entering into organizational relationships. It is therefore vital for strategic purposes to control and manage these relationships through appropriate organizational <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> Organizational <b>governance</b> <b>structures</b> are structures through which risks that accompany organizational relationships are managed and controlled.

This research focuses on the design of a framework for the support of decision-making processes concerning organizational <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> Based on theory, and knowldge gained during a case study analysis and a workshop a decision framework is designed. The decision framework consists of three layers: factors, risks, and organizational <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> Together with a risk matrix, the decision framework provides guidance by illustrating the aspects that need to be considered, the relations among these aspects, and the steps decision-makers should take in order to design appropriate organizational <b>governance</b> <b>structures.</b> Systems, Engineering, Policy Analysis and ManagementEconomics of InfrastructureTechnology, Policy and Managemen...|$|R
