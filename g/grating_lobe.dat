40|$|Acoustic phased arrays with inter-element {{spacings}} {{of greater}} than one half-wavelength will produce <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> that decrease {{the usefulness of}} the array. With many array config-urations, the near-field and far-field character of these lobes is significantly different — an optimization of the array configuration to reduce <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> in the far-field can have little bearing on the performance of the array in the near-field. The focus of this thesis is the reduction of <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> in the near-field by iterative opti-mization. Genetic algorithms are employed to choose inter-element spacings which are able to reduce the magnitude of <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> at select distances in the near-field. The genetic algorithm produced configurations that are theoretically able to suppress <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> in the near-field. In order to verify the efficacy of these configurations, a hardware test platform was con-structed. The platform permits largely automated evaluation of the near-field character of arbitrary array configurations. Using the test platform, several of the arrangements were constructed and evaluated. The results of these evaluations confirm {{that it is possible to}} reduce the <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> of sparse phased arrays in the near-field. Contents Abstract i...|$|R
40|$|Sparse ultrawideband antenna arrays {{suppress}} the <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> {{due to the}} fact that the duration of pulses processed by individual antenna elements is too short to constructively superpose them in the time domain. Such arrays represent an attractive option for design of many low-comlexity low-cost ultrawideband systems, where narrow beamwidth is achieved by increase of element spacing. This paper empirically explores the minimum bandwidth required for suppression of the <b>grating</b> <b>lobes.</b> It is found that the relative bandwidth required to suppress <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> is independent on the centre frequency, element spacing, and number of elements. There is a weak dependency of the bandwidth on the type of the pulse used, but the general conclusion is that the relative bandwidth has to exceed 100 % in order to {{suppress the}} <b>grating</b> <b>lobes.</b> It is, however, noted that whilst sparse array with a low number of antenna elements can suppress the <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> and posses a narrow beam, the compromise for this feature is a reduction of the level of spatial filtering between the main lobe and other directions, when compared to arrays where <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> are suppressed by dense spacing. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

In order to ensure the <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> peaks are below the environmental guideline of 0. 01 mW/sq cm, constraints are defined for the mechanical alignment (tilt) of the SPS antenna and the satellite attitude control system.

A hybrid-phase feeding technique combining a cophase feed and an alternating-phase feed is applied to facilitate the suppression of grating lobes. In addition, a stepped feed waveguide and offset coupling slots aligned in a line are employed to realize a tapered aperture distribution. As a result, <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> suppression of 8. 1 [*]dB was achieved on the diagonal planes compared to a conventional alternating-phase-fed waveguide slot array antenna.

40|$|Pulse {{compression}} {{is used in}} {{radar system}} to achieve the range resolution of short duration pulses and Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of long duration pulses. Linear Frequency Modulated (LFM) pulse is one type of signal used in radar. In wide-band radar, for good range resolution, very wide bandwidth is used. The conventional hardware {{may not be able}} to sustain this large bandwidth. So the wideband signal is split into narrowband signals. In narrowband signals, frequency changes linearly for complete duration of the pulse. We change the center frequency of each LFM pulse by introducing a frequency step between consecutive pulses. The resultant signal is known as Stepped Frequency Pulse Train (SFPT). When the product of pulse duration and frequency step become more than one, the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of SFPT yields undesirable peaks, known as grating lobes. Along with <b>grating</b> <b>lobe,</b> the higher peak side lobe can hides the small. Also the wide main lobe width deteriorate the range resolution capability of the signal. Many analytic techniques have been proposed in the literature to select the SFPT parameter to suppress the <b>grating</b> <b>lobe,</b> without paying much attention to side lobe and main lobe width. In this work we compare three MOO algorithms to find the optimized parameter of SFPT. The problem is studied in two ways: In first we take objective of minimization of grating lobes and peak side lobe level. The constraint is of increase in bandwidth. In second problem, our aim is to minimize the main lobe width, which improves the resolution. The objective functions for the second problem are minimization of main lobe width and peak side lobe level. We don’t want high <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> amplitude, so we add a constraint, which restrict the maximum <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> amplitude below a threshold value. Simulations are carried out for different range of parameter values and the simulation result shows the potential of the MOO approach...|$|E
40|$|Uniform {{placement}} of array elements limits its maximum frequency {{due to the}} formation of <b>grating</b> <b>lobes.</b> While non-uniform element or subarray spacing have significantly lower <b>grating</b> <b>lobes,</b> it reduces aperture efficiency and leads to arrays that are difficult to design and manufacture. We propose a modular asymmetric convex-shaped subarray to construct the array by rotation and translation, filling the aperture without overlaps or gaps. This new approach can achieve lower <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> compared to uniform array geometries. It can also lower design, manufacturing and operation costs by offering interoperable subarrays and provide array size flexibility...|$|R
40|$|For arrays the {{placement}} of the single elements determines the angular resolution and the unambiguity interval. The width of the total array determines the resolution capabilities. The wider the elements are placed from each other, the more space in Fourier domain is covered by the measurement and the resolution in time domain will improve. On the other hand the density of the elements has an effect on the angular interval in which objects can be detected unambiguously. For objects within the unambiguous interval <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> will appear outside this area while objects outside result in <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> in the interval of interest. In this paper the properties of arrays regarding resolution and unambiguity interval will be discussed and methods for the suppression of ambiguous <b>grating</b> <b>lobes</b> are suggested.

This contrast parameter quantifies the contrast between an on-axis object and its surroundings and as such is closely related to the visibility of an object. Its behaviour as a function of depth depends on the physical array properties and the electronic settings (e. g. delay settings). With the aid of a simulation tool the significance of the contrast parameters is evaluated. It was shown that the contrast parameter is a useful parameter in addition to the conventional Figures-of-Merit used to assess the array performance, such as beam diameter and <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> level. In particular the contrast parameter facilitates the making of compromises between beamdiameter and <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> levels, which impose conflicting demands on the design of the array.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{transducers}} {{have been}} widely used in the medical applications. High frequency array transducers have recently attracted many research interests, since it provides not only the electronic beamforming but also the very fine image resolution. The transducers are usually either annular or linear arrays. This study concentrates on the design of both types of array in high frequency applications. The annular array is firstly investigated, and an optimized design of array geometry is developed including the kerfs influence which is usually neglected in the design of high frequency arrays. The improved imaging performance is found by this optimized design. More interestingly, the conventional annular array with element having the same surface area has a relatively large sidelobe closest to the main lobe. Two methods are applied to suppress the sidelobe. The method of using high-impedance single matching to enlarge the element bandwidth only shows very limited lobe suppression, however, a novel matching approach is found. Another method of changing the array geometry from equal area elements to equal width ones successfully suppressed the sidelobe. The imaging results suggest that the novel equal width array shows a good improvement. The linear array is then analyzed. The kerfs influence again is found to be significant for the array especially for high frequency. It is essential to use a high attenuated kerfs material in the linear array design. More importantly, the limitation of current fabrication techniques forces the linear array to concede a high <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> in the imaging field if it operates in a relatively high frequency. A novel linear array is developed to suppress the <b>grating</b> <b>lobe</b> without using advanced fabrication techniques. The imaging results show that the novel linear array has a general reduction of - 6 dB for the lobe suppression. The novel design made the linear array operate in a very high frequency without strong <b>grating</b> <b>lobe,</b> and the array can be fabricated by current techniques.
