Results show that the dyads complete the task more quickly and accurately when helpers are colocated than when they are connected via an audio link. However, they didn’t achieve similar efficiency gains when they communicated through an audio/video link. These results demonstrate the value of a shared visual work space, but raise questions about the adequacy of current video communication technology for implementing it.

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{proposes a}} damage {{assessment}} methodology for the non-structural elements, especially ceiling {{elements of a}} building, utilizing an inspection robot. The developed inspection robot equipped with a wireless camera and data processing function has a capability of providing valuable <b>information</b> <b>for</b> the <b>repair</b> and maintenance decision making of a damaged structure. The inspection robots {{will be able to}} estimate the damage condition without any process of engineers’ on-site-inspection involved. The robots also can gather the static data of the nonstructural elements from the sensor, which are distributed on the nonstructural elements. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the inspection robot, the robot is utilized to estimate the ceiling of a real structure damaged by the 2011 off the Pacific coast of Tohoku Earthquake. And conceptual experiment is also conducted for the purpose of evaluating the proposed damage assessment methodology in cooperation with the smart sensor and the inspection robot. The proposed methodology will provide useful information to the maintenance and repair planning of a damaged structure...|$|R

The author improves the organizational and methodological support of internal audit of expenditures on the fixed assets repair and modernization that forms the accurate <b>information</b> <b>for</b> management <b>repair</b> and modernization of fixed assets. The paper specifies the goals and objectives of internal expenditures on repair and modernization of fixed assets, depending on the sources of such facilities to the company, allowing the author to determine the documentary control methods to be applied by an auditor to perform each task. The article determines the areas of risk components of internal control that can lead to ineffective implementation of authority by officials of an enterprise in the process of fixed assets repair, which can cause inefficient use of resources and, consequently, decrease in the efficiency of the work of fixed assets repair and modernization. The author proposes the list of auditor’s questions to assess the internal control system in the repair of fixed assets and these questions will help identify the significant drawbacks of control means. ...|$|R
40|$|Ghosts of T 4 {{bacteriophage}} {{inhibit the}} uptake of thiomethyl-β-galactoside (TMG), α-methylglucoside, glucose- 6 -phosphate, and glycerol in Escherichia coli B. The transport of orthonitrophenyl-β-galactoside (ONPG) is also inhibited {{to a lesser}} degree and without alteration of the apparent Km of transport. These effects of ghosts parallel those of energy poisons on these systems. However, no one energy poison can produce such pronounced inhibitory effects in all these systems. The effect of the intact phage in these systems was either absent or very slight relative to the ghost. The effect of ghosts on the uptake of TMG was not immediate; at 10 C, no effect of the ghosts was apparent for at least 2 min. This suggests that a step, more temperature dependent than the attachment of the ghost, is necessary for the inhibitory action. The intracellular level of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) in the ghost-infected cells fell to less than 25 % of the control value, and the ATP lost from the cell appeared in extracellular medium. Phage, on the other hand, caused no decrease in the intracellular ATP level. This loss of ATP from the cells after ghost infection suggests an alteration of the barrier properties of the membrane so that ATP can leave the cell; however, the accessibility of extracellular ONPG to intracellular β-galactosidase does not increase. The dissimilarity of the actions of phage and ghosts on all properties examined does not support the model that the initial events in their infections are identical but that the intact phage, unlike the ghost, can provide <b>information</b> <b>for</b> the <b>repair</b> of its effects...|$|R

40|$|IntroductionPatients {{with chronic}} distal aortic {{dissection}} (CDAD) remain {{at high risk}} for late aorta-related events and reinterventions, and the ideal management strategy remains undefined. Open surgical procedures carry morbidity, but scant data for thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) of CDAD exist. This study reports our intermediate-term results with TEVAR for complicated CDAD. MethodsAll cases of TEVAR for complicated (aortic growth, malperfusion, intractable pain) CDAD at our institution between 2000 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic <b>information,</b> indications <b>for</b> <b>repair,</b> complications, and aortic morphologic changes were collected from medical records and imaging studies. Aortic morphology (aneurysm size, false lumen thrombosis) was assessed at multiple levels with 3 -dimensional image analysis techniques. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate survival, freedom from reintervention, and likelihood of false lumen thrombosis, with log-rank tests used to discriminate between Kaplan-Meier curves. ResultsIn total, 144 stent–grafts were implanted in 76 consecutive patients (49 male) with complicated CDAD. Early (< 30 postoperative days) mortality was 5 %. There was no paraplegia, and 1 patient died of stroke. At mean follow-up of 34 months, 12 patients had died (1 aorta-related death). Seventeen patients (22 %) underwent 19 secondary aortic reinterventions, mainly for enlargement of the untreated aorta remote to stent–graft repair. Three secondary procedures treated retrograde proximal dissections. Estimated survivals were 86 %, 82 %, and 80 % at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively, and freedoms from both death and reintervention were 72 %, 64 %, and 59 % at similar time points. Of 67 patients (88 %) with complete imaging follow-up, TEVAR resulted in significantly decreased aortic diameter through the stent–grafted segment but not untreated segments. Complete thrombosis of the entire false lumen was uncommon in patients with extensive dissections (13 % vs 78 % P < . 001). ConclusionsManagement of complicated CDAD remains challenging for clinicians. TEVAR is a reasonable treatment modality for dissections limited to the thoracic aorta and for prevention of focal aortic growth in extensive dissections. Late complications and the need for secondary interventions emphasize the complexity of this patient population and the need for long-term follow-up...|$|R
