50|$|<b>Droloxifene</b> is an {{analogue}} of tamoxifen, specifically 3-hydroxytamoxifen, but has 10- to 60-fold increased {{affinity for}} the estrogen receptor and reduced partial estrogen agonistic activity. It causes a dose-dependent decrease in luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels, indicating that it has antigonadotropic activity, and dose-dependently increases sex hormone-binding globulin levels, indicating that it has estrogenic activity in the liver. Similarly to tamoxifen, <b>droloxifene</b> has partial estrogenic effects in the uterus. Unlike tamoxifen, <b>droloxifene</b> does not produce DNA adduct or liver tumors in animals.|$|E

It reached phase II and phase III clinical trials for these indications before development was discontinued in 2000. The drug was found to be significantly less effective than tamoxifen in the treatment of breast cancer in two phase III clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|TPE is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{of a group}} of nonsteroidal estrogen receptor ligands. It includes the estrogens chlorotrianisene, estrobin (DBE), triphenylbromoethylene, triphenylchloroethylene, triphenyliodoethylene, triphenylmethylethylene; the selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) afimoxifene, brilanestrant, broparestrol, clomifene, clomifenoxide, <b>droloxifene,</b> endoxifen, etacstil, fispemifene, idoxifene, miproxifene, miproxifene phosphate, nafoxidine, ospemifene, panomifene, and toremifene. The antiestrogen ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) is also closely related, but is technically not a derivative of TPE and is instead a triphenylethanol derivative. The tamoxifen metabolite and aromatase inhibitor norendoxifen is also a TPE derivative. In addition to their estrogenic activity, various TPE derivatives like tamoxifen and clomifene have been found to act as protein kinase C inhibitors.|$|E

40|$|Although {{increased}} levels of C-reactive protein {{have been linked to}} E therapy, the significance of this finding and whether it occurs with the selective ER modulators are unknown. Thirty-five healthy postmenopausal women were enrolled in a placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over design trial to evaluate the effects of 0. 625 mg oral conjugated E and 60 mg <b>droloxifene,</b> a structural analog of tamoxifen, on serum levels of C-reactive protein, IL- 6, and endothelial cell adhesion molecules. E treatment resulted in 65. 8 % higher levels of C-reactive protein (P � 0. 0002) and 48. 1 % higher levels of IL- 6 (P < 0. 001), but also resulted in a 10. 9 % reduction in soluble E-selectin (P � 0. 002) and borderline reductions in vascular cell adhesion molecule- 1.

40|$|Earlier study {{suggested}} that 3, 4 -dihydroxytamoxifen (tam catechol), a tamoxifen metabolite, is proximate to the reactive intermediate that binds covalently to proteins and possibly to DNA (). The current study demonstrates that rat and human hepatic cytochrome P- 450 s (CYPs) catalyze tam catechol formation from tamoxifen (tam), 3 -hydroxy-tam (<b>Droloxifene),</b> and 4 -hydroxy-tam (4 -OH-tam). Higher levels of catechol were formed from 4 -OH-tam and 3 -hydroxy-tam than from tam. Evidence that human hepatic CYP 3 A 4 and 2 D 6 catalyze {{the formation of}} tam catechol from 4 -OH-tam and supportive data that the catechol is proximate to the reactive intermediate, was obtained: 1) There was a good correlation (r = 0. 82;...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} well known that triphenylethylene {{derivatives}} such as tamoxifen, <b>droloxifene,</b> toremifene and panomifene are very useful selective estrogen receptor modulators to prevent bone loss and breast cancer. 1 The triphenylvinyl moiety {{is a very important}} framework in these types of analogs. Among the triphenylvinyl moieties, β,β-bis(4 '-methoxy) phenyl-α-phenylvinyl moiety is of particular im-portant because a metabolite of tamoxifen formed in patients is 1 -(4 '-hydroxy) phenyl- 1 -(4 '-dimethylaminoethoxy) phenyl- 2 -phenyl- 1 -butene 2 which binds to estrogen receptor much more effectively than tamoxifen. 3 Therefore, a variety of easy transformations of functionality on vinyl carbon with keeping the β,β-bis(4 '-methoxy) phenyl-α-phenylvinyl moiety is a quite important synthetic target for the synthesis of vari-ous relevant compounds. Generally, most of triphenylethyl...|$|E
40|$|The new anti-estrogens, {{including}} the selective estrogen receptor modulators (e. g., toremifene, <b>droloxifene,</b> idoxifene, raloxifene and arzoxifene), the selective estrogen receptor downregulators (e. g., fulvestrant), {{and the new}} steroidal (e. g., exemestane) and non-steroidal (anastrozole and letrozole) aromatase inhibitors have been investigated {{in the treatment of}} breast cancer and hormonally sensitive tumors of the uterine body. In postmenopausal women, anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane appear to have superior efficacy and an improved toxicity profile than tamoxifen, and fulvestrant seems to be at least as effective as anastrozole in patients in whom tumors have progressed after prior endocrine treatment. Preliminary data showed a high response rate and a favorable toxicity profile for arzoxifene in endometrial cancer, whereas letrozole could represent a new interesting therapeutic tool for endometrial cancer as well as for low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma...|$|E
40|$|The antiestrogen, tamoxifen, {{has been}} {{extensively}} used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Although tamoxifen showed benefits in the chemotherapy and chemoprevention of breast cancer, epidemiological studies in both tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients and healthy women indicated that treatment caused {{an increased risk of}} developing endometrial cancer. These troubling side effects lead to concerns over long-term safety of the drug. Therefore, it is important to fully understand the relationship between the antiestrogenic and the genotoxic mechanisms of tamoxifen, other antiestrogens, and their metabolites. Previously, we have shown that o-quinone formation from tamoxifen and its analogues, <b>droloxifene</b> and 4 -hydroxy-toremifene, may not contribute to the cytotoxic effects of these antiestrogens; however, these o-quinones can form adducts with deoxynucleosides and this implies that the o-quinone pathway could contribute to the genotoxicity of the antiestrogens in vivo. To further investigate this potential genotoxic pathway, we were interested in the role of estrogen receptor (ER) 1 R and â since work with catechol estrogens has shown that ERs seem to enhance DNA damage in breast cancer cell lines. As a result, we investigated the binding affinities of 4 -hydroxy and 3, 4 -dihydroxy derivatives of tamoxifen and toremifene to ER R and â. The antiestrogeni...|$|E
40|$|For many years, {{tamoxifen}} {{has been}} the _gold standard_ amongst anti-oestrogen therapies for breast cancer. However, the selective aro- matase inhibitors (AIs), anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane, have demonstrated advantages over tamoxifen as first-line treatments for advanced disease. Anastrozole is also more effective as an adjuvant treatment in early, operable breast cancer and is being increasingly used in the adjuvant setting. Generally, the selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as toremifene, <b>droloxifene,</b> idoxifene, ralox- ifene, and arzoxifene, show minimal activity in tamoxifen-resistant disease and show no superiority over tamoxifen as first-line treatments. In addition to these agents, other treatment options for advanced disease include high-dose oestrogens and progestins. Response rates for high- dose oestrogens and tamoxifen are similar, {{but the use of}} oestrogens is limited by their toxicity profile. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} new endocrine treatment options for breast cancer, particularly for use in disease that is resistant to tamoxifen or AIs. Fulvestrant (_Faslodex_) is a new type of steroidal oestrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that downregulates cellular levels of the ER and progesterone receptor and has no agonist activity. This paper reviews the key efficacy and tolerability data for fulvestrant in postmenopausal women in the context of other endocrine therapies and explores the potential role of fulvestrant within the sequencing of endocrine therapies for advanced breast cancer. </p...|$|E
