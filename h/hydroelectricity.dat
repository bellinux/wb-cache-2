5|$|Hydropower is {{produced}} in 150 countries, with the Asia-Pacific region generating 32 percent of global hydropower in 2010. China is the largest <b>hydroelectricity</b> producer, with 721 terawatt-hours of production in 2010, representing around 17 percent of domestic electricity use. There are now three <b>hydroelectricity</b> plants larger than 10 GW: the Three Gorges Dam in China, Itaipu Dam across the Brazil/Paraguay border, and Guri Dam in Venezuela. The cost of <b>hydroelectricity</b> is low, making it a competitive source of renewable electricity. The average cost of electricity from a hydro plant larger than 10 megawatts is 3 to 5 U.S. cents per kilowatt-hour.|$|E
5|$|Conventional <b>hydroelectricity</b> {{works very}} well in {{conjunction}} with solar power, water can be held back or released from a reservoir behind a dam as required. Where a suitable river is not available, pumped-storage <b>hydroelectricity</b> uses solar power to pump water to a high reservoir on sunny days then the energy is recovered at night and in bad weather by releasing water via a hydroelectric plant to a low reservoir where the cycle can begin again. However, this cycle can lose 20% of the energy to round trip inefficiencies, this plus the construction costs add to the expense of implementing high levels of solar power.|$|E
5|$|The dam serves {{mainly for}} {{irrigation}} water storage, flood control and <b>hydroelectricity</b> production, and impounds Don Pedro Reservoir {{in the foothills}} of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1898, without {{building}} a dam, the original Lower Bonnington Power Plant was generating <b>hydroelectricity</b> from Bonnington Falls in the Kootenay River near {{the confluence of}} the Slocan River in order to supply water to mines in Rossland, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Pumped-storage <b>hydroelectricity</b> stores {{energy in}} the form of water pumped when energy is {{available}} from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one. The energy is recovered when demand is high by releasing the water, with the pump becoming a hydroelectric power generator.|$|E
5|$|The {{guard of}} honour and a 21-gun salute was {{repeated}} in Sydney and Melbourne, where large crowds cheered Diệm's arrival {{at the airport and}} the passing of his motorcade. The South Vietnamese leader was taken outside the capital cities for two days so that he could see the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a large <b>hydroelectricity</b> project in highland Victoria.|$|E
5|$|Typically, {{conventional}} <b>hydroelectricity</b> complements {{wind power}} very well. When {{the wind is}} blowing strongly, nearby hydroelectric stations can temporarily hold back their water. When the wind drops they can, provided they have the generation capacity, rapidly increase production to compensate. This gives a very even overall power supply and virtually no loss of energy and uses no more water.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hydroelectricity</b> is {{the term}} {{referring}} to electricity generated by hydropower; the production of electrical power {{through the use of}} the gravitational force of falling or flowing water. In 2015 hydropower generated 16.6% of the worlds total electricity and 70% of all renewable electricity and is expected to increase about 3.1% each year for the next 25 years. Hydroelectric plants have the advantage of being long-lived and many existing plants have operated for more than 100 years.|$|E
5|$|On July 16, 1933, a {{crowd of}} 3,000 watched the driving of the first stake at the low dam site, and {{excavation}} soon began. Core drilling commenced that September while the Bureau of Reclamation accelerated its studies and designs for the dam. It would still help control floods and provide for irrigation and <b>hydroelectricity,</b> though at a reduced capacity. Most importantly, it would not raise its reservoir high enough to irrigate the plateau around the Grand Coulee. However, the dam's design provided for future raising and upgrading.|$|E
5|$|Oroville Dam is an earthfill {{embankment}} dam on the Feather River {{east of the}} city of Oroville, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley. At 770 feet (235m) high, it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply, <b>hydroelectricity</b> generation and flood control. The dam impounds Lake Oroville, the second largest man-made lake in the state of California, capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre-feet (4.4km3).|$|E
5|$|The Missouri River is {{the largest}} and longest river in the state. Other major South Dakota rivers include the Cheyenne, the James, the Big Sioux, and the White. Essentially all of South Dakota's rivers {{are part of the}} Missouri River Valley. Dams on the Missouri River create four large reservoirs: Lake Oahe, Lake Sharpe, Lake Francis Case, and Lewis and Clark Lake. <b>Hydroelectricity</b> {{generated}} from power plants at the dams provides approximately half of the electricity used by South Dakotans.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment {{found that}} the solar PV would have little impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily <b>hydroelectricity</b> and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} crippled infrastructure, blocking roads {{throughout the}} area and destroying a <b>hydroelectricity</b> plant in Jacmel. The town was left without power and drinking water. In Jérémie, the flooding was so severe as to sweep away a large metal bridge. Hundreds of poorly constructed native houses were destroyed on the Tiburon Peninsula, leaving thousands of survivors without homes. Property damage in Haiti amounted to over $1 million. Meanwhile, thousands of livestock were killed and crops were completely destroyed, prompting fears of impending famine.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} 19thcentury, the Oregon Trail, a pioneer trail {{of which a}} major portion {{followed}} the Snake River, had been established by aspiring settlers and traders. Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. The powerful, steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate <b>hydroelectricity,</b> enhance navigation, and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the lower river, transforming it {{into a series of}} reservoirs. Several of these have been proposed for removal in order to restore some of the river's once-tremendous salmon runs.|$|E
5|$|Economic {{stability}} {{returned with}} the U.S. entry into World War II in 1941, when demand for the state's agricultural and industrial products grew as the nation mobilized for war. In 1944, the Pick–Sloan Plan was passed {{as part of the}} Flood Control Act of 1944 by the U.S. Congress, resulting in the construction of six large dams on the Missouri River, four of which are at least partially in South Dakota. Flood control, <b>hydroelectricity,</b> and recreational opportunities such as boating and fishing are provided by the dams and their reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the <b>hydroelectricity</b> sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on those resources for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, means it has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that Russia has, 44GW comes from <b>hydroelectricity,</b> 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by hydroelectric power stations. Some of Russia's hydroelectric power plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, as shown by the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Since 1900, {{more than}} 15 large dams and many smaller ones {{have been built}} in the Willamette's {{drainage}} basin, and 13 of them are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce <b>hydroelectricity,</b> to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other alterations, and pollution (especially on the river's lower reaches). Part of the Willamette Floodplain was established as a National Natural Landmark in 1987 and the river was named as one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Steamboats {{operated}} {{briefly on}} the large lakes of the upper basin, contributing {{to the growth of}} towns such as Klamath Falls, Oregon, before they were replaced by railroads in the late 19thcentury. In the 19th and 20thcenturies, the upper basin became a productive agricultural region, and many dams were built to provide irrigation and <b>hydroelectricity.</b> In the 1960s, the Klamath River was targeted by much larger, but ultimately unsuccessful schemes to augment water supplies in other parts of California. One of these projects, the Klamath Diversion, would have reversed the entire flow of the Klamath River to supply farms and urban areas in central and southern California.|$|E
5|$|The American River Division {{is located}} in north-central California, {{on the east side}} of the Great Central Valley. Its {{structures}} use the water of the American River, which drains off the Sierra Nevada and flows into the Sacramento River. The division is further divided into three units: the Folsom, Sly Park and Auburn-Folsom South. The American River Division stores water in the American River watershed, to both provide water supply for local settlements, and supply it to the rest of the system. The dams also are an important flood control measure. <b>Hydroelectricity</b> is generated at Folsom and Nimbus dams, and marketed to the Western Area Power Administration.|$|E
5|$|Though Brownlee {{was no more}} {{enthusiastic}} than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed <b>hydroelectricity</b> projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the main}} stem of the Columbia River has 14dams, of which three are in Canada and 11 in the US. Four mainstem dams and four lower Snake River dams contain {{navigation}} locks to allow ship and barge {{passage from the}} ocean as far as Lewiston, Idaho. The river {{system as a whole}} has more than 400dams for <b>hydroelectricity</b> and irrigation. The dams address a variety of demands, including flood control, navigation, stream flow regulation, storage and delivery of stored waters, reclamation of public lands and Indian reservations, and the generation of hydroelectric power.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Trinity River is an {{important}} water source for irrigation and <b>hydroelectricity</b> generation, {{as well as a}} major center of recreational activities such as gold panning, fishing and whitewater rafting. Since 1964 the Trinity River has been dammed to create Trinity Lake, the third largest man-made lake in the state. As much as 90percent of the upper Trinity River watershed was diverted for agriculture in the Central Valley. In 1991 environmental regulations were enacted, requiring a greater release of water to the Trinity River in order to protect fish. However, the use of Trinity River water remains a contentious issue, especially in years of drought.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, where a {{suitable}} {{head of water}} is not available, pumped-storage <b>hydroelectricity</b> {{or other forms of}} grid energy storage such as compressed air energy storage and thermal energy storage can store energy developed by high-wind periods and release it when needed. The type of storage needed depends on the wind penetration level – low penetration requires daily storage, and high penetration requires both short and long term storage – as long as a month or more. Stored energy increases the economic value of wind energy since it can be shifted to displace higher cost generation during peak demand periods. The potential revenue from this arbitrage can offset the cost and losses of storage. For example, in the UK, the 1.7 GW Dinorwig pumped-storage plant evens out electrical demand peaks, and allows base-load suppliers to run their plants more efficiently. Although pumped-storage power systems are only about 75% efficient, and have high installation costs, their low running costs and ability to reduce the required electrical base-load can save both fuel and total electrical generation costs.|$|E
5|$|Australia was {{particularly}} interested in developing atomic energy as the country was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with <b>hydroelectricity</b> {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis drives a Tesla powered by <b>hydroelectricity.</b>|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{generated}} in Switzerland is 56% from <b>hydroelectricity</b> and 39% from nuclear power, {{resulting in a}} nearly CO2-free electricity-generating network. On 18 May 2003, two anti-nuclear initiatives were turned down: Moratorium Plus, aimed at forbidding the building of new nuclear power plants (41.6% supported and 58.4% opposed), and Electricity Without Nuclear (33.7% supported and 66.3% opposed) after a previous moratorium expired in 2000. However, {{as a reaction to}} the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the Swiss government announced in 2011 that it plans to end its use of nuclear energy in the next 2 or 3 decades. In November 2016, Swiss voters rejected a proposal by the Green Party to accelerate the phaseout of nuclear power (45.8% supported and 54.2% opposed). The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) is the office responsible for all questions relating to energy supply and energy use within the Federal Department of Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC). The agency is supporting the 2000-watt society initiative to cut the nation's energy use by more than half by the year 2050.|$|E
5|$|In {{the latter}} half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three Allis Chalmers built Francis turbine-{{generator}}s, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest <b>hydroelectricity</b> facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1,345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16large generators, eight {{on each side of the}} river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made arbitrarily distributable. The present contracts for the sale of electricity expire in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Many {{factors have}} {{influenced}} the construction of dams along the Snake River. A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes, from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula, a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River. Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three major categories. From its headwaters {{to the beginning of}} Hells Canyon, many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water. Between here and Hells Canyon, the first dam on the Snake, Swan Falls Dam, was built in 1901. In Hells Canyon, a cascade of dams produce <b>hydroelectricity</b> from the river's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance. Finally, a third cascade of dams, from Hells Canyon to the mouth, facilitates navigation. Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the Snake River, which now serve an important purpose for people living in the Snake's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports.|$|E
5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of <b>hydroelectricity</b> and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with electric traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with electric traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E
5|$|Pasvikdalen {{has been}} {{populated}} since the Stone Age; archeological {{findings from the}} Komsa culture have been dated back to 4000 BC. About 2300 BC there was immigration from Finland and later the area was largely used by Skolts for reindeer husbandry. Norwegian immigration started about 1850, and the first land was granted land for farming in 1874, after a road was built along the valley to Svanvatn. This was followed up by Russian immigration {{to the other side}} of the border. The road was extended to Grensefossen in 1939 and after 1945 the population on the Russian side was forcefully moved by the Soviet authorities and the area depopulated. The Soviet Union started planning to regulate Pasvikelva for <b>hydroelectricity</b> in the 1940s, with the first power station opening in 1951. Seven power stations were built which take advantage of the entire height of fall in the river.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{greenhouse}} emissions, {{is being}} tackled at all scales, ranging from tracking {{the passage of}} carbon through the carbon cycle to the commercialization of renewable energy, developing less carbon-hungry technology and transport systems and attempts by individuals to lead carbon neutral lifestyles by monitoring the fossil fuel use embodied in all {{the goods and services}} they use.

25|$|In Brazil, <b>hydroelectricity</b> {{supplies}} about 77% {{of total}} electricity demand. It {{is estimated that}} about 70% of the overall <b>hydroelectricity</b> potential of the country, is still unexploited.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydroelectricity</b> {{eliminates}} the flue gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion, including pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, dust, and mercury in the coal. <b>Hydroelectricity</b> also avoids {{the hazards of}} coal mining and the indirect health effects of coal emissions.|$|E
25|$|Variable {{renewable}} energy (VRE) is a {{renewable energy}} source that is non-dispatchable due to its fluctuating nature, like wind power and solar power, {{as opposed to a}} controllable {{renewable energy source}} such as <b>hydroelectricity,</b> or biomass, or a relatively constant source such as geothermal power or run-of-the-river <b>hydroelectricity.</b>|$|E
25|$|The 2007 National Energy Policy {{supports}} the diversification and increase of energy sources, mainly through renewable energy such as <b>hydroelectricity,</b> geothermal, solar, wind power and biofuels (as well as mineral coal and natural gas).
