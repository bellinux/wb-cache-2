40|$|Abstract Sediments and {{associated}} biota represent important {{sources for the}} exposure of aquatic organisms to environmental toxicants including dioxin-like compounds, genotoxic chemicals, and endocrine disruptors. One of the key chal-lenges that <b>environmental</b> <b>toxicologists</b> and risk assessors are facing is the charac-terization and assessment of toxicological risks associated with such complex matrices such as sediments. Therefore, approaches have been developed supple-menting chemical analysis with bioanalytical techniques that {{make use of the}} specific properties of certain groups of chemicals to interfere with specific biological processes. This type of analysis has been coined effect-directed analysis (EDA), and is based on a combination of fractionation procedures, biotesting, and subsequent chemical analyses. In this chapter, we review {{the current state of the}} art of EDA regarding the assessment of sediment and biota samples for dioxin-like, genotoxic, and endocrine disrupting potentials. We discuss in vivo and in vitro screening concepts that are used in combination with fractionation and chemical analytical techniques to aid in the risk assessment of these chemical groups i...|$|R

As a result, there is a continued need for robust analytical tools that can aid in the rapid quantification and characterization of chemical exposure. In the first research phase, we demonstrated that a current tool for estimating human organophosphate pesticide exposure, measuring dialkyl phosphate (DAPs) metabolites in urine as chemical biomarkers of pesticide exposure, could represent exposure to DAPs themselves and not to pesticides. We showed that DAPs are metabolically stable, have high oral bioavailability, and are rapidly excreted in the urine following oral exposure.

40|$|The {{dysfunction}} {{associated with}} intersexuality in vertebrates and molluscs {{is often a}} serious threat to ecosystems. Although poorly understood, crustacean intersexuality is associated with contamination and includes forms linked to increased sex-ratio distorting parasites at polluted sites. Despite the importance of crustaceans for monitoring vulnerable aquatic habitats, {{little is known about the}} molecular basis of this abnormal sexual differentiation and any associated sexual dysfunction. To increase the relevance of crustaceans to <b>environmental</b> <b>toxicologists,</b> we comprehensively analyzed gene expression in amphipods presenting parasite- and nonparasite-associated intersexuality. Our findings reveal existing vertebrate biomarkers of feminization should not be applied to crustaceans, as orthologous genes are not induced in feminized amphipods. Furthermore, in contrast to vertebrates, where feminization and intersexuality is often associated with deleterious demasculinization, we find males maintain masculinity even when unambiguously feminized. This reveals a considerable regulatory separation of the gene pathways responsible for male and female characteristics and demonstrates that evidence of feminization (even if detected with appropriate biomarkers) is not a proxy for demasculinization in crustaceans. This study has also produced a comprehensive spectrum of potential molecular biomarkers that, when combined with our new molecular understanding, will greatly facilitate the use of crustaceans to monitor aquatic habitats...|$|R

50|$|There is {{presently}} {{no authority to}} specifically regulate nanotech-based products. Scientific research has indicated the potential for some nanomaterials to be toxic to humans or the environment.

The fish also exhibited changed gene markers in their livers, indicating their entire physiology was affected. In a concurrent test, the fullerenes killed water fleas, an important link in the marine food chain. The extremely small size of fabricated nanomaterials also means that they are much more readily taken up by living tissue than presently known toxins. Nanoparticles can be inhaled, swallowed, absorbed through skin and deliberately or accidentally injected during medical procedures.

40|$|Dichloroacetate (DCA) is a {{xenobiotic}} {{of interest}} to both <b>environmental</b> <b>toxicologists</b> and clinicians. The chemical {{is a product of}} water chlorination and of the metabolism of various drugs and industrial chemicals. Its accumulation in groundwater and at certain Superfund sites is considered a potential health hazard. However, concern about DCA toxicity is predicated mainly on data obtained in inbred rodent strains administered DCA at doses thousands of times higher than those to which humans are usually exposed. In these animals, chronic administration of DCA induces hepatotoxicity and neoplasia. Ironically, the DCA doses used in animal toxicology experiments are very similar to those used clinically for the chronic or acute treatment of several acquired or hereditary metabolic or cardiovascular diseases. As a medicinal, DCA is generally well tolerated and stimulates the activity of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme complex, resulting in increased oxidation of glucose and lactate and an amelioration of lactic acidosis. By this mechanism, the drug may also enhance cellular energy metabolism. DCA is dehalogenated in vivo to monochloroacetate and glyoxylate, from which it can be further catabolized to glycolate, glycine, oxalate, and carbon dioxide. It remains to be determined whether important differences in its metabolism and toxicology exist in humans between environmentally and clinically relevant doses. - Environ Health Perspect 106 (Suppl 4) : 989 - 99...|$|R

40|$|Occupational and <b>environmental</b> <b>toxicologists</b> {{are faced}} with the {{responsibility}} of providing sound scientific data {{that can be used to}} ensure individuals that they can conduct their daily activities without undergoing any undue risk which might potentiate the development of disease. With the majority of chemicals in the environment, it has been generally assumed that there is some safe level of exposure that is of no threat to human health. To be able to predict the absolute safe level is the sought after goal; however, the possibility of achieving this level of precision is remote, and in fact no chemical is absolutely safe. Thus, it becomes vitally important to carefully define the population at risk, the mode of exposure, and the lowest concentration that will cause an adverse health effect. Great strides have been made from the days when the toxicologists were extrapolating low-level health effects from studies performed at high concentrations (LD 50), with single pollutant exposures (03, NO 2, SO 2), inadequate analytical and monitoring techniques, and "unnatural " routes of exposure. It is now recognized that in many instances the action of one toxic agent can be modified by exposure to other agents. The possibility of various environmental pollutants interacting to cause effects that may be additive, synergistic, or antagonistic is always present.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} that <b>environmental</b> <b>toxicologists</b> and risk assessors are facing is the identification and assessment of potential impacts of pollutants in water bodies. Due to the complexity and diversity of aquatic system, the sole use of classic biological–analytical techniques is insufficient for addressing this issue. The SOLUTIONS project, in which context the present thesis was developed, {{was set up to}} produce consistent solutions for the large number of legacy, present and future chemicals posing a risk to European water resources with respect to ecosystems and human health. For that purpose, a new generation of biological approaches, chemical analysis tools, and a full chain of in silico models were integrated for identification of substances and mixtures posing risks, in order to support decisions in environmental and water policies. This thesis has been carried out as part of SOLUTIONS, and the research questions guiding this thesis were: (i) how can integrative approaches cooperate for the hazards potential determination? (ii) how to assess the environmental impact of mixture? (iii) how to optimize the integrative approaches to link adverse biological effects and the detected chemicals? (iv) how to analysis the mechanism of priority toxicant? and (v) are the integrative approaches able to (1) investigate various biological responses; (2) prioritize aquatic toxicants and (3) analyze the toxic mechanism. These objectives were explored in complementary studies focusing on the integrative approaches development and adaptation, followed by the application of integrative approaches to identify the priority toxic mixtures in the aquatic environments, and ultimately leaded to a comprehensive multi-mechanism aquatic toxicity assessment approach. Firstly, the molecular responses of estrogenic activity and AhR-mediated activity, cellular response of genotoxic activity and organism response of embryo developmental toxicity were investigated with zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae for environmental relevant mixtures. And the Ames fluctuation assay and the chemical activated luciferase gene expression (CALUX®) assay were employed to detect mutagenicity and in vitro estrogenic activity respectively. It covered both in vivo assays and in vitro assays for multiple toxic effects investigation. According to the observed toxic effects, the primary bioavailable toxic mode of action ranging from molecular level to whole organism level was developed. Then with the help of complexity reduction technique of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and the in silico methods of QSAR toolbox and ChemProp, non-bioactive substances were ruled out. Based on the observed biological responses and in silico results, the detected chemicals were prioritized. To analysis the toxic effect mechanism, the mixture model of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA) were worked together with the observed biological response to explore the mixture interactions. The environment risks and complications of environmental mixtures were assessed by the risk quotients with three classic aquatic taxa (algae, invertebrate and fish). To excavate the specific reasons for the entrogenicty, the in silico methods of VirtualToxLab and MetaPrint 2 D (-React) were combined with HPLC to explore the estrogenic contributions of priority estrogenic compounds and their metabolites.

Few physicians are familiar with this rare disease, and motivation to investigate the unknown requires familiarity with what is known and what is anomalous. In pursuit of the previously undescribed risk, investigators benefited greatly from multi-disciplinary collaboration, in this case including physicians, epidemiologists, <b>environmental</b> scientists, <b>toxicologists,</b> industry representatives, and worker advocates.

The first chapter presents a brief overview of the techniques presented in the book. The author assumes that the reader has a general understanding of chromatography and the basic components of a chromatographic system. The remainder of the book is organized into chapters by chromatographic technique. Each of these subsequent chapters is organized by the variety of compounds that have been successfully analyzed by each technique. In this way, a reader can search for information by either analyte or analytical technique. The chromatographic techniques include widely used techniques such as gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography (both with a variety of detectors including mass spectrometry), thin-layer chromatography, ion-pair chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and ion exchange chromatography. Less common techniques are also presented: micelle chromatography, electrostatic ion chromatography, ion exclusion chromatography and gel permeation chromatography. Classes of compounds addressed in this text include a wide variety of naturally occurring as well as anthropogenic compounds such as metals, organometals, carboxylates, insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, fertilizers, petroleumrelated compounds, detergents, plasticizers, and disinfectants. In these chapters, the author briefly summarizes the scientific literature with respect to the analytical techniques covered in chapter one. Although details are generally insufficient to permit readers to duplicate reported analyses, a truly impressive number of cited references are listed {{at the end of each}} chapter. The book concludes with a comprehensive subject index. This book provides a good initial reference for a variety of graduate students, scientists (chemists, biologists, soil scientists, <b>toxicologists,</b> <b>environmental</b> scientists, etc.), managers, and public health professionals who may be faced with evaluating and/or developing an analytical approach for the analysis of organic and/or inorganic compounds in a water-based matrix.

Each of the next 12 chapters is dedicated to the analysis of a class of compounds. Chapter topics include hydrocarbons, surface active agents, oxygen-containing compounds, halogen-containing compounds, nitrogen-containing compounds, phosphorous-containing compounds, sulfur-containing compounds, pesticides (insecticides, growth regulators, fungicides), mixtures of organic compounds, metalloids, organometallic compounds, and finally miscellaneous organics. In these chapters, the author briefly summarizes the scientific literature with respect to the analytical techniques covered in Chapter One. Although details are generally insufficient to permit readers to duplicate reported analyses, cited references are listed {{at the end of each}} chapter. Chapter Fourteen emphasizes the importance of sampling procedures and provides a good overview of sample homogenization, and destructive and nondestructive sampling approaches. The final two chapters discuss accumulation processes in sediments, and the disposal of wastes to land. These chapters provide an excellent justification for the importance of the material presented in this book, and would perhaps serve the reader better had they constituted the initial book chapters. The book concludes with an appendix of instrument suppliers, an extremely brief listing of the United Kingdom Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Foods Methods for soil analysis, and a subject index. This book provides a good initial reference for a variety of graduate students, scientists (chemists, biologists, soil scientists, <b>toxicologists,</b> <b>environmental</b> scientists, etc.), managers, data/grant reviewers, and public health professionals who may be faced with reviewing data and/or developing an analytical approach for the analysis of organic compounds in difficult matrices such as soils, sediments and sludges. Mostly, however, this book simply reviews the literature. The author injects very little analysis to the literature summary. For example, there is no mention of the fact that analysis by thin-layer chromatography is generally qualitative (nonquantitative) compared to analysis by gas chromatography (GC) or high performance liquid chromatography. For the analysis of halogen-containing compounds (such as organochlorine insecticides), there is no mention of the selectivity afforded by GC–electron capture detection. I believe a large number of readers would benefit greatly from a discussion section at the end of each chapter. This discussion might include a table that compares the variety of detection methods with respect to limits of detection, cost, sample throughput, and reproducibility. Because many chapters contain mostly references that are more than 20 years old (i. e., citations pertaining to the use of packed GC columns), the discussion section could help the reader determine the advantages of one technique over another and which techniques are commonly used today versus those which are antiquated. Perhaps this would be easier if individual chapters were written by pertinent experts or at least if there were multiple editors rather than having one author compile and edit the entire book. Additionally, a brief summary of the author’s experience/expertise would possibly contribute credibility to this book. Another small addition that would increase the value of the book would be the inclusion of the article titles in the cited references. This would make it easier for readers to determine the value of citations prior to obtaining the article...|$|R
