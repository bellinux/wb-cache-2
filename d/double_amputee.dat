50|$|<b>Double</b> <b>amputees</b> have {{difficulty}} using a starting block in track events because they cannot align their legs with the {{block in the}} standard way. They often use different starting positions as a result. They have a different stride to able-bodied runners, with their artificial limbs having increased ground contact time, shorter leg swing time, and less time in the air while running.|$|R
500|$|Reagan {{played his}} {{favorite}} acting role {{when he was}} a <b>double</b> <b>amputee</b> in 1942's Kings Row, in which he recites the line [...] "Where's the rest of me?"—later used as the title of his 1965 autobiography. Many film critics considered Kings Row to be his best movie, though the film was condemned by New York Times critic Bosley Crowther.|$|E
500|$|Organisers {{expected}} {{the first ever}} sell-out {{in the history of}} the Paralympics. LOCOG's chief executive Paul Deighton remarked that [...] "the interest in attending the Paralympics has been extraordinary from the start." [...] This success was attributed to the enthusiasm surrounding Great Britain's performance during the Olympics, fan interest in South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius—who had become the first ever <b>double</b> <b>amputee</b> to compete in the Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes, and affordable prices.|$|E
500|$|Organizers {{expected}} the Games {{to be the}} first Paralympics to achieve mass-market appeal, fuelled by continued enthusiasm from the British public following the country's successful performance at the Summer Olympics, awareness of the United Kingdom's role {{in the history of the}} Paralympics, public attention surrounding South African sprinter Oscar Pistorius (who, only just prior to the Paralympics, became the first <b>double</b> <b>amputee</b> to compete in the Summer Olympics alongside able-bodied athletes), a major marketing campaign instituted by the Games' local broadcaster, and growing media coverage of Paralympic sport. The games ultimately met these expectations, breaking records for ticket sales, heightening the profile of the Paralympics in relation to the Olympics, and prompting IPC president Philip Craven to declare them the [...] "greatest Paralympic Games ever." ...|$|E

50|$|Factoring {{should not}} be {{confused}} with certain events where athletes with a greater impairment are entitled to compete in a race for athletes with a 'lesser' impairment, for example <b>double</b> <b>amputees</b> (such as Oscar Pistorius) in a single leg amputee athletics race alongside runners such as Jonnie Peacock or Richard Browne. In such races, no factoring is taken into account. In cycling, a number of the road races are cross-classification and non-factored despite factoring taking place in the time trial for the same classifications.|$|R
2500|$|Occasionally, {{athletes with}} a {{disability}} excel to compete with able bodied athletes. [...] Legally blind Marla Runyan ran in the 2000 and 2004 Olympics and {{won a gold medal}} in the 1500 metres at the 1999 Pan American Games. [...] Oscar Pistorius, a <b>double</b> <b>amputee,</b> has competed in the 2012 Olympics. [...] At the 2011 World Championships Pistorius successfully made it to the 400 metres semi-final round and won a silver medal as part of South Africa's 4x400 metres relay team. [...] In Masters athletics it is far more common to make an accommodation for athletes {{with a disability}}. [...] Blind Ivy Granstrom set numerous Masters world records while being guided around the track.|$|E
2500|$|Duckworth {{was working}} towards a Ph.D. in {{political}} science at Northern Illinois University, with research interests in the political economy and public health in southeast Asia, when she was deployed to Iraq in 2004.

She was the first female <b>double</b> <b>amputee</b> from the Iraq war. The explosion [...] "almost completely destroyed her right arm, breaking it in three places and tearing tissue from the back side of it". The doctors [...] "reset the bones in her arm and stitched the cuts" [...] to save her arm. Duckworth received a Purple Heart on December 3 and was promoted to Major on December 21 at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where she was presented with an Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal.

40|$|Previously instituted {{policies}} regarding prosthetic limb provision {{had been}} deemed dependable.

In order to attempt to eliminate the wastage of prosthetic provision to non-ambulators a new policy decision was made. Doubtful ambulators and those from the three aforementioned categories will be initially provided with temporary prostheses. Only after a period of months of temporary prosthetic usage at home will a decision be made as to whether a permanent prosthesis will be issued...|$|R
