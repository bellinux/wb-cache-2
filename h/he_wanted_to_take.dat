Prior to this, Hrungnir had been drunkenly boasting of his desire to, amongst other things, kill all of the gods except Freyja and Sif, whom <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> home with him. However, at the duel, Hrungnir is quickly killed by the enraged Thor.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} three days Marseille's Staffel was rested and taken off flying duties. On 28 September Marseille {{received}} a telephone call from Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel asking to return with him to Berlin. Hitler was to make a speech at the Berlin Sportpalast on 30 September and Rommel and Marseille were to attend. Marseille rejected this offer, citing that he was needed at the front and had already taken three months' vacation that year. Marseille also said <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> leave at Christmas, to marry his fiancée Hanne-Lies Küpper.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects {{in the years that}} followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to ever play in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|Doc Holliday had a {{reputation}} as a gunman and had reportedly been in nine shootouts during his life, although it has only been verified that he killed three men. One well-documented episode occurred on July 19, 1879, when Holliday and his business partner, former deputy marshal John Joshua Webb, were seated in their saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Former U.S. Army scout Mike Gordon got into a loud argument with one of the saloon girls that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with him. Gordon stormed from the saloon and began firing his revolver into the building. Before Gordon could get off his second shot, Holliday killed him. Holliday was tried for the murder but acquitted, mostly based on the testimony of Webb.|$|E
5|$|The {{moral code}} {{embedded}} in Aboriginal lore {{is evident in}} a story from an unspecified locality in eastern Australia (probably in New South Wales) published in 1943. An Aboriginal man, fishing in a lagoon, caught a baby bunyip. Instead of returning the baby to the water, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the bunyip back to the camp to boast of his fishing prowess, against the urging of his friends. Before he could do anything, the mother bunyip rose from the water, flooding swirling water around them, and took back her baby. As the water receded, the men found {{that they had been}} changed into black swans. As punishment for the fisherman's vanity, they never regained their human form, but could be heard at night talking in human voices as a reminder to their human relatives of the perils of pride and arrogance.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what happened to his son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E

25|$|A {{decisive factor}} for Lentulus's further career was his {{behavior}} against the Prussian commander, Gottfried Emanuel von Einsiedel, during the Second Silesian War on 16 September 1744. The Austrian commander at Prague, Ferdinand Philipp von Harsch, {{had agreed to}} capitulate after a two-week siege. Lentulus, at that time captain, refused to sign the capitulation certificate and, instead, broke his sword: he had been commanded to fight to defend Prague, but not to surrender. This impressed the Prussian King Frederick II so much that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Lentulus into his service.|$|E
25|$|On 19 May 2013, it was {{reported}} that Nawaz Sharif had secured a majority in Pakistan's national assembly after 18 independent candidates joined the party, allowing it to form government in the National Assembly without striking an alliance with any other party. The minimum needed was 13 independent candidates, but Sharif had managed to make an alliance with 5 more candidates, giving the PML-N a coalition government of 142 seats. After the coalition was announced, Nawaz Sharif stated that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his oath as Prime Minister on 28 May, the 15th anniversary of when he ordered Pakistan's first nuclear tests in 1998.|$|E
25|$|When Eisenhower was {{appointed}} Supreme Allied Commander for Operation Overlord in January 1944, Whiteley {{was one of}} three key British staff officers <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> with him to England to staff the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF), the others being Kenneth Strong and Humfrey Gale. Eisenhower encountered resistance to this from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, General Sir Alan Brooke, who agreed to transfer Whiteley and, reluctantly, Gale, but not Strong. Accordingly, Whiteley initially became Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence (G-2) at SHAEF, with American Brigadier General Thomas J. Betts as his deputy. However Eisenhower eventually had their way and Strong assumed the post on 25 May 1944. Whiteley then became deputy to the Assistant Chief of Staff, Operations (G-3), Major General Harold Bull. Whiteley remained in this post {{for the rest of the}} war.|$|E

25|$|After the {{invasion}} of Gaul by several barbarian tribes in 406, contact was broken between Britain and the Western Roman central government in Ravenna. As a result, the provincial Roman army - probably encouraged by the local nobility – elected three of their own emperors in rapid succession, of whom {{the commander of the}} army eventually succeeded in 407 in holding onto power. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the political and military chaos in Gaul caused by the barbarian invasion to strengthen his power and crossed with his loyal troops across the English Channel. At this point, the Romano-British renounced him probably in the wake of an uprising against the governor appointed by him. Around 410 AD, the last units of the mobile field army left the island, drawing to a close 300 years of Roman rule over Britain.|$|E
25|$|After Brezhnev's {{death in}} 1982 Andropov was voted in as General Secretary by the Politburo. Immediately after his {{appointment}} Andropov asked Gromyko if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> over Brezhnev's old {{office of the}} Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. Gromyko turned down Andropov's offer, believing that Andropov would eventually take the office for himself. He {{did not believe that}} Andropov would take the office because of pure vanity, but rather due to its functions. After Andropov's death in 1984 and Chernenko's in 1985, Gromyko nominated Mikhail Gorbachev for the General Secretaryship on 11 March 1985. In supporting Gorbachev, Gromyko knew that the influence he carried would be strong. After being voted in Gorbachev relieved Gromyko of his duty as foreign minister and replaced him with Eduard Shevardnadze and Gromyko was appointed to the largely honorary position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.|$|E
25|$|On his return, Macleod was {{surprised}} and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting {{came to believe that}} <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> all the credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas extract to continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.|$|E

25|$|In March 1551, her {{condition}} improved somewhat {{and she was}} able to receive a messenger from Bona Sforza who informed her that Bona recognized her marriage to Sigismund Augustus. It was described as her last victory. Her health continued to decline and she had fever, diarrhea, nausea. Sigismund Augustus personally tended to his sick wife even though reportedly she stank of pus. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> her to Niepołomice where he hoped that spring weather would lessen her suffering. When there was a doubt whether a special wagon to transport Barbara could fit through the city gates, Sigismund Augustus ordered the gate demolished. Barbara died on 8 May 1551 in Kraków. She asked to be buried in Vilnius and her body was transported to Vilnius Cathedral, where she was buried on 23 June next to Sigismund Augustus' first wife Elizabeth of Austria. Her death was a severe loss to the King; it is said that for {{a good portion of the}} journey he followed her coffin on foot. It was said that Sigismund Augustus became more serious, avoided parties, and liked to dress black for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|The other {{officers}} in Danyang {{were well aware}} that Gai Lan and Dai Yuan were the masterminds behind Sun Yi's murder but were unable {{to take action against}} the two men because their powers were limited. Gai Lan took over Sun Yi's residence and seized Sun's concubines and servants for himself. When <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Lady Xu (Sun Yi's widow), she declined, said that it was too soon after her husband's death to remarry, and told him to wait for a month. During the intervening period, Lady Xu secretly contacted Sun Gao (孫高), Fu Ying (傅嬰) and other former subordinates of Sun Yi, informed them of the circumstances, and plotted with them to avenge her husband. On the appointed day, Lady Xu changed out of her mourning garments and invited Gai Lan to her personal quarters, where Sun Gao and Fu Ying, in disguise as maids, ambushed and killed Gai while the others slew Dai Yuan. Gai Lan and Dai Yuan's heads were cut off and offered as propitiation at Sun Yi's altar. This incident shocked everyone in Danyang. Shortly thereafter, Sun Quan came to Danyang to reward those who remained loyal to Sun Yi and punish those who conspired with Gai Lan and Dai Yuan.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} was becoming tense {{and so the}} Uthman's administration had to investigate the origins and extent of anti-government propaganda and its aims. Some time around 654, Uthman called all the governors of his 12 provinces to Medina to discuss the problem. In this Council of Governors, Uthman directed the governors that they should adopt all the expedients they had suggested, according to local circumstances. Later, in the Majlis al Shurah (council of ministry), it was suggested to Uthman that reliable agents {{should be sent to}} various provinces to investigate the matter and report about the sources of such rumors. Uthman then sent his agents to the main provinces, Muhammad ibn Maslamah was sent to Kufa; Usama ibn Zayd was sent to Basra; Ammar ibn Yasir was sent to Egypt, while `Abd Allah ibn Umar was sent to Syria. The emissaries who had been sent to Kufa, Basra and Syria submitted their reports to Uthman, that all was well in Kufa, Basra and Syria. The people were satisfied with the administration, and they had no legitimate grievance against it. Some individuals in various locations had some personal grievances of minor character, with which the people at large were not concerned. Ammar ibn Yasir, the emissary to Egypt, however, did not return to Medina. The rebels had carried on with their propaganda in favor of the Caliphate of Ali. Ammar ibn Yasir had been affiliated with Ali; he left Uthman, and instead joined the opposition in Egypt. Abdullah ibn Saad, the governor of Egypt, reported about the activities of the opposition in Egypt. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action against Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr (foster son of Ali), Muhammad bin Abi Hudhaifa (adopted son of Uthman) and Ammar ibn Yasir.|$|E
