Group 1 : Conventional animals (tap water) Group 2 : Conventional animals (tap water, acidified) Group 3 : <b>Germfree</b> <b>animals</b> (tap water, sterilized) Group 4 : <b>Germfree</b> <b>animals</b> (tap water, acidified, sterilized) The application of acidified drinking water was applied for a period of 7 to 9 weeks. The following parameters were used to describe the effects on dental hard tissues. 1. Plaque and dental calculus (plaque-index, Silness and Löe 1964) 2. Defects on enamel and dentin (Severity-index, Radike and Muhler 1953) 3. Erosions and wear (Sorvari et al. 1988) 4. Depth of fissures (Karle et al. 1980) and 5. Scanning-electronmicroscopy of lower jaw molars and incisivi. Dental plaque was found in animals of all groups. Conventional animals having received tap water revealed a Plaque-index of 8, 4. The same phenomenon was observes for <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> (Plaque-index of 5,o and 3, 6 respectively). Estimation of defects of enamel and dentin by the Severity-index resulted in 3, 3 for the conventional tap water group, 7, 9 for the conventional acidified water group. In <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> acidified water also elevated the index to 6, 9 compared to the tap water group with an index of 2, 3. In both conventional and <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> a significantly higher degree of tooth defects and erosions were detected. Conventional animals showed 12, 7 % and <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> showed 15, 5 % less intact enamel when being exposed to acidified drinking water. The analysis of scanning electronmicroscopic pictures showed clearly visible etching pattern in group 2 and 4 – mainly on palatinal surfaces of molar cusps. Additionally, Gaps at the enamel-dentine interface and denuded enamel rods on incisors could be observed.

40|$|The {{administration}} of the antibiotic neomycin {{has been associated with}} a reversible intestinal malabsorption syndrome (1 - 5); shorter, broader villi and decreased levels of intestinal enzymes have been reported both in humans (6 - 11) and in experimental animals (12 - 14). The severity of the intestinal morphologic and physiologic alterations appears to increase with dose and time (15 - 17).

40|$|ABSTRACT-Liver tumors {{induced by}} {{dimethylnitrosamine}} showed an increased incidence in Syrian hamsters with intestinal microflora suppressed by antibiotics, {{as compared with}} the inci-dence in animals not treated with antibiotics. The possible mech-anisms, including metabolic alterations caused by changes in the normal microflora population, were discussed. -J Natl Cancer Inst 58 : 1835 - 1836, 1977. Numerous studies have indicated that interaction be-tween dietary constituents and chemical carcinogens may be responsible for the geographic and socioeco-nomic variations in the incidence of certain forms of cancer. For example, diets having a high content of fat and animal protein are considered among the most important causal factors associated with colon cancer in man (1 - 9). Another major consideration is the presence of intestinal microflora, which may convert dietary com-ponents and endogenous secretions into cocarcinogens and/or carcinogens (10 - 13). Germfree, as opposed to conventional, animals have shown a decreased tumor incidence in actual tumor number and in target organs when a carcinogen requir-ing metabolic activation was administered. The opposite was true when a direct acting carcinogen was given (14 - 17). In the present study, we used conventional Syrian hamsters and those with intestinal microflora sup-pressed by a combination of antibiotics. An attempt was made to determine the effect on carcinogenesis by the potent liver carcinogen DMN in normal versus sup-pressed microfloral populations and to correlate these results with those in <b>germfree</b> <b>animal</b> studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{traditional}} Japanese medicine juzentaihoto (JTX) is {{a pharmaceutical}} grade multi-herbal medicine widely {{used for the}} prevention of cancer metastasis and infection in immuno-compromized patients in Japan. The effect of JTX has been supposed to be intimately affected by the immunological properties of host and enteric microflora. The influence of JTX on the gene expression profile in the large and small intestines was investigated by microarray analyses using mice of different strains with or without enteric microflora. Results In all types of mice, including <b>germfree</b> (GF) <b>animals,</b> the genes most affected by two-week oral JTX treatment were the type 1 interferon (IFN) -related genes including Stat 1, Isgf 3 g and Irf 7, which {{play a critical role in}} the feedback loop of IFN-α production cascade. In IQI specific pathogen free (SPF) mice JTX increased the steady state level of the expression of IFN-related genes, but had the opposite effect in IQI GF and BALB/c SPF mice. Promoter analysis suggests that tandem repeated $IRFF (the promoter sequences for interferon regulatory factors) may be a primary target for JTX action. Pre-treatment of JTX accelerated the effects of an oral IFN "inducer" 2 -amino- 5 -bromo- 6 -methyl- 4 -pyrimidinol (ABMP) (up-regulation of IFN-α production in IQI strain and down-regulation in BALB/c mice), which is in good accordance with the effect of JTX on gene expression of type 1 IFN-related genes. Conclusions Microarray analysis revealed that the target of JTX might be the transcription machinery regulating the steady-state level of genes involved in the ISGF 3 -IRF 7 cascade, whose effect is bi-directional in a strain- and microbiota-dependent manner. </p...|$|R

40|$|Intestinal mucosal cells, {{originating}} in the crypts, migrate up the villi of the small intestine and slough off into the lumen (1, 2). Studies of the kinetics of these events have revealed a differential rate of cellular renewal between the intestinal mucosal cells of <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> and those of conventional animals (3, 4). The time for migration of the mucosal cells from the crypt to villus tip is twice as long in the germfree animal (3, 4). The absence of intestinal bacterial flora in the germfree animal may account for this difference in dynamic morphology. Recent advances in intestinal and fecal culturing techniques have provided information about the intestinal bacterial flora under normal and experimental conditions (5 - 7). The changing patterns of intestinal microorganisms have been followed both in newborn animals (8 - 11) and after contamination in <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> (12).

40|$|The serum y-globulin level {{depends on}} a dynamic {{equilibrium}} between synthesis and catabolism. The mechanisms which regulate this equilibrium are not well understood, but a balance must exist between the rate of production {{and the rate of}} breakdown in order to maintain a constant serum-/-globulin concentration. Injections of exogenous y-globulin into mice increase the rate of catabolism of isotopically labeled homologous (mouse) y-globulin (1). The rate of catabolism of homologous y-globulin is also more rapid in hyperimmunized mice (1) or mice harboring y-globulin-producing plasma cell tumors (2). On the other hand, germfree mice, which have subnormal serum y-globulin concentrations, have slower rates of y-globulin breakdown than normal mice (3). The rate of T-globulin catabolism also appears {{to be related to the}} serum y-globulin concentration in man (4 - 10). In guinea pigs, however, the rates of homologous y-globulin catabolism are the same in <b>germfree</b> and normal <b>animals</b> in spite of up to 6 -fold differences in the serum ") '-globulin levels (11), suggesting that the fractional catabolic rate of homologous y-globulin is independent of the serum level in these animals...|$|R
40|$|Germfree mice {{housed in}} {{isolators}} under controlled environmental and nutritional conditions {{were associated with}} an intestinal microflora. These associated animals and germfree mice drawn from the same population were used in experiments in which saline extracts of cells from the small intestine were assayed for alkaline phosphatase activity and for protein and DNA content. Epithelial cells were harvested from the intestines sequentially from the villous tips to the crypts of Lieberkühn. In all preparations, <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> yielded from one and one-third to one and one-half times the mass (wet weight) of cells yielded by associated mice. Likewise, for all preparations, extracts {{of the mass of}} cells from germfree mice contained more protein and DNA per milliliter than did extracts from associated animals. The ratio of the amount of extractable protein or DNA per milliliter of extract to the total wet weight of the cells in milligrams was about the same, however, for preparations from germfree and associated animals. All preparations from <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> yielded higher total alkaline phosphatase activities than those from associated mice. When related to the amount of DNA in the cells, the enzymatic activities were slightly but not significantly higher in preparations from <b>germfree</b> <b>animals,</b> except for preparations of cells removed from the tips of the villi. When related to the amount of protein in the extracts, the enzymatic activity (i. e., specific activity) was about the same in preparations from germfree and from associated mice, except (again) for preparations of cells removed from the tips of the villi. In the latter preparations, the specific alkaline phosphatase activities and enzymatic activities calculated relative to the amount of DNA were substantially higher for <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> than for mice with a microflora. Individual intestinal epithelial cells from germfree and associated animals, except those close to the villous tips, contain about the same alkaline phosphatase activity. Therefore, germfree mice must yield more activity of such microvillous enzymes than do mice with a microflora, partly because enterocytes at the tips of the villi in germfree mice contain more protein with enzymatic activity than do cells in a comparable location in mice with a microflora. In addition, the small intestines of germfree mice contain more activity of enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase than do those of associated animals because the small intestines of the former animals contain more enterocytes than do those of the latter...|$|E

Quantitative and qualitative stool cultures on selective media of the treated animals revealed only growth of yeast organisms. The treated animals developed enlargement of the ceca with fluid contents and watery stools, resembling characteristics of <b>germfree</b> <b>animals.</b> Radioautography with tritiated thymidine revealed an increased epithelial cell migration rate in the mice treated with the antibiotics for 3 to 5 wk. A slight increase in villus height was also noted. The treated male mice showed greater variance than the treated females in epithelial cell migration rates. Histochemical staining reactions showed a decrease in nonspecific esterase and in NADH dehydrogenase activity in the proximal gut of the antibiotic animals. Stains of distal gut and those for acid and alkaline phosphatase, NADPH dehydrogenase, lactic dehydrogenase, and succinic dehydrogenase were similar to the controls. A slight increase in sucrase activity and a slight decrease in lactase activity in the antibiotic animals was observed in contrast to control animals.

The two populations of animals were maintained in plastic film isolators under tightly controlled environmental and nutritional conditions. Samples were taken at 0, 4, 8, 12, and 17 days and at 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 weeks after association. The activities were expressed as specific activities and as total units per segment of small intestine. Enzymatic activities expressed in both ways fluctuated considerably in the samples taken from one time to the next in animals of both types. The activities expressed as total units per segment of bowel of all three enzymes had decreased from levels in <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> by as early as 4 days after association. The total units of activity per segment of bowel tested continued to decrease for approximately 3 weeks in the associated animals to levels two- to fivefold {{lower than those of}} <b>germfree</b> <b>animals.</b> However, the specific activities of the three enzymes in the animals of the two types became less disparate at later sample times. This latter result is predictable because the {{concentration of}} protein extractable from the small intestines of the mice of the two types was the same {{at the beginning of the}} experiment, but by the later sampling times, the concentration of protein extractable from small bowels of ex-germfree mice was significantly lower than that from germfree mice. The fluctuations in levels of the enzymatic activities, even under controlled environmental and nutritional conditions, point to the necessity of using such conditions and a kinetic approach in studies of the effects of the microbiota on the activities of enzymes in the microvillous membranes of small bowel enterocytes. The changes in protein concentrations suggest that such activities and the amounts of protein extractable from the mucosa are influenced by different properties of the microflora. Thus, studies in which the enzymes are extracted from the entire mucosa and the activities are expressed as units per weight of extractable protein may give misleading results concerning the influence of the microbiota on the enterocyte membranes...|$|E

One of the limitations of our earlier studies was the failure, for lack of adequate cultural techniques, to enumerate quantitatively the strict anaerobes.

At 128 days of OVA feeding T-lymphocyte numbers diminished but B-lymphocyte numbers increased, and AF animals had more than six times as many gingival B lymphocytes as animals not fed antigen. Also, AF animals showed immunoglobulin A antibody in intestinal perfusates (after 9 days of OVA feeding) and in saliva (within 23 days of OVA initiation). Plasma immunoglobulin G antibodies were not detected until 59 days of feeding. Spleen cells from AF rats showed in vitro blastogenic responses to OVA at 23 to 59 days of feeding. Periodontal bone loss was greater in AF animals after 59 and 128 days of OVA. <b>Germfree</b> <b>animals</b> fed only one antigen experienced more periodontal bone loss than animals fed the same diet not containing antigen. Therefore, immune phenomena can contribute to experimental bone loss in germfree rats...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{guinea pigs}} {{provided}} with a solution of 5 % (wt/vol) degraded carrageenan as the sole source of oral fluids developed ulcerations of their ceca and large intestines within 30 days. Similar lesions were not detected in germfree guinea pigs treated in an identical manner, suggesting that an intestinal microflora was necessary for development of intestinal lesions. To simplify the bacterial flora required for production of cecal ulcerations, 10 pools consisting of 10 bacterial strains each were isolated from the cecal microflora of carrageenan-treated animals. Groups of germfree guinea pigs were associated with 2 of the 10 pools by orogastric intubation and observed for development of disease. One-half of each group was treated with carrageenan. The two bacterial pools were characterized {{by the presence of}} cytopathic effects for WI- 38 and Vero cells, increased chemotactic activity, and increased concentrations of long-chain fatty acids. The results indicated that animals associated with those two pools developed cecal ulcerations during carrageenan treatment. Preliminary results also indicated that cecal ulcerations developed in <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> mono-associated with a strain of Bacteroides vulgatus isolated from one of the pools, regardless of whether carrageenan was administered, suggesting a bacterial involvement in disease development in the absence of carrageenan treatment...|$|E
40|$|This chapter will {{summarise}} {{the role}} of some functionally active intestinal microbes acting on man and animal on some anatomical, physiological and biochemical functions. The inuences on immunological functions will be presented separately. The baselines for these functions refer to studies performed in material from <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> and healthy newborns, and values obtained are compared to functions in a macro-organism which have been in affected by a micro-ora. In principle, these functions are similar in all the organisms so far investigated, only the levels vary, due to age, and different dietary components and environmental factors. Alterations of the normal pattern of these functions mainly reects altered ecological conditions in the organism {{and the reasons for}} these are sometimes known—sometimes unknown. The consequences after alterations of these functions have to be investigated in several ways, i. e., both with regard to local and distal effects on the host organism. Key words: microora-associated functions, germfree, normal intestnal ora, biochemical, anatomical. ORIGINAL ARTICLE the lactulose test. Still another way to investigate the ora is to investigate its metabolic capacity by searching for metabolites indicating functional activity of microbes present, microbes which are difcult to cultivate and thus identify.

40|$|From mouse fecal {{material}} we have isolated four strictly anaerobic bacteria which, when {{associated with}} germfree mice or rats, reduced the cecal volume by 80 and 60 %, respectively. This cecal volume-reducing flora did not metabolize estrone- 3 -sulfate, taurolithocholate- 3 -sulfate or taurolithocholate but gnotobiotic rats {{associated with this}} particular flora (CRF-rats) excreted these compounds faster in feces plus urine than did germfree rats. The time needed for 50 % excretion (t 1 / 2) of orally administered estrone- 3 -sulfate was 32 h in germfree rats versus 13 h in CRF rats; for intraperitoneally injected taurolithocholate- 3 -sulfate the t 1 / 2 was 63 h in germfree versus 17 h in CRF rats and for taurolithocholate the t 1 / 2 was 199 h in germfree and 96 h in CRF rats. Association of germfree rats with the cecal volume-reducing flora did not change the cecal absorption rate of estrone- 3 -sulfate, but shortened the 50 % small intestinal transit time of [14 C]PEG from 10 to 3 h; a value also found in conventional rats. These results stress the important influence of the intestinal microflora on the absorption and excretion of steroids via {{its effect on the}} physiology of the whole intestinal tract and point to the deficiencies inherent to the use of <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> in excretion studies. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} Lactobacillus acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 to antagonize Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Typhimurium {{and to reduce}} the {{pathological}} consequences for the host was determining using conventional and gnotobiotic animals. Conventional NIH mice received daily by gavage a 0. 1 ml suspension containing about 10 (8) cfu L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 and <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> received a single 0. 1 ml dose. The gnotobiotic and conventional groups were infected orally with 10 ² and 10 (5) cfu of S. Typhimurium, respectively, 7 days after the beginning of treatment. Control groups were treated with sterile saline instead of Lactobacillus. Survival data showed a protective effect against the pathogenic bacteria in both conventional and gnotobiotic Lactobacillus-treated mice. L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 colonized the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice {{and the number of}} viable cells ranged from 10 (9) to 10 (10) cfu/g of faeces. In both experimental and control gnotobiotic animals, S. Typhimurium became rapidly established at a level ranging from 10 (8) to 10 (10) cfu/g of faeces and remained at high levels until the animals died or were sacrificed. In conclusion, the previous treatment of mice with L. acidophilus UFV-H 2 B 20 protects the animals against the experimental infection with S. Typhimurium but this protection was not due to the reduction of the pathogenic populations in the intestines...|$|E
40|$|The role of interbacterial {{adherence}} in {{the colonization}} {{of the rate}} oral cavity was investigated with aggregating and nonaggregating strains of Veillonella alcalescens and Streptococcus mutans. V. alcalescens V- 1 and S. mutans M- 7 rapidly formed large stable aggregates when mixed in vitro. Aggregates could be reduced in size by sonication, {{but they could not}} be completely dispersed, indicating that bonding between the organisms was strong. V. alcalescens V- 1 did not coaggregate with S. mutans C 67 - 1, and V. alcalescens OMZ 193 did not coaggregate with either S. mutans strain C 67 - 1 or M- 7. Osborne-Mendel rats monoassociated with either S. mutans C 67 - 1 or M- 7 were inoculated with veillonellae, molar teeth were removed at 2 h and at 14 days, and the number of veillonellae was determined. At 2 h post-inoculation there were 600 times as many colony-forming units of V. alcalescens V- 1 adherent to the teeth of animals monoassociated with S. mutans M- 7 when compared with animals monoassociated with the nonaggregating S. mutans C 67 - 1. The number of colony-forming units of V. alcalescens V- 1 was 1, 000 times greater than the number of nonaggregating V. alcalescens OMZ 193 in S. mutans M- 7 -infected animals. Similar results were obtained when teeth were samples 14 days after inoculation. Veillonellae inoculated into the mouths of <b>germfree</b> <b>animals</b> rapidly disappeared from tooth surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Commensal gut {{bacteria}} {{contribute to}} intestinal inflammation in inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and experimental colitis. Since ileitis models are scarce, {{the impact of}} gut flora on small intestinal inflammation has not been elucidated. Oral infection of susceptible mice with the parasite Toxoplasma (T.) gondii results in severe Th 1 -type small intestinal immunopathology characterized as pan-ileitis. Methods: Gut flora changes during development of ileitis were identified by molecular and microbiological techniques. The contribution of gut bacteria to inflammation was determined by antimicrobial treatment and {{by the use of}} gnotobiotic mice. Results: Ileitis was accompanied by a marked increase of the total bacterial load and a sharp decrease in bacterial diversity. Inflammatory changes were paralleled by a population shift from predominantly Gram-positive rods to Gram-negative bacteria identified as Escherichia coli and Bacteroides/Prevotella spp., respectively. Prophylactic and therapeutic antibacterial treatment with ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole prevented or reduced small intestinal inflammation. <b>Germfree</b> <b>animals</b> generated by quintuple antimicrobial treatment and recolonized with total gut flora, E. coli or Bacteroides/Prevotella spp. developed small intestinal pathology after infection with T. gondii. Germfree mice or mice monoassociated with Lactobacillus johnsonii did not develop ileal inflammation. Conclusions: Development of T. gondii-driven Th 1 -type immunopathology is accompanied by a shift from a highly diverse microflora to few Gram-negative species. The use of gnotobiotic mice will allow to study the impact of individual bacterial species on small intestinal immunopathology and to test the effect of gut flora modulation in IBD. Furthermore it may prove useful to test novel therapies based on modulation of gut flora...|$|E
