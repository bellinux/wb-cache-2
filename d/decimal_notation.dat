5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> (equivalently, endless {{trailing}} 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly {{as in the}} special case considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are dense.|$|E

25|$|In the 10th century, Middle-Eastern mathematicians {{extended}} the decimal numeral system to include fractions, as recorded in a treatise by Syrian mathematician Abu'l-Hasan al-Uqlidisi in 952–953. The <b>decimal</b> point <b>notation</b> {{was introduced by}} Sind ibn Ali, who also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals.|$|R
25|$|The flourishing of algebra in {{the medieval}} Islamic world and in Renaissance Europe was an {{outgrowth}} of the enormous simplification of computation through <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Simon Stevin {{created the}} basis for modern <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> and insisted {{that there is no}} {{difference}} between rational and irrational numbers in this regard.|$|E
25|$|A {{tallying}} {{system has}} {{no concept of}} place value (as in modern <b>decimal</b> <b>notation),</b> which limits its representation of large numbers. Nonetheless tallying systems are considered the first kind of abstract numeral system.|$|E
5000|$|In {{computer}} science, {{the double}} dabble algorithm {{is used to}} convert binary numbers into binary-coded <b>decimal</b> (BCD) <b>notation.</b> It {{is also known as}} the Shift-and-add-3 algorithm, and can be implemented using a small number of gates in computer hardware, but at the expense of high latency.|$|R
25|$|Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory further {{proposed}} that the prefixes be abandoned altogether, and the letter B be used for base-2 exponents, similar to E in <b>decimal</b> scientific <b>notation,</b> to create shorthands like 3B20 for 3×220, a convention still used on some calculators to present binary floating point-numbers today.|$|R
25|$|Other {{achievements}} of Muslim mathematicians {{during this period}} include {{the addition of the}} <b>decimal</b> point <b>notation</b> to the Arabic numerals, the discovery of all the modern trigonometric functions besides the sine, al-Kindi's introduction of cryptanalysis and frequency analysis, the development of analytic geometry by Ibn al-Haytham, the beginning of algebraic geometry by Omar Khayyam and the development of an algebraic notation by al-Qalasādī.|$|R

25|$|The final result, abhi, equals 387 (abhi = 20 + 21 + 27 + 28 = 1 + 2 + 128 + 256 = 387); this is {{the same}} result {{achieved}} by adding 157 and 230 in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{decimal numeral}} system (also called base-ten {{positional}} numeral system, and occasionally called denary) {{is the standard}} system for denoting integer and non-integer numbers.

25|$|The {{routing prefix}} of an address is {{identified}} by using another address, called the network mask or subnet mask, {{written in a}} form identical {{to that of the}} address itself. For example, the subnet mask for a routing prefix that is composed of the most-significant 18 bits of an IPv4 address is written as 11111111.11111111.11000000.00000000 in binary, or as 255.255.192.0 in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation.</b> This form of denoting the network mask, however, is only used for IPv4 networks.|$|E
25|$|The Russian abacus {{was brought}} to France around 1820 by the {{mathematician}} Jean-Victor Poncelet, who served in Napoleon's army and had been {{a prisoner of war}} in Russia. The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> and algorismic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, not for any applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid. The Turks and the Armenian people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a coulba by the Turks and a choreb by the Armenians.|$|E
25|$|We {{can assume}} that as we write text left to right, we are {{increasing}} the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses − as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value 0a0b0c0d (written 168496141 in usual <b>decimal</b> <b>notation)</b> is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in decreasing significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes {{from left to right}} in decreasing significance: 0Ah at +0, 0Bh at +1, 0Ch at +2, 0Dh at +3.|$|E
50|$|The {{latitude}} and longitude are expressed in <b>decimal</b> degree <b>notation,</b> in which a positive latitude value refers to the northern hemisphere, and a negative value refers to the southern hemisphere.

25|$|In mathematics, the {{mathematician}} Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi {{gave his}} name {{to the concept of}} the algorithm, while the term algebra is derived from al-jabr, the beginning of the title of one of his publications. What is now known as Arabic numerals originally came from India, but Muslim mathematicians did make several refinements to the number system, such as the introduction of <b>decimal</b> point <b>notation.</b> Mathematician Al-Battani (850-929) contributed to astronomy and mathematics, while scholar Al-Razi contributed to chemistry and medicine.|$|R
50|$|Just like <b>decimal</b> {{engineering}} <b>notation</b> can {{be viewed}} as a base-1000 scientific notation (103 = 1000), binary engineering notation relates to a base-1024 scientific notation (210 = 1024), where the exponent of two must be divisible by ten. This is closely related to the base-2 floating-point representation commonly used in computer arithmetic, and the usage of IEC binary prefixes (e.g. 1B10 for 1 × 210, 1B20 for 1 × 220, 1B30 for 1 × 230, 1B40 for 1 × 240 etc.).|$|R
500|$|Since the {{question}} of 0.999... {{does not affect the}} formal development of mathematics, it can be postponed until one proves the standard theorems of real analysis. One requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written in <b>decimal</b> <b>notation,</b> consisting of an optional sign, a finite sequence of one or more digits forming an integer part, a decimal separator, and a sequence of digits forming a fractional part. For the purpose of discussing 0.999..., the integer part can be summarized as b0 and one can neglect negatives, so a decimal expansion has the form ...|$|E

50|$|He {{is known}} to have {{translated}} and modified the Zij al-Sindhind. The Zij al-Sindhind was the first astronomical table ever introduced in the Muslim World. As a mathematician Sind ibn ʿAlī was a colleague of al-Khwarizmi and worked closely with Yaqūb ibn Tāriq together they calculated the diameter of the Earth and other astronomical bodies. He also wrote a commentary on Kitāb al-ğabr wa-l-muqābala and helped prove the works of al-Khwarizmi. The <b>decimal</b> point <b>notation</b> to the Arabic numerals was introduced by Sind ibn Ali.|$|R
2500|$|Another similar {{convention}} to denote base-2 exponents {{is using a}} letter P (or p, for [...] "power"). In this notation the significand is always meant to be hexadecimal, whereas the exponent is always meant to be <b>decimal.</b> This <b>notation</b> can be produced by implementations of the printf family of functions following the C99 specification and (Single Unix Specification) IEEE Std 1003.1 POSIX standard, when using the %a or %A conversion specifiers. Starting with C++11, C++ I/O functions could parse and print the P-notation as well. Meanwhile, the notation has been fully adopted by the language standard since C++17. Apple's Swift supports it as well. It is also required by the IEEE 754-2008 binary floating-point standard. Example: 1.3DEp42 represents 1.3DEh×242.|$|R
50|$|Having been {{derived from}} the Hindu numerals, modern Khmer numerals also {{represent}} a <b>decimal</b> positional <b>notation</b> system. It is the script with the first extant material evidence of zero as a numerical figure, dating its use back to the seventh century, two centuries before its certain use in India. However, Old Khmer, or Angkorian Khmer, also possessed separate symbols for the numbers 10, 20, and 100. Each multiple of 20 or 100 would require an additional stroke over the character, so the number 47 was constructed using the 20 symbol with an additional upper stroke, followed by the symbol for number 7. This inconsistency with its decimal system suggests that spoken Angkorian Khmer used a vigesimal system.|$|R

The fourth edition contained about 12000 formulas already.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>decimal</b> <b>notation</b> the nth {{power of}} ten is written as '1' {{followed}} by n zeroes. It can also be written as 10n or as 1En in E notation. See order of magnitude and orders of magnitude (numbers) for named powers of ten. There are two conventions for naming positive powers of ten, called the long and short scales. Where a {{power of ten}} has different names in the two conventions, the long scale name is shown in brackets.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the modern decimal-based place value {{notation}} {{can be traced to}} the Aryabhatiya (c.500), which states sthānāt sthānaṁ daśaguṇaṁ syāt [...] "from place to place each is ten times the preceding."
