5|$|Luton kicked-off the final, {{and both}} sides enjoyed early spells of possession, moving the ball about briskly. Arsenal tested the Luton back four in the eighth minute, when Davis' pass went over Johnson and the ball was {{collected}} by Thomas on the right flank. Charging towards the penalty area, he was impeded by the incoming Dibble and moved near the byline, but Johnson obstructed his eventual shot at goal. Minutes later, Luton had their first chance of the match from a long free kick, taken by Tim Breacker. The ball reached the Arsenal penalty area, and goalkeeper John Lukic failed to collect it; Harford got {{his head to the}} ball, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> over the crossbar. Another Luton free kick, this time in the 13th minute, led to the opening goal. The Arsenal defence failed to clear Preece's incoming delivery, and Foster, thinking quick, managed to slip an angled pass in Brian Stein's direction. The midfielder scored – it was the second goal Arsenal had conceded in the competition.|$|E

During this time, W Division worked {{on the development of the}} hydrogen bomb. He was once again in charge of the pit crew for the Ivy Mike nuclear test on Enewetak Atoll in the Pacific, the first test of a thermonuclear device. Even the veteran Schreiber was impressed by the [...] explosion. [...] "It really filled up the sky," [...] he recalled, [...] "It was awesome. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on and on." ...|$|E
500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day {{is an exercise in}} loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is an order of magnitude worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E

500|$|Betty Driver, who {{had been}} {{performing}} since she was 8 years old, retired from acting in her late forties to run hotels in Cheshire and Derbyshire. It was here that she was spotted by one of her customers, producer of Coronation Street, Harry Kershaw, who persuaded her to audition {{for the role of}} Hilda Ogden in 1964; she eventually had to turn the role down as she was tied into an advertising contract with Procter & Gamble and they refused to release her. The part of Hilda eventually went to Jean Alexander. Driver has commented, [...] "Harry Kershaw, producer of Coronation Street, persuaded me to audition for Hilda Ogden – just think I could have been wearing curlers for 30 years." [...] In 1969, she was cast as the new character, Betty Turpin. Commenting on her casting in 1999, Driver said, [...] " [...] said, 'Betty, {{how would you like to}} pull pints for us on television?', and that was it. I suppose I expected I'd be there for perhaps a few months. But <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on and on and, well, they've never managed to get rid of me." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{song that}} Moore {{is the most}} proud of is [...] "Crystal Ball". She said about the track: [...] "I {{recorded}} it in one take and we didn’t mix it. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> straight to master. It was all about a vibe and not about perfection or being polished. I just love that song and I loved recording it." [...] She wrote the song with Billy Mann, who also aided her with the songs [...] "Stupid Girls", [...] "Dear Mr. President" [...] and [...] "I'm Not Dead" [...] (all 2006), among others.|$|E

2500|$|Thirty-eight seconds later, {{the captain}} of an Eastwind Airlines Boeing 737 {{reported}} to Boston ARTCC that he [...] "just saw an explosion out here", adding, [...] "we just saw an explosion up ahead of us here...about [...] or something like that, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> down into the water." [...] Subsequently, many air traffic control facilities in the New York/Long Island area received reports of an explosion from other pilots operating in the area. Many witnesses {{in the vicinity of}} the crash stated that they saw or heard explosions, accompanied by a large fireball or fireballs over the ocean, and observed debris, some of which was burning while falling into the water.|$|E
2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> on and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian Horntail, was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Mahal has {{performed}} his brand of blues (an African American artform) for {{a predominantly white}} audience. This has been a disappointment at times for Mahal, who recognizes {{there is a general}} lack of interest in blues music among many African Americans today. He has drawn a parallel comparison between the blues and rap music in that they both were initially black forms of music that have come to be assimilated into the mainstream of society. He is quoted as saying, [...] "Eighty-one percent of the kids listening to rap were not black kids. Once there was a tremendous amount of money involved in it... they totally moved it over to a material side. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> off to a terrible direction." [...] Mahal also believes that some people may think the blues are about wallowing in negativity and despair, a position he disagrees with. According to him, [...] "You can listen to my music from front to back, and you don't ever hear me moaning and crying about how bad you done treated me. I think that style of blues and that type of tone was something that happened as a result of many white people feeling very, very guilty about what went down." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coming {{off their}} {{loss to the}} Cardinals, the Rams stayed at home for a Monday Night fight with the current NFC North {{champion}} Chicago Bears. [...] After a scoreless first quarter, the Rams struck first with QB Marc Bulger completing a 1-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt, yet the PAT attempt had a botched snap, making it no good. [...] However, immediately following St. Louis's first score, the Bears took the lead with DB Devin Hester returning a kickoff 94 yards for a touchdown. [...] Fortunately, the Rams responded with RB Steven Jackson's 2-yard TD run, yet Chicago responded with QB Rex Grossman's 34-yard TD pass to WR Bernard Berrian. [...] St. Louis {{tried to get a}} 48-yard field goal in before halftime, yet <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>went</b> wide right. [...] In the third quarter, the Rams' recent struggles continued with RB Thomas Jones's 30-yard TD run, while Grossman completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR Muhsin Muhammad. [...] In the fourth quarter, the Bears dominance continued with RB Adrian Peterson's 1-yard TD run. [...] St. Louis tried to come back with Bulger completing a 6-yard TD pass to Holt, yet Hester immediately followed that up with a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown, which gave him the single-season record for the most returns for a touchdown with six. [...] The only thing remaining within St. Louis was Jackson's 2-yard TD run. [...] With their second-straight loss, the Rams fell to 5–8.|$|E

The latter is bad enough, sounding as it does like many voices, but there is not in it that terrible fierceness which the voice of his big cousin contains. Peter had no desire to hear it any nearer. The first time he met his cousin, Jumper the Hare, he asked him about Howler, for Jumper had come down to the Green Forest from the Great Woods where Howler lives and is feared.|$|E
