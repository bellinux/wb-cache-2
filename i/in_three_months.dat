5|$|Despite the {{unexpected}} failure of Thunderbirds Are Go on its release in December 1966, the United Artists distributors authorised a sequel, to be budgeted at £300,000.

5|$|His friend George Gray, {{himself a}} {{champion}} shooter, {{told him that}} he had reduced sniping casualties from five a week per battalion to forty-four <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> in sixty battalions; by his reckoning, this meant that Hesketh-Prichard had saved over 3,500 lives. He was promoted to major in November 1916. By this time in the war, his contributions to sniping had been such that the former German superiority in the practice had now been reversed.|$|E

40|$|To {{delineate}} endocrine mechanisms regulating equine luteal {{function and}} the possible functional differences between one <b>month</b> and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> corpora lutea of pregnancy (CL), the in vitro basal releases of prostaglandin F (PGF), prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2), progesterone, and 17 beta-estradiol by one and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL of pregnant mares were evaluated. In addition, the in vitro effects of PGF 2 alpha PGE 2, progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol on synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) and sex steroids were studied. PGF, PGE 2, and 17 beta-estradiol secretion was higher in one <b>month</b> than <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL, while progesterone was secreted similarly by both types of CL. PGE 2 treatment decreased 17 beta-estradiol in one month CL; progesterone increased PGE 2 <b>in</b> one and <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL; 17 beta-estradiol increased PGE 2 in one month CL. This study suggests that, in one month CL, PGE 2 production could be regulated by progesterone and 17 beta-estradiol, while, <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> CL, this prostaglandin seems {{to be under the}} control of progesterone alone...|$|R

5|$|Loup was one {{of eight}} {{pitchers}} in the bullpen for the Blue Jays' 2014 opening day. On April 20, Loup walked three consecutive batters {{for the first time}} in his career, and took the loss as the Blue Jays fell to the Cleveland Indians 6–4. On May 3, the Blue Jays announced that Loup would replace Sergio Santos as the team's closer until Casey Janssen returned from injury. After walking as many batters <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> as he had the entire last season, Loup regained confidence after pitching the last few innings of a game on June 4 that went from a 3–2 lead to an 8–2 win against the Detroit Tigers.|$|E

5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within {{the first three months of}} the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.|$|E
5|$|With the {{establishment}} of the Transitional National Government in 2000, a group of businessmen imported about 30 billion shillings of Canadian-printed notes, sparking a collapse of the currency and wide-scale demonstrations and protests in Mogadishu.

In August 1884, he joined the Kodokan judo dojo of his childhood friend Kano Jigoro as its nineteenth member. He advanced to first degree black belt (shodan) rank <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> fourth degree (yondan) ranking in two years, and sixth degree (rokudan) in fourteen years. He was prone to discuss the philosophy of judo with Kano, as Yamashita initially believed power should be applied before technique.|$|E

5|$|A Hero's Song was Dvořák's last orchestral {{work and}} the final of his five symphonic poems, the others being The Water Goblin, The Noon Witch, The Golden Spinning Wheel, and The Wild Dove (Opp. 107–110). It is also the last {{instance}} of him writing purely instrumental music, as he dedicated himself to vocal and operatic works after its completion. He began working on the piece on August 4, 1897, immediately after revising the third act of his opera The Jacobin. The work was completed <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> during which time Dvořák lived at his summer residence {{in his hometown of}} Příbram, and spent time at his chateau of the patron Josef Hlávka in Lužany. The piece was completed on October 25 of the same year, and was published in 1899 by Fritz Simrock in Berlin. The symphonic poem coincidentally anticipated Richard Strauss's similar tone poem Ein Heldenleben (A Hero's Life), which was composed a year later. In fact, Dvořák originally intended to title the piece A Hero's Life, a name which had been suggested to him by his pupil Vítězslav Novák.|$|E
5|$|In 1986 the GUNT {{rebelled against}} Gaddafi, {{stripping}} Libya {{of its main}} cover of legitimacy for its military presence in Chad. Seeing an occasion to unify Chad behind him, Habré ordered his forces to pass the 16th parallel so as to link with the GUNT rebels (who were fighting the Libyans in Tibesti) in December. A few weeks later a bigger force struck at Fada, destroying the local Libyan garrison. <b>In</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> combining the methods of guerilla and conventional warfare in a common strategy, Habré was able to retake almost all of northern Chad, and in the following months, inflicted new heavy defeats on the Libyans, until a ceasefire {{putting an end to}} the conflict was signed in September. The ceasefire left open the issue of the disputed Aouzou Strip, which was eventually assigned to Chad by the International Court of Justice in 1994.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Evans {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he should step up his {{swimming}} career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only four weeks of solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. <b>In</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> of training in London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E

5|$|Morrison {{initially}} returned on June 13 {{episode of}} Raw, but R-Truth attacked him again {{prior to their}} scheduled match, re-injuring him. Morrison returned again on July 25 episode of Raw, attacking R-Truth. At SummerSlam, Morrison competed in a six-man tag team match, teaming with Kofi Kingston and Rey Mysterio to defeat R-Truth, Alberto Del Rio and The Miz. The following night on Raw, Morrison defeated R-Truth in a Falls Count Anywhere match to end their feud. At Night of Champions, Morrison competed in a Fatal-4-Way match for the WWE United States Championship, also involving Alex Riley, Jack Swagger and Dolph Ziggler, with the latter of whom successfully retaining his title. Morrison then challenged Cody Rhodes for the Intercontinental Championship twice; first on the September 26 episode of Raw in a 10 man battle royal and later in a singles match at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, but lost on both occasions. Following this, Morrison went on a losing streak, lasting a number of weeks. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Morrison picked up his first victory <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months,</b> defeating United States Champion Dolph Ziggler in a non-title match. He then challenged Ziggler for the championship at Survivor Series in a losing effort.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June 2005, his 18th birthday, Messi {{signed his}} first {{contract}} {{as a senior}} team player. It made him a Barcelona player until 2010, two years less than his previous contract, but his buyout clause increased to €150million. His breakthrough came two months later, on 24 August, during the Joan Gamper Trophy, Barcelona's pre-season competition. A starter for the first time, he gave a well-received performance against Fabio Capello's Juventus, receiving an ovation from the Camp Nou. While Capello requested to loan Messi, a bid to buy him came from Inter Milan, {{who were willing to}} pay his €150 million buyout clause and triple his wages. According to then-president Joan Laporta, {{it was the only time}} the club faced a real risk of losing Messi, but he ultimately decided to stay. On 16 September, his contract was updated for the second time <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> and extended to 2014.|$|E
5|$|Sea otters {{were once}} {{numerous}} in San Francisco Bay. Historical records revealed the Russian-American Company sneaked Aleuts into San Francisco Bay multiple times, despite the Spanish capturing or shooting them while hunting sea otters in the estuaries of San Jose, San Mateo, San Bruno and around Angel Island. The founder of Fort Ross, Ivan Kuskov, finding otters scarce {{on his second}} voyage to Bodega Bay in 1812, sent a party of Aleuts to San Francisco Bay, where they met another Russian party and an American party, and caught 1,160 sea otters <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>months.</b> By 1817, sea otters in the area were practically eliminated and the Russians sought permission from the Spanish and the Mexican governments to hunt further and further south of San Francisco. Remnant sea otter populations may have survived in the bay until 1840, when the Rancho Punta de Quentin was granted to Captain John B. R. Cooper, a sea captain from Boston, by Mexican Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado along with a license to hunt sea otters, reportedly then prevalent {{at the mouth of}} Corte Madera Creek.|$|E
