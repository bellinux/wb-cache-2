5|$|A rare but {{important}} terrain feature {{found in the}} abyssal and <b>hadal</b> zones is the hydrothermal vent. In contrast to the approximately 2°C ambient water temperature at these depths, water emerges from these vents at temperatures ranging from 60°C up to as high as 464°C. Due to the high barometric pressure at these depths, water may exist in either its liquid form or as a supercritical fluid at such temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Most {{fish are}} ectothermic ("cold-blooded"), {{allowing}} their body temperatures to vary as ambient temperatures change, {{though some of}} the large active swimmers like white shark and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Fish are abundant in most bodies of water. They can be found in nearly all aquatic environments, from high mountain streams (e.g., char and gudgeon) to the abyssal and even <b>hadal</b> depths of the deepest oceans (e.g., gulpers and anglerfish). With 33,600 described species, fish exhibit greater species diversity than any other group of vertebrates.|$|E
5|$|Polychaetes occur {{throughout}} the Earth's oceans at all depths, from forms that live as plankton near the surface, to the deepest oceanic trenches. The robot ocean probe Nereus observed a 2–3cm specimen (still unclassified) of polychaete {{at the bottom}} of the Challenger Deep on 31 May 2009. There are more than 10,000 described species of polychaetes; they can be found in nearly every marine environment. Some species live in the coldest ocean temperatures of the <b>hadal</b> zone, while others can be found in the extremely hot waters adjacent to hydrothermal vents.|$|E
50|$|On Halloween night, {{scores of}} {{children}} are suddenly abducted by the long-thought-extinct <b>Hadals,</b> who brutally kill any adults attempting to intervene. The <b>Hadals</b> take the children back underground with them, leaving the United States in a panic. Due to the tensions with the Chinese, the U.S. government decides against mobilizing the military to perform a sweep of the sub-planetary Pacific region {{in search of the}} kidnapped children and the apparently-not-extinct <b>Hadals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rebecca's army discovers {{a complex}} of pyramids across a river from the city and, led by Clemens, enters it across a large bridge while Hunter's mercenaries and Rebecca herself remain behind. The {{volunteer}} army, now down to less than ninety men, discover troves of treasure and begin looting. Suddenly, they are ambushed by <b>Hadals</b> and effectively massacred - only three {{make it back to}} the city. Rebecca, Hunter, the mercenaries, and the three volunteer survivors use a building on the city's side of the bridge to fortify themselves and a siege begins, pitting the remaining humans against an unknown number of <b>Hadals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Qahukhaneh-ye Adal (قهوخانه عدال, also Romanized as Qahūkhāneh-ye <b>‘Adāl)</b> is {{a village}} in Khvajehei Rural District, Meymand District, Firuzabad County, Fars Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its {{existence}} was noted, but its population was not reported.|$|R
5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the <b>hadal</b> snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
5|$|Another unusual feature {{found in}} the abyssal and <b>hadal</b> zones is the cold seep, {{sometimes}} called a cold vent. This {{is an area of}} the seabed where seepage of hydrogen sulfide, methane and other hydrocarbon-rich fluid occurs, often {{in the form of a}} deep-sea brine pool. The first cold seeps were discovered in 1983, at a depth of 3200meters in the Gulf of Mexico. Since then, cold seeps have been discovered in many other areas of the World Ocean, including the Monterey Submarine Canyon just off Monterey Bay, California, the Sea of Japan, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, off the Atlantic coast of Africa, off the coast of Alaska, and under an ice shelf in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 31 {{described}} {{species of}} Monoplacophora (a class of mollusks) live below 2000meters. Of these 11 species, two live {{exclusively in the}} <b>hadal</b> zone. The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet {{been found in the}} Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000meters and two of them are restricted to the abyssal plain. Although genetic studies are lacking, at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living {{in a wide range of}} depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world's oceans.|$|E
50|$|Reviewers {{noted the}} novel to be a {{relatively}} rare contemporary entry in the once-common Hollow Earth subgenre, popularized by Edgar Rice Burroughs and Jules Verne. The very concrete hellish environment evoked Dante's Inferno, while the <b>hadals</b> could also {{be read as a}} homage to the Morlocks of H. G. Wells.|$|R

It has been {{revealed}} that the kidnapped children are {{the design of the}} Angel, but the Angel's plans have been co-opted by Clemens, who was once a [...] "trainee" [...] of the Angel. Ike kills many surviving <b>Hadals</b> and has been told to bring the children and the disobedient Clemens to the Angel. Clemens, however, proves to be a formidable adversary and bests Ike in hand-to-hand combat, inadvertently aided by the sniper Beckwith, who remained undetected by the <b>Hadals</b> and mistook Ike for a bad guy and assumed Clemens was a good guy, shooting Ike's hand. Clemens has the remaining girls and a traumatized and mentally unstable Rebecca (unable to cope with the loss of her daughter Samantha) with him, and tells the girls that he, Clemens, is their rescuer and that Ike is the one who mutilated him.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, on the surface, a plot emerges within Helios to {{sterilize}} the sub-planet with a potent bioweapon and thereby open it to human settlement and exploitation. At the same time, the Jesuit's scholarly organization discovers that the <b>hadals</b> {{may have a}} mysterious method of transferring human consciousness from body to body, allowing for effective immortality for a select few; after {{the members of the}} Beowulf Circle begin to be brutally murdered one-by-one, the two storylines gradually converge.|$|R
5|$|Within the abyssal and <b>hadal</b> zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of thermophilic, halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E
25|$|Evolution {{from its}} origin has {{resulted}} in a successful and diverse group: pectinids are present in the world's seas, found in environments ranging from the intertidal zone to the <b>hadal</b> depths. The Pectinidae play an extremely important role in many benthic communities and exhibit a wide range of shell shape, sizes, sculpture, and culture.|$|E
25|$|Sea urchins have conquered most sea habitats, on an {{extremely}} {{wide range of}} depths. Some species, such as Cidaris abyssicola, can live down to several thousands of meters deep. Many genera are totally indentured to the abyssal zone, such as many cidaroids, most of the genera in the Echinothuriidae family, or the strange genus Dermechinus. One of the deepest-living family is the Pourtalesiidae, strange bottle-shaped irregular sea urchins that live only in the <b>hadal</b> zone and have been collected as far as 6850 meters deep in the Java trench. Nevertheless, this makes sea urchin the class of echinoderms living the least deep, compared to sea cucumbers and crinoids that remain abundant below 8000m.|$|E
50|$|After melting invisibly {{away from}} human {{encroachment}} for several months, the <b>hadals</b> spring a trap: a massive, coordinated worldwide ambush of the armies exploring and occupying the sub-planet. The attack is enormously successful; world casualties number a full quarter-million. Though an enormous initial shock, the dismay wears off quickly and humanity is essentially undeterred; the Descent recommences, in even greater force. Cities are {{built in the}} upper crust, three miles deep, while social instability grows and interest in space exploration diminishes.|$|R
30|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{explored}} the Internet access via roadside access points for the moving vehicles. In [1], Ott and Kutscher identified {{the characteristics of the}} drive-thru network access. They show that vehicles experience three different connectivity phases while driving by an access point: the entry phase, production phase, and exit phase. During the entry phase and exit phase, the vehicles suffer from poor connectivity, while in the production phase, it maintains good connection quality. In [2], <b>Hadaller</b> et al. studied the impact of the above three phases on the TCP goodput through detailed experiments in several drive-thru network access scenarios. In [3], Bychkovsky et al. conducted experimental studies with numerous open Wi-Fi access points for vehicular Internet access in urban environments. The experiments observe that the mean connection duration is fairly short (12 to 13 s), and it requires high latency to complete the IP address acquisition. This highly affects the application layer performance. Our goal is to improve the application layer performance through the association control techniques.|$|R

500|$|The {{aphotic zone}} can be {{subdivided}} into three different vertical regions, based on depth and temperature. First is the bathyal zone, extending from {{a depth of}} 1000metres down to 3000metres, with water temperature decreasing from [...] to [...] as depth increases. Next is the abyssal zone, extending from a depth of 3000metres down to 6000metres. The final zone includes the deep oceanic trenches, and {{is known as the}} <b>hadal</b> zone. This, the deepest oceanic zone, extends from a depth of 6000metres down to approximately 11000metres. Abyssal plains are typically in the abyssal zone, at depths from 3000 to 6000metres.|$|E
500|$|CeDAMar {{scientists}} {{have demonstrated that}} some abyssal and <b>hadal</b> species have a cosmopolitan distribution. One example {{of this would be}} protozoan foraminiferans, certain species of which are distributed from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Other faunal groups, such as the polychaete worms and isopod crustaceans, appear to be endemic to certain specific plains and basins. Many apparently unique taxa of nematode worms have also been recently discovered on abyssal plains. This suggests that the very deep ocean has fostered adaptive radiations. The taxonomic composition of the nematode fauna in the abyssal Pacific is similar, but not identical to, that of the North Atlantic. A list of some of the species that have been discovered or redescribed by CeDAMar can be found [...]|$|E
2500|$|The benthic {{zones are}} aphotic and {{correspond}} to the three deepest zones of the deep-sea. The bathyal zone covers the continental slope down to about [...] The abyssal zone covers the abyssal plains between 4,000 and 6,000m. Lastly, the <b>hadal</b> zone corresponds to the hadalpelagic zone, which is found in oceanic trenches.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, a shoal of 17 <b>hadal</b> snailfish, {{a species}} of deep water snailfish, was filmed by a UK-Japan team using remote {{operated}} landers at depths of [...] in the Japan Trench in the Pacific. The fish were 30 centimetres long (12in), and were darting about, using vibration sensors on their nose to catch shrimps. [...] The team also reported that {{the appearance of the}} fish, unlike that of most deep sea fish, was surprisingly [...] "cute", and that they were surprised by how active the fish were at these depths.|$|E
2500|$|The {{seafloor}} {{was visited}} {{for the first}} time by a robotic vehicle in 2012.The most conspicuous aspect of the footage was the swarm of benthic amphipods. Some of these amphipods were collected by bait bags attached to the vehicle and were brought to the surface for further analysis. The samples recovered were Scopelocherius schellenbergi, a species of lysianassoid amphipod that have so far only been found in ultradeep trenches in the Pacific. Two invertebrate creatures were also observed in the video. One soft dark individual, estimated to be 10-20 centimeters long, has been identified by Dr. Stace E. Beaulieu of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution as a sea cucumber, tentatively assigned to genus Peniagone. The other individual, a small crustacean, is tentatively identified as a munnposid isopod, based on morphology and similar walking and jumping movements observed for other <b>hadal</b> munnopsid isopods. Because these individual were not collected, {{it is not possible to}} obtain species-level identifications. However, these sightings likely exceed the deepest known records for genus Peniagone and family Munnopsidae.|$|E
2500|$|Cold seeps were {{discovered}} in 1983 by Charles Paull and colleagues on the Florida Escarpment in the Gulf of Mexico {{at a depth of}} [...] Since then, seeps have been discovered in many other parts of the world's oceans. Most have been grouped into five biogeographic provinces: Gulf of Mexico, Atlantic, Mediterranean, East Pacific and West Pacific, but cold seeps are also known from under the ice shelf in Antarctica, the Arctic Ocean, North Sea, Skagerrak, Kattegat, Gulf of California, the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, off southern Australia and in the inland Caspian Sea. With the recent discovery of a methane seep in the Southern Ocean, cold seeps are now known in all major oceans. [...] Cold seeps are common along continental margins in areas of high primary productivity and tectonic activity, where crustal deformation and compaction drive emissions of methane rich fluid.
