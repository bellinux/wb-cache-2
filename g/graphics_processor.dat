5|$|The third-generation iPad (marketed as The new iPad, colloquially {{referred}} to as the iPad 3) is a tablet computer, developed and marketed by Apple Inc. The third device in the iPad line of tablets, it added a Retina display, the new Apple A5X chip with a quad-core <b>graphics</b> <b>processor,</b> a 5 megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and support for LTE networks in North America. It shipped with iOS 5.1, which also provides a platform for audio-visual media, including electronic books, periodicals, films, music, computer games, presentations and web content.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} seven {{versions}} of the iPad. The first generation established design precedents, some of which, such as the home button placement, have persisted through all models. The 2nd-generation iPad (iPad 2) introduced a new thinner design, a dual-core Apple A5 processor, and VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling. The third generation added a Retina Display, the new Apple A5X processor with a quad-core <b>graphics</b> <b>processor,</b> a 5-megapixel camera, HD 1080p video recording, voice dictation, and 4G (LTE). The fourth generation added the Apple A6X processor and replaced the 30-pin connector with an all-digital Lightning connector. The iPad Air added the Apple A7 processor and the Apple M7 motion coprocessor, and reduced the thickness {{for the first time}} since the iPad 2. The iPad Air 2 added the Apple A8X processor, the Apple M8 motion coprocessor, an 8-megapixel camera, and the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; and further reduced the thickness. The iPad introduced in 2017 added the Apple A9 processor, while sacrificing some of the improvements the iPad Air 2 introduced in exchange for a lower launch price.|$|E

25|$|While the Mac Mini G4 {{contained}} a separate <b>graphics</b> <b>processor,</b> all {{revisions of the}} Intel-based Mac Mini contain integrated GPUs, except in the 2011 version where the 2.5GHz model contains a separate AMD Radeon GPU. In Apple's early marketing of the Mac Mini G4, it touted {{the superiority of the}} use of a discrete ATI Radeon 9200 32MB graphics card over the integrated graphics included in many budget PCs. The Intel GMA that was built into the Mac Mini was criticized for producing stuttering video, despite supporting hardware accelerated H.264 video playback, and disappointing frame rates in graphics-intensive 3D games.|$|E
25|$|Continuing this year’s {{earlier work}} on {{graphics}} performance-related matters, Dolphin developers implemented {{a solution for}} the long-standing problem known as shader compilation stuttering. The stuttering {{is caused by the}} emulator waiting for the graphics driver to compile shaders required for new environments or objects. The solution that the so-called Ubershaders – in development since 2015 – present to the problem was to emulate the Wii’s and GameCube’s rendering pipeline by way of an interpreter running on the host system’s <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> itself until a specialized shader has been compiled and can be used for future frames, at a lower cost to performance.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Mac Mini G4, the Intel-based Mac Mini uses a dual-channel {{architecture}} for memory. The original Intel-based Mac Mini uses 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM, while models {{starting with}} the early 2009 revision use 1066MHz DDR3 SDRAM. From the 2011 revision onwards, the Mac Mini supports up to 16GB of memory. While all versions of the Mac Mini {{up to and including}} the 2012 revision supports user upgradeable memory after purchase, the current model does not, because the memory is soldered to the logic board. Since the integrated <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> does not have its own dedicated memory, the system shares some of the main system memory with it.|$|E

25|$|The console has custom {{components}} codeveloped by the Nintendo Research & Engineering Department {{and other}} manufacturers, all combined into a unified system on chip. The main processor (CPU) is a ARM11 MPCore-based dual-core processor manufactured at 45nm. One processor core {{is dedicated to}} games and applications, while the other core is exclusive to the operating system, enabling multitasking and background tasks. These tasks are handled seamlessly in the background during gameplay or while the system is in sleep mode. The system also contains a single-core ARM9 processor, enabling backward compatibility with Nintendo DS games. The <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> (GPU) is developed by Digital Media Professionals, and consists of a semi-custom PICA200 processor.|$|E
25|$|Pre-2009 Mac Mini models had a video {{connector}} {{which was}} compatible with DVI, HDMI (video only), SVGA, S-Video and composite video {{with the appropriate}} adapter. Sound is provided by a combination jack that uses both mini-headphone (analog) and optical fiber cables (digital). Unlike the Apple TV, the Mac Mini is backward compatible with televisions that have only composite or S-Video inputs. As of the July 2011 revision of the Mac Mini, the computer sports an Intel HD3000 <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> with an optional Radeon graphics processing unit available and Thunderbolt which makes decoding high-resolution video much quicker and efficient. The addition of an HDMI port simplifies connecting the Mini to high-definition televisions and home theater AV receivers.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in {{computing}} technology keep {{increasing the}} rate at which guessed passwords can be tested. For example, in 2010, the Georgia Tech Research Institute developed a method of using GPGPU to crack passwords much faster. Elcomsoft invented the usage of common graphic cards for quicker password recovery in August 2007 and soon filed a corresponding patent in the US. As of 2011, commercial products are available that claim the ability to test up to 112,000 passwords per second on a standard desktop computer using a high-end <b>graphics</b> <b>processor.</b> Such a device will crack a 6 letter single-case password in one day. Note that the work can be distributed over many computers for an additional speedup proportional to the number of available computers with comparable GPUs. Special key stretching hashes are available that take a relatively long time to compute, reducing {{the rate at}} which guessing can take place. Although it is considered best practice to use key stretching, many common systems do not.|$|E

500|$|NeXT {{released}} a {{second generation of}} workstations in 1990.

Jobs was explicit in ensuring NeXT staff {{did not use the}} latter terminology, lest the NeXT machines be compared to competing Sun workstations. The magneto-optical drive was replaced with a 2.88 MB floppy drive to offer users a way to use their floppy disks. However, individual 2.88 MB floppies were expensive and the technology did not supplant the 1.44 MB floppy. Realizing this, NeXT utilized the CD-ROM drive, which eventually became an industry standard for storage. Color graphics were available on the NeXTstation Color and the NeXTdimension <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> hardware for the NeXTcube. The new computers were cheaper and faster than their predecessors, with the new Motorola 68040 processor.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1995, reports {{surfaced}} that Sega would collaborate with Lockheed Martin, The 3DO Company, Matsushita, or Alliance Semiconductor {{to create a}} new graphics processing unit, which conflicting accounts said would be used for a 64-bit [...] "Saturn 2" [...] or an add-on peripheral. Development of the Dreamcast was wholly unrelated to this rumored project. In light of the Saturn's poor market performance, Irimajiri decided to start looking outside of the company's internal hardware development division {{to create a new}} console. In 1997, Irimajiri enlisted the services of [...] IBM's Tatsuo Yamamoto to lead an 11-man team to work on a secret hardware project in the United States, which was referred to as [...] "Blackbelt". Accounts vary on how an internal team led by Hideki Sato also began development on Dreamcast hardware; one account specifies that Sega of Japan tasked both teams, while another suggests that Sato was bothered by Irimajiri's choice to begin development externally and chose to have his hardware team begin development. Sato and his group chose the Hitachi SH-4 processor architecture and the VideoLogic PowerVR2 <b>graphics</b> <b>processor,</b> manufactured by NEC, in the production of their mainboard. Initially known as [...] "Whitebelt", this project was later codenamed [...] "Dural", after the metallic female fighter from Sega's Virtua Fighter series.|$|E
500|$|The idea {{to develop}} Final Fantasy XI as an online game was {{conceived}} by Hironobu Sakaguchi when establishing Square Pictures headquarters in Hawaii. Impressed by western MMORPGs that he discovered there, such as EverQuest, Sakaguchi convinced Square {{to begin the}} development of their own MMORPG and suggested that it be based on the Final Fantasy series. The team responsible for Chrono Cross was assigned to the development of Final Fantasy XI after the English localization of the former title. Development began in November 1999. The game was the first developed under Square's new philosophy to develop for [...] "all platforms and media". Hiromichi Tanaka, the producer of the game, has stated Final Fantasy XI is heavily influenced by Final Fantasy III, especially in its battle and magic systems. According to Tanaka, Square put in Final Fantasy XI what they could not put in the first Final Fantasy titles due to technical limitations, thus making Final Fantasy XI the [...] "most [...] Final Fantasy of all the episodes". The game was developed and ran on the Nvidia GeForce 4 Ti GPU, which the President of Square Yoichi Wada described as the most powerful <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> available at the time. The game cost two to three billion yen (~$17–25million) to create along with the PlayOnline Network Service and was assumed to become profitable over a five-year timespan. By creating a unified game world instead of different ones balkanized by language, development costs were cut 66%. Since recurring monsters of the series are known by different names in the Japanese and English versions of the other installments, it was decided for Final Fantasy XI to use both Japanese and English names for different varieties of the same monsters.|$|E
500|$|According to Miyamoto, Pilotwings 64 was {{designed}} to allow gamers to experience free flight in realistic 3D environments on the Nintendo 64. Prior to the game's conception, Paradigm had worked on military vehicle and flight simulators, but not video games. Dave Gatchel of Paradigm disclosed that with regard to creating the game, they began with a [...] "physics-based approach", but deviated from this {{in order to gain}} a balance between accuracy and fun for players. He indicated that there was never an issue as to whether Pilotwings 64 should be more of an arcade game or a simulation, as their goal was to [...] "always have a more arcade feel". The technical team studied the original Pilotwings extensively during development. Pilotwings on the SNES makes use {{of the power of the}} 16-bit console, principally its Mode 7 capability. Similarly, Pilotwings 64 prominently demonstrates the graphical features of its own console. Gatchel suggested that just as design elements present in the game generated its production requirements, these same elements were influenced by the Nintendo 64's technology during development. The large islands within the game were created using Paradigm's own 3D development tool Vega UltraVision. Navigation of these environments is relatively smooth thanks to Pilotwings 64 taking advantage of several key Nintendo 64 hardware features. Conventional level of detail and mipmapping were used to reduce the computational load of distant landscape objects and terrains when they were rendered. The processes respectively substitute simpler geometrical shapes for more complex ones and less detailed textures for more detailed ones, lowering the polygon count and 3D rendering time for a given frame and thus putting less demand on the geometric engine. Pilotwings 64 also applies z-buffering, which keeps track of an object's depth and tells the <b>graphics</b> <b>processor</b> which portions of the object to render and which to hide. This, along with texture filtering and anti-aliasing, makes the object appear solid and smooth along its edges rather than pixelated.|$|E
