40|$|The {{requirements}} of RF acceleration in the SLC Linac to produce high energy beams are {{complicated by the}} presence of small transverse RF beam deflections which arise from several sources. These RF deflections place stringent tolerances on the phase and amplitude atability of the klystrons. They also force the use of special magnetic bumps to correct the trajectories of oppositely charged beams that will pass down the linac. If left unabated, RF deflections can liiit the performance of the SLC. There are several methods to reduce the deflections. Many measurements of RF defiections {{have been made in the}} low energy part of the iinac where the beams are most sensitive. TOLERANCES ON RF BEAM DEFLECTIONS The SLC linac must accelerate both electrons and positrons. Both beams are injected from their respective damping rings at 1. 21 GeV and ultimately reach 50 GeV. The transverse emittances of these beams are quite small and must be maintained. Trajectory errors in the linac will cause the beams to exhibit betatron oscillations in the FODO lattice of the linac, excite transverse wakefields, and enlarge their emittances. Static trajectory errors can be corrected by DC dipole magnets. However, studies 1 g 2 have shown that pulse-topulse fluctuations in the launching conditions or steering early in the linac must be kept below 13 pm or 0. 3 prad (/? = 42 m). These jitter tolerances relax as the beam energy increases. Small radial asymmetries in the RF fields in an accelerator will deflect beams transversely. The effects of these fields can be observed as beam trajectory errors downstream of an accelerator section driven by a klystron. An example is shown in Fig. 1. In the SLC, both electrons and positrons are deflected in the same direction. Special static magnetic bumps are used to compensate for these deiiections. Fluctuations in the RF power or phase will cause trajectory errors which cannot be corrected. Using the tolerances stated above and the fact that klystron ph&e and amplitude jitters can be kept below 0. 5 degrees and l%, respectively, RF deflections must be kept below 50 keV/c per klystron immediately downstream of the <b>damp</b> <b>ing</b> ring!?, i. e., the RF fields must be aligned to one part in five thousand...|$|R
40|$|Please {{note that}} only this summary is in english. The {{rest of the}} report is in dutch only. This paper deals with the wave {{propagation}} of harmonic travelling waves through an incompressible, Newtonian fluid contained within an elastic tube with homogeneous and isotropic wall material. In particular the next questions are considered: 1) What {{is the difference between}} the one-dimensional and the two-dimensional blood flow approach? 2) Is it possible to derive an expression for the wave velocity c without making important restrictions as a thin or an incrompessible wall? 3) What is the influence of vascular tethering on blood flow and wave propagation? After a historical review and some physiological aspects, an one-dimensional approach is considered. The equations for (axisymmetric) long waves are derived and linearized. From these equations the expressions for the wave velocity c, the phase velocity c_p, the <b>damping</b> number <b>d</b> and the longitudinal impedance per length Z_l are realised. In the next part of this paper, a two-dimensional flow is considered. The motion of the fluid is described by the linearized form of the Navier-Stoker equations. The motion of the wall is described by the equations of classical elasticity theory, the equations of Navier. Boundary conditions are used describing the continuity of stress and velocity components in the fluid and the tube. From these boundary conditions a set of six simultaneous equations in six unknown constants has been obtained. Because {{it is not possible to}} solve the set of six equations, asymptotic methods have been introduced. Furthermore, one boundary condition is strongly dependent on the tethering of the blood vessels to the surrounding tissues. Therefore two cases are considered. In the first case the longitudinal constraint of the blood vessels is very strong, the second case deals with the study of a freely moving tube. For both cases expressions are realised for the wave velocity c, the phase velocity c_p, the <b>damping</b> number <b>d</b> and the longitudinal impedance per length Z_l are compared with each other and with the one-dimensional approach. The next conclusions follow from this work: 1) It is not possible to describe quite satisfactory blood flow and wave propagation in blood vessels with an one-dimensional harmonic theory. 2) The influence of vascular tethering on blood flow and wave propagation is rather small. 3) The longitudinally constrained blood vessel conception approaches reality much better than the freely moving conception.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical investigation on the seismic {{performance of a}} benchmark bridge with different optimal isolation systems under near fault ground motion. Usually, very large displacements make seismic isolation an unfeasible solution due to boundary conditions, especially in case of existing bridges or high risk seismic regions.

The work is aimed at analyzing the seismic performance of a three-span continuous bridge designed with different isolation systems having different levels of damping. The case study was analyzed in different configurations including: (a) simply supported, (b) isolated with lead rubber bearings (LRBs), (c) isolated with rubber isolators and 10 % classical <b>damping</b> (HDLRBs), and (<b>d)</b> isolated with rubber isolators and 70 % supplemental <b>damping</b> ratio.

We investigate PR {{as a function of the}} <b>damping</b> factor <b>d</b> on a network obtained from a domain of the World Wide Web, finding that rank-reversal happens frequently over a broad range of PR (and of d).

Rank-reversal is also observed by measuring the Spearman and Kendall rank correlation, which evaluate relative ranks rather than absolute PR. Rank-reversal happens not only in directed networks containing rank-sinks but also in a single strongly connected component, which by definition does not contain any sinks.

Methods. In the flush-pulse method, the opened fast-flush valve of the CMS is closed; as a result, the fluid column in the CMS is impacted. This procedure can be done without affecting the net flow of infusion fluid. We validated the method in laboratory conditions by comparing 14 paired results obtained with this method to the results obtained using a generally accepted step-response method. The measurable values are the resonance frequency (fr) and the <b>damping</b> coefficient (<b>d).</b> The analysis of the flush-pulse method in situ is complicated by the patient's blood pressure wave. A remedy for this problem that is based on the first derivative of the pressure signal has been developed. The flush-pulse method is applied 14 times in situ. Results. In laboratory settings, the fr ranged from 12. 5 to 64. 0 Hz and d ranged from 0. 14 to 0. 32. The correlation coefficient was 0. 99 for fr and 0. 91 for d. We found four overdamped systems in situ (d 2 ̆ 6 gt; 1). In other systems fr values between 8. 5 and 41. 0 Hz and d values between 0. 16 and 0. 72 were observed.

40|$|Abstract: Recently, a {{new power}} split hybrid {{electric}} vehicle drive train has been developed by the Corporate Research and Development Department of the Robert Bosch Company. The new drive train differs from a conventional one in many respects. In this paper we investigate how these differences affect the vibrational behavior of the drive line. With {{the aid of a}} linear mechanical model, a modal analysis is performed and the effect of the control of the drive train on the eigenvibrations is studied. The analysis reveals, for example, a shuffle behavior, which can also be observed in vehicles with conventional drive train. The constant of the I part of the controller influences the vibrational behavior in quite a complex way. Starting from zero and steadily increasing the control parameter, one of the modes undergoes three metamorphoses. On the basis of this fundamental understanding, two strategies for the optimization of the drive line vibrational behavior are proposed. Furthermore, the simple mechanical model is refined with regard to various aspects. For example, tire slip is taken into account and a two-track model capturing asymmetric vibrations of the two axle shafts or wheels is considered.

We combined 4 months of acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) data with sea-level, temperature, and wind time series to analyze the dynamics of low-frequency (periods >  1  day) internal oscillations in the fjord. Additionally, seasonal conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) data from 19 along-fjord stations were used to characterize the seasonality of the density field. The density profiles were used to estimate the internal long-wave phase speed (c) using two approximations: (1)  a simple reduced gravity model (RGM) and (2)  a continuously stratified model (CSM). No major seasonal changes in c were observed using either approximation (e. g., the CSM yielded 0. 73  <  c  <  0. 87  m s − 1 for mode 1).

To assess its ability to predict halo correlations on large scales, we compare its results with those of an N-body simulation of a 3 h- 1 Gpc box sampled with 20483 particles taken from the MICE suite, matching the same seeds for the initial conditions. Thanks to the Fastest Fourier Transforms in the West (FFTW) libraries and to the relatively simple design, the code shows very good scaling properties. The CPU time required by PINOCCHIO is a tiny fraction (˜ 1 / 2000) of that required by the MICE simulation. Varying some of PINOCCHIO numerical parameters allows one to produce a universal mass function that lies in the range allowed by published fits, although it underestimates the MICE mass function of Friends-of-Friends (FoF) haloes in the high-mass tail. We compare the matter-halo and the halo-halo power spectra {{with those of the}} MICE simulation and find that these two-point statistics are well recovered on large scales. In particular, when catalogues are matched in number density, agreement within 10 per cent is achieved for the halo power spectrum. At scales k > 0. 1 h Mpc- 1, the inaccuracy of the Zel'dovich approximation in locating halo positions causes an underestimate of the power spectrum that can be modelled as a Gaussian factor with a <b>damping</b> scale of <b>d</b> = 3 h- 1 Mpc at z = 0, decreasing at higher redshift.

The changes in dynamic-mechanical properties occurring during the ultra-violet light accelerated weathering of these polymers were followed by a visco-elastometric technique (Rheovibron) in the solid phase over a wide temperature range. Selective cross-linking of the polybutadiene in high-impact polystyrene caused the depression of the low temperature <b>damping</b> peak (tan <b>d)</b> with a corresponding sharp peak in tan d at ambient temperature accompanied by an integral rise in complex modulus. During the same period of photoxidation, the hydroperoxide concentration and gel content increased rapidly, reaching a maximum before decomposing photolytically with the destruction of unsaturation and with the formation of stable oxidation products. Infra-red spectroscopy showed the formation of carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. a,ß-unsaturated carbonyl was also identified and was formed by decomposition of both allylic hydroperoxide and initial peroxidic gel by ß-scission of the graft between polybutadiene and polystyrene. With further photoxidation a more stable ether gel was formed involving the destruction of the conjugating double bond of a,ß-unsaturated carbonyl. Addition of saturated and unsaturated ketones which are potential sensitisers of photoxidation to high-impact polystyrene and polybutadiene failed to photo-initiate the oxygen absorption of the polymers. A prior thermal oxidative treatment on the other hand eliminated the auto- accelerating stage leading to linear kinetics as the concentration of thermally-produced hydroperoxide approached a maximum. Antioxidants which act by destroying hydroperoxide lengthened the induction period to rapid oxygen absorption, whilst a phenolic antioxidant behaved as a weak photo-activator initially and a retarder later. Prior photolysis of high-impact polystyrene photo-activated the unsaturated component and caused similar changes in dynamic-mechanical properties to those found during photoxidation although at a much lower rate.
