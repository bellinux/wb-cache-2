In order to {{shed some light on}} the contradiction between a widely accepted decrease in work life stability and empirical findings that do not confirm such a decline, we contrast "objective" evidence from occupational trajectories with "subjective" evidence on various dimensions of perceived continuity and discontinuity of job histories. We use the West German part of the German Life History Study for a survival analysis of occupational mobility for cohorts born between 1929 and 1971. Here, using a new concept, we distinguish between <b>direct</b> <b>mobility</b> and indirect mobility which is defined as an occupational change that happens after an employment interruption. In addition, we analyze a new German cross-sectional data set from 2005 on retrospective career perceptions. We employ multinomial regression models to understand whether younger individuals report more unwanted occupational mobility and employment interruptions than older individuals. Our findings indicate that direct occupational mobility has neither increased across cohorts nor has it surged upward for the most recent cohorts, but that there has been an increase in indirect occupational mobility. Furthermore, while there is no higher incidence of unwanted occupational mobility in younger age groups, we find mixed evidence regarding the increased occurrence of unwanted career interruptions in younger age groups. Finally, the desire to experience occupational and firm changes has grown for younger age groups...|$|E

40|$|AbstractPrevious study {{demonstrated}} that WASP localizes on vesicles during Dictyostelium chemotaxis and these vesicles {{appear to be}} preferentially distributed at the leading and trailing edge of migrating cells. In this study, we have examined the role of PCH family proteins, Nwk/Bzz 1 p-like protein (NLP) and Syndapin-like protein (SLP), in the regulation of the formation and trafficking of WASP-vesicles during chemotaxis. NLP and SLP appear to be functionally redundant and deletion of both nlp and slp genes causes the loss of polarized F-actin organization and significant defects in chemotaxis. WASP and NLP are colocalized on vesicles and interactions between two molecules via the SH 3 domain of NLP/SLP and the proline-rich repeats of WASP are required for vesicle formation from Golgi. Microtubules are required for polarized trafficking of these vesicles as vesicles showing high <b>directed</b> <b>mobility</b> are absent in cells treated with nocodazole. Our results suggest that interaction of WASP with NLP/SLP {{is required for the}} formation and trafficking of vesicles from Golgi to the membrane, which might {{play a central role in}} the establishment of cell polarity during chemotaxis...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} {{problem in}} mobile ad-hoc {{wireless sensor networks}} is the localization of individual nodes, i. e., each node’s awareness of its position relative to the network. In this paper, we introduce a variant of this problem (directional localization) where each node {{must be aware of}} both its position and orientation relative to the network. This variant is especially relevant for the applications in which mobile nodes in a sensor network are required to move in a collaborative manner. Using global positioning systems for localization in large scale sensor networks is not cost effective and may be impractical in enclosed spaces. On the other hand, a set of pre-existing anchors with globally known positions may not always be available. To address these issues, in this work we propose an algorithm for directional node localization based on relative motion of neighboring nodes in an ad-hoc sensor network without an infrastructure of global positioning systems (GPS), anchor points, or even mobile seeds with known locations. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that our algorithm scales well for large numbers of nodes and provides convergent localization over time, even with errors introduced by motion actuators and distance measurements. Furthermore, based on our localization algorithm, we introduce mechanisms to preserve network formation during <b>directed</b> <b>mobility</b> in mobile sensor networks. Our simulations confirm that, in a number of realistic scenarios, our algorithm provides for a mobile sensor network that is stable over time irrespective of speed, while using only constant storage per neighbor...|$|R

Indeed, optimizing passengers and goods flows in the urban area while reducing the externalities linked to <b>direct</b> <b>mobility's</b> improvements, {{become more and more}} stressing. Goods transport, long excluded from the city's problems, seems now attract renewed interest both from the traditional players such as institutional or professionals of road transport, but also from the new players such as operators of public transport. Some operators are wondering whether or not to enter further into this issue: design and manage combined urban transport solutions, which allow a smooth sharing of passengers and goods could be a real opportunity to extend their services. Unfortunately, not much is known concerning how these innovative solutions can be integrated into companies' strategy, and examples of involvement of public transport operators in urban goods transport and urban logistics are still few. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore this issue. At first, the concept of combined passengers/goods urban transport is defined and existing solutions are described, carried out on an international survey. Than, experiences of European operators involved in combined passengers/goods urban transport solutions are analysed. From this framework, the paper discusses the conditions and economic factors that may make such solutions an interesting alternative to traditional urban transport services' production.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{mobility}} and accessibility effects of business-to-consumer (b 2 c) e-commerce {{by means of}} a literature review. The main questions are how b 2 c e-commerce affects (a) individual activity patterns and travel behaviour, (b) the freight transport and logistic decisions of firms, and (c) the location decisions of households and firms. The review shows that the <b>direct</b> (short-term) <b>mobility</b> effects of b 2 c e-commerce are relatively clear, and that an overall increase in both individual travel and freight transport can be expected. The indirect (long-term) changes for physical accessibility and mobility, however, are less clear and harder to deal with, due to the complex relationships, time lags, data problems and methodological (attribution) problems. Still, it appears that processes of decentralisation and sub-urbanisation of distribution systems for b 2 c e-commerce may gradually extend and shift, respectively, towards more remote and less densely populated areas in the Netherlands. This would reinforce the ongoing process of retail store closures in these areas, i. e., the spatial redistribution in retailing facilities, thus limiting physical accessibility.

In fact, if a node visits {{a great number of}} different locations in a short time, it is likely to meet many others. Although this is true to some extent, there are plenty of scenarios where the concentration of users is not constant in space (e.g., the union of a city center with its suburbs).

For this reason, {{in order to maintain the}} overall idea detached to any specific environment, we chose not to include any <b>direct</b> information regarding <b>mobility</b> patterns in the sociability indicator. An important advantage of this approach is that no information on nodes position is ever required (see Section 2.2).|$|R

The aim {{of the study was}} to obtain insight in a) long-term changes in functional capacities; b) disability and the perceived problems; and c) the sort of help needed. Methods. Fifty stroke patients (mean age 63 years) treated between January 1986 and October 1990, were visited at home by a physician. Four functional measurements were used; the newly developed Rehabilitation Activities Profile, the Barthel Index, a four-item (Barthel Index) subscore (B 4), and the Frenchay Activities Index. Results. There was some disability in communication, but in this group much help was needed concerning mobility. The majority was independent in personal care, but frequently needed help with household activities. Most patients experienced disabilities with occupational and leisure activities and many problems were encountered in relations. Basic functional items (B 4) did not seem to have changed. The majority of the patients (82 %) was living at home, but a considerable part was depending on home care (40 %), physical therapy (26 %), home adjustments (50 %) and/or appliances (50 %).

40|$|Abstract Flagella and invasin play {{important}} roles {{during the early}} stages of infection by the enteric pathogen Yersinia enterocolitica. Our previous study demonstrated that OmpR negatively regulates invasin gene expression at the transcriptional level. The present study focused on the role of OmpR in the regulation of flagella expression. Motility assays and microscopic observations revealed that an ompR mutant strain exhibits a non-motile phenotype {{due to the lack of}} flagella. An analysis of flhDC::lacZYA chromosomal fusions demonstrated a decrease in flhDC expression in ompR mutant cells, suggesting a role for OmpR in the positive control of flagellar master operon flhDC, which is in contrast to the negative role it plays in Escherichia coli. Moreover, high temperature or osmolarity and low pH decreased flhDC expression and OmpR was not required for the response to these factors. Evidence from an examination of the DNA binding properties of OmpR in vitro indicated that the mechanism by which OmpR regulates flhDC is <b>direct.</b> Electrophoretic <b>mobility</b> shift assays confirmed that OmpR binds specifically to the flhDC promoter region and suggested the presence of more than one OmpR-binding site. In addition, phosphorylation of OmpR by acetyl-P appeared to stimulate the binding abilities of OmpR. Together with the results of our previous studies revealing the negative role of OmpR in the regulation of invasin expression, these findings support a model in which invasion and motility might be reciprocally regulated by OmpR...|$|R
