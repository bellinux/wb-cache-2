5|$|A {{traditional}} Korean bow, or gakgung, is a {{small but}} very <b>efficient</b> horn-bamboo-sinew composite bow. Korean archers normally practice at a range of approximately 145 metres.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power <b>efficient</b> than its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy <b>efficient</b> as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy <b>efficient</b> as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E
5|$|Behemoth {{has a high}} {{throughput}} {{and will}} accommodate approximately 1,545 passengers an hour, {{making it one of}} the most <b>efficient</b> roller coasters in the park.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as <b>efficient</b> as predicted. Urey suggested that a more <b>efficient</b> but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|Energy <b>efficient</b> and {{sustainability}} features designed {{into the project}} led to a LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Elements {{that led to this}} include landscaping that reduces runoff from rainwater, lots of natural light, a more <b>efficient</b> HVAC system that is located under the floors, and a location near public transit. Landscaping includes using drought resistant native species to reduce the need for irrigation. The floor-based HVAC system is more energy <b>efficient</b> and helps keep the temperature of the entire building more even and uses radiant heating and cooling. Additionally, the construction used environmentally friendly sealants, carpets, paints, and adhesives as well as preventing 90% of the construction waste from entering landfills. Also, potable water usage is reduced by 40% due to the use of low-flow sinks, showers, and toilets. The contractor also recycled 90% of the materials from the building that previously occupied the site.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts's {{electricity}} generation market was made competitive in 1998, enabling retail customers to change suppliers without changing utility companies. In 2012, Massachusetts consumed 1374.4 trillion BTU, {{making it the}} fifth-lowest state in terms of consumption of energy per capita, and 63% of that energy came from natural gas. In 2014 and 2015, Massachusetts was ranked as the most energy <b>efficient</b> state the United States while Boston is the most <b>efficient</b> city, but it had the third-highest electricity prices of any state.|$|E
5|$|More <b>efficient</b> {{weapons would}} require less <b>efficient</b> initiators. This meant that less {{polonium}} would be required. At {{the time of}} Sandstone, the national stockpile of polonium-beryllium initiators consisted of 50 A-Class initiators, with more than 25 curies of polonium, and 13 B-Class initiators with 12 to 25 curies. During Sandstone, at least one test would be conducted with a B-Class initiator.|$|E

5|$|The {{ytterbium}} +3 ion {{is used as}} a {{doping material}} in active laser media, specifically in solid state lasers and double clad fiber lasers. Ytterbium lasers are highly <b>efficient,</b> have long lifetimes and can generate short pulses; ytterbium can also easily be incorporated into the material used to make the laser. Ytterbium lasers commonly radiate in the 1.06–1.12µm band being optically pumped at wavelength 900nm–1µm, dependently on the host and application. The small quantum defect makes ytterbium a prospective dopant for <b>efficient</b> lasers and power scaling.|$|E
5|$|Weber listed several {{preconditions}} for {{the emergence}} of the bureaucracy: The growth in space and population being administered, the growth in complexity of the administrative tasks being carried out and the existence of a monetary economy– these resulted in a need for a more <b>efficient</b> administrative system. Development of communication and transportation technologies made more <b>efficient</b> administration possible (and popularly requested) and democratisation and rationalisation of culture resulted in demands that the new system treat everybody equally.|$|E

25|$|Electric motors {{were several}} times more <b>efficient</b> than small steam engines because central station {{generation}} was more <b>efficient</b> than small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses.|$|E
25|$|Tshilidzi Marwala {{surmised that}} {{artificial}} intelligence influences {{the applicability of}} the theory of the <b>efficient</b> market hypothesis in that the more artificial intelligence infused computer traders there are in the markets as traders the more <b>efficient</b> the markets become.|$|E
25|$|A {{proof that}} P = NP could have {{stunning}} practical consequences if the proof leads to <b>efficient</b> methods for solving {{some of the}} important problems in NP. It {{is also possible that}} a proof would not lead directly to <b>efficient</b> methods, perhaps if the proof is non-constructive, or the size of the bounding polynomial is too big to be <b>efficient</b> in practice. The consequences, both positive and negative, arise since various NP-complete problems are fundamental in many fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome is}} never Pareto <b>efficient.</b>|$|E
25|$|Stand-alone BLAT is more {{suitable}} for batch runs, and more <b>efficient</b> than the web-based BLAT. It is more <b>efficient</b> because {{it is able to}} store the genome in memory, unlike the web-based application which only stores the index in memory.|$|E
25|$|The Box–Muller {{transform}} {{was developed}} as a more computationally <b>efficient</b> alternative to the inverse transform sampling method. The Ziggurat algorithm gives an even more <b>efficient</b> method. Furthermore, the Box–Muller transform can be employed for drawing from truncated bivariate Gaussian densities.|$|E
25|$|It is {{necessary}} for hemoglobin to release the oxygen that it binds; if not, {{there is no point}} in binding it. The sigmoidal curve of hemoglobin makes it <b>efficient</b> in binding (taking up O2 in lungs), and <b>efficient</b> in unloading (unloading O2 in tissues).|$|E
25|$|The {{full-duplex}} capability makes SPI {{very simple}} and <b>efficient</b> for single master/single slave applications. Some devices use the full-duplex mode to implement an <b>efficient,</b> swift data stream for {{applications such as}} digital audio, digital signal processing, or telecommunications channels, but most off-the-shelf chips stick to half-duplex request/response protocols.|$|E
25|$|Clasps could {{initially}} {{be awarded}} to holders of the medal {{upon completion of}} eighteen and twenty-four years of <b>efficient</b> service. This was amended on 26 August 1944 to authorise the award of additional clasps for each additional completed period of six years of <b>efficient</b> service after twenty-four years.|$|E
25|$|<b>Efficient</b> mining. The {{extraction}} process of thorium from the earth's crust {{is a much}} safer and <b>efficient</b> mining method than that of uranium. Thorium’s ore, monazite, generally contains higher concentrations of thorium than the percentage of uranium found in its respective ore. This makes thorium a more cost <b>efficient</b> and less environmentally damaging fuel source. Thorium mining is also easier and less dangerous than uranium mining, as the mine is an open pit, which doesn't require ventilation such as the underground uranium mines, where radon levels are potentially harmful.|$|E

25|$|However, Laplace {{expansion}} is <b>efficient</b> for small matrices only.|$|E
25|$|L-estimators {{are often}} much more robust than maximally <b>efficient</b> {{conventional}} methods – the median is maximally statistically resistant, having a 50% breakdown point, and the X% trimmed mid-range has an X% breakdown point, while the sample mean (which is maximally <b>efficient)</b> is minimally robust, breaking {{down for a}} single outlier.|$|E
