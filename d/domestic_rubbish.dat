5|$|The Mycenaean {{period has}} not yielded {{sculpture}} of any great size. The statuary {{of the period}} consists {{for the most part}} of small terracotta figurines found at almost every Mycenaean site in mainland Greece—in tombs, in settlement debris, and occasionally in cult contexts (Tiryns, Agios Konstantinos on Methana). The majority of these figurines are female and anthropomorphic or zoomorphic. The female figurines can be subdivided into three groups which were popular at different periods: the earliest are the Phi-type, which look like the Greek letter phi and their arms give the upper body of the figurine a rounded shape. The Psi-type looks like the letter Greek psi: these have outstretched upraised arms. The latest (12th century BC) are the Tau-type: these figurines look like the Greek letter tau with folded(?) arms at right angles to the body. Most figurines wear a large 'polos' hat. They are painted with stripes or zigzags {{in the same manner as}} the contemporary pottery and presumably made by the same potters. Their purpose is uncertain, but they may have served as both votive objects and toys: some are found in children's graves but the vast majority of fragments are from <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> deposits. The presence of many of these figurines on sites where worship took place in the Archaic and Classical periods (approximately 200 below the sanctuary of Athena at Delphi, others at the temple of Aphaea on Aegina, at the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas above Epidauros and at Amyklae near Sparta), suggests both that many were indeed religious in nature, perhaps as votives, but also that later places of worship may well have first been used in the Mycenaean period.|$|E
2500|$|At Capels Mill, {{the bed of}} {{the canal}} was used as the route for the Stroud Bypass in the 1980s, and so a {{diversion}} had to be built at this point. It passes through an area which was used as a landfill site in the 1960s and 1970s. Some [...] of new channel was constructed, some of it edged with sheet piling. After passing through a railway viaduct, the bank is supported by a series of contiguous concrete piles, which were drilled to a depth of between [...] and [...] and provide a retaining wall which is [...] tall at its highest point. As the project neared completion, open days to allow the public to walk along the bottom of the new canal section were held on 10 and 11 May 2013, and were attended by over 1,800 people. Where <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> had to be removed, it was relocated on the site, covered with [...] of crushed recycled concrete and a layer of Bentomat geotextile, which was topped by subsoil and topsoil obtained from elsewhere on the site. Tubular vents allow any methane produced by the disturbed rubbish to escape safely. The new section was filled with water and officially completed on 2 June 2013.|$|E

In this research is done using studies sludge become compost. Sludge mixed with <b>rubbish</b> organic <b>domestic</b> waste, waste of onion 2 ̆ 7 s skin and fried onions waste. This study used activator EM 4 and activator from activated sludge to optimize the composting process. The result showed that compost with activator EM 4 likely matured faster because had the lower C/N ratio.

50|$|In the UK {{the term}} {{is also used to}} {{describe}} dishonest tradesmen such as double-glazing salesmen, second-hand car dealers, gas fitters, mechanics, roofers, plumbers and <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> collectors. A BBC Television programme exposing such practices was called Watchdog, which was later followed by Rogue Traders.|$|E
50|$|After {{the closure}} of the Lewes and East Grinstead Line south from East Grinstead in 1958, the track on the viaduct {{remained}} in place to allow the stabling of carriages. Imberhorne cutting located south of the viaduct was designated as a <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> dump, and infilled with waste during the 1970s. After various local residents requested the demolition of the decaying viaduct, the structure was listed from 15 September 1988.|$|E
50|$|The Anglican Church remains {{comprise}} a rectangular concrete pad with entry steps. The slightly elevated north-east {{end of this}} pad (originally holding the altar) has a small rectangular CGI shed constructed after the lazaret occupation. Immediately adjacent to the church pad is a platform floor made from concrete pavers. More recent <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> and materials scattered about the site suggest the paved platform is {{the location of a}} post-lazaret occupation camp site.|$|E
5000|$|The {{district}} is second-level in local government, responsible for {{town and country planning}} and <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> and recycling collections, for example. There are 55 {{members of the}} Council, representing 35 wards. The towns have more than one ward: Crowborough has five; Hailsham, three; Heathfield, two; Polegate, two; and Uckfield, four. The ward boundaries are regularly redrawn in an attempt to maintain a standard number of electors per councillor. They are at 2007: ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{are over}} 140 burial pits on Caburn: some are circular, some {{triangular}} and some rectangular. Each pit {{was found to}} be full of artefacts. Deposits included weapons, tools, pottery, coins, querns, and disarticulated human and animal bones. The most recent excavators argue that these are not random, or mere <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish,</b> but are structured deposits and appear [...] "ritually charged". The NE corner of the enclosure seemed to have special significance, because the high-status objects were mostly deposited there.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{the level}} of the spa was dropped by 0.6 metres (two feet) by pump to reveal the cap stones {{surrounding}} the spa. The site was thick in sludge, although the water was quite clear. <b>Domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> including the usual refrigerators, shoes, and jackets were removed. It is now the responsibility of Kildare County Council and Leixlip Town Council to continue with the work to restore the spa which is part of Ireland's National Heritage and an important feature in the Kildare area.|$|E
50|$|Some {{green tax}} shift {{proposals}} {{have been criticized}} as being fiscally regressive (a tax with an average tax rate that decreases as the taxpayer's income increases). Taxing negative externalities usually entails exerting a burden on consumption, and since the poor consume more and save or invest less {{as a share of}} their income, any shift towards consumption taxes can be regressive. In 2004, research by the Policy Studies Institute and Joseph Rowntree Foundation indicated that flat rate taxes on <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish,</b> energy, water and transport use would have a relatively higher impact on poorer households.|$|E
50|$|The Bronze Age {{produced}} {{evidence at}} Girton of a burnt mound. This oval pile of burnt stones some 10-12 metres {{in diameter and}} 0.4 metres high {{can be linked to}} heating water and probably cooking. Other archaeological evidence {{is in the form of}} a ‘pit alignment’ examined in Besthorpe Quarry in the 1990s; this consisted of a line of deep pits dug presumably to support large posts and usually interpreted as being significant of boundaries or divisions in the landscape. As the alignment was away from any contemporary settlement and its <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> no finds were made to assist dating.|$|E
50|$|The Rheydter Höhe ("Rheydt Hill") {{was created}} in 1945 from rubble {{left behind by the}} bombing of the towns of Mönchengladbach and Rheydt, which left 65% of the two towns in ruins. During the 1950s, great {{quantities}} of <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> were dumped on the Trümmerberg. In order to enable plants and trees to grown, a layer of humus, between one and two metres thick, laid over the household rubbish. During the 1990s, this resulted in poison gas emissions from the rubble, of which nothing can be seen today. However, about 30 metres below the plateau, which doubles as a viewing point, individual pieces of plastic bags can be seen {{on the sides of the}} footpath, which have been exposed by rainwater over time.|$|E

It passes through an area which was used as a landfill site in the 1960s and 1970s. Some 355 yd of new channel was constructed, some of it edged with sheet piling. After passing through a railway viaduct, the bank is supported by a series of contiguous concrete piles, which were drilled to a depth of between 30 ft and 49 ft and provide a retaining wall which is 35 ft tall at its highest point. As the project neared completion, open days to allow the public to walk along the bottom of the new canal section were held on 10 and 11 May 2013, and were attended by over 1,800 people. Where <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> had to be removed, it was relocated on the site, covered with 2 ft of crushed recycled concrete and a layer of Bentomat geotextile, which was topped by subsoil and topsoil obtained from elsewhere on the site.

40|$|Due to the {{accelerating}} {{development of}} ‘rapidly to become redundant ’ technologies, {{there is a}} growing mountain of perfectly serviceable discarded electronic devices hiding quietly at the bottom of almost every <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> pile or at the back of nearly every second hand shop. If you add in to this scenario the accelerating nature of our society where people don’t have time or the motivation in their lives to sell or auction their redundant electronics, one can discover a plethora of discarded materials available for salvage. Using this as a starting point, I have produced a portable noise instrument from recycled materials, that is primarily an artistic led venture, built specifically for live performance. 1...|$|E
40|$|This article unveils the {{different}} ‘thought worlds’ that inform {{urban development policy}} {{and the reality of}} urban service delivery in Faisalabad, Pakistan’s third largest city. Focusing on changing patterns of residential waste removal and based on ethnographic work among minority Christian street sweepers, the ‘little sub-worlds’ involved in <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> collection are explored, showing how these articulate with larger ‘thought worlds’ about dirt and disorder. The symbolic meanings of dirt across public and private spheres are examined alongside efforts by development practitioners and donors to impose generic policy solutions related to privatised delivery. Drawing on Mary Douglas’s insights about how ritual pollution or danger-beliefs serve generally to maintain social categories and hierarchies, the article nevertheless points to the historically contingent specificities of caste-like relations in urban Pakistan and how these have been constructed. It shows how under increasing competition for scarce jobs, entitlements associated with hereditary status-based occupations are once more appealed to and reconstructed by these vulnerable waste workers, shaping in the process urban service delivery and the relations that underpin it. The disjuncture born of diverse logics about dirt and disorder reveal an institutional multiplicity and messy social reality that sits uneasily with development as an ordering and unidirectional process...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of Anglian and Anglo-Scandinavian settlements at Cottam, East Yorkshire, was first indicated in 1987 by numerous finds of copper alloy coins, dress pins and strap ends by metal detector users. This report {{presents the results}} of fieldwork carried out on behalf of the Department of Archaeology, University of York, between 1993 - 5, including field walking, geophysical survey, and excavation. This revealed an enclosure of the eighth-ninth centuries, containing traces of a small number of post-built halls. In the late ninth century this settlement was then abandoned, a process which led to the incorporation of a human female skull in a <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> pit. A new enclosed settlement was laid out nearby, which was occupied briefly in the early tenth century. It is argued that the Anglian settlement may have been part of a royal multiple estate but {{that as a result of}} estate reorganisation after the Scandinavian settlement it developed into an independent manor. Cottam is the first so-called "productive site" in the environs of York to be the subject of archaeological investigations. The results suggest that it was a prosperous but not exceptional site, and that the primary activity was farming, with limited evidence for trade or manufacture. This work also prompts a reassessment of the typology of crop mark enclosures and the re-examination of the large number of undated enclosures in the area...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from archaeocarpological analyses {{carried out in}} ‘The Mirror Pit’, a rectangular pit, situated {{in the city of}} Ferrara, in Emilia Romagna - Northern Italy. The study is part of wider research focused on the Mediaeval period of this city. The pit belongs to a building which was in use from the second half of 14 th to the end of 15 th century A. D. The pit itself was filled with <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish</b> during a few years {{in the middle of the}} 15 th century. The layers were preserved by waterlogging and are therefore extraordinarily rich in organic remains and artifacts, among which was the beautiful spherical mirror which gave its name to the pit. Approximately 256, 000 well-preserved seeds and fruits belonging to 98 species or carpological types were identified in 12 litres of sediment from the different layers. Ficus carica, Brassica rapa subsp. rapa/subsp. sylvestris and Vitis vinifera subsp. vinifera prevailed. Many cultivated plants and weeds were present, together with a smaller number of wild plants of wet environments and woodlands. Altogether they provided much new information on the diet (cultivated and wild fruits, cereals and pulses, vegetables, spices and medicinal/fibre/oil plants) of the middle to upper class inhabitants of a city in Northern Italy during the Renaissance period. The records also yielded evidence of domestic activities such as winemaking, oil making, mustard making and other kitchen practices...|$|E
40|$|Charred plant remains {{included}} charred {{cereal grains}} and chaff {{together with other}} crop plants, such as legumes, and weed seeds. Charred plant remains have been found throughout the occupation of the town usually together with animal bones and fish remains as <b>domestic</b> <b>rubbish.</b> Occasionally larger groups of charred plant remains have been found including cereal chaff used as fuel in a Roman period corn drier at Norfolk Street villa (Jones 1982) and charred hay from a Roman pit at Causeway Lane (Monckton 1999 a) providing evidence of other activities within the town. Such deposits were not found here and few remains {{were found in the}} samples from Roman contexts. In contrast abundant grain deposits of medieval to post-medieval date were found here. These were quite unlike the samples from the town at the time, which were thought to represent only domestic activity. Other plant remains were preserved by mineralization caused by impregnation with calcium salts, this occurs in such conditions as found in cesspits, these were found here as in the town. The remains included fruit stones and pips, which had been eaten and deposited in the pit as sewage. These were found with fish bone from food consumed, as well as fly puparia from the insects living in the cesspits. Parasite eggs of worms of the human gut were found by testing these deposits, confirming the presence of sewage. Hence these remains show the presence of cesspits and give evidence of domestic activity and diet in the past. These remains were considered together over the phases of the site from Roman to post-medieval to help to interpret the activities on the site in the past.
