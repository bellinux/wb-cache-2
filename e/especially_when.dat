5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, {{is that they are}} only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> herbivory is variable.|$|E
5|$|Like others storks, {{it lacks}} vocal muscles and {{produces}} sound mainly by bill-clattering, although low grunting, mooing or roaring sounds are made <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> nesting.

5|$|The arrests {{brought a}} surge of media {{coverage}} to the sit-in campaign, including national television news coverage, front page stories in both of Nashville's daily newspapers, and an Associated Press story.

5|$|The {{sunbirds}} and spiderhunters {{are very}} small passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> feeding young.

5|$|A {{particular}} critical {{success was}} The Year of the Sex Olympics, broadcast {{as part of}} BBC2's Theatre 625 series in July 1968. Kneale's first television work {{to be made in}} colour—although only a black-and-white copy now survives—the story was based in a future where {{the majority of the population}} are kept in a docile state by constant broadcasts of pornography and other low-brow reality television programming. The Live Life Show, in which a family are watched twenty-four hours a day as they struggle to live on an isolated rural island, becomes a massive success, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> a murderer is introduced into the set-up.|$|E
5|$|A {{photovoltaic}} power station, {{also known}} as a solar park, is a large-scale photovoltaic system (PV system) designed for the supply of merchant power into the electricity grid. They are differentiated from most building-mounted and other decentralised solar power applications because they supply power at the utility level, rather than to a local user or users. They are sometimes also referred to as solar farms or solar ranches, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> sited in agricultural areas. The generic expression utility-scale solar is sometimes used to describe this type of project.|$|E

5|$|A {{side effect}} of Baldwin's tour of Wales was the implied {{assertion}} of royal authority in a section of Henry's domains that had always been somewhat fractious. Baldwin was also asserting his ecclesiastical authority over the Welsh bishops, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> he {{made a point of}} celebrating mass at every Welsh cathedral; he was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to celebrate mass at St Asaph's Cathedral. Baldwin excommunicated the only Welsh prince who refused to appear before him and take the cross, Owain Cyfeiliog.|$|E
5|$|All {{actinides}} are pyrophoric, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> finely divided, that is, they spontaneously ignite upon reaction with air. The {{melting point}} of actinides {{does not have}} a clear dependence on the number of f-electrons. The unusually low melting point of neptunium and plutonium (~640°C) is explained by hybridization of 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in these metals.|$|E
5|$|Ash may disrupt {{transportation}} systems over large areas for hours to days, including roads and vehicles, railways and ports and shipping. Falling ash {{will reduce the}} visibility which can make driving difficult and dangerous. In addition, fast travelling cars will stir up ash, creating billowing clouds which perpetuate ongoing visibility hazards. Ash accumulations will decrease traction, <b>especially</b> <b>when</b> wet, and cover road markings. Fine-grained ash can infiltrate openings in cars and abrade most surfaces, especially between moving parts. Air and oil filters will become blocked requiring frequent replacement. Rail transport is less vulnerable, with disruptions mainly caused by reduction in visibility.|$|E
