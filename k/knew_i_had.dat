5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You {{need to know how}} to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and wanted to have a good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

The way I worked it out, {{it was to be}} me or Ken MacLeay and I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a few years {{experience}} on him, having played Tests and more Sheffield Shield. This is the biggest thrill apart from my 1981 Test selection in England and helping bring back the Sheffield Shield to NSW last year.|$|E

The fact that period drama always has been very popular at the BBC probably helped.|$|E

Gyllenhaal said, [...] "Every actor I {{look up to}} has done theatre work, so I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to give it a}} try." [...] The play, which had been a critical sensation on Broadway, ran for eight weeks in London's West End. Gyllenhaal received favorable critical reviews and an Evening Standard Theatre Award in the category [...] "Outstanding Newcomer".|$|E

She stated: [...] "I guess it was when I watched Monster... I pretty much <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to find a way. I {{had to do something}} like that, something completely transformational." [...] In 2005, Pinto began a modeling career and joined Elite Model Management India, with whom she worked {{for two and a half}} years. She was featured in several television and print advertisements for products such as Wrigley's Chewing Gum, Škoda, Vodafone India, Airtel, Visa, eBay, and De Beers.|$|E

500|$|Galvis {{was born}} November 14, 1989, in Punto Fijo, Falcón, Venezuela, and at age 14, the Philadelphia Phillies began to scout {{him during his}} days playing youth baseball. He participated on Latin America's team in the Little League World Series, but due to his slight stature ( [...] ), {{struggled}} to captivate scouts' attention. Galvis said, [...] "They told me that I couldn't play (pro) baseball. But I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> the ability." [...] In 2006, scouts Sal Agostinelli and Jesus Mendez signed him during the amateur player signing period. Galvis, 16 years old, was not a particularly heralded prospect, but did receive some attention from scouting experts before signing with the Phillies.|$|E
500|$|At this time, as an {{adolescent}} in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer's attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{to be in}} jazz. Two things decided me – {{the sound of a}} trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session". Farmer's trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, [...] "then I heard Freddie Webster, and I loved his sound. I decided to work on sound because it seemed like most of the guys my age were just working on speed".|$|E

Regrettably, this is not to be." [...] Apollo 11 Command Module pilot Michael Collins said, of Armstrong, [...] "He was the best, and I will miss him terribly."

She described it as a [...] "very difficult instrument" [...] and stated, [...] "There was so much noise in [...] It was like rrrrrrnnnnngh , I was faking the melody and it was ugly, very weird stuff. I had to really switch this button [...] like don't listen to it and feel what you’'re feeling. It took a while because at the beginning, I was very aware of playing this horrible melody, if you could call it a melody, and I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to feel something.

500|$|Ruck {{says that}} with Cameron Frye, Hughes gave him [...] "the best part I {{ever had in}} a movie, and any success that I've had since 1985 is because he took a big chance on me. I'll be forever grateful." [...] "While we were making the movie, I just <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> a really good part", Ruck says. [...] "My {{realization}} of John's impact on the teen-comedy genre crept in sometime later. Teen comedies tend {{to dwell on the}} ridiculous, as a rule. It's always the preoccupation with sex and the self-involvement, and we kind of hold the kids up for ridicule in a way. Hughes added this element of dignity. He was an advocate for teenagers as complete human beings, and he honored their hopes and their dreams. That's what you see in his movies." ...|$|E
500|$|He continued, [...] "It {{all felt}} like a perfect fit. What's great about the scene, too, is there's hardly any dialogue. It's nine minutes long. I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to start minimal and give it space. Let notes ring, then give it space, and build up the {{anticipation}} from there, without tipping in either direction." [...] Djawadi stated that he refrained from using the typical Lannister theme, [...] "The Rains of Castamere", {{in order to create}} more of a mystery. The piece also featured vocals by two young boys singing in unison, with Djawadi describing how he pieced all of the separate pieces of the music together by saying [...] "The boys I recorded completely separate. The strings I recorded all together. Even the solo instruments, I recorded them separately — the solo violins and solo cellists were recorded separately. The piano, I played. And the organ as well." ...|$|E

500|$|To promote The Slim Shady LP, Eminem {{embarked}} on an extensive tour schedule. [...] He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut {{near the end of}} the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs. He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder." [...] However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.|$|E
500|$|Milk {{became more}} {{interested}} in political and civic matters when he was faced with civic problems and policies he disliked. One day in 1973, a state bureaucrat entered Milk's shop Castro Camera and informed him that he owed $100 as a deposit against state sales tax. Milk was incredulous and traded shouts with the man about the rights of business owners; after he complained for weeks at state offices, the deposit was reduced to $30. Milk fumed about government priorities when a teacher came into his store to borrow a projector because the equipment in the schools did not function. Friends also remember {{around the same time}} having to restrain him from kicking the television while Attorney General John N. Mitchell gave consistent [...] "I don't recall" [...] replies during the Watergate hearings. Milk decided that {{the time had come to}} run for city supervisor. He said later, [...] "I finally reached the point where I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to become involved or shut up".|$|E
500|$|After the Seven Network dropped Neighbours in 1985, rival channel Network Ten {{picked the}} series up. It {{initially}} attracted low ratings and Ten began {{working hard to}} publicise the series. They revamped the show and added several new cast members. Kylie Minogue had had a fairly successful career as a child actress, having appeared in various television dramas, including Skyways and The Henderson Kids, but she was considering giving up acting after failing to find further work. After finishing her school exams in 1985, Minogue then auditioned {{for the role of}} Charlene. She attended the audition dressed as the character and won the role. Of hiring Minogue, Neighbours casting director Jan Russ commented [...] "Kylie had done a couple of things before I saw her, but she was only 18 and as shy as a mouse. She really hadn't evolved into anything at that stage, but the camera loved her and I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my Charlene." [...] Minogue initially signed up to play Charlene for one week, this was then extended to 13 weeks and then through to mid-1988. She made her debut screen appearance in the episode broadcast on 17 April 1986.|$|E

500|$|Berry {{was famous}} for his {{attention}} to detail and preparation, which he used to overcome his physical limitations. Considered slow for a wide receiver, he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Rather than speed, he was renowned for his precise pass patterns and sure hands; he rarely dropped passes, and he fumbled only once in his career. He would squeeze Silly Putty constantly to strengthen his hands. He and Unitas regularly worked after practice and developed the timing and knowledge of each other's abilities that made each more effective. The reason for this, according to Berry, was that the two did not think on the same wavelength. [...] "Every season we had {{to start all over}} on our timing, especially the long ball," [...] said Berry. [...] "He knew he had to release the ball when I was eighteen yards from scrimmage for me to receive it thirty-eight yards out. I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to make my break in those first eighteen yards and get free within 2.8 seconds." [...] He also relied on shifty moves, and by his count, he had 88 different moves to get open, all of which he practiced every week.|$|E
500|$|Many Simpsons {{staff members}} were fans of English comedian Ricky Gervais and his British comedy series The Office that he created and starred. In January 2004, The Simpsons creator Matt Groening called Gervais to congratulate {{him on his}} double Golden Globe win. During the phone call, Gervais was invited to lunch with Groening and {{executive}} producer Al Jean since they were big fans and wanted to meet him. At this lunch, he was offered a chance to appear in and write an episode of The Simpsons. Groening first asked Gervais for just a guest appearance, but {{came to the conclusion}} that he might be interested in writing an episode too. Gervais told The Independent that when he got the offer, [...] "well, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to say yes, but fear kicked in at exactly the same time." [...] He became the first person to be credited with simultaneously writing and guest-starring in an episode of The Simpsons. He was also the first Briton to write an episode for the show. As a big follower of The Simpsons, Gervais saw the experience as [...] "a dream come true." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, 15-year-old Cruz {{made her}} acting debut in a music video for the Spanish pop group Mecano's song [...] "La Fuerza del Destino". Between 1990 and 1997, she hosted the Spanish TV channel Telecinco's talk show La Quinta Marcha, a {{programme}} that was hosted by teenagers, {{aimed at a}} teenage audience. She also played in the [...] "Elle et lui" [...] episode of an erotic French TV series called Série rose in 1991, where she appeared nude. In 1992, Cruz made her feature film debut at 18 as the lead female role in the comedy drama art house film, Jamón, jamón. In the film, she portrayed Silvia, {{a young woman who}} is expecting her first child with a man whose mother does not approve of the relationship and attempts to sabotage it by paying Javier Bardem's character to seduce her. People magazine noted that after Cruz appeared topless in the film, she became [...] "a major sex symbol". In an interview with the Los Angeles Daily News in 1999, Cruz commented that [...] "it was a great part, but...I wasn't really ready for the nudity. [...] But I have no regrets because I wanted to start working and it changed my life." [...] Charlie Rose of 60 Minutes noted that Cruz [...] "became an overnight sensation as much for her nude scenes as for her talent".
