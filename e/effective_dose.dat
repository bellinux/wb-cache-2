5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically <b>effective</b> <b>dose,</b> leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa.

5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest <b>effective</b> <b>dose.</b> They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

40|$|By gamma spectroscopic measurement, {{content of}} natural and {{anthropogenic}} radionuclides and their activity levels were determined in selected common Ghanaian maize. The purpose was to establish whether these levels and subsequently their annual <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> from the intake of these radionuclides were within the internationally acceptable limits. Six different maize varieties were collected, processed and data on each sample analyzed using a High Purity Germanium Detector.

5|$|The median {{lethal dose}} (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled. So a fatal 4.5Sv dose {{can be caused by}} ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because radiation exposure that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous dose. It has been estimated that a {{median lethal dose}} of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to benzodiazepines during {{pregnancy}} {{has been associated}} with a slightly increased (from 0.06 to 0.07%) risk of cleft palate in newborns, a controversial conclusion as some studies find no association between benzodiazepines and cleft palate. Their use by expectant mothers shortly before the delivery may result in a floppy infant syndrome, with the newborns suffering from hypotonia, hypothermia, lethargy, and breathing and feeding difficulties. Cases of neonatal withdrawal syndrome have been described in infants chronically exposed to benzodiazepines in utero. This syndrome may be hard to recognize, as it starts several days after delivery, for example, as late as 21 days for chlordiazepoxide. The symptoms include tremors, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, hyperactivity, and vomiting and may last for up to three to six months. Tapering down the dose {{during pregnancy}} may lessen its severity. If used in pregnancy, those benzodiazepines with a better and longer safety record, such as diazepam or chlordiazepoxide, are recommended over potentially more harmful benzodiazepines, such as temazepam or triazolam. Using the lowest <b>effective</b> <b>dose</b> for the shortest period of time minimizes the risks to the unborn child.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study is to evaluate, in terms of number of {{examinations}} and how <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> are distributed by location and chronology, the use of CT and nuclear medicine examinations in the management of paediatric oncology patients. Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective and descriptive study that included 57 children (13 with neonatal neuroblastoma, 18 with renal tumours, and 26 with lymphoma) over a 5 -year period, with the length of monitoring ranging from 1 to 7  years. All CT scans and nuclear medicine examinations were counted, and the <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> calculated. ResultsThe majority of the examinations were performed during the first year of management. The cumulative <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> ranged from 7 – 152  mSv. The lymphoma group received the highest doses, but fewer than 10 % of children received in excess of 100  mSv, as against 40 % in the North American study published by Chawla et al.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: For CT scan planning, scan {{projection}} radiographs (SPR) are used.

The goal {{of this study was to}} investigate SPR of the head in respect to <b>effective</b> <b>doses,</b> the influence of dose-reduction measures, and comparison with conventional x-ray. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Entrance doses for default and minimal settings were measured on a LightSpeed Ultra CT scanner and on conventional x-ray equipment. <b>Effective</b> <b>doses</b> for different scanning fields of the head were calculated for an adult, a 10 -year-old child, and a neonate by using the commercially available software PCXMC. RESULTS: Depending on projection and technique, SPR <b>effective</b> <b>doses</b> for adults were 1. 9 – 27. 7 Sv; for the 10 -year-old child, 2. 1 – 31. 1 Sv; and for the neonate, 5. 2 – 97. 2 Sv. Doses with the tube under the table were 1. 3 – 3. 4 times lower. Doses for conventional radiography were higher than SPR doses for adults and partially lower for children.
