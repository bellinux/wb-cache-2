40|$|Weld {{cladding}} {{is employed}} {{to improve the}} service life of engineering components by increasing corrosion and wear resistance and reducing the cost. The acceptable multi-bead cladding layer depends on single bead geometry. Hence, in first step, the relationship between input process parameters and the single bead geometry is studied and in second step a comprehensive study on multi bead clad layer deposition is carried out. This paper highlights an experimental study carried out to get single layer cladding deposited by automated GMAW process and to find the possibility of hot forming of the cladded work piece to get the final hot formed improved structure. The experiments for single bead were conducted by varying the three main process parameters wire feed rate, arc voltage and welding speed while keeping other parameters like nozzle to work distance, shielding gas and its flow rate and torch angle constant. The effect of bead spacing and torch orientation on the cladding quality of single layer {{from the results of}} single bead deposition was studied.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to examine}} the feasibility of a new concept in section rolling of thick strip, which either could not be rolled at present due to cracking at bent corners. Whereas, the {{second moment of area}} of sections could be increased through sharpened corners and increased gauge thickness. A heat assisted section rolling process is proposed. This process is based on application of high intensity heat on the inner surface of the strip, immediately prior to rolling. To investigate the new section rolling concept, the following work has been carried out. Firstly, the material property of the S 450 steel has been determined using the Gleeble simulator, followed by thermal conductivity tests. Since a freon was used to increase temperature gradient, the heat transfer coefficient for the freon-hot surface interaction was determined. Finally, the four point hot bending tests were conducted to validate the simulation model. For this purpose, a <b>hot</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig was designed and fabricated, utilizing an halogen heater as the heat source. The results between experiment and simulation were compared and a good correlation was found. Then, finite element analyses of a single pass hot rolling process has been adopted to investigate the neutral axis shift and section thickening effects. It is revealed that localised heating creates bulging on the compressed surface. The bulged surface affects the both neutral axis and thickening of the formed parts. This research has demonstrated that localised heating has a potential to be employed in section rolling operations. It shows that the neutral axis of the bent region shifted closer to the tensile surface would reduce the tendency for surface cracking. In addition, the increase in thickness that arises at a bend would enhance the stiffness of rolled sections. Ultimately a process window for heat assisted section rolling has been established.

40|$|While laser jet {{printing}} {{technology has been}} used for decades, there remain issues with consistent media output; media deformation, such as curl, is often introduced during the printing process. This deformation can be affected by factors external to the printer, such as the two-sidedness of media properties and the environmental conditions under which the printer is operated, as well as factors related to the internal processes and configuration of the printer. The purpose of this project is to provide Hewlett-Packard (HP) with a quantitative study on the effects of media fiber orientation, filler content, and moisture loss on curl generated during the printing process. Several brands of paper were characterized and compared. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) showed a quantifiable difference in filler content between each side of a sheet, leading to contrasting curl behaviors. Tensile testing was performed to determine sample fiber orientation, showing a predominant machine direction bias. A <b>hot</b> <b>bend</b> <b>test</b> was used to observe the variance in curl seen between the two sides of a sheet, while samples were fed through a laser jet printer to observe in situ deformation to validate observations from <b>hot</b> <b>bend</b> <b>testing.</b> These tests indicated significantly different media properties based on sidedness and orientation, which can be correlated to resultant curl. This work will allow HP to engineer printers that counteract curl and produce consistent, high quality output using a variety of media types...|$|R

Long columns of todomatsu (Japanese fir,Abies sachalinensis Fr. Schmidt) with various length/thickness ratios were the specimens.

In this paper, a method is proposed that allows {{the determination of the}} fatigue limit curve and the crack growth curve by means of such rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests.</b> For this purpose, flaws of controlled shape and size are introduced on the surface of conventional round bar specimens. The rotating <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> rig is equipped with additional hardware for optical crack length measurement. The stress at incipient crack growth gives a point in the fatigue limit (Kitagawa-Takahashi) diagram. After the crack starts to grow, photomicrographs are taken in regular intervals in order to obtain the crack growth curve. – The fatigue limit and crack growth curves obtained from the rotating <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> are compared with results from conventional single edge notch bending specimens. Agreement is good, with the results from the rotating bending experiments lying somewhat on the conservative side.
