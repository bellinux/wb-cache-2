5|$|In July 1919, he {{returned}} Australia and was discharged {{a month later}} in August. Bruxner then returned to Tenterfield, sold <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> and station agency {{and went back to}} his property as a grazier.

5|$|McGinnity {{sold the}} Tigers and {{purchased}} the Butte Miners of the Northwestern League in 1916, serving as player-manager and bringing with him several players from Tacoma. In June 1917, he sold <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> {{in the team}} and secured his release. He played for the Great Falls Electrics of the Northwestern League {{for the remainder of}} the 1917 season.|$|E
5|$|Ohio-native Thomas Edison helped {{contribute}} to the modern communications world through many of his inventions, including <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> ticker, Kinetoscope, phonograph, and his contributions to the telegraph.

50|$|In 1954, Voisin {{recorded}} {{an effective}} stocking {{rate for the}} most productive part of the grazing season (10 May - 23 September) of 2.2 Livestock Units per acre (5.5 LU/ha). Prior to starting rational grazing, Voisin claimed <b>his</b> <b>stocking</b> rate was only 0.6 LU/acre (1.5 LU/ha), representing a more-than tripling of <b>his</b> <b>stocking</b> rate.|$|R

5|$|On January 29, 1931, Pathé, {{with its}} {{contract}} players, well-regarded newsreel operation, and Culver Studios {{along with its}} associated backlot, located more or less {{next door to the}} vastly larger MGM lot was merged into RKO proper as Kennedy sold off the last of <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> in the company he had been instrumental in creating.|$|E
5|$|Paramount did {{distribute}} the film, but {{four years later}} Hitchcock sold <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> in Shamley to Universal's parent company (MCA) and his next six films were made at and distributed by Universal Pictures. After another four years, Paramount sold all rights to Universal.|$|E
5|$|The doping {{scandal in}} the 1998 Tour de France didn't affect the team directly, but Riis, {{who was part of}} the peloton in the Tour de France, was branded a doping cheat in the Danish media in early 1999. He sold <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> in Professional Cycling Denmark.|$|E

5|$|An {{important}} {{concern for}} Barnes, when {{returning from the}} United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.|$|E
5|$|In 1877 Beato sold most of <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> to {{the firm}} Stillfried & Andersen, who then moved into his studio. In turn, Stillfried & Andersen sold the stock to Adolfo Farsari in 1885. Following the sale to Stillfried & Andersen, Beato {{apparently}} retired for some years from photography, concentrating on his parallel career as a financial speculator and trader. On 29 November 1884 he left Japan, ultimately landing in Port Said, Egypt. It was reported in a Japanese newspaper {{that he had lost}} all his money on the Yokohama silver exchange.|$|E
5|$|In March 1891, Clayton and C.Wood Daily of Keyser argued {{on behalf}} of the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railway Company in a {{mandamus}} case at the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia brought by a director of the company, W.Irvine Cross. Alex Shaw of Baltimore claimed his right to cumulate <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> ownership in the company, and elected Cross as a director of the company. On March 24, the court ruled that the company was governed by the cumulative method, and therefore, Cross was entitled to his director seat.|$|E

5|$|Other names used by Fleming {{included}} a colleague at The Sunday Times, Robert Harling, who {{was transformed into}} Commissioner of Police Harling, whilst an ex-colleague from <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> broking days, Hugo Pitman, became Chief of Immigration Pitman and Fleming's golfing friend, Bunny Roddick, became Deputy Governor Roddick. The title Thunderball came from a conversation Fleming had about a US atomic test.|$|E
5|$|As {{publishing}} {{began to}} change its form in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, large publishing houses pushed out small, independent booksellers. Johnson {{did not attempt to}} form or join one of these new firms. In the late 1790s and early 19th century, Johnson's business declined, particularly as his relatives, John Miles and Roland Hunter, began to take over the daily operations; Miles was uninterested in the business, and Hunter did not have Johnson's commercial sense or his ability to choose successful manuscripts. In January 1806, Johnson's premises were wracked by a second fire, destroying the building and all of <b>his</b> <b>stock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bud devises a plan {{to drive}} up Bluestar's stock before {{manipulating}} it back down. He and the other union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy controlling interest in Bluestar at a significant discount. Gekko, realizing that <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns {{on the evening news}} that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Bush {{established}} Arbusto Energy, a small {{oil exploration}} company, {{although it did}} not begin operations until the following year. He later changed the name to Bush Exploration. In 1984, his company merged with the larger Spectrum 7, and Bush became chairman. The company was hurt by decreased oil prices, and it folded into HKN, Inc., with Bush becoming a member of HKN's board of directors. Questions of possible insider trading involving HKN arose, but a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation concluded that the information Bush {{had at the time}} of <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> sale was not sufficient to constitute insider trading.|$|E
5|$|In his fifties, Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. <b>His</b> <b>stock</b> remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Patty is {{the lead}} {{attorney}} in a high-profile litigation, representing the bankrupted workers of a large company run by Frobisher, who allegedly advised his employees {{to invest in the}} company while selling his own stock. Patty insists on taking the case to trial rather than accepting a settlement, but on Ellen's first day it is revealed that the prosecution cannot yet link Frobisher to his stockbroker—though both were in Palm Beach, Florida over the same weekend—and thus cannot disprove that the selling of <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> was not pre-arranged. When Ellen returns home, her boyfriend David Connor (Noah Bean) proposes to her and she accepts.|$|E

5|$|Barnes {{used the}} {{opportunity}} of travelling around England to pursue his business interests, cutting many deals. When he was rested from the first match against Yorkshire, {{he stayed in the}} capital and made deals at the London Exhibition. During breaks in play, or when Australia was batting and he had already been dismissed, he often spent the time inspecting local factories and talking to other businesspeople. An important concern for Barnes, when returning to Australia by boat after the tour, was to avoid paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included fine English cloth, which was in very short supply in Australia. Hearing a rumour that customs officers were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee. Upon returning to Australia, Barnes opted out of first-class cricket to focus on business interests. He wrote a newspaper column, in which he often criticised cricket administrators and the small share of revenue they gave to players. Barnes wrote in a confrontational manner, often lampooning and angering the authorities.|$|E
5|$|Because of his height, Ulis was {{overlooked}} {{until well}} into the recruiting process for top basketball schools. He was not highly recruited until his 201314 senior year of high school. Among schools regarded as high-major programs, only Iowa and DePaul made him offers during his junior year. His other offers were from Dayton, Colorado State, Loyola, Northern Illinois and Oregon State. During his junior season, <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> soared and Marian Catholic started winning. In the March 2013 Illinois High School Association Class 4A sectional round, Marian Catholic vied against Bloom High School and then played Edwardsville High School in the supersectional round. Although Marian lost to a much taller Edwardsville team, it established a school record for wins with a 294 record and it won its IHSA sectional for the first time. Ulis finished fourth in the Illinois Mr. Basketball balloting behind Jabari Parker, Jahlil Okafor and Malcolm Hill. He was a first team All-state selection by the Chicago Tribune along with Parker, Okafor, Cliff Alexander and Jalen Brunson.|$|E
5|$|He {{played in}} high school at Curie High School in Chicago where he won Naismith and Mr. Basketball USA {{recognition}} as national player of the year. He did not play organized basketball until eighth grade, but by late in his freshman season he became a notable contributor to his high school's varsity team. He was ranked among the top 20 prospects in the national class of 2014 prior to his sophomore season. As a junior, he moved into the top 10 of the national class and was recognized as an All-American. By {{the beginning of his}} senior season, he was considered to be a top 5 player by most talent evaluators and <b>his</b> <b>stock</b> was still on the rise. Following a Martin Luther King Day performance during his senior year against the number one team in the country, many experts considered him to be {{the best player in the}} national class of 2014.|$|E
