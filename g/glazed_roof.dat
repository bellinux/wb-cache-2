5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} a temporary structure positioned over {{the tracks and}} the platforms were sheltered with individual awnings rather than the all-over <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> provided at the DR's other stations. Access to the station was via a passageway from Bridge Street and a pedestrian subway under the road. On 30 May 1870, the railway was extended to Blackfriars.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} two {{platforms}} positioned {{in a cutting}} partially covered with a <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> and partially exposed to the atmosphere. It was designed by John Fowler the MR's chief engineer. The brick-built street-level entrance building featured a balustrade {{along the edge of}} the roof decoratively topped with urns. Fowler's building was demolished and reconstructed to a design by the MR's architect Charles W Clark in 1914 with a cladding of white faïence blocks. The building is listed Grade II by Historic England. The brickwork of the platform retaining walls was restored in 1986 during a renovation of the station.|$|E
5|$|The station's fourth span was renovated in 2010, {{involving}} {{repair and}} {{restoration of the}} original <b>glazed</b> <b>roof,</b> so that platforms 9 to 12 inclusive can once more enjoy daylight. A false ceiling or crash deck had been in place since 1996. Work was completed and the restored roof unveiled in July 2011. A second phase of improvements began in July 2014 and was completed two years later. Network Rail originally planned to demolish Span 4 and build an office block over {{that part of the}} station; Save Britain's Heritage successfully campaigned against this.|$|E
50|$|In 1979, {{renovation}} of both {{wings of the}} temple was again being carried out and the roof of temple was changed from belian wood into concrete with <b>glazed</b> <b>roofing</b> tiles; the ridge or roof and column were decorated with traditional dragon and phoenix statues. The renovated building was declared open in 1980.|$|R
50|$|The Arcade had six grand entrances, {{the main}} ones on Market Street {{incorporating}} graceful swans in stone and ironwork and Charles Street, and, within, four linked arcades with wrought iron <b>glazed</b> <b>roofs</b> and accommodation for offices and stock rooms.The ground floor occupants included a cigar merchant, a cabinet maker and two tailors.|$|R

5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E
25|$|Accommodation was {{provided}} for pilot and passenger/navigator in two closed cockpits. The pilot {{sat in the}} rear cockpit aft of the wing trailing-edges under a small forward-sliding canopy and flip-open side panels. The passenger/navigators cockpit had a flush <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> and was situated over the centre-section.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} {{booking office}} was demolished around the early 1990s, being replaced {{for a time}} by a portable building {{and now that the}} <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> has been removed a small booking office with a hipped roof has been added, with {{the north side of the}} concourse being made into a car park.|$|E
50|$|A {{composting}} yard treats all {{the household}} organic and garden wastes and provides high grade compost fertilizer for the vegetable and fruit gardens. It has an overall roof U value of 0.14. The <b>glazing</b> <b>roof</b> comprises 9.38mm thick low-E safety laminated glass {{which can be}} opened up to 90%.

50|$|During {{the mid-1990s}} the church again become {{the subject of}} renewed debate, partly because it is felt that its setting {{would be at least}} {{overpowered}} and possibly desecrated by the erection of the controversial Drake Circus Shopping Centre to the North West and because there was a growing campaign to partially restore the church to incorporate some modern <b>glazed</b> <b>roofing</b> to enclose a blitz museum.|$|R
25|$|The {{principal}} {{construction material}} was so-called red Gothic bricks. Stone blocks were used {{only in the}} foundations and the upper parts of buildings, towers and walls. The castle was decorated {{in a variety of}} ways, including <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> tiling, burned bricks, and stained glass windows. Its overall style after the second construction phase could be described as Gothic with some Romanesque features.|$|E
25|$|As of late 2013 {{the main}} station {{entrance}} and booking hall were closed due to extensive repairs {{being required to}} the ticket office floor and {{the replacement of the}} station's <b>glazed</b> <b>roof.</b> This enabled a Georgian wire glass to be put back in place and various lime mortar repairs and the flagpole being replaced with one of GRP and stainless steel.|$|E

From (1835–37) he rebuilt Royal College of Surgeons of England, in Lincoln's Inn Fields, Westminster, he {{preserved}} the Ionic portico from the earlier building (1806–13) designed by George Dance the Younger, the building has been further extended (1887–88) and (1937). In 1837 he won the competition to design the Reform Club, Pall Mall, London, which is one of his finest Italianate public buildings, notable for its double height central saloon with <b>glazed</b> <b>roof.</b> His favourite building in Rome, the Farnese Palace, influenced the design.|$|E

50|$|The Passage des Panoramas is {{the oldest}} of the covered {{passages}} of Paris, located in the 2nd arrondissement of Paris between the Montmartre boulevard to the North and Saint-Marc street to the south. It is one of the earliest venues of the Parisian philatelic trade, {{and it was one of}} the first covered commercial passageways in Europe. Bazaars and souks in the Orient had roofed commercial passageways centuries earlier but the Passage de Panoramas innovated in having <b>glazed</b> <b>roofing</b> and, later on, in 1817, gas lights for illumination. It was an ancestor of the city gallerias of the 19th century and the covered suburban and city shopping malls of the 20th century.|$|R
25|$|The orangery {{was added}} to the house by the 2nd Earl of Wilton around 1823. It was {{probably}} designed by Lewis Wyatt as it is similar to his orangeries at Tatton Park and Belton House. It was probably built for the wife of the 2nd Earl, Lady Mary Stanley, who was a keen botanist. It was designed with a domed, <b>glazed</b> <b>roof,</b> fronted by a formal garden with two large copies of the Borghese Vase. The ornate glass roof was removed, to be replaced with a flat roof after Manchester City Council purchased the park in 1902. The orangery is now a function and conference venue, run by Manchester City Council's Hospitality and Trading Service.|$|E
25|$|The tracks from Glasgow {{enter at}} {{the east end of}} the wide {{concourse}} which is flanked to the north and south by high stone walls, each capped {{at the east}} end by a castellated turret. A <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> between these walls sheltered the concourse until recently, but it has been removed and small shelters introduced. The northernmost line stops as a bay platform and is not in use, and platform 1 serving eastbound trains opens directly to the top of Station Avenue which slopes down to Cathcart Street through stone archways marking the station entrance. The two tracks in use continue westwards through a tunnel which is capped by the parapet wall to Terrace Road, which leaves Cathcart Street further to the west and rises steeply towards the station before turning south over the tunnel entrance and continuing to {{rise to the level of}} the Well Park. Doorways in the parapet wall lead to staircases down to each platform, and to a steel ramp down to Platform 2 serving westbound trains. Originally, there was only one doorway, which led to a sloping passageway which in turn connected with the (now removed) station's internal steel lattice footbridge.|$|E
500|$|The {{main station}} between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was {{designed}} by Brunel, who was enthusiastic {{at the idea of}} being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt. [...] He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the München Hauptbahnhof. The <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning , [...] and [...] The roof is [...] long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, a -wide and -wide departure platform, [...] a [...] arrival platform, and a [...] combined arrival platform and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|E
50|$|Internally, {{the rear}} wing {{consists}} of a large former immigration ward flanked by former kitchen and bathroom to each floor, with timber post and beam internal construction. The ground floor level has been partitioned with a central corridor leading to a large room at the rear, and has a central skylight which consists of <b>glazed</b> <b>roofing</b> sections which light glazed ceiling panels to the hall and adjacent side rooms. Ceilings throughout this section have pressed metal sheeting of various designs. The basement level has a lower floor level than the William Street section and boarded timber ceilings. The sub-basement level is similar, but {{with a number of}} partitioned rooms along either side. The toilet block has concrete floors, plastered walls and timber partition cubicles.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{the amount}} of {{insulation}} is {{the main component of}} preventing energy loss. This includes draft exclusion, <b>glazing,</b> wall and <b>roof</b> insulation.|$|R
50|$|A {{refurbishment}} of {{the house}} carried out by Frederik Raben in the 1760s resulted in the <b>glazed</b> tile <b>roof,</b> larger windows and the sandtone staircase {{in front of the}} main entrance. H.C. Lundgreen carried out a comprehensiv3 renovation of the building in 1927. Water, electricity and central heating was installed.|$|R
2500|$|The {{platforms}} of Bayswater station {{were constructed}} in the trench and [...] provided with a <b>glazed</b> <b>roof.</b> A short section of the trench was left unroofed {{to the west of}} the station to allow smoke and steam from the trains to escape from the tunnels. Even before the completion in 1884 of the continuous circuit of tracks which are now the Circle line, the MR and DR operated services through Bayswater as the Inner Circle. The MR originally provided all of the trains, but from 1871, each company operated half of the service.|$|E
2500|$|The village {{takes its}} name from a {{technically}} confused reference (a friary is generally a house of Franciscans and in any case not of Carthusians) to the Witham Charterhouse, a Carthusian Priory founded in 1182 by Henry II, which had peripheral settlements including one at Charterhouse and possibly another at Green Ore. [...] It is reputed to be the first Carthusian house in England. One of only nine Carthusian Houses in the contry, the priory did not survive the Dissolution of the Monasteries. At the dissolution it was worth £227; the equivalent of £52,000 today (2006). Excavations in 1921 revealed buttressed wall foundations and building rubble including <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> and floor tiles. It is a scheduled ancient monument.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2010, {{the museum}} opened a $150-million {{building}} expansion, adding , increasing the museum’s gallery space by nearly 50 percent. Whereas the 1976 wing had faced inward toward a parking lot, the new wing re-oriented {{the entrance to}} the Boulevard, in addition to reopening the original 1936 entrance. The design includes a three-story atrium named for Louise B. and J. Harwood Cochrane with a -tall glass wall to the east and broad expanses of glass walls to the west, and a partially <b>glazed</b> <b>roof.</b> The London-based architect Rick Mather partnered with Richmond-based [...] {{in the design of the}} building, while landscape architecture was handled by OLIN. Landscaping included a new [...] sculpture garden named for philanthropists E. Claiborne and Lora Robins. [...] The new wing is named in honor of patrons James W. and Frances G. McGlothlin; the major focus of the wing is on American art, and to support the installation and interpretation of its American collections, in 2008 the museum received a $200,000 grant from the Luce Foundation. The expansion received one of the 2011 RIBA International Awards for architecture.|$|E
50|$|The stone foundations, {{which are}} covered in {{decorated}} tiles are laid out around courtyards. The remains of <b>roof</b> slates and <b>glazed</b> ceramic <b>roof</b> tiles have also been found.

40|$|Abstract. Transparency of <b>glazed</b> <b>roofs</b> {{does not}} depend on glass as material, which enables an {{admission}} of daylight to the interior, but it depends on the share of the glazed part of the canopy and their structural part. Spaces of glazed atria and courtyards of historical buildings are covered with very difficult shape of glazed canopies, which are supported by various types of load-bearing structures. In contemporary architecture glazed atria are used for the reason of saving energy and lighting up the inner spaces. New types of structures and using glass in load-bearing function in glass canopies are important thanks to their structural subtlety, where the structure covers slight part of glazed canopy. The result of clever ideas and modern technology are lightweight structures of bold forms and spans. In this context transparency became a new expression element of architecture...|$|R
50|$|The curved and raked {{windscreen}} and the {{electrically powered}} semi-elliptical rear quarter-lights {{were made from}} Triplex laminated heat-reflecting safety glass, and the electrically powered side windows were double <b>glazed.</b> The <b>roof</b> was thermally insulated and had a transparent sun panel fixed toward the front, with a blind underneath the panel to block the light when desired.|$|R
2500|$|This period also {{marked the}} {{establishment}} of the first architecture courses in Finland, and in 1879 these began at the Polytechnical Institute in Helsinki, though at first with German or German-educated teachers. Other Finns went abroad for various periods of time to study. In fact, Jacob Rijf (1753-1808) is noted as the first Finn to have studied architecture at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm in 1783-84, though he is a rare early exception. He became a notable designer of churches throughout Finland, including Hyrynsalmi church (1786) and Oravais church (1797). One hundred years later it was also still quite rare; e.g. notable revivalist-style architect Karl August Wrede studied architecture in Dresden, and Theodor Höijer at the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts in Stockholm. Also, Gustaf Nyström studied both architecture and town planning in Vienna in 1878-79. His buildings are typical of the eclecticism of the time, designing in both Gothic Revival style and a so-called neo-Renaissance style of classicism, with heavy ornamentation as well as heavy use of colour in interiors but also occasionally in facades, as for instance with his House of the Estates, Helsinki (1891). The semi-circular Rotonda (1902–07), Gustaf Nyström's design for the extension to C.L. Engel's neoclassical Helsinki University Library (1845), demonstrates both an outwardly stylistic continuity with the original - albeit the pilasters have not classical capitals but reliefs, made by the sculptor Walter Runeberg, personifying the sciences - whilst also employing modern techniques in the Art Nouveau interior: the semicircular 6-storey extension comprises a large light-well surrounded by radially placed bookshelves. Due to the then stringent fire-safety requirements, the extension has a framework of steel and reinforced concrete, with reinforced concrete stairs, an iron construction supporting the large <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> and metal windows. After graduating at the Polytechnical Institute, Usko Nyström (no relation) had continued his studies at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890-91; on returning to Finland he initially designed (from 1895 to 1908 in the partnership Usko Nyström-Petrelius-Penttilä) neo-Renaissance architecture - in particular gaining from the growth area of building speculation in middle-class apartment buildings in Helsinki - whilst also developing a more Jugendstil style inspired by National Romanticism, and politically by the pro-independence Fennoman movement. Usko Nyström's chief work, the Grand Hôtel Cascade, Imatra (1903) (nowadays called Imatran Valtionhotelli), is a key Jugendstil style building; the [...] "wilderness hotel", built next to the impressive Imatra Rapids (the biggest in Finland), was intended mostly for wealthy tourists from the Russian Imperial capital of Saint Petersburg, while its architectural style was inspired by Finnish National Romanticism, whilst taking its inspiration partly from the medieval and neo-Renaissance French châteaux Usko Nyström had seen during his time in France.|$|E
6000|$|Verena Tarrant came in {{the very}} next day from Cambridge to Charles Street; that quarter of Boston is in direct {{communication}} with the academic suburb. It hardly seemed direct to poor Verena, perhaps, who, in the crowded street-car which deposited her finally at Miss Chancellor's door, had to stand up all the way, half suspended by a leathern strap from the <b>glazed</b> <b>roof</b> of the stifling vehicle, like some blooming cluster dangling in a hothouse. She was used, however, to these perpendicular journeys, and though, as we have seen, she was not inclined to accept without question the social arrangements of her time, it never would have occurred to her to criticise the railways of her native land. The promptness of her visit to Olive Chancellor had been an idea of her mother's, and Verena listened open-eyed while this lady, in the seclusion of the little house in Cambridge, while Selah Tarrant was [...] "off," [...] as they said, with his patients, sketched out a line of conduct for her. The girl was both submissive and unworldly, and she listened to her mother's enumeration of the possible advantages of an intimacy with Miss Chancellor as she would have listened to any other fairy-tale. It was still a part of the fairy-tale when this zealous parent put on with her own hands Verena's smart hat and feather, buttoned her little jacket (the buttons were immense and gilt), and presented her with twenty cents to pay her car-fare.|$|E

40|$|This paper quantifies {{environmental}} impact {{aspects of the}} recent pneumatic roofing system made of multi-layer etfe films in a lifetime perspective. A comparison with a similar high transparency system, a glazing system, is {{needed in order to}} understand its environmental efficiency. Two existing covering systems (an etfe pneumatic <b>roof</b> and a <b>glazing</b> <b>roof),</b> designed to contain a thermal buffer zone between buildings, have been chosen in order to apply the Life Cycle Assessment methodology: the material and building stage have been considered, giving a further insight to evaluate different design choices and technical solutions. The results about the LCA application in the building field show the advantage of the lightweight structure, reducing the involved material amount and highlight the importance of the light technical solutions assessment both at the material stage (relating to their own specific gravity), both at the roof subsystems stage and even better at a building scale...|$|R
40|$|At a {{time when}} great {{importance}} is being attached to making more efficient use of resources, {{there is a strong}} case for considering ways in which buildings may be improved and extended to meet new and changing requirements.

The investigation aimed at carrying further the current knowledge of the environmental performances of glazed courts and so revealing the potential of the glazing of existing courts. The work was carried out in collaboration with Essex County Council and the emphasis was on school buildings.
