5|$|The 4 MINDS schools offer four {{programs}}; Pre-School, Junior, Senior and Special {{programs for}} pupils who have Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and are severely disabled intellectually or have challenging behaviours. The curriculum is tailored {{to suit the}} special needs of individual children and {{the focus is on the}} functional needs of the pupils for the present and the future. Areas of learning include language communication, functional academics such as time telling, money value, self-help skills and personal grooming, social competency and pre-vocational skills. To promote the holistic development of pupils, the schools have within their curriculum time, physical education, music and swimming. A multidisciplinary team of Allied Health Professionals in each school, such as psychologists, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech therapists, ensures a <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the development of pupils and support for their families.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that {{there is nothing in the}} principles that would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Indiana, Sadler moved to Michigan as a {{teenager}} {{to work at the}} Battle Creek Sanitarium. There he met the physician and health-food promoter John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of corn flakes breakfast cereal, who became his mentor. Sadler married Kellogg's niece, Lena Celestia Kellogg, in 1897. He worked for several Christian organizations and attended medical school, graduating in 1906. Sadler practiced medicine in Chicago with his wife, who was also a physician. He joined several medical associations and taught at the McCormick Theological Seminary. Although he was a committed member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church for almost twenty years, he left the denomination after it disfellowshipped his wife's uncle in 1907. Sadler and his wife became speakers on the Chautauqua adult education circuit in 1907, and he became a highly paid, popular orator. He eventually wrote over 40 books on a variety of medical and spiritual topics advocating a <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> health. Sadler extolled the value of prayer and religion but was skeptical of mediums, assisting debunker Howard Thurston, and embraced the scientific consensus on evolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{definitions}} of the outcomes decided upon are subject to interpretation by those implementing them. Across different programs or even different instructors outcomes could be interpreted differently, leading to a difference in education, even though the same outcomes {{were said to be}} achieved. By outlining specific outcomes, a <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> learning is lost. Learning can find itself reduced to something that is specific, measurable, and observable.

25|$|However, {{considerations}} of how unified conscious representations are formed {{are not the}} full focus of multisensory Integration research. It is obviously important for the senses to interact {{in order to maximize}} how efficiently people interact with the environment. For perceptual experience and behavior to benefit from the simultaneous stimulation of multiple sensory modalities, integration of the information from these modalities is necessary. Some of the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon and its subsequent effects on cognitive and behavioural processes will be examined hereafter. Perception is often defined as one's conscious experience, and thereby combines inputs from all relevant senses and prior knowledge. Perception is also defined and studied in terms of feature extraction, which is several hundred milliseconds away from conscious experience. Notwithstanding the existence of Gestalt psychology schools that advocate a <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the operation of the brain, the physiological processes underlying the formation of percepts and conscious experience have been vastly understudied. Nevertheless, burgeoning neuroscience research continues to enrich our understanding of the many details of the brain, including neural structures implicated in multisensory integration such as the superior colliculus (SC) and various cortical structures such as the superior temporal gyrus (GT) and visual and auditory association areas. Although the structure and function of the SC are well known, the cortex and the relationship between its constituent parts are presently the subject of much investigation. Concurrently, the recent impetus on integration has enabled investigation into perceptual phenomena such as the ventriloquism effect, rapid localization of stimuli and the McGurk effect; culminating in a more thorough understanding of the human brain and its functions.|$|E

500|$|In India, a {{solution}} was proffered {{by means of}} a more <b>holistic</b> <b>approach</b> <b>to</b> the constitutional promise of equality. In Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978), the learned Justice Prafullachandra Natwarlal Bhagwati noted that [...] "an essential element of equality pervades Article 14", the equivalent of Singapore's Article 12. With that as a starting point, he went on to assert that [...] "the procedure ... must be right and just and fair and not arbitrary". The judge in Maneka Gandhi therefore spoke for a dynamic approach to equality, one that should not be [...] "subjected to a narrow, pedantic or lexicographic approach". This more liberal approach, which accords courts the latitude to deal with legislation backed by arbitrary or unreasonable objectives, was cited with approval in Malaysia by the learned Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram in Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996). It is unclear, though, if this test will be applied in Singapore due to a dearth of case law on the matter.|$|E
