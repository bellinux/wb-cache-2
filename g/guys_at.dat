5|$|Celeste gives Natasha the waitressing job at Charlie's and {{she moves}} in with Summer and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), after her house is sold. Natasha also decides {{to drop out}} of her {{university}} course, upon realising that it is not right for her. Natasha meets Ed Lee (Sebastian Gregory) at Charlie's and offers to help him solve a maths equation, but he dismisses her. When she solves the problem, he invites her to a maths club. Natasha later transfers to his calculus course and Ed helps her with conditional probability, which they use to predict the outcome of a game of cards. They decide to play a game of Blackjack with a group of <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> Charlie's, but are forced to stop when a couple of police officers walks in. Natasha convinces Ed to hold a game at the Men's Shed, so they can continue to test the theory and make some money. Andrew comes up with an idea to use the theory to make an odds calculator mobile app. When Natasha goes to asks Ed about the idea, he introduces her to the hobby of LARPing, before agreeing to sign Andrew's contract.|$|E
500|$|Stewart himself {{says that}} he does not {{perceive}} his show as cynical. [...] "It's so interesting to me that people talk about late-night comedy being cynical," [...] he says. [...] "What's more cynical than forming an ideological news network like Fox and calling it 'fair and balanced'? What we do, I almost think, is adorable in its idealism." [...] Stewart has said {{that he does not}} take any joy in the failings of American government, despite the comedic fodder they provide. [...] "We're not the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> the craps table betting against the line," [...] he said on Larry King Live. [...] "If government suddenly became inspiring... we would be the happiest people in the world to turn our attention to idiots like, you know, media people, no offense." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the episode, TV Squad commented {{positively}} about the storyline, noting that [...] "Unlike The Simpsons tonight, Family Guy actually did work their two storylines together. Their first big one, was about Peter's ever increasing weight problem. He skips out on going to his physical, so that he and Brian can go meet the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> an all-you-can-eat steak restaurant." [...] In {{a review of}} Family Guy, Volume 4, Nancy Basile regards [...] "The Fat Guy Strangler" [...] as one of her favorite episodes, as well as [...] "PTV." [...] Basile moves on to comment that [...] "Being prejudiced against fat people just isn't talked about, but this episode sheds a harsh light on that problem. At times the episode tries to show people who are fat as being victims of unfair bias, but other times just out and out makes fun of them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Grey Matters" [...] {{marked the}} first episode that {{featured}} a shared scene between actors Leonard Nimoy and John Noble, whose characters are old colleagues of each other. At the time, it was Nimoy's third episode and consequently last commitment as a guest actor on Fringe, and he had expressed his reluctance in interviews to return for further episodes. Nimoy however later agreed to a reappearance in the two-part season finale [...] "Over There". The visual effect of making Walter and Bell appear younger was produced by Zoic Studios. Fringes visual effects supervisor, Jay Worth, explained [...] "The <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> Zoic had to walk {{a fine line between}} too plasticky, stretched, morph effects and something that naturalistically looks younger". During filming for [...] "Brown Betty", Noble described the episode in an interview, [...] "'Grey Matters' was a very important episode for Walter because it helped to explain to some degree his apparent behavior. His eccentricity. His obsessiveness. His forgetfulness. Because we found out that he had certain memory parts of his brain removed." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't know we were recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E
500|$|For the {{destruction}} of the Bus, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s plane that serves as a mobile command center, series lead visual effects provider FuseFX were able to storyboard and plot out the sequence earlier than usual, before creating a completely computer generated sequence in which the plane is hit by a missile while flying in the arctic. As the plane is brought down, [...] "pieces of wreckage catch fire and burn as they fall to earth. There is also a smaller plane that flies through the airborne debris. It’s a very complex sequence, combining CG, effects simulations and pyrotechnics." [...] Series visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack elaborated that [...] "Doing fire realistically on television is a tall order. You don’t get the representation of what a real fire element looks like using software, but the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> FuseFX, those FX animators are amazing. It takes a long time and a lot of set up to get things right. And it wasn’t just the fire, it was the smoke and the debris, and then it was the cloaking device, and May [...] in the cockpit and it was May on bluescreen. Between Houdini and the particles we had to create for that one shot—a big giant virtual shot where we had a QuinJet come down and all the debris is falling all around and there’s fire and smoke, that sequence was what that episode was about. It was a big scene to pull off." ...|$|E

500|$|The medal's {{order of}} {{precedence}} was criticized by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The commander of this organization, John Hamilton, explained, [...] "It {{is very important to}} properly recognize all who faithfully serve and excel, but this new medal – no matter how well intended – could quickly deteriorate into a morale issue. Medals that can only be earned in direct combat must mean more than medals awarded in the rear." [...] The Military Order of the Purple Heart joined in condemnation, stating [...] "To rank what is basically an award for meritorious service higher than any award for heroism is degrading and insulting to every American Combat Soldier, Airman, Sailor or Marine who risks his or her life and endures the daily rigors of combat in a hostile environment. The Military Order of the Purple Heart strongly urges the newly appointed Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to either reconsider the precedence of the Distinguished Warfare Medal or develop another way to recognize the achievements of those whose indirect actions contribute greatly to the accomplishment of the mission without diminishing the sacrifice of life and limb by those who confront the enemy firsthand on the battlefield." [...] The Association of the United States Navy also expressed criticism of the medal's placement, stating [...] "While AUSN supports the medal itself, as well as the achievements and importance of the cyber warfare community, the concern lies with the ranking of the medal." [...] Doug Sterner, military medals expert and curator of the Military Times Hall of Valor, expressed confusion, saying, [...] "I understand the need to recognize the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> the console who are doing some pretty important things. But to see it ranking above the Bronze Star (with) V?" [...] Nick McDowell, a member of the Orders and Medals Society of America said that an alternative to adding a new medal could be adding a new ribbon device to an existing medal, and said that [...] "The problem is that we're adding another non-valor personal decoration into a system that is already crowded with non-valor personal decorations." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "The way I {{originally}} {{heard about}} (the reunion) was {{from one of}} the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> Earache (Records), who called me up to ask me about it. I knew nothing about it so I called Martin to ask him about it. The conversation got a little heated and I explained they couldn't do it under the name SABBAT as both he and (bassist) Frazer quit, leaving me and (drummer) Simon (Negus) with a lot of debts and financial problems to clear up. This was the reason we carried on as SABBAT and did a third album. Obviously we wanted the new line up to work out but it didn't … simple as that. What it came down to though was Simon Negus and myself, in theory, own the business and name as they left. If you left your employee, you couldn't go and start that business somewhere else under the same name." ...|$|E

2500|$|Playmates Toys, finding {{success with}} the license for Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, wanted {{to start their own}} {{franchise}}. Inspired by the success of the Sonic the Hedgehog series with Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2, they decided that they wanted to start the franchise as a video game, a rare approach at the time. From there, the game's design actually started with Douglas TenNapel's simple sketch of an earthworm that he presented to Shiny Entertainment. [...] Impressed, programmer David Perry and the rest of Shiny bought the rights to Earthworm Jim from TenNapel, and started developing the game. From there, TenNapel would work on doing the game design, creating level ideas, and voicing Jim's character, while Perry and the other programmers created other characters and game mechanics. Perry recounted that the giant hamster [...] "was drawn by one of our <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> three o'clock one morning".|$|E
2500|$|Howard's {{abilities}} and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: [...] " [...] is so developed... He {{has so much}} promise and I am glad that I {{will be out of}} the league when he is peaking." [...] Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: [...] " [...] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence." [...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're {{going to have to change}} the rules." [...] As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA.|$|E
2500|$|Blake {{started his}} 2010 {{campaign}} at the Brisbane International in Australia where Blake lost to Gaël Monfils in the quarterfinals. [...] At the 2010 Australian Open Blake defeated French veteran Arnaud Clément {{in the first}} round. He then faced fourth seed and US Open champion Juan Martín del Potro in the second round, losing a classic in five grueling sets, 8–10 in the last one. On April 14, Blake {{announced that he would}} be taking the clay court season off with a serious knee injury. As a result of this injury Blake missed the French Open {{for the first time since}} 2004. [...] Blake returned to action at Wimbledon, where he lost to Dutchman Robin Haase. The result was surprising considering that Haase lost badly to Blake earlier in the season at Delray Beach. During this match, Blake harshly accused ESPN commentator and former WTA player Pam Shriver of disrupting play due to her overly loud commentary from the box situated above the court behind him. This led to a verbal exchange between the two during the match. After the match, an emotional Blake declared that if his knee problems did not subside he may consider retirement. Blake, who refuses to take any anti-inflammatories for his knee, called his performance [...] "embarrassing" [...] and said [...] "I can't beat these <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> 80 percent." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "30 Days" [...] is {{produced}} by Steve Mac. Mac who is a regular collaborator has previously produced hit singles for the band including [...] "Ego.". [...] "30 Days" [...] was said to [...] "fill the dance floor with its echoing beats" [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy rated the single 4 out of 5 stars, writing a positive review about its [...] "blend of plinky synths", [...] "rumbling electro beats" [...] and [...] "addictive chorus" [...] which is [...] "cooler than a blast of Listerine."

[...] "blend of plinky synths" [...] and [...] "rumbling electro beats" [...] Some critics, however, questioned [...] "30 Days" [...] being on Living for the Weekend as they said the song would have been a good fit for the band's previous album, On Your Radar. It was revealed that the band had begun working with Darkchild on songs which are [...] "kind of R". Una Healy said: We've got a good mix. I'm really excited about it because we've got to work with some cool people It was revealed by Professor Green that the band were recording with DJ Fresh. Healy said that the whole opportunity of signing US label was a great step for the band to get out and build a fan base in the United States. [...] "The whole thing; performing, recording a great album to be released later in the year, and to work with the <b>guys</b> <b>at</b> E! who were professional and friendly.
