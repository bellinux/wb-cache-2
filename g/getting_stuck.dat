5|$|In summer 1923 Lethbridge {{was part}} of a second {{expedition}} led by Wordie, designed to explore the eastern coast of Greenland to conduct geological and archaeological investigations and repeat Edward Sabine's pendulum gravity experiments. Sailing from Newcastle, they stopped first at Bergen and then Jan Meyen before <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in pack ice. With food reserves running low, the crew resorted to killing and eating grey seals and polar bears, before they eventually aborted the mission and returned home.|$|E
5|$|Due to rain {{shortly before}} the start of the race, it {{commenced}} behind the safety car, with every car equipped with full wet tyres. The safety car came back into the pitlane at the end of lap five and racing began properly. While the top four drivers stayed out, several behind chose to make a pitstop for intermediate tyres. Just one lap later, Pascal Wehrlein became the first casualty of the still damp track, sliding off the track and <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in the gravel, leading to a brief virtual safety car period. During this time, both Hamilton and Rosberg changed tyres. The biggest winner of the first few laps was Sergio Pérez, who had worked up his way from tenth on the grid to fourth, ahead of Ricciardo. Meanwhile, at the front, Hamilton had established a five-second advantage over Rosberg, who soon came under attack by Verstappen, who was running well on the intermediate tyres. Bottas came into a spin on lap 11, losing positions and dropping back to 13th place. On lap 16, Sebastian Vettel was the first driver to make the switch to slick tyres, while Verstappen moved ahead of Rosberg into second position.|$|E

25|$|Nowadays {{there are}} some crusher buckets with a {{patented}} technology which can achieve a higher productivity (Xcentric Crusher). They are manufactured with a high inertia power train, circular jaw movement and an antiestagnation plate, which prevents large shredding pieces from <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in the bucket's mouth, not allowing them to enter the crushing jaws. They have also the crushing jaws placed in a cross position. This position together with its circular motion gives these crusher buckets the faculty of grinding wet material.|$|E

When asked where the food is <b>getting</b> <b>stuck,</b> patients will often point to the cervical (neck) region as the site of the obstruction. The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for a coin to land on its edge, usually by landing up against an object (such as a shoe) or by <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in the ground. However, even {{on a flat surface}} it {{is possible}} for a coin to land on its edge, with a chance of about 1 in 6000 for an American nickel. Angular momentum typically prevents most coins from landing on their edges unsupported if flipped. Such cases in which a coin does land on its edge are exceptionally rare and in most cases the coin is simply re-flipped.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{an infant}} to sleep while {{lying on the}} stomach or the side {{increases}} the risk. This increased risk is greatest at {{two to three months}} of age. Elevated or reduced room temperature also increases the risk, as does excessive bedding, clothing, soft sleep surfaces, and stuffed animals. Bumper pads may increase the risk of SIDS due to the risk of suffocation. They are not recommended for children under one years of age as this risk of suffocation greatly outweighs the risk of head bumping or limbs <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in the bars of the crib.|$|E
25|$|The Lysander pilots {{would fly}} low and {{slowly across the}} English Channel and cross the French coastline, then head to their {{allocated}} area, where the French resistance would signal a pre-arranged code before lighting up a makeshift runway across a field, hoped to be flat enough to land a Lysander. The pilot would land his aircraft down for the agents to climb down while any returning passengers climbed aboard and he would then hope to take off again before the Germans arrived. Problems were sometimes encountered with aircraft <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in waterlogged fields, bushes and small trees causing damage and animals straying into the way.|$|E

25|$|Simple {{heuristics}} like hill climbing, which move {{by finding}} better neighbour after better neighbour and stop {{when they have}} reached a solution which has no neighbours that are better solutions, cannot guarantee to lead {{to any of the}} existing better solutions – their outcome may easily be just a local optimum, while the actual best solution would be a global optimum. Metaheuristics use the neighbours of a solution as a way to explore the solutions space, and although they prefer better neighbours, they also accept worse neighbours in order to avoid <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in local optima; they can find the global optimum if run for a long enough amount of time.|$|E
25|$|In Bucks County, a woman {{died of a}} heart attack. Emergency {{personnel}} {{could not}} reach her. The eastbound lanes of the Pennsylvania Turnpike near the Philadelphia Interchange was shut down during the afternoon of the 16th because of a multi-vehicle accident that set a couple of them ablaze. In Nockamixon and Bridgeton Townships, an avalanche closed a mile of River Road. Several drivers were stranded and had to be rescued. The snow was 10 feet high on the roadway.

The Lehigh Valley International Airport remained opened, but most flights were canceled. There was no public transportation on the 17th.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, {{predicting}} gas solubility {{is essential}} to manufacturing polymers, but models using particle swarm optimization (PSO) tend to converge to the wrong points. An improved version of PSO has been created by introducing chaos, which keeps the simulations from <b>getting</b> <b>stuck.</b> In celestial mechanics, especially when observing asteroids, applying chaos theory leads to better predictions about when these objects will approach Earth and other planets. Four of the five moons of Pluto rotate chaotically. In quantum physics and electrical engineering, the study of large arrays of Josephson junctions benefitted greatly from chaos theory. Closer to home, coal mines have always been dangerous places where frequent natural gas leaks cause many deaths. Until recently, there was no reliable way to predict when they would occur. But these gas leaks have chaotic tendencies that, when properly modeled, can be predicted fairly accurately.|$|E

25|$|He {{failed to}} score any points in Turkey, {{as he was}} unable {{to keep pace with the}} frontrunners, and {{struggled}} on to finish tenth, while in Britain, he lost places at the start, and got stuck behind Nick Heidfeld early on. Despite some good fights, especially with former teammate Lewis Hamilton, the poor pace of his car meant he was always likely to struggle for points and finished in 14th, two places behind teammate Piquet. At the Nurburgring, Alonso lost places at the first corner, before <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in traffic. However, he went on to finish seventh, and was catching the two Brawn cars of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello towards the end. For the last stint, he was the fastest man on the track, half a second quicker than the leaders, which resulted in the fastest lap of the race.|$|E
25|$|In Orthodox Judaism, men {{and women}} who are not married to each other and are not {{immediate}} blood relatives are not allowed to enter into a secluded situation ("yichud") in a room or in an area that is private. This measure is taken to prevent the possibility of sexual relations, which is prohibited outside of marriage. According to some authorities, this applies even between adoptive parents and adoptive children over the age of maturity, while others are more lenient with children adopted from a young age. Seclusion does not consist of merely being in a room together alone; only if the situation is private, with no one else expected to enter, does the restriction apply. Originally, this prohibition applied only to married women secluded with men other than their husbands, but it was extended to include single women. According to the Talmud, this extension occurred in the time of King David, when his son Amnon raped Absalom's sister, Tamar. On the issue of elevators, opinions vary; some allow yichud in an elevator for a time of no more than 30 seconds, while others forbid it under all circumstances, partly due to the possibility of an elevator <b>getting</b> <b>stuck.</b>|$|E
25|$|Foraging on {{the seabed}} {{typically}} {{takes place at}} depths between 20 and 40 m, although they can dive to depths of 700 m in search of food. Their flexible necks provide {{a wide range of}} movement while they are searching for food on the ocean floor. Some animals have been observed to suck up water and then forcefully expel it to uncover their prey hidden in the silt on the seabed. As their teeth are neither large nor sharp, belugas must use suction to bring their prey into their mouths; it also means their prey has to be consumed whole, which in turn means it cannot be too large or the belugas run the risk of it <b>getting</b> <b>stuck</b> in their throats. They also join together into coordinated groups of five or more to feed on shoals of fish by steering the fish into shallow water, where the belugas then attack them. For example, in the estuary of the Amur River, where they mainly feed on salmon, groups of six or eight individuals join together to surround a shoal of fish and prevent their escape. Individuals then take turns feeding on the fish.|$|E
