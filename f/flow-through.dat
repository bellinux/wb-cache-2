5|$|Some {{species of}} mysids {{are easy to}} culture {{on a large scale}} in the {{laboratory}} as they are highly adaptive, and can tolerate a wide range of conditions. Despite low fecundity, these species have a short reproductive cycle which means they can quickly reproduce in vast numbers. They can be cultured in static or <b>flow-through</b> systems, the latter having been shown to be able to maintain a higher stocking density than a static system. In <b>flow-through</b> systems, juvenile mysids are continuously separated from the adult brood stock in order to reduce mortality due to cannibalism. Artemia (brine shrimp) juveniles (incubated for 24 hours) are the most common food in mysid cultures, sometimes enriched with highly unsaturated fatty acids to increase their nutritional value.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous <b>flow-through</b> method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to be abandoned. Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style <b>flow-through</b> lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone histology this indicates that Plateosaurus was endothermic.|$|E
25|$|Because red worms are surface dwellers {{constantly}} {{moving towards}} the new food source, the <b>flow-through</b> system {{eliminates the need}} to separate worms from the castings before packaging. <b>Flow-through</b> systems are well suited to indoor facilities, making them the preferred choice for operations in colder climates.|$|E
25|$|Vacuum Pump: a pump {{is needed}} to push (i.e., {{upstream}} location) or pull (i.e., downstream location) air into and through the animal chamber and respirometry <b>flow-through</b> system.|$|E
25|$|Interior trims {{received}} only slight revisions from 1971. A revised <b>flow-through</b> ventilation system utilizing vents in the doorjambs replaced the troublesome system used in 1971 with the trunklid vents.|$|E
25|$|Current practical, {{comfortable}} domestic water-heating systems {{combine a}} solar preheating {{system with a}} thermostatic gas-powered <b>flow-through</b> heater, so that {{the temperature of the}} water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.|$|E
25|$|The {{new body}} also {{featured}} a double shell roof for improved roll-over protection. Also new for '71 was a <b>flow-through</b> ventilation system utilizing vents {{mounted in the}} trunklid shared with other full-sized GM cars and the compact Chevrolet Vega. It used the heater fan to draw air into the car from the cowl intake, and force it out through vents in the trunk lid or tailgate. In theory, passengers could enjoy fresh air even when the car was moving slowly or stopped, as in heavy traffic. In practice, however, it didn't work.|$|E
25|$|On this basis, Apatosaurus {{could not}} have had a reptilian {{respiratory}} system, as its tidal volume would have been less than its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs. Likewise, a mammalian system would only provide to the lungs about 225−184=41liters of fresh, oxygenated air on each breath. Apatosaurus must therefore have had either a system unknown {{in the modern world}} or one like birds', with multiple air sacs and a <b>flow-through</b> lung. Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700liters of space available in a 30-ton Apatosaurus′ chest.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War Oslo Sporveier had a {{fleet of}} 331 trams, of which only the 46 Gullfisk trams were modern bogie-constructions. The {{remaining}} were twin-axle and limited in capacity. Oslo Sporveier needed more and newer matériel and considered several options. More Gullfisk were considered, but their aluminum bodies were found to be unsuitable, they had issues with cracks in the bogies and their electrical system was prone to faults. They were design with entrance through the middle door, which had during the high usage during the war proven to be inefficient and often led to two conductors being needed for each car. By then <b>flow-through</b> units with a stationary conductor had become common. There were also significant developments within controllers and 300-volt motors. As such additional orders for Gullfisk were discarded.|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund legal {{structures}} {{vary depending}} on location and the investor(s). US hedge funds aimed at US-based, taxable investors are generally structured as limited partnerships or limited liability companies. Limited partnerships and other <b>flow-through</b> taxation structures assure that investors in hedge funds {{are not subject to}} both entity-level and personal-level taxation. A hedge fund structured as a limited partnership must have a general partner. The general partner may be an individual or a corporation. The general partner serves as the manager of the limited partnership, and has unlimited liability. The limited partners serve as the fund's investors, and have no responsibility for management or investment decisions. Their liability is limited to the amount of money they invest for partnership interests. As an alternative to a limited partnership arrangement, U.S. domestic hedge funds may be structured as limited liability companies, with members acting as corporate shareholders and enjoying protection from individual liability.|$|E
25|$|Both VAM Rebel-based Rambler Classics {{included}} {{almost the}} same equipment between the two body styles {{with only a few}} exceptions. The largest difference was in the front seats. The Classic 770 came with full-width bench seat while the Classic SST had individually adjustable units, even though some of the hardtops came with a front bench. The standard features included <b>flow-through</b> ventilation, front door flip-open air vents, four-wheel drum brakes, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, day-night rearview mirror, two-speed electric wipers, electric washers, luxury steering wheel, electric clock, 200km/h speedometer, cigarette lighter, front ashtray, AM Motorola radio with antenna, locking glove box, courtesy lights, dual rear ashtrays, four side armrests, front two-point seatbelts, dual coat hooks, dual dome lights on C-pillars (except 1969-1970 sedan), single dome light on headliner (1969-1970 sedan only), fold-down armrest integrated to the rear seat back, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, back-up lights, turn lights, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment for both models included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, automatic transmission (not available in 1967 and 1968), remote controlled driver and passenger outside mirrors, heater with front defroster, rubber-faced bumper guards, bumper tubes, and a locking gas cap, among others. Sales the two-door hardtop body style declined in 1970.|$|E
500|$|A 2009 {{study showed}} that pterosaurs had a lung-air sac system and a {{precisely}} controlled skeletal breathing pump, which supports a <b>flow-through</b> pulmonary ventilation model in pterosaurs, analogous to that of birds. The presence of a [...] air sac system {{in at least some}} pterodactyloids would have further reduced the density of the living animal.|$|E
500|$|A spermiating male {{indicates}} successful {{production of}} mature spermatozoa {{which results in}} the release of large volumes of milt {{over the course of}} three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with the syringe to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs are adhesive and demersal, therefore if incubation is to take place in a <b>flow-through</b> hatching jar, the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping. [...] Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days.|$|E
500|$|On this basis, its {{respiratory}} system {{would likely have}} been parabronchi, with multiple pulmonary air sacs as in avian lungs, and a <b>flow-through</b> lung. An avian {{respiratory system}} would need a lung volume of about [...] compared with a mammalian requirement of , which would exceed the space available. The overall thoracic volume of Apatosaurus has been estimated at , allowing for a , four-chambered heart and a [...] lung capacity. That would allow about [...] for the necessary tissue. Evidence for the avian system in Apatosaurus and other sauropods is also present in the pneumaticity of the vertebrae. Though this {{plays a role in}} reducing the weight of the animal, Wedel (2003) states they are also likely connected to air sacs, as in birds.|$|E
500|$|Many saurischian dinosaurs possessed {{vertebrae}} {{and ribs}} that contained hollowed-out cavities (pneumatic foramina), which reduced {{the weight of}} the bones and may have served as a basic 'flow-through ventilation' system similar to that of modern birds. In such a system, the neck vertebrae and ribs are hollowed out by the cervical air sac; the upper back vertebrae, by the lung; and the lower back and sacral (hip) vertebrae, by the abdominal air sac. These organs constitute a complex and very efficient method of respiration. [...] "Prosauropods" [...] are the only major group of saurischians without an extensive system of pneumatic foramina. Although possible pneumatic indentations have been found in Plateosaurus and Thecodontosaurus, the indentations were very small. One study in 2007 concluded that basal sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus likely had abdominal and cervical air sacs, based on the evidence for them in sister taxa (theropods and sauropods). The study concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether basal sauropodomorphs had a bird-like <b>flow-through</b> lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present.|$|E

2500|$|The Algonquin Visitor Centre {{features}} exhibits {{about the}} natural and cultural history of the park. A [...] large and detailed relief map of southern Ontario is displayed to enable a visitor to be oriented to the size and geography of the park. [...] In a <b>flow-through</b> style, exhibits continue with many taxidermied species set in their native surroundings, then progresses, in a chronological manner, through an extensive collection of artifacts relating to human intervention in the park. [...] The centre also includes a video theatre, a gift shop, a panoramic outdoor viewing deck, and an art gallery—"The Algonquin Room"—with changing exhibits of art related to the park.|$|E
2500|$|AMC marketed the Javelin as {{offering}} [...] "comfortable packaging {{with more}} interior and luggage space {{than most of}} its rivals" [...] with adequate leg- and headroom {{in the back and}} a trunk capacity of [...] There were no side vent windows. <b>Flow-through</b> ventilation extracted interior air through apertures in the doors controlled by adjustable flap valves {{in the bottom of the}} door armrests. All Javelins came with thin-shell bucket seats and a fully carpeted interior, while the SST model had additional appearance and comfort items that included reclining front seat backs, simulated wood grained door panel trim, and a sports-style steering wheel. The Javelin's instruments and controls were set deep in a padded panel, with the rest of the dashboard was set well forward, away from the passenger.|$|E
2500|$|Early sauropodomorphs, {{including}} the group traditionally called [...] "prosauropods", {{may also have}} had air sacs.

The study concluded {{that it was impossible to}} determine whether prosauropods had a bird-like <b>flow-through</b> lung, but that the air sacs were almost certainly present. A further indication for the presence of air sacs and their use in lung ventilation comes from a reconstruction of the air exchange volume (the volume of air exchanged with each breath) of Plateosaurus, which when expressed as a ratio of air volume per body weight at 29nbsp&ml/kg is similar to values of geese and other birds, and much higher than typical mammalian values.|$|E
2500|$|An SS option {{remained}} available, but it {{was merely}} a $123 dress-up package that included a blackout grille and Rally wheels. It could be ordered {{with any of the}} Nova engines. 35,542 SS packages were installed, making 1973 the best-selling year for the option. A modified rear side window shape was also introduced, eliminating the vent windows on both two- and four-door models. A revised rear suspension was adapted from the second generation Camaro with multi-leaf springs replacing the mono-leaf springs used on Novas since the original 1962 model. By this time, six-cylinder and V8 engines were de rigueur for American compact cars, with the [...] and [...] V8s becoming fairly common. The 1973 Nova with a six-cylinder engine or 307 cu. in.(5.0 L) [...] V8 were among the last Chevrolets to be offered with the two-speed Powerglide automatic transmission, which was in its final year. A dressy Custom series joined the Nova line and a Custom hatchback listed for $2,701 with a six-cylinder engine. That was $173 more than the six-cylinder base-model two-door hatchback. Air conditioning added $381. Every 1973 Chevrolet Nova got side guard door beams and additional sound insulation, as well as <b>flow-through</b> ventilation systems. A sunroof could be installed, and fold-down rear seats were available.|$|E
