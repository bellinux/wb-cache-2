40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> in a stressful environment (i. e., following compulsory {{enrollment in the}} Greek army). It was predicted that higher levels of mindfulness and self-compassion would relate negatively to <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> whilst negative automatic thoughts and intolerance of uncertainty would positively relate to <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> This research also explored the strength of independent variables when predicting <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> plus the additional contribution of self-compassion when controlling for the effect of mindfulness on <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Ninety-seven military recruits completed the psychological scales {{on the first day}} of enrollment. Their height and weight were measured at baseline and after 5 weeks to record <b>weight</b> <b>gain.</b> Results revealed that 43 participants <b>gained</b> <b>weight,</b> whilst 54 lost weight. Those who lost weight reported significantly higher scores in mindfulness and self-compassion, whereas those who <b>gained</b> <b>weight</b> reported significantly higher scores in negative automatic thoughts and intolerance of uncertainty. Furthermore, negative automatic thoughts and intolerance of uncertainty did not significantly predict <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> after mindfulness and self-compassion were taken into account. Also, self-compassion uniquely contributed to the negative prediction of <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> once mindfulness was taken into account. This research concluded that negative cognition may play a role in weight gain; however, mindfulness and self-compassion may be more useful traits in predicting <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> given that once they are taken into account, negative cognition stop being significant predictors...|$|R
