5|$|Anti-malware {{researchers}} also exploited Heartbleed {{to their own}} advantage in order to access secret forums used by cybercriminals. Studies were also conducted by deliberately setting up vulnerable machines. For example, on April 12, 2014, at least two independent researchers were able to steal private keys from an experimental server intentionally set up for that purpose by CloudFlare. Also, on April 15, 2014, J. Alex Halderman, a professor at University of Michigan, reported that his <b>honeypot</b> server, an intentionally vulnerable server designed to attract attacks in order to study them, had received numerous attacks originating from China. Halderman concluded that {{because it was a}} fairly obscure server, these attacks were probably sweeping attacks affecting large areas of the Internet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – System {{security}} personnel fight a seemingly unending battle {{to secure their}} digital assets against an ever-increasing onslaught of attacks. <b>Honeypots</b> provide a valuable tool to collect information about the behaviors of attackers in order to design and implement better defenses, but most current configurations are static setups consisting of either lowinteraction or high-interaction environments. Although static <b>honeypots</b> help address this issue, the ability to construct dynamic <b>honeypots</b> easily would enable {{security personnel}} to identify potential security vulnerabilities {{in the attempt to}} build better defenses. This research effort describes a method to automatically and dynamically configure <b>honeypots</b> {{based on the results of}} network scans. These dynamically constructed <b>honeypots</b> then emulate a system or network of systems in order to collect information to better protect that network. This dynamic <b>honeypots</b> configuration methods has been implemented and tested, and can now enhance the ability of system administrators to identify system vulnerabilities.

25|$|Lealholm {{remained}} a traditional, labour-intensive, mixed farming community until the 1970s. In {{the second half}} of twentieth century increasing mechanization of farming operations led to a rapid decline of employment opportunities in agriculture in the surrounding area. However, the rise in the ownership of cars brought tourism into the North York Moors area and the village is a tourist <b>honeypot</b> in the summer months. Employment in tourism has risen rapidly and the village now has guest houses, holiday cottages, bed and breakfast accommodation and catering establishments providing jobs and income along with services and retailers. Lealholm had a typical NER goods shed and coal yard close to the railway station, which became a factory base when the company Lightspeed panels were set up in 1972. They produced the Magenta kit car, a fiberglass body kit based on a Mini chassis. Today the site is a car repair garage.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} and physical {{nature of the}} arthropod exoskeleton limits its ability to stretch or change shape as the animal grows. In some special cases, such as the abdomens of termite queens and <b>honeypot</b> ants means that continuous growth of arthropods is not possible. Therefore, growth is periodic and concentrated into {{a period of time}} when the exoskeleton is shed, called moulting or ecdysis, which is under the control of a hormone called ecdysone. Moulting is a complex process that is invariably dangerous for the arthropod involved. Before the old exoskeleton is shed, the cuticle separates from the epidermis through a process called apolysis. New cuticle is excreted by the underlying epidermis, and mineral salts are usually withdrawn from the old cuticle for re-use. After the old cuticle is shed, the arthropod typically pumps up its body (for example, by air or water intake) to allow the new cuticle to expand to a larger size: the process of hardening by dehydration of the cuticle then takes place. A newly molted arthropod typically is pale in colour; in that state it is said to be teneral or a callow. It generally darkens or otherwise gains colour as its exoskeleton hardens.|$|E
500|$|Liddy {{built upon}} the {{proposals}} to devise [...] "Operation Gemstone", a more expansive plan of espionage.

Liddy's initial draft of Operation Gemstone was deemed [...] "too extreme" [...] by campaign officials, but a scaled-down version was later approved in 1972. Despite Liddy's restructuring of the project, a request for additional funding for the original Sandwedge proposal was made by Dean in January 1972, although Mitchell's rejection of this request signalled the project's end.|$|E

500|$|In {{the colonies}} {{of a few}} ant species, there are {{physical}} castes—workers in distinct size-classes, called minor, median, and major ergates. Often, the larger ants have disproportionately larger heads, and correspondingly stronger mandibles. These are known as macrergates while smaller workers are known as micrergates. Although formally known as dinergates, such individuals are sometimes called [...] "soldier" [...] ants because their stronger mandibles make them more effective in fighting, although they still are workers and their [...] "duties" [...] typically do not vary greatly from the minor or median workers. In a few species, the median workers are absent, creating a sharp divide between the minors and majors. Weaver ants, for example, have a distinct bimodal size distribution. Some other species show continuous variation {{in the size of}} workers. The smallest and largest workers in Pheidologeton diversus show nearly a 500-fold difference in their dry-weights. Workers cannot mate; however, because of the haplodiploid sex-determination system in ants, workers of a number of species can lay unfertilised eggs that become fully fertile, haploid males. The role of workers may change with their age and in some species, such as <b>honeypot</b> ants, young workers are fed until their gasters are distended, and act as living food storage vessels. These food storage workers are called repletes. For instance, these replete workers develop in the North American <b>honeypot</b> ant Myrmecocystus mexicanus. Usually the largest workers in the colony develop into repletes; and, if repletes are removed from the colony, other workers become repletes, demonstrating the flexibility of this particular polymorphism. This polymorphism in morphology and behaviour of workers initially was thought to be determined by environmental factors such as nutrition and hormones that led to different developmental paths; however, genetic differences between worker castes have been noted in Acromyrmex sp. These polymorphisms are caused by relatively small genetic changes; differences in a single gene of Solenopsis invicta can decide whether the colony will have single or multiple queens. The Australian jack jumper ant (Myrmecia pilosula) has only a single pair of chromosomes (with the males having just one chromosome as they are haploid), the lowest number known for any animal, making it an interesting subject for studies in the genetics and developmental biology of social insects.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} well known {{mechanisms}} of task allocation is worker polymorphism, where workers within a colony have morphological differences. This difference in size {{is determined by the}} amount of food workers are fed as larvae, and is set once workers emerge from their pupae. Workers may vary just in size (monomorphism) or size and bodily proportions (allometry). [...] An excellent example of the monomorphism is in bumblebees (Bombus spp.). Bumblebee workers display a large amount of body size variation which is normally distributed. The largest workers may be ten times the mass of the smallest workers. Worker size is correlated with several tasks: larger workers tend to forage, while smaller workers tend to perform brood care and nest thermoregulation. Size also affects task efficiency. Larger workers are better at learning, have better vision, carry more weight, and fly at a greater range of temperatures. However, smaller workers are more resistant to starvation. [...] In other eusocial insects as well, worker size can determine what polymorphic role they become. [...] For instance, larger workers in Myrmecocystus mexicanus (a North America species of <b>honeypot</b> ant) tend to become repletes, or workers so engorged with food that they become immobile and act a living food storage {{for the rest of the}} colonies.|$|E
