50|$|SHADO has {{a variety}} of {{high-tech}} hardware and vehicles at its disposal to implement a layered defence of Earth. Early warnings of alien attack would come from SID, the Space <b>Intruder</b> <b>Detector,</b> a computerised tracking satellite that constantly scans for UFO incursions. The forward line of defence is Moonbase from which the three lunar Interceptor spacecraft, carrying nuclear missiles, are launched. The second line of defence includes Skydiver, a submarine mated with the submersible, undersea-launched Sky One interceptor aircraft, which attacks UFOs in Earth's atmosphere. The last line of defence are ground units including the armed, IFV-like SHADO Mobiles, fitted with caterpillar tracks.|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes {{security}} algorithms {{which are}} used to mitigate the Media Access Control (MAC) layer Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in WLAN infrastructure networks. This work is aimed to attend the DoS attacks due to the susceptibility of the MAC layer’s management frames. The management frames are sent unencrypted; this makes the intruder easily spoof the MAC address of the client or Access Point (AP) and stops their communication. There are two algorithms proposed in this paper namely, the <b>Intruder</b> <b>Detector</b> and Manager (IDM) and Letter Envelop Protocol with Traffic pattern filtering (LEPT). The <b>Intruder</b> <b>Detector</b> and Manager (IDM) algorithm detects and prevents the intruder entering into the network by maintaining tables {{in order to avoid}} the masquerading DoS attacks. When this procedure is followed, IDM increases the throughput by preventing intruders and maintains the history of intruders. This reduces the computational time of the AP and maintains the throughput and bandwidth. The LEPT algorithm is proposed to avoid the resource flooding DoS attacks. The experimental results prove that these algorithms effectively maintain the throughput and increase the performance of WLAN...|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in October 1979 Tonopah Test Range Airport was reconstructed and expanded. The {{base was}} {{immediately}} staffed with US Air Force security police. The flight line was walled {{off with a}} double fence; the only access to the runway was through gates. The area between the fences was lighted at night and had <b>intruder</b> <b>detectors.</b> At first, the facilities were limited to a few buildings, a small mess hall, and sixteen winterized trailers. [...] Security checkpoints {{were placed on the}} sole public access road which led to the TTR. The 6000 ft runway was lengthened to 10000 ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added. Phase II of the expansion consisted of the construction of an extra taxiway, a new control tower, a 42000 sq ft hangar, a parts warehouse, a dining hall, a water storage tank, and extensive fuel storage tanks. Phase III expansion of the facility was a 2000 ft runway extension to a total length of 12000 ft. Extensions were made to taxiways, the ramp, the runway gained arrester gear, and new navigation aids were installed. More fuel storage was provided, together with Liquid Oxygen (LOX) storage, a fire station, and the first 24 aircraft hangars. The cost was over $100 million.On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. The Tactical Air Command ("R"-Unit), also known as the [...] "Baja Scopions" [...] unit, remained at Groom Lake until the last production F-117 was delivered from Lockheed in July 1990. During the operational lifetime of the F-117, however personnel from Tonopah and later Holloman AFB would be temporarily deployed to Groom Lake for various checkout flights of classified elements of the aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Motion {{detectors}} {{have found}} wide use in domestic and commercial applications. One common application is activating automatic door openers in businesses and public buildings. Motion sensors are also {{widely used in}} lieu of a true occupancy sensor in activating street lights or indoor lights in walkways, such as lobbies and staircases. In such smart lighting systems, energy is conserved by only powering the lights for the duration of a timer, after which the person has presumably left the area. A motion detector may be among the sensors of a burglar alarm that is used to alert the home owner or security service when it detects the motion of a possible <b>intruder.</b> Such a <b>detector</b> may also trigger a security camera to record the possible intrusion.|$|R
40|$|In {{a virtual}} {{networked}} system where infrastructure {{is shared by}} more than one user security is a serious concern. Good network security protects a network {{in a manner that is}} consistent with its purpose and precautions must be taken when choosing a network provider for an organization. An attacker can enter into the system and compromise virtual machines and then exploit vulnerabilities. During the packet flow through the network experiences some delay. The existing intrusion detection processes incorrectly identify this delay as intruder’s attack. This work is intended to efficiently identify the intruders in the case of congestion and find possible countermeasure using Intrusion detection manager (IDM) in virtual networked system. The <b>Intruder</b> <b>Detector</b> and Manager (IDM) algorithm detects and prevents the intruder entering into the network by maintaining tables and reconfigurable virtual network-based countermeasures in order to avoid the masquerading DDoS attacks. When this procedure is followed, IDM increases the throughput by preventing intruders and maintains the history of intruders...|$|E
40|$|Authentication {{plays an}} {{important}} role in how we interact with computers, mobile devices, the web, etc. The idea of authentication is to uniquely identify a user before granting access to system privileges. For example, in recent years more corporate information and applications have been accessible via the Internet and Intranet. Many employees are working from remote locations and need access to secure corporate files. During this time, it is possible for malicious or unauthorized users to gain access to the system. For this reason, it is logical to have some mechanism in place to detect whether the logged-in user is the same user in control of the user's session. Therefore, highly secure authentication methods must be used. We posit that each of us is unique in our use of computer systems. It is this uniqueness that is leveraged to "continuously authenticate users" while they use web software. To monitor user behavior, n-gram models are used to capture user interactions with web-based software. This statistical language model essentially captures sequences and sub-sequences of user actions, their orderings, and temporal relationships that make them unique by providing a model of how each user typically behaves. Users are then continuously monitored during software operations. Large deviations from "normal behavior" can possibly indicate malicious or unintended behavior. This approach is implemented in a system called <b>Intruder</b> <b>Detector</b> (ID) that models user actions as embodied in web logs generated in response to a user's actions. User identification through web logs is cost-effective and non-intrusive. We perform experiments on a large fielded system with web logs of approximately 4000 users. For these experiments, we use two classification techniques; binary and multi-class classification. We evaluate model-specific differences of user behavior based on coarse-grain (i. e., role) and fine-grain (i. e., individual) analysis. A specific set of metrics are used to provide valuable insight into how each model performs. <b>Intruder</b> <b>Detector</b> achieves accurate results when identifying legitimate users and user types. This tool is also able to detect outliers in role-based user behavior with optimal performance. In addition to web applications, this continuous monitoring technique can be used with other user-based systems such as mobile devices and the analysis of network traffic...|$|E
