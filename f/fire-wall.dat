It was lit by a long, continuous window on each side and accessed by port and starboard doors at the back. The rear section of the fuselage carried a conventional tail which was wood framed and ply covered. The fin was triangular and mounted a balanced, curved edge rudder which reached down to the keel. The straight edged tailplane, strut braced to the lower fuselage, was mounted on the fin just above its base. Inset elevators gave its trailing edge an elliptical shape.|$|E

Our attacks use a technique allowing an off-path at-tacker to learn the sequence numbers of both client and server in a TCP connection. The technique exploits the fact that many computers, in particular those running Windows, use a global IP-ID counter, which provides a side channel allowing efficient exposure of the connec-tion sequence numbers. We present results of experiments evaluating the learn-ing technique and the attacks that exploit it.

The usage of out-of-band signaling protocols such as SIP for IP telephony and multimedia applications requires a dynamic control of these firewalls and imposes several challenges.

The {{main focus of}} this paper is the Simple Middlebox Configuration Protocol (SIMCO), which is a new transaction-based firewall control protocol. Due to the impact on call setup delays, firewall signaling requires small end-to-end delays and thus mandates a careful choice of the transport pro-tocol. Therefore, this paper studies SCTP, TCP and UDP-based transport for SIMCO and compares different configurations that allow to optimize the performance. We present an analytical model to quantify the impact of head-of-line blocking in SCTP and TCP and verify it with measurements. Both the model and measurements reveal that SCTP can significantly reduce the SIMCO response times by leveraging transmission over multiple parallel streams. While already a few SCTP streams can almost completely avoid head-of-line blocking, our results show that TCP- and UDP-based transport may suffer from significantly larger delays...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Security {{concerns}} {{are becoming increasingly}} criti-cal in networked systems. Firewalls provide important defense mechanisms for network security. However, misconfigurations in firewalls are very common and significantly weaken the desired security. This paper introduces FIREMAN, a static analysis toolkit for firewall modeling and analysis. By treating firewall configurations as specialized programs, FIREMAN applies static analysis techniques to check misconfigurations, such as policy violations, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies, in individual <b>fire-walls</b> as well as among distributed firewalls. FIREMAN performs symbolic model checking of the firewall configurations for all possible IP packets and along all possible data paths. It is both sound and complete because of the finite state nature of firewall configurations. FIREMAN is implemented by modeling firewall rules using binary decision diagrams (BDDs), which have been used successfully in hardware verification and model checking. We have experimented with FIREMAN {{and used it to}} uncover several real misconfigurations in enterprise networks, some of which have been subsequently confirmed by these networks’ administrators.

40|$|Abstract: To provide network {{services}} consistently under various network failures, enterprise networks increasingly utilize path di-versity through multi-homing. As a result, multi-homed non-transit autonomous systems become to surpass single-homed networks in number. In this paper, we address an inevitable problem that oc-curs when networks with multiple entry points deploy firewalls in their borders. The majority of today’s firewalls use stateful inspection that ex-ploits connection state for fine-grained control. However, stateful inspection has a topological restriction such that outgoing and in-coming traffic of a connection should {{pass through a}} single <b>fire-wall</b> to execute desired packet filtering operation. Multi-homed net-working environments suffer from this restriction and BGP poli-cies provide only coarse control over communication paths. Due to these features and the characteristics of datagram routing, there exists a real possibility of asymmetric routing. This mismatch be-tween the exit and entry firewalls for a connection causes connec-tion establishment failures. In this paper, we formulate this phenomenon into a state-sharing problem among multiple firewalls under asymmetric routing con-dition. To solve this problem, we propose a stateful inspection pro-tocol that requires very low processing and messaging overhead. Our protocol consists of the following two phases: 1) Generation of a TCP SYN cookie marked with the firewall identification num-ber upon a SYN packet arrival, and 2) state sharing triggered by a SYN/ACK packet arrival {{in the absence of}} the trail of its initial SYN packet. We demonstrate that our protocol is scalable, robust, and simple enough to be deployed for high speed networks. It also transparently works under any client-server configurations. Last but not least, we present experimental results through a prototype implementation.

Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) analyses and gas chromatographic/mass spectrophotometric (GC-MS) analyses of the petroleum fractions were used to determine if the enhancement methods were more effective than the control in biodegrading the contaminants. Results indicated that there was no significant difference in the petroleum reduction rates among the six treatment methods. The conclusions were that the petroleum was not bioavailable [...] transfer from soil-to-water was likely the rate controlling factor in this study. Biodegradation rates were significantly slowed by the highly weathered state of the petroleum, and the extreme spatial heterogeneity hindered the sampling and analysis of the petroleum. These conclusions were further supported in a second experiment using only the extracted petroleum contaminant. The extracted petroleum was biodegraded when made available in shake flasks.

40|$|Abstract. A secure reverse firewall, as {{recently}} defined by Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz, {{is a third}} party that “sits between a user and the outside world ” and modifies the user’s sent and received messages so {{that even if the}} user’s machine has been corrupted, her security is still guaranteed. In other words, reverse firewalls allow us to provide meaningful (and, indeed, very strong) security guar-antees against powerful adversaries that may have tampered with the user’s hardware or software (or adversaries that are aware of bugs in the user’s protocol implementation). A long list of recent events and disclosures shows that such threats are extremely common in practice, and they present a serious, arguably existential, threat to cryptography. Importantly, reverse firewalls defend against such threats without sharing any secrets with the user, and in general we expect the user to place no more trust in the firewall than she places in her communication channel. While Mironov and Stephens-Davidowitz demonstrated that reverse firewalls can be constructed for very strong cryptographic primitives (which are of mostly theoretical interest), we study reverse <b>fire-walls</b> for perhaps the most natural cryptographic task: secure message transmission. We find a rich structure of solutions that vary in efficiency, security, and setup assumptions, in close analogy with message transmission in the classical setting. Our strongest and most important result shows a proto-col that achieves interactive, concurrent CCA-secure message transmission with a reverse firewall—i. e., CCA-secure message transmission on a possibly compromised machine! Surprisingly, this protocol is quite efficient and simple, requiring only a small constant number of public-key operations. It could easily be used in practice. Behind this result is a technical composition theorem that shows how key agreement with a sufficiently secure reverse firewall can be used to construct a message-transmission protocol with its own secure reverse firewall. ...|$|R

40|$|The gradual {{weakening}} {{and subsequent}} repeal of most {{provisions of the}} Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 allowed commercial banks to acquire investment banking subsidiaries, to grow substantially in size, and to access even more information through more diverse banking activities. At the same time, proprietary trading became {{a major source of}} revenue for the banks. The subsequent financial crisis of 2008 exposed another glaring weakness of banking in the post-Glass-Steagall era. Banks had grown too big, too risky and too interconnected, many surpassing trillions of dollars in assets, interbank loans and liabilities on and off balance sheet. The sheer size, risk and interconnectedness of banking alone raised concerns about systemically important and too-big-to-fail banks. After numerous attempts to bring back Glass-Steagall failed, Congress attempted to contain banking systemic banking risk by passing the Volcker rule to prohibit proprietary trading, and enacting consumer protection and other ring-fencing and <b>fire-wall</b> provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. To test the potential importance of the Volcker Rule, we would need to know the amount of profits banks make from using proprietary adverse information about their clients. However, the source of the proprietary information banks use to execute their proprietary trading programs is typically confidential. Furthermore, banks do not disclose where and how they obtain this confidential information, which helps them create billions of dollars of profits every year. In this paper we investigate one possible source of this information. Specifically, we investigate the importance of the private information banks acquire as part of their financial intermediary and financial advisory role for their client firms. Banks often attain insider trading status and become subject to insider trading reporting requirements and trading restrictions when they are hired to provide financial advice to their client firms. When banks become temporary insiders, they must also report all of these trades executed on Forms 3, 4, and 5 alongside other legal insiders. Using this insider trading database, we demonstrate that banks can and do access important, private, material information about their clients and trade on this information. On average, the inside information that banks acquire and trade on is highly valuable, allowing the banks to earn more on 25 % on their proprietary trades. Furthermore, we find that relaxation and elimination of the Glass-Steagall restrictions allowed the banks to trade more frequently and earn greater amount of abnormal profits. Since 2002, banks tend to trade and earn more than 40 % abnormal profits from adverse information about their client firms. Consequently, we demonstrate that an added benefit of enforcement of the Volcker Rule would be to eliminate the incentives to trade on material, non-public information about their clients by eliminating proprietary trading by banks. Thus, we argue that enforcing the Volcker Rule would also help contain some the current conflicts of interest in the banking system resulting from the elimination of Glass-Steagall restrictions...|$|E
