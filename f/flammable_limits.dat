One of the factors required for an eruptive fire to take place is that BVOC concentrations must be between their lower <b>flammable</b> <b>limit</b> and upper <b>flammable</b> <b>limit.</b> When this accumulation of BVOCs is exacerbated by specific geographical zones (e. g. small valleys, thalwegs, canyons), the combination of these two factors can lead to situations with a very high flammability potential, representing a considerable risk for firefighters. In France, 16 firefighters have been fatally injured over the last 15 years. This work was carried out on three species of the Mediterranean basin: Pinus laricio Poir., Pinus pinaster Ait. and Cistus monspeliensis L.

The experimental research was conducted in 20 L and 120 L closed explosion chambers under both quiescent and turbulent conditions, using both electric spark and pyrotechnic ignition sources. The data reported here generally confirm the data of previous investigators, but they are more comprehensive than those reported previously. The results illustrate the complications associated with buoyancy, turbulence, selective diffusion, and ignitor strength versus chamber size. Although the lower <b>flammable</b> <b>limits</b> (LFLs) are well defined for methane (CH,) and Propane (CA), the LFLs for hydrogen (HZ) and its heavier isotope deuterium (D 2) are much more dependent on the limit criterion chosen.

The results are compared with those from biogas (containing inhibitors) flames at reduced pressure, inhibitorless biogas flames at atmospheric pressure (1 atm), and biogas flames at atmospheric pressure to emphasize the effect of inhibitors on biogas laminar burning velocity and flammability limits.

This paper presents experimental data {{on the characteristics of}} hydrogen-air explosion in air mixture using 20 -L sphere. This data includes the maximum explosion pressure, deflagration index, and the maximum rate of pressure rise. Methods and equations are available to estimate these parameters. The experimental maximum explosion pressure agrees with the theoretical value estimated using a chemical equilibrium program if the concentration of hydrogen is from 10 % to 75 % in air but not close to the <b>flammable</b> <b>limits.</b> Therefore, the maximum pressure can be estimated conventionally by the equilibrium program regardless {{of the size of the}} explosion vessel. Deflagration index for mixture of hydrogen in air, even if normalized by the cube root of the number of vessels explosion, is shown to be sensitive to the vessel volume. The fraction of burnt gas just before the flame contacts the wall has a dominant effect on the deflagration index (Crowl, 2001). From experimental data the deflagration index of hydrogen explosion in 20 L is 212. 54 bar. m / sec. The maximum explosion pressure is 2. 8 bar at the amount of 22 % hydrogen in air and the maximum rate of increase in pressure is 783 bar.

In addition, qualitative conclusions were made regarding the effect of atmospheric conditions on possible events. Thus, wind velocity was found to dominate during a jet fire event suppressing the thermal radiation effect, whereas gas dispersion was found to be affected mainly by solar radiation that favors the faster dissolution of fuel gas below the lower <b>flammable</b> <b>limit.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The combination of these two factors may lead up to situations with great potential of flammability, which provoke high risk for the firefighters. No less 9 cases were reported for 15 years ago in France with 16 fatalities for the firefighters. The hypothesis of our works comes from the simple fact of back experiences. Our study was realised on Pinus laricio, a important species of France.

The volatile quantity was multiplied by five greater to 50 °C at 175 °C for Pinus laricio. α-pinene, the major component, was emitted 7 times more to 50 °C at 175 °C.
