50|$|Power History {{refers to}} the power of a nuclear reactor over an {{extended}} period of time. Power history is important for calculations and operations that involve decay heat and <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> and to avoid the iodine pit during reactor shutdowns.|$|R
50|$|Generation II {{reactors}} {{were typically}} designed to achieve about 40 GWd/tU. With newer fuel technology, {{and particularly the}} use of nuclear poisons, these same reactors are now capable of achieving up to 60 GWd/tU. After so many fissions have occurred, the build-up of <b>fission</b> products <b>poisons</b> the chain reaction and the reactor must be shut down and refueled.|$|R
50|$|For example, {{a nuclear}} reactor that has {{operated}} at 100% power for 100 hours and then has dropped down to 20% power for 5 hours will have a different amount of decay heat and <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> than the same nuclear reactor operating at 20% power for 105 hours. This is because the second reactor has a different power history.|$|R
50|$|In a {{fast reactor}} the <b>fission</b> product <b>poison</b> {{situation}} may differ significantly because neutron {{absorption cross sections}} can differ for thermal neutrons and fast neutrons. In the RBEC-M Lead-Bismuth Cooled Fast Reactor, the fission products with neutron capture more than 5% of total fission products capture are, in order, 133Cs, 101Ru, 103Rh, 99Tc, 105Pd and 107Pd in the core, with 149Sm replacing 107Pd for 6th place in the breeding blanket.|$|R
50|$|There are {{numerous}} other fission products that, {{as a result}} of their concentration and thermal neutron absorption cross section, have a poisoning effect on reactor operation. Individually, they are of little consequence, but taken together they have a significant effect. These are often characterized as lumped <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> and accumulate at an average rate of 50 barns per fission event in the reactor. The buildup of <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> in the fuel eventually leads to loss of efficiency, and in some cases to instability. In practice, buildup of reactor poisons in nuclear fuel is what determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor: long before all possible fissions have taken place, buildup of long-lived neutron-absorbing fission products damps out the chain reaction. This is the reason that nuclear reprocessing is a useful activity: solid spent nuclear fuel contains about 97% of the original fissionable material present in newly manufactured nuclear fuel. Chemical separation of the fission products restores the fuel so that it can be used again.|$|R
50|$|Some of the fission {{products}} generated during nuclear reactions have a high neutron absorption capacity, such as xenon-135 (microscopic cross-section σ = 2,000,000 b (barns); up to 3 million barns in reactor conditions) and samarium-149 (σ = 74,500 b). Because these two <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> remove neutrons from the reactor, they will affect the thermal utilization factor and thus the reactivity. The poisoning of a reactor core by these {{fission products}} may become so serious that the chain reaction comes to a standstill.|$|R
50|$|The {{table in}} the next section gives yields for notable {{radioactive}} (with halflife greater than one year, plus iodine-131) fission products, and (the few most absorptive) neutron <b>poison</b> <b>fission</b> products, from thermal neutron fission of U-235 (typical of nuclear power reactors), computed from http://books.elsevier.com/companions/075067136X/pdfs/Yield.bas?mscssid=HAX80JCKT7RB8LS6F675GU2LM83N1CL6.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons,</b> other {{materials in the}} reactor decay to materials that act as neutron poisons. An {{example of this is}} the decay of tritium to helium-3. Since tritium has a half-life of 12.3 years, normally this decay does not significantly affect reactor operations because the rate of decay of tritium is so slow. However, if tritium is produced in a reactor and then allowed to remain in the reactor during a prolonged shutdown of several months, a sufficient amount of tritium may decay to helium-3 to add a significant amount of negative reactivity. Any helium-3 produced in the reactor during a shutdown period will be removed during subsequent operation by a neutron-proton reaction.|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} {{experimental research}} {{program has been}} established between industry and university partners to evaluate the subcritical behavior of fresh and spent highly enriched fuel assemblies at the University of Missouri Research Reactor (MURR). This proposed program will involve a series of subcritical measurements using the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) developed {sup 252 }Cf source-driven noise technique. Measurements evaluating the subcritical behavior of simple arrays of fresh MURR assemblies will be performed for evaluating the spectral effects of materials typically found in shipping casks such as lead, steel, aluminum, and boron. Also, measurements will be performed on spent assemblies to characterize physics parameters which {{may be useful in}} determining the subcritical behavior of fuels for reactivity credit of actinide burnup and <b>fission</b> product <b>poisoning...</b>|$|R
50|$|Fission {{occurs in}} the nuclear fuel, and the fission {{products}} are primarily retained within the fuel close to where they are produced. These fission products {{are important to the}} operation of the reactor because some fission products contribute delayed neutrons that are useful for reactor control while others are neutron poisons that tend to inhibit the nuclear reaction. The buildup of the <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> is a key factor in determining the maximum duration a given fuel element can be kept within the reactor. The decay of short-lived fission products also provide a source of heat within the fuel that continues even after the reactor has been shut down and the fission reactions stopped. It is this decay heat that sets the requirements for cooling of a reactor after shutdown.|$|R
50|$|While {{criticality}} at fast energies may {{be achieved}} with uranium enriched to 5.5 weight percent Uranium-235, fast reactor designs have often been proposed with enrichments {{in the range of}} 20 percent for a variety of reasons, including core lifetime: If a fast reactor were loaded with the minimal critical mass, then the reactor would become subcritical after the first fission had occurred. Rather, an excess of fuel is inserted with reactivity control mechanisms, such that the reactivity control is inserted fully at the beginning of life to bring the reactor from supercritical to critical; as the fuel is depleted, the reactivity control is withdrawn to mitigate the negative reactivity feedback from fuel depletion and <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons.</b> In a fast breeder reactor, the above applies, though the reactivity from fuel depletion is also compensated by the breeding of either Uranium-233 or Plutonium-239 and 241 from Thorium 232 or Uranium 238, respectively.|$|R
40|$|Depletion {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed for the McClellan reactor history from January 1990 through August 1996. A database has been generated for continuing use by operations personnel which contains the isotopic inventory for all fuel elements and fuel-followed control rods maintained at McClellan. The calculations {{are based on the}} three-dimensional diffusion “theory code REBUS- 3 which is available through the Radiation Safety Information Computational Center (RSICC). Burnup-dependent cross-sections were developed at zero power temperatures and full power temperatures using the WIMS “code (also available through RSICC). WIMS is based on discretized transport theory to calculate the neutron flux as a function of energy and position in a one-dimensional cell. Based on the initial depletion calculations, a method was developed to allow operations personnel to perform depletion calculations and update the database with a minimal amount of effort. Depletion estimates and calculations can be performed by simply entering the core loading configuration, the position of the control rods at the start and end of cycle, the reactor power level, the duration of the reactor cycle, and the time since the last reactor cycle. The depletion and buildup of isotopes of interest (heavy metal isotopes, erbium isotopes, and <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons)</b> are calculated for all fuel elements and fuel-followed control rods in the MNRC inventory. The reactivity loss from burnup and buildup of <b>fission</b> product <b>poisons</b> and the peak xenon buildup after shutdown are also calculated. The reactivity loss from going from cold zero power to hot full power can also be calculated by using the temperature-dependent, burnup dependent cross-sections. By calculating all of these reactivity effects, operations personnel are able to estimate the total excess reactivity necessary to run the reactor for the given cycle. This method has also been used to estimate the worth of individual control rods. Using this approach, fuel management and core loading can be optimized such that each individual fuel element and fuel-followed control rod is used to its full potential before being replaced with fresh fuel. This fuel management strategy allows a significant cost saving to MNRC by reducing fuel replacement costs and maximizing the usefulness of each element in the inventory...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} fuel burnup, <b>fission</b> product <b>poisoning,</b> and {{hydrogen}} moderator density variation on reactivity in the AGN- 201 reactor are considered. A modified one-group perturbation theory is developed {{and applied to}} changes in parameters resulting from a change in hydrogen moderator density. An equation for the reactivity change is obtained for three models: a bare cylindrical core, a bare core using extrapolated dimensions, and a reflected core. These three equations are then used to predict values of the reactivity increase resulting from interchanging in a new 3 / 4 inch thick fuel disk with comparable fuel disks presently in the core. The results obtained by a digital computer solution of the reactivity equations reveal {{that the increase in}} reactivity varies from 0. 4392 to 0. 7707 %, depending upon the core model and position of the old disk within the core. Because the license of the Naval Postgraduate School does not permit a value of excess reactivity above 0. 40 %, it is concluded that a simple interchange of disks in this manner would produce too large a value of excess reactivity[URL] Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} {{fraction of}} the future energy demand may be satisfied by nuclear power. In this context, the possibilities of worldwide nuclear deployment are studied. We {{are convinced that the}} Molten Salt Reactors may {{play a central role in}} this deployment. The Molten Salt Reactor needs to be coupled to a reprocessing unit in order to extract the <b>Fission</b> Products which <b>poison</b> the core. The efficiency of this reprocessing has a crucial influence on reactor behavior especially for the breeding ratio. The Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project was based on an intensive reprocessing for high breeding purposes. A new concept of Thorium Molten Salt Reactor is presented here.

40|$|Molten salts (fluorides or chlorides) {{have been}} taken in {{consideration}} very soon in nuclear energy production researches. This was initially due to their advantageous physical properties: good heat transfer capacity, radiation insensitivity, high boiling point, [...] {{and they can be}} used in various situations: heat transfer, core coolants with solid fuels, liquid fuel in molten salt reactor, solvents for spent nuclear solid fuel in the case of pyro- reprocessing, fusion. Molten salt reactors which are one of the six innovative concepts chosen by the Generation IV international forum may be particularly interesting in the case of waste incinerators or of the thorium cycle. As the neutron balance is very tight, the possibility to quickly extract <b>poisoning</b> <b>fission</b> products is very attractive.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} novel adjoint and spectral {{methods for}} the sensitivity and uncertainty (S&U) analysis of multi-physics problems {{encountered in the}} field of reactor physics. The first part focuses on the steady state of reactors and extends the adjoint sensitivity analysis methods well established for pure neutron transport problems to coupled criticality calculations, where feedbacks are present between neutronics and other phenomena (e. g. thermalhydraulics or <b>fission</b> product <b>poisoning).</b> The second part presents novel spectral techniques, namely grid and basis adaptive Polynomial Chaos (PC) methods for the S&U analysis of generic problems, together with a large scale application of the developed Fully Adaptive Non-Intrusive Spectral Projection (FANISP) algorithm for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of a transient. Following a short introduction in Chapter 1 {{to some of the most}} frequently used S&U analysis techniques Chapter 2 presents the theory for the adjoint based sensitivity analysis of coupled criticality problems. This enables the computation of first order changes in responses of interest due to variations of both neutronic input parameters (such as cross sections) and those describing augmenting phenomena (e. g. thermal-hydraulics). The chapter also presents a very efficient procedure for calculating the necessary neutronics and augmenting adjoint functions that relies on using Krylov algorithms together with the individual neutron transport and augmenting codes to perform the required matrix-vector multiplications and inversions during preconditioning. As a proof of principle study a one-dimensional slab model is investigated, where two-group diffusion theory is coupled with heat-conduction and xenon-poisoning. In Chapter 3 the larger scale applicability of the coupled adjoint theory is studied. A deeper look into the exact form of the adjoint operators reveals that for the most common cases of coupling neutron transport to thermal-hydraulics and <b>fission</b> product <b>poisoning</b> the effects of the operators can easily be calculated by routines present in the adjoint capable neutron transport and augmenting codes. This enables their reuse with little code modifications, therefore the main challenge lies in the coupling scheme rather than in dedicated code development (once both codes are already suited for solving the individual adjoint problems). As a more realistic application the S&U analysis of a coupled model of an infinite array of fuel pins was performed employing a purpose made thermal-hydraulics code and a general purpose discrete ordinates neutron transport solver. The results confirmed that the preconditioned Krylov algorithm provides excellent performance in calculating the necessary adjoint functions and these properly provide the first order changes of responses of interest due to perturbations in any of the system input parameters. In Chapter 4 the development of novel adaptive Polynomial Chaos techniques is detailed aimed at the S&U analysis of generic problems. Two types of adaptivity is discussed: adaptive sparse grid algorithms relying on Gerstner’s original technique for calculating multidimensional integrals and adaptive PC basis set construction for building up the Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) of responses in an efficient way. The details of the implementation of the developed methods in the FANISP algorithm are also presented and three demonstrational problems are studied. They all focus on specific merits of the adaptive algorithms and confirm that they are significantly more effective than traditional spectral techniques as well as brute force Monte Carlo methods. As a truly large scale, realistic application of the FANISP algorithm the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of an Unprotected Loss Of Flow transient in the GFR 2400 Gas Cooled Fast Reactor is performed in Chapter 5. For dealing with the 42 considered uncertain input parameters two further cost reduction techniques are discussed based on a reduction of dimensionality and an adaptive increase of the global polynomial order. It is shown that due to the non-intrusive nature of the developed PC methods they are easy to apply and can be far more efficient in determining sensitivities, uncertainties and even full probability density functions than standard techniques. The most important merit of the chapter is that it greatly expands the usefulness of PC methods to problems with up to 40 - 50 input parameters, providing a lot of new opportunities for application. In conclusion, the work presented in this thesis provides attractive methods for the sensitivity and uncertainty analysis of the two most common types of multi-physics calculations in the nuclear field, namely determining the coupled steady state and the transient behaviour of reactors. The practical applicability of both the developed coupled adjoint method and the FANISP algorithm was demonstrated, which serves as a strong basis for future use. Since adjoint methods are uniquely capable of taking into account all input parameters at once, whereas PC techniques can deal with nonlinearities, their combined use has even higher potentials. As a closure several possible future research topics are highlighted among the recommendations.

40|$|Just as {{automobiles}} need fuel to operate, so do nuclear reactors. When {{fossil fuels}} such as gasoline are burned to power an automobile, they are consumed immediately and nearly {{completely in the}} process. When the fuel is gone, energy production stops. Nuclear reactors are incapable of achieving this near complete burn-up because as the fuel (uranium) that powers them is burned {{through the process of}} nuclear fission, a variety of other elements are also created and become intimately associated with the uranium. Because they absorb neutrons, which energize the fission process, these accumulating <b>fission</b> products eventually <b>poison</b> the fuel by stopping the production of energy from it. The fission products may also damage the structural integrity of the fuel elements. Even though the uranium fuel is still present, sometimes in significant quantities, it is unburnable and will not power a reactor unless it is separated from the neutron-absorbing fission products by a method called fuel reprocessing. Construction of the Fuel Reprocessing Complex at the Chem Plant started in 1950 with the Bechtel Corporation serving as construction contractor and American Cyanamid Company as operating contractor. Although the Foster Wheeler Corporation assumed responsibility for the detailed working design of the overall plant, scientists at Oak Ridge designed all of the equipment that would be employed in the uranium separations process. After three years of construction activity and extensive testing, the plant was ready to handle its first load of irradiated fuel...|$|R
2500|$|Limited {{graphite}} lifetime - Compact designs have {{a limited}} lifetime for the graphite moderator and fuel / breeding loop separator. Under the influence of fast neutrons, the graphite first shrinks, then expands indefinitely until it becomes very weak and can crack, creating mechanical problems and causing the graphite to absorb enough <b>fission</b> products to <b>poison</b> the reaction. The 1960 two-fluid design had an estimated graphite replacement period of four years. Eliminating graphite from sealed piping was a major incentive {{to switch to a}} single-fluid design. Replacing this large central part requires remotely operated equipment. MSR designs have to arrange for this replacement. In a molten salt reactor, virtually all of the fuel and fission products can be piped to a holding tank. Only a fraction of one percent of the fission products end up in the graphite, primarily due to fission products slamming into the graphite. This makes the graphite surface radioactive, and without recycling/removal of at least the surface layer, creates a fairly bulky waste stream. Removing the surface layer and recycling the remainder of the graphite would solve this issue. Several techniques exist to recycle or dispose of nuclear moderator graphite. Graphite is inert and immobile at low temperatures, so it can be readily stored or buried if required. At least one design used graphite balls (pebbles) floating in salt, which could be removed and inspected continuously without shutting down the reactor. Reducing power density increases graphite lifetime. [...] By comparison, solid-fueled reactors typically replace 1/3 of the fuel elements, including all of the highly radioactive fission products therein, every 12 to 24 months. This is routinely done under a protecting and cooling column layer of water.|$|R
