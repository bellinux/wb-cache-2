Stored data are regarded {{as part of the}} internal state of the entity performing the algorithm. In practice, the state is stored in one or more data structures.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} variant ways {{to write the}} {{equation}} of a line which can all be converted {{from one to another}} by algebraic manipulation. These forms (see Linear equation for other forms) are generally named by the type of <b>information</b> (<b>data)</b> about the line that is needed to write down the form. Some of the important data of a line is its slope, x-intercept, known points on the line and y-intercept.|$|E
25|$|RNA-Seq {{experiments}} {{generate a}} {{large volume of}} raw sequence reads, which have to be processed to yield useful <b>information.</b> <b>Data</b> analysis usually requires a combination of bioinformatics software tools (see also List of RNA-Seq bioinformatics tools) that {{vary according to the}} experimental design and goals. The process can be broken down into four stages: quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression. Most popular RNA-Seq programs are run from a command-line interface, either in a Unix environment or within the R/Bioconductor statistical environment.|$|E

5000|$|The National Biodiversity Centre (Abbreviation: NBC; Chinese: 国家生物多样性中心 Pusat Kepelbagaian Bio Nasional; [...] தேசிய பல்வகை உயிரியல் நிலையம்) is {{a branch}} of the National Parks Board and serves as Singapore’s {{one-stop}} centre for biodiversity-related information and activities. It manages all available <b>information</b> and <b>data</b> on biodiversity in Singapore. Diverse biodiversity-related <b>information</b> and <b>data</b> are currently generated, stored and updated by different organisations and individuals. The National Biodiversity Centre will maximize the usefulness of such <b>information</b> and <b>data</b> by linking them in a single meta-database. Having complete and up-to-date information is crucial for many decision-making processes involving biodiversity. This hub of biodiversity <b>information</b> and <b>data</b> at the National Biodiversity Centre will also allow knowledge gaps to be better identified and addressed.|$|R

Course syllabi were examined using grounded theory techniques that allowed us to identify how faculty were addressing <b>information</b> and <b>data</b> <b>information</b> literacies in their courses, but it also enabled us to understand the interconnectedness of these literacies to other departmental intentions for student learning, such as developing a professional identity or learning to conduct original research. The holistic understanding developed through this research provides the necessary information for designing and suggesting <b>information</b> literacy and <b>data</b> <b>information</b> literacy services to departmental faculty in ways supportive of curricular learning outcomes...|$|R
