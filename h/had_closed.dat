5|$|Imported beer {{had been}} very {{expensive}} during the initial gold rush, costing around $100 a barrel, or approximately $1 a bottle. The Dawson City Brewery had been established in the city by a businessman called T.

5|$|In 2000, the Ranger Uranium Mine in the Northern Territory and the Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam mine in South Australia {{continued}} to operate, but Nabarlek Uranium Mine <b>had</b> <b>closed.</b> A third uranium mine, Beverley Uranium Mine in SA, was also operating. Several advanced projects, such as Honeymoon in SA, Jabiluka in the Northern Territory and Yeelirrie in WA were on hold {{because of political}} and indigenous opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 2000/01, {{the track}} towards Portishead were relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Docks. In 2010, another section of track was {{reinstated}} {{to allow the}} reopening of South Liberty Lane depot to handle Trans Ocean's wine import business, reducing road traffic. Seven trains terminate at the depot every week. The depot <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> in 1990 {{due to lack of}} demand for its facilities.|$|E
5|$|On November 16, 2015, Noodles & Company {{announced}} that it had pulled out of Central Texas, closing all five of its locations in the Austin area.

5|$|The {{days leading}} up to the {{elections}} saw the resignations of several high-profile cabinet ministers. These included the Europe Minister Caroline Flint, Home Secretary Jacqui Smith, the Minister for Children Beverley Hughes, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Hazel Blears, and Work and Pensions Secretary James Purnell, who resigned minutes after the polls for the local and European elections <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> and sent a letter to the Prime Minister calling on him to step aside.|$|E
5|$|The mill {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} TW Monds & Sons until their 1918 merger with T Affleck & Son—which owned the Newry mill at Longford—creating the company Monds & Affleck. Monds & Affleck only operated the mill until 1924, and never reopened it. By 1931 it was reported as having ceased operations years ago. Monds & Affleck sold the mill in 1947, though it is not known when the mill's machinery was removed. By this time the mill was descending into Ruin and had long been vacant. The mill was renovated in 1984 and opened as a restaurant, though four years later it <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> and was being sold. After this it was reopened as a wedding and meeting venue. It <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> again by 2008, but was being renovated with the intention of reopening.|$|E

5|$|After World of Motion <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> on January 2, 1996, {{everything}} inside the ride building was removed. After, new track was constructed {{outside of the}} building which is used as the high-speed test for Test Track. Work inside the building also continued at the same time. It was scheduled to open 29 months after World of Motion's closing, in May 1997, but after numerous problems rose, the ride opening was delayed by nearly 2 years. Also, the cars used on the ride were designed to resemble {{the look of a}} test car that is used to go through multiple safety tests.|$|E
5|$|After the Warrior left, Black Hawk {{decided to}} seek {{refuge in the}} north with the Ojibwes. Only about 50 people, {{including}} Wabokieshiek, agreed to go with him; the others remained, determined to cross the Mississippi and return to Sauk territory. The next morning, on August 2, Black Hawk was heading north {{when he learned that}} the American army <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> in on the members of the British Band who were trying to cross the Mississippi. He tried to rejoin the main body, but after a skirmish with American troops near present-day Victory, Wisconsin, he gave up the attempt. Sauk chief Weesheet later criticized Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek for abandoning the people during the final battle of the war.|$|E
5|$|Another {{controversial}} Peace Prize {{was that}} awarded to Barack Obama in 2009. Nominations <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> only eleven days after Obama took office as President of the United States, {{but the actual}} evaluation occurred over the next eight months. Obama himself stated {{that he did not}} feel deserving of the award, or worthy of the company it would place him in. Past Peace Prize laureates were divided, some saying that Obama deserved the award, and others saying he had not secured the achievements to yet merit such an accolade. Obama's award, along with the previous Peace Prizes for Jimmy Carter and Al Gore, also prompted accusations of a left-wing bias.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the heavy security, {{businesses}} around the tower had seen decreased patronage due to less foot traffic around the heavily secured area. Protests around the tower subsided after his inauguration in January 2017, and by summer 2017, the security measures around the tower had been loosened somewhat, owing to the fact that most security measures were implemented only when Trump was actually in the tower. However, several businesses at the tower's base <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> by then because of a {{reduction in the number of}} customers.|$|E
5|$|As {{the second}} day dawned, the 9th SS Panzer Division {{continued}} to reinforce the German blocking line. Krafft's unit withdrew overnight and joined Spindler's line, coming under his command. Spindler's force was now becoming so large as more men and units arrived at the new front, that {{he was forced to}} split it into two battle groups: Kampfgruppes Allworden and Harder. The defensive line now blocked the entire western side of Arnhem and <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> the gap exploited by Frost alongside the river the previous evening.|$|E

5|$|At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, Corregidor {{left its}} dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to {{overcapacity}} with Filipino civilians seeking {{to escape to}} the southern Philippines after the war had started. It {{has been estimated that}} between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools <b>had</b> <b>closed.</b> Also aboard were military supplies as well the entire artillery complement of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy's Inshore Patrol of the ship's plan to leave Manila Bay.|$|E
5|$|Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian {{attempts}} to drive {{directly into the}} Razih mountains. The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished, and {{it was estimated that}} the Egyptians lost 1,000 men killed, wounded and taken prisoner. Meanwhile, the royalists were building up an offensive. The Egyptian line of communications went from San'a to Amran, then Khairath, where it branched off north-eastwards to Harf. From Harf it turned due south to Farah, and then South-eastwards to Humaidat, Mutamah and Hazm. From Hazm it led south-eastwards to Marib and Harib. A military convoy went over this route twice a month. Since the royalists <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> the direct route across the mountains from San'a to Marib, the Egyptians had no other way.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which <b>had</b> <b>closed</b> in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, encouraged the desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
