25|$|The English naturalist John Ray (29 November 1627 - 17 January 1705) is {{sometimes}} referred to as the father of English natural history. As well as collecting and classifying plants, he wrote two books entitled The Wisdom of God manifested in the Works of the Creation (1691), and Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World (1692), which included essays on The Primitive Chaos and Creation of the World, The General Deluge, its Causes and Effects, and The Dissolution of the World and Future Conflagrations. In The Wisdom of God he included many of the familiar examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature (the teleological argument), such as the structure of the eye, the <b>hollowness</b> of the bones, the camel's stomach and the hedgehog's armor.|$|E
500|$|De Figueiredo and Treuherz {{note that}} when Salvin {{restored}} the two wings that each contain two turrets {{on the front}} of the hall, he left their tops open on two sides, so that they appear solid from the front but not from the back. [...] Hartwell et al in the Buildings of England series, commenting on the appearance of the hall, say [...] "but it is all front". [...] They note [...] "the thinness of the end parts and the <b>hollowness</b> of the sham towers" [...] and state that the [...] "back is without drama", and conclude that [...] "it is a grand concept executed lamely".|$|E
500|$|Brent Burmester said in Audioenz in 2005 that, {{compared}} to the already discontinued Rega 2, the Rega 3 is [...] "tauter, faster, just a little quieter... and better in all the dimensions in which the P2 is already strong. My only niggle was the slight <b>hollowness</b> invested in the lower-midrange". Burmester described the P3 sound as [...] "dynamic, expressive ... fresh and enthusiastic feel, not quite but nearly weaving the illusion that you're sitting in the third row of the auditorium or the engineer's booth at the recording studio. [...] sounded 'newer', more together, sharper, more focused. It's a contemporary sound, not a million miles from well sorted CD players of three times the price".|$|E
500|$|Brad Renfro stars {{alongside}} McKellen as Todd Bowden, a 16-year-old who discovers Denker's criminal past. Singer auditioned {{a couple}} hundred young men and chose 14-year-old Renfro, saying of him, [...] "Brad was the brightest, the most intense and the most real. Not only could he have the intensity when we wanted, there was a <b>hollowness</b> that he could convey, {{and by the end}} of the picture he had to become this empty vessel." [...] Portraying a manipulative character temporarily influenced Renfro, who said that people around him were worried about his state of mind. Renfro said of his performance, [...] "It's a trip I have to take. People just kind of have to leave me alone when I'm doing it. It's my job." [...] Singer described his impression of the character: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his essay}} Love is a Stranger, {{published}} in {{the first volume of}} the Doctor Who Magazine— Special Edition, David Bailey highlights the central idea that [...] "...the lives of little people are precious, special and worth fighting for.....the Eternals may have unimaginable power at their fingertips but they lack, and are jealous of, one thing: the ability to live, and die." [...] The <b>hollowness</b> of immortality was a thread that ran through Season 20, with the earlier story Mawdryn Undead showing Mawdryn trapped in an endless cycle of painful regeneration, while in The Five Doctors, Borusa's prize of immortality results in little more than a living death. The horror of eternal life is brought home when the Black Guardian threatens Turlough with immortality as a punishment for failure, something that drives him to try and commit suicide rather than face eternity.|$|E
500|$|Critics had {{polarized}} {{opinions on}} the production of [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl". Spence D. of IGN Music wrote that [...] "strings create a mournfully thoughtful tone" [...] on the ballad. Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy commended [...] "the pleasant mix of cascading piano and tender strings", but criticized the drum sounds for their <b>hollowness.</b> He nevertheless added that the drums do not prevent the song from being [...] "a classy, well-constructed pop ballad". Nissim concluded that although [...] "the emotion-filled vocals offer yet more proof that [...] {{is one of the}} finest pop singers of her generation", [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] is not as catchy as her best work. Darryl Sterdan of Jam! called it a [...] "grand-piano ballad" [...] that may stand out from pop songs on a regular studio album, but seems monotonous on I Am... Sasha Fierce as it is on a disc that contains ballads only. Negative reviews came from The A.V. Club Michaelangelo Matos, who felt that [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] sounded [...] "unfinished", and Paste magazine's Jessica Suarez, who said Beyoncé's [...] "commanding voice sounds unusually thin" [...] on the ballad. She was unconvinced by the lyrics, noting that the line, [...] "I don't want to play the broken-hearted girl", [...] "rings false". Ben Westhoff of Las Vegas Weekly wrote that it was difficult to guess what inspired the development of the breakup ballad as Beyoncé married Jay-Z a few months before the album's release.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN called [...] "The Dark Defender" [...] "a very {{satisfying}} {{episode of the}} show" [...] and thought that [...] "so far [...] {{doing a very good}} job" [...] of replicating the tension seen in the first season. He was impressed by Dexter's discoveries about his birth mother and adoptive father, but called Debra's romance with Gabriel a [...] "less successful" [...] storyline. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Tom O'Neil called the episode a [...] "standout" [...] because of the parts of Dexter's past that it explored. He stated that, for regular viewers, [...] "this episode is a real knockout", but for unfamiliar viewers, [...] "this whole Dark Defender bit might look pretty corny". TV Squad's Keith McDuffee believed the revelation of Laura's affair with Harry to be [...] "certainly the most shocking moment of the episode", and thought that [...] "One of the brilliant moments of the season so far was Dexter going after one of his mom's killers." [...] Paula Paige of TV Guide called Dexter's monologue about his <b>hollowness</b> [...] "very moving". She thought that his confrontation with his mother's killer [...] "may {{have been one of the}} best shot [...] in the whole series". Blogcritics Ray Ellis praised the [...] "razor-sharp sense of humor" [...] seen in the episode and thought that [...] "In a season of mostly dreary, bland series, Dexter remains the most daring show on television." [...] Dexter and Jimenez's confrontation was named Hall's best scene by Variety critic Stuart Levine.|$|E
500|$|Andy Kellman, {{of review}} website Allmusic, felt that So Amazin was [...] "Milian's strongest album yet, if {{only by a}} narrow margin". He said that the album was short on ideas, with Cool & Dre using beats from some of their recent hits. He felt that Milian's {{weakness}} was ballads, which were [...] "more like placeholders that merely apply some forced variety to the album"; but described the club tracks as [...] "perfectly functional and appealing". Spence Dookey of IGN gave the album a 6.9 out of 10 and said that [...] "Milian glistens most brightly on the tracks that are the most stripped down, such as 'Gonna Tell Everybody'". He said {{given the nature of}} the style of music Milian was practicing, [...] "there's a fair share of rump shaking club jams offsetting the more slow tempo fare". Dookey described single [...] "Say I" [...] as [...] "a poundingly theatrical ditty", and [...] "Foolin'" [...] as one of the [...] "few tracks that genuinely attempts to lift Milian up from the generic R/club stylings". The reviewer found the overall sound was the album's biggest flaw; [...] "the production rings with a sense of detached <b>hollowness</b> ... The result is an album severely lacking any of the warmth that usually accompanies R Milian's hauntingly beautiful voice deserves to be wrapped in a sunny glow of organic vibes." [...] Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters praised the album, [...] "despite a few lyrical hiccups, a couple of lackluster hooks, and some obvious influences." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, {{the hair}} of the hybrids {{exhibits}} a pattern of <b>hollowness,</b> which blends the traits of both polar bears and grizzlies. In cross section, {{the hair of}} polar bears is hollow, while the hair of grizzlies is either solid or has small hollow regions. This varies according to which part of the grizzly the hair is located. In the hybrid male, the paw hair was solid, but the dark back hair was somewhat hollow, albeit with [...] "smaller empty regions than found in polar bear hair". The hair of the female hybrid, [...] "contains a range of hollow regions".|$|E
2500|$|Another set of {{scientific}} arguments against a Hollow Earth or any hollow planet comes from gravity. Massive objects tend to clump together gravitationally, creating non-hollow spherical {{objects such as}} stars and planets. The solid sphere {{is the best way}} in which to minimize the gravitational potential energy of a physical object; having <b>hollowness</b> is [...] unfavorable in the energetic sense. In addition, ordinary matter is not strong enough to support a hollow shape of planetary size against the force of gravity; a planet-sized hollow shell with the known, observed thickness of the Earth's crust {{would not be able to}} achieve hydrostatic equilibrium with its own mass and would collapse.|$|E
2500|$|In Hebrew, {{the word}} נָבִיא (nāvî), [...] "spokesperson", {{traditionally}} translates as [...] "prophet". The second subdivision of the Hebrew Bible, TaNaKh (for [...] "Torah, Nevi'im, Ketuvim"), {{is devoted to}} the Hebrew prophets. The meaning of navi is perhaps described in Deuteronomy 18:18, where God said, [...] "...and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him." [...] Thus, the navi was thought to be the [...] "mouth" [...] of God. The root nun-bet-alef ("navi") is based on the two-letter root nun-bet which denotes <b>hollowness</b> or openness; to receive transcendental wisdom, one must make oneself [...] "open". Cf. Rashbam's comment to Genesis 20:7.|$|E
2500|$|The word challah likely {{comes from}} the Hebrew root halal. The {{etymology}} of this root is uncertain. It may originally have indicated roundness ("circle") and then also came to denote <b>hollowness</b> ("space"), or vice versa. The special Sabbath bread was originally called yachov in Hebrew, since it was baked {{in the form of}} a round loaf.. It also connotes [...] "let go" [...] of something, to put space between things, (as the dough is taken from the family bread dough, and [...] "let go" [...] to the priests. It is also now known as cholla bread. The bread was adopted by bakers in Poland and Russian Empire and is known as chałka (diminutive of chała) in Poland and khala (хала) in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine.|$|E
2500|$|Joanne Gordon, {{author and}} Chair and Artistic Director, Theatre, at California State University, Long Beach ]) wrote [...] "Follies {{is in part}} an affectionate look at the American musical theater between the two World Wars and {{provides}} Sondheim {{with an opportunity to}} use the traditional conventions of the genre to reveal the <b>hollowness</b> and falsity of his characters' dreams and illusions. The emotional high generated by the reunion of the Follies girls ultimately gives way to anger, disappointment, and a weary resignation to reality." [...] "Follies contains two scores: the Follies pastiche numbers and the book numbers." [...] Some of the Follies numbers imitate the style of particular composers of the early 20th century: [...] Losing My Mind is in the style of a George Gershwin ballad [...] "The Man I Love". [...] Sondheim noted that the song [...] "The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues" [...] is [...] "another generic pastiche: vaudeville music for chases and low comics, but with a patter lyric...I tried to give it the sardonic knowingness of Lorenz Hart or Frank Loesser." ...|$|E
2500|$|Den of Geek gave an {{overwhelmingly}} positive {{review of the}} series giving it four stars out of five saying, [...] "It is the most consistent of the new series so far (in fact, of the show’s 45 year history)". They praised the special effects as never being better citing [...] "The Fires of Pompeii", [...] "Planet of the Ood" [...] and the finale as [...] "the epitome of what The Mill can do". They praised the acting talents of David Tennant and Catherine Tate saying, [...] "never have we had it so good...she [...] displayed such a fine grasp of character that even David Tennant was left slightly in the shade by her energetic, thoughtful, hopeful and achingly sorrowful (not to mention damn funny to boot) performance". However they criticised the familiarity of the Sontaran two-parter and the <b>hollowness</b> of [...] "Voyage of the Damned". Overall they said, [...] "series four was never anything less than stunning, there were no ‘lows’ it was all ‘highs’," [...] and praised Russell T. Davies. They summed up the series as [...] "astonishing".|$|E
2500|$|On November 23, 1923, Urmuz shot himself, {{an event}} which remains {{shrouded}} in mystery. His death {{occurred in a}} public location, described as being close to Kiseleff Road in northern Bucharest. Some early sources suggest {{that he may have}} been suffering from an incurable disease, but he is also argued to have been fascinated with guns and their destructive potential. In 1914 for instance, he wrote down in his papers a homage to revolvers, crediting them with a magical power over the suicidal brain. Reports also show that he was theorizing the purposelessness and <b>hollowness</b> of life, addressing his fears on the subject to family members during the funeral of his brother Constantin (also in 1914). Researcher Geo Șerban wrote about Demetrescu-Buzău's well-hidden disappointment, assessing that, during his final year, the writer continued to act cheerful and relaxed, but that a [...] "devastating" [...] tension was building up inside him. At around that time, Urmuz took his one real trip as an adult civilian, visiting the Budaki Lagoon in Bessarabia.|$|E
2500|$|The Los Angeles Times {{was one of}} the {{few major}} news outlets to publish a {{negative}} review on the film's opening weekend. Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "The writer-director appears to be straining for his effects. Some sequences, especially one involving bondage harnesses and homosexual rape, have the uncomfortable feeling of creative desperation, of someone who's afraid of losing his reputation scrambling for any way to offend sensibilities." [...] Some who reviewed it in the following weeks took more exception to the predominant critical reaction than to Pulp Fiction itself. While not panning the film, Stanley Kauffmann of The New Republic felt that [...] "the way that [...] has been so widely ravened up and drooled over verges on the disgusting. Pulp Fiction nourishes, abets, cultural slumming." [...] Responding to comparisons between Tarantino's film and the work of French New Wave director Jean-Luc Godard, especially his first, most famous feature, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader wrote, [...] "The fact that Pulp Fiction is garnering more extravagant raves than Breathless ever did tells you plenty about which kind of cultural references are regarded as more fruitful— namely, the ones we already have and don't wish to expand." [...] Observing in the National Review that [...] "o film arrives with more advance hype", John Simon was unswayed: [...] "titillation cures neither <b>hollowness</b> nor shallowness".|$|E
2500|$|The Fragile {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} contemporary critics. Mojo called it [...] "an impressively multi-textured, satisfyingly violent sonic workout", and Alternative Press found it [...] "nothing short of astounding". Edna Gundersen of USA Today called it [...] "meticulously honed and twisted to baffle, tantalize, disarm and challenge the listener", and wrote that [...] "the coats of polish ... can't camouflage Trent Reznor's perverse and subversive paths to musical glory." [...] Ann Powers of Spin called the album [...] "a good old-fashioned strap-on-your-headphones experience". Jon Pareles of The New York Times wrote that, although he [...] "doesn't approach suicide {{as he did}} on" [...] The Downward Spiral, [...] "Reznor can hide {{in the studio and}} piece together music that's as cunning, and disquieting, as his raw anger used to be." [...] Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly viewed that, even [...] "if [...] emotional palette is limited, it remains broader than any of his metalhead peers", and that, [...] "right now, hard rock simply doesn't get any smarter, harder, or more ambitious than this." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times wrote that, despite its length, [...] "this is a profoundly challenging and moving work that strikes at the <b>hollowness</b> of most contemporary pop-rock with bullwhip force." [...] The Guardians Adam Sweeting praised it as [...] "a fearsomely accomplished mix of monster riffing, brooding melodies and patches of minimalist soul-searching". Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield felt that the album's [...] "excess is Reznor's chosen shock tactic here, and what's especially shocking is how much action he packs into his digital via dolorosa." ...|$|E
