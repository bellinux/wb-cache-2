500|$|More than 1,000 viewers {{complained to}} ITV {{and more than}} 2,000 to Ofcom when, in week 5 of the live shows, Cole refused to vote off either act in the bottom two (Cohen and Waissel) and {{was not allowed to}} vote last and force a deadlock. A {{spokesperson}} for The X Factor explained: [...] "A judge can abstain from placing a vote. [...] made it clear that she would not send anyone home and therefore abstained from voting. [...] went back to her to clarify that it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> majority vote if she did that. [...] was unable to take the vote to deadlock as deadlock requires a valid active vote." [...] However, a Daily Mail poll of 6,890 people showed that 4,795 of them wanted Cole to be sacked for refusing to vote. O'Leary revealed that during the previous commercial break, when the bottom two was known to the producers, they realized that Cole might abstain and decided in that if she did, they would go to a majority vote. After the series ended, voting statistics showed that Waissel received fewer votes than Cohen, meaning that if the result went to deadlock, Waissel would have been eliminated.|$|E
2500|$|Bahraini {{human rights}} groups and {{opposition}} parties have heavily criticized recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces. Nabeel Rajab said [...] "They're told they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> holy war in Bahrain to kill some non-Muslims or kafir [...] or Shias ... And those are maybe responsible {{for a lot of}} killing and a lot of systematic torture and human rights violations committed in the past months and years". Michael Stephens, of the Royal United Services Institute linked recruiting mercenaries in the Bahraini security forces to the lack of government confidence in its own citizens. [...] "So they rely on foreign recruits to unquestioningly carry out orders of violently suppressing protests", he said. Bruce Riedel, a leading American expert on South Asia said [...] "when the very serious demonstrations began and it looked like the regime might even be toppled at a certain point, their hiring of mercenaries went up substantially".|$|E

And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|R
