5|$|A {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the skeletal remains revealed injuries including a broken ankle, and a double <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> the larynx which indicated strangulation {{as the cause of}} death. At times, both Mme M'Barek and her brother admitted their involvement in the death of Lord Shaftesbury and the French authorities decided to charge both her and her brother with the crime of premeditated murder.|$|E
5|$|Gunn {{was unable}} to save the club from relegation to the First Division, but signed a two-year {{contract}} in July 1998. However, a hairline <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> his leg, sustained during the 1998 close season, effectively ended his playing career. On his doctors' advice, Gunn formally retired in March 1999.|$|E
5|$|Smith lost Morrell and Trundle on free transfers, and {{replaced}} them with Chris Armstrong and Chris Llewellyn. The club's financial problems meant that players went unpaid at the start of 2003–04, although they remained in the play-off places in December 2003. However, a hairline <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> Shaun Pejic left Smith short of defenders and the promotion challenge ebbed away to a mid-table finish. Wrexham retained the FAW Premier Cup though with a 4–1 victory over Rhyl. However, Smith made himself unpopular with supporters after refusing to endorse their campaign to oust controversial chairman Alex Hamilton.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fractures</b> <b>to</b> {{the first}} {{metacarpal}} bone account for 30-40% of all hand fractures and 25% of all metacarpal <b>fractures</b> (second <b>to</b> <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the fifth metacarpal bone). 80% of <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the first metacarpal occur at its base.|$|R
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of these various definitions, <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the carpal bones are referred <b>to</b> as carpal <b>fractures,</b> while fractures such as distal radius fracture are often considered <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the wrist.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss the {{treatment}} of <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the hand given the importance of this organ in terms of functional anatomy. After classifying the various types of fractures, surgery and rehabilitation options for all types are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on therapy for the most frequently seen lesions such as <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the scaphoid, the fifth metacarpal and the base of the first metacarpal. The importance of the use of prophylaxis against stiffness and treatment for oedema, which are commonly seen in <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> the hand, is also highlighted...|$|R
5|$|After {{a strong}} {{performance}} by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team's 5–0 1992 preseason, Coslet promoted {{him to the}} starting lineup. Despite throwing {{for a total of}} 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener, then the second-highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut, the team lost 20–17; the Jets lost their first four games. Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27, 1992, having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season. Two days later, defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg stepped forward in the pocket as the two players were about to sandwich him. Mersereau managed to walk away and continue his career with New York, but Byrd suffered a <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> his C-5 vertebra that left him partially paralyzed. Inspired by Byrd's persistent high spirits, New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills. The Jets finished the season 4–12.|$|E
5|$|With Blackburn {{now in the}} Championship, Slew {{was still}} unable to make the break into the first team and was instead loaned to League One side Oldham Athletic for six months in August 2012. Slew scored on his Oldham debut, netting in a 2–4 League Cup loss to Sheffield Wednesday a week after signing. After only four {{appearances}} for his temporary club, Slew suffered a stress <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> his back and was sidelined for over three months, returning to Blackburn Rovers for treatment, and effectively ending his loan spell. Having recovered from his injury, Slew signed a six-week loan deal with League Two side Rotherham United {{at the end of}} January 2013. Slew's first appearance for Rotherham came just two days later, in a 3–1 win against promotion rivals Northampton Town, and he played regularly for the duration of his loan spell, making seven appearances in total. Despite Rotherham hoping to retain Slew's services {{until the end of the}} season, they were unable to agree a deal with Blackburn Rovers, and Slew returned to Ewood Park once more.|$|E
5|$|He {{suffered}} a stress <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> the pubic bone which {{kept him out}} {{for more than three}} months from November 2007 until he returned to first-team action for Middlesbrough's 2–0 FA Cup victory over Mansfield Town on 26 January 2008. He was sent off in the 80th minute in a match against Arsenal on 15 March 2008 after kicking Gaël Clichy in the face with his boot, which resulted in him receiving a three-match ban. Mido was ruled out {{for the remainder of the}} 2007–08 season in April following a hernia operation on a pelvic injury. He made the bench for Middlesbrough's opening Premier League fixture against former club Tottenham and came on as a substitute in the 82nd minute and scored four minutes later after deflecting Didier Digard's shot. The following weekend saw him score against Liverpool at Anfield to put Middlesbrough 1–0 in the lead, but they eventually lost the game 2–1. This was followed up with goals against Yeovil Town in the League Cup and Portsmouth in the league. Mido was again targeted by some Newcastle fans while warming up before Middlesbrough's 0–0 draw, with claims of racist chanting being investigated by The FA. He revealed his anger at The FA's investigation, believing that they would make no difference to any future abuse. Two men were eventually arrested over the chanting and were due to appear at Teesside Magistrates Court.|$|E

In [...] "tight" [...] rock (low permeability) like the Barnett Shale, the gas uses <b>fractures</b> <b>to</b> {{move out of}} the rock and into the wellbore. The fractures may be natural or induced (see below). A horizontal well exposes more rock (and therefore more <b>fractures)</b> <b>to</b> the wellbore because it is usually designed with the horizontal portion of the well in the productive formation.|$|R

25|$|Tottenham's {{final game}} of August was against newly {{promoted}} Birmingham City.

The game was marred for Spurs, however, as it was confirmed that influential midfielder Luka Modrić had suffered a <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> his fibula, forcing him to miss a number of weeks in the season.|$|E
25|$|A form {{of surgery}} is the {{so-called}} fronto-supraorbital advancement and remodelling. Firstly, the supraorbital bar is remodelled by a wired greenstick <b>fracture</b> <b>to</b> straighten it. Secondly, the supraorbital bar is moved 2cm. forward and fixed only to the frontal process of the zygoma without fixation to the cranium. Lastly, the frontal bone is divided into two, rotated and attached to the supraorbital bar causing a nude area (craniectomy) between the parietal bone and frontal bone. Bone will eventually regenerate since the dura mater lies underneath (the dura mater has osteogenic capabilities). This results in an advancement and straightening of the forehead.|$|E
