25|$|A failed two-year {{relationship}} with Australian model Helena Vestergaard, {{who was only}} 19 when they began dating in 2012 (he was 50), served as {{a major influence on}} his songwriting for the band's 2016 album, The Getaway which often has Kiedis questioning their relationship and the age difference between the two. “Lyrically, I’m embarrassed to say, but a two-year relationship that completely fell apart like a nuclear bomb just left me feeling pretty raw and available to the emotional universe for writing. So even though the relationship {{was a bit of a}} disaster, I feel that in some way <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> something out of it, which was about half the songs on this record,” Kiedis said.|$|E
500|$|In late 1963, Eastwood's co-star on Rawhide, Eric Fleming, {{rejected}} {{an offer}} to star in an Italian-made western called A Fistful of Dollars, to be directed in a remote region of Spain by the then relatively unknown Sergio Leone. Richard Harrison suggested Eastwood to Leone because Harrison knew Eastwood could play a cowboy convincingly. Eastwood thought the film would be an opportunity to escape from his Rawhide image. Eastwood signed a contract for $15,000 in wages for elevenweeks' work, with a bonus of a Mercedes automobile upon completion. Eastwood later spoke of {{the transition from a}} television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat. The hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I {{decided it was time to}} be an anti-hero." [...] Eastwood was instrumental in creating the Man with No Name character's distinctive visual style and, although a non-smoker, Leone insisted Eastwood smoke cigars as an essential ingredient of the [...] "mask" [...] he was attempting to create for the loner character.|$|E
500|$|Bond next {{created the}} role of Pitti-Sing in The Mikado (1885–87), one of the [...] "three little maids from school." [...] Sometimes, {{inspiration}} for plot points in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas was provided by characteristics of the performers themselves. [...] For instance, Gilbert noted {{in an interview that}} the fact that the female singers to be engaged for The Mikado, Leonora Braham, Bond, and Sybil Grey, were all of short stature inspired him to make them schoolgirls—three [...] "little" [...] maids—and to treat them as a closely linked trio throughout the work as much as possible. [...] Bond, however, knew how to stand out on stage. [...] During preparations for The Mikado, she persuaded the wardrobe mistress to make the obi of her costume twice as big as that of the other [...] "little maids". [...] She wrote: [...] "I made the most of my big, big bow, turning my back to the audience whenever I got a chance, and waggling it. [...] The gallery was delighted, but I nearly got the sack for that prank! [...] However, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> noticed, which was what I wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, it was like I was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simpson was a {{good student}} as a child but was also [...] "a clown" [...] and [...] "a smart aleck who used to make jokes in class. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> in trouble a lot when I was older and then I didn't like school so much anymore." [...] She {{attended}} Beverly Hills High School and received a scholarship to attend University of California, Berkeley where she studied poetry:"I stuck with poetry as long as I could — {{as far as my}} talent would take me." [...] After she finished her B.A. at Berkeley, she worked at a job during the days and worked as a journalist during the nights and on the weekends. She enjoyed journalism and hoped for a position with the Richmond Independent Gazette but did not receive it. She then attended graduate school at Columbia University and received her M.F.A from there. While a student at Columbia, she was an editor for Paris Review.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{interviewed by}} FourFourTwo magazine, McManaman stated, [...] "I think I {{probably}} least enjoyed my time when Glenn Hoddle was the manager. But I wouldn't {{say he was}} necessarily the worst. He had his ways of training and ways of acting and all managers have different ways of doing things; it's the same with club managers. Sometimes when you join up with England and you don't play {{as often as you}} did under a certain other manager – then you'll think it's terrible. I loved going to play with England. For instance, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> to go to the World Cup even though I only played for 17 minutes. That kind of experience leaves an indelible mark on your mind. So I don't really think of it in terms of [...] "worst"; but going to the World Cup and not playing much was a big thing for me, really, and that was under Glenn, of course." [...] Hoddle also notably arranged for McManaman to meet a disabled fan (and thus fulfill his lifelong wish of meeting McManaman) while the fan {{was on the verge of}} death, in 1997, to great media acclaim, though the story only broke a year after Hoddle had been sacked from the England job for alleged disparaging comments about disabled people.|$|E
2500|$|Eastwood was not {{the first}} actor {{approached}} to play the main character. Originally, Sergio Leone intended Henry Fonda to play the [...] "Man with No Name." [...] However, the production company could not afford to employ a major Hollywood star. Next, Leone offered Charles Bronson the part. He, too, declined, arguing that the script was bad. Both Fonda and Bronson would later star in Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West (1968). Other actors who turned the role down were Henry Silva, Rory Calhoun, Tony Russel, Steve Reeves, Ty Hardin, and James Coburn. Leone then turned his attention to Richard Harrison, an expatriate American actor who had recently starred in the very first Italian western, Duello nel Texas. Harrison, however, had not been impressed with his experience on that previous film and refused. The producers later presented a list of available, lesser-known American actors and asked Harrison for advice. Harrison suggested Eastwood, who he knew could play a cowboy convincingly. Harrison later stated, [...] "Maybe my greatest contribution to cinema was not doing A Fistful of Dollars and recommending Clint for the part." [...] Eastwood later spoke about transitioning from a television western to A Fistful of Dollars: [...] "In Rawhide, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>get</b> awfully tired of playing the conventional white hat ... the hero who kisses old ladies and dogs and was kind to everybody. I {{decided it was time to}} be an anti-hero." ...|$|E
