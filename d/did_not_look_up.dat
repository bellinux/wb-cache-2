500|$|The tour {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Jason Stratley from The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "On stage, wiggling and writhing, a rock-video vision of messy, bleached- blond hair, bare skin, sequined paisley and dime store diamonds was the flash-and-trash rock queen Madonna. Behold the Madonna clones—she {{is turning into}} one fine legend." [...] Jeff Sewald from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] "the modus operandi [...] was clear. Madonna was not only selling her music to throngs of teen-agers and adults alike, but she was selling herself and the entire package {{proved to be a}} joy for the 14,500 screaming fans. [...] Madonna's 'Virgin Tour' had torn the cover off Pittsburgh's sexuality." [...] Rachel Lee from The Sacramento Bee felt that [...] "more than any pop star in recent memory, even Boy George and Prince, Madonna is an image. Her hour-long concert here Tuesday night, as professionally performed and well-choreographed as it was, did nothing to give her more dimension than the two already bestowed on her." [...] Arthur Daniels from Lexington Herald-Leader felt that [...] "Madonna looked grim, but the fans were delighted when the blond rock star made her first major concert appearance to kick off her 'Virgin Tour'. [...] She looked blank and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> as she passed fans who gathered by the stage door before the show." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{media reports}} {{initially}} suggested that Abhishek Bachchan was being considered {{to portray the}} role of Vijay Chauhan, director Karan Malhotra approached Hrithik Roshan for the role. Roshan, however was sceptical on taking up a role earlier played by Amitabh Bachchan and agreed to star in the film only after months of deliberation. He said, [...] "The script had so much passion that I felt very emotional and I {{made up my mind}} to do it". [...] On casting Hrithik, Malhotra explained, [...] "Hrithik has the charm of a boy and the attitude of a man. Also, he has a certain vulnerability, which I was looking in my characterisation of Vijay Dinananth Chauhan." [...] While explaining the character of Vijay Chauhan, Malhotra added, [...] "Nobody can play Vijay the way Amitabh Bachchan did, and I would have wanted my Vijay to be subtle even if it wasn't Hrithik. I wanted the negative characters in my film to be bigger. This made Hrithik's victory seem bigger." [...] In preparation for the film, Roshan <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> Bachchan's performance in the original for inspiration, as he considered his role to be completely different. Roshan, however, faced several difficulties while filming. He suffered from a severe back injury, which caused him considerable pain, throughout the shooting schedule. In an interview with Filmfare he quoted, [...] "Agneepath is the hardest I’ve ever worked in my life. I didn’t know what the film had in store for me. I’ve never been so tired in my life. I have exhausted my body completely." ...|$|E

60|$|If we <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to the Landlord, we look round {{for him on}} all emergencies, for {{he is a man}} of {{infinite}} experience, who unites hands with wit. He is a more public character than a statesman,--a publican, and not consequently a sinner; and surely, he, if any, should be exempted from taxation and military duty.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} with the narrator calling [...] "Halloa! Below there!" [...] into a railway cutting. The {{signalman}} standing on the railway below <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> as the narrator expects, but rather turns about and stares into the railway tunnel that is his responsibility to monitor. The narrator calls down again and asks permission to descend. The signalman seems reluctant.|$|R
40|$|SCENE ONE: A home {{room in a}} Catholic High School in South Philadelphia. The boy sits {{quietly in}} the first aisle, third desk, reading a book. He <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> <b>not</b> even for a moment. He is hoping no one will {{remember}} he is sitting there. He wishes he were invisible. The teacher is not yet in the classroom so the other boys are talking and laughing loudly...|$|R

50|$|Raymond Wong Ho-yin as Wong Hon-yip (黃漢業), Wong Fei-hung's second son. He {{is a young}} {{reporter}} that knows no harm {{to what he was}} doing.

The knot was untied after a trouble he got into during reporting, however it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> last long as he was killed in a drunk fight involving Sam-shui.

60|$|Blakeney paid no heed {{seemingly}} to the other's hesitation. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> at him, but quietly drew pen {{and paper}} towards him, and made ready to write.|$|R

60|$|The pass is gloomy and damp, {{the water}} roars unceasingly, till {{it is almost}} like a {{constant}} pain. The driver of the pack-horses, as he comes up the narrow path {{in the side of}} the gorge, cringes his sturdy cheerfulness as if to obliterate himself, drawing near to the large, pale Christ, and he takes his hat off as he passes, though he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up,</b> but keeps his face averted from the crucifix. He hurries by in the gloom, climbing the steep path after his horses, and the large white Christ hangs extended above.|$|R
60|$|Then one memorable day a {{new idea}} came to Ugh-lomi. The horse looks down and level, but he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up.</b> No animals <b>look</b> up--they have too much common-sense. It was only that fantastic creature, man, could waste his wits skyward. Ugh-lomi made no {{philosophical}} deductions, but he perceived the thing was so. So he spent a weary day in a beech that stood in the open, while Eudena stalked. Usually the horses went into the shade {{in the heat of}} the afternoon, but that day the sky was overcast, and they would not, in spite of Eudena's solicitude.|$|R

60|$|Betty {{was very}} pale and silent. She <b>did</b> <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> from the pistol she was loading when Tom entered. The boy Tolly, however, {{looked at his}} tall, strong figure with evident satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|As he {{uttered the}} malediction the {{disappointed}} man heaved a last stone, angrily and without {{an attempt at}} an aim. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to observe the result, but turned sharply round towards the camp.|$|R
60|$|No {{one else}} said a word. The captain <b>did</b> <b>not</b> even <b>look</b> <b>up</b> {{to see who}} had spoken. He felt the justice {{as well as the}} {{harshness}} of the remark, and poured the water back into the jar.|$|R

50|$|This {{side bend}} may cause issues in {{practitioners}} with lower back problems.Farhi warns {{that those with}} posterolateral disc herniation may find the twisting in this asana challenging the back. Iyengar advises: those prone to dizzy spells, vertigo, or high blood pressure <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> {{down at the floor}} in the final asana or turn the head; those with cervical spondylosis <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> for too long; those with a cardiac condition practise against a wall and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> raise the arm, but rest it along the hip; and those with stress-related headaches, migraine, eye strain, diarrhoea, low blood pressure, psoriasis, varicose veins, depression or extreme fatigue <b>do</b> <b>not</b> practise this asana.Satyananda Saraswati states that the asana should not be practiced by those suffering from severe back conditions.|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of disliking relations {{depends on how}} adolescents perceive the relative informal status of their peers. This notion is examined on a longitudinal sample using dynamic network analysis (585 students across 16 classes in 5 schools). As hypothesized individuals dislike those who they look down on (disdain) and conform to others by disliking those who they perceive as being looked down on by their peers (conformity). The inconsistency between status perceptions also leads to disliking, when individuals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to those who they perceive to be admired by peers (frustration). No evidence is found that adolescents <b>do</b> <b>not</b> dislike those who they <b>look</b> <b>up</b> to (admiration). Results demonstrate the role of status perceptions on disliking tie formation.
