In 1931, <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, Islamism, and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal.|$|E

5|$|His {{enthusiasm for}} {{teaching}} at the university ebbed in his final years there. He was also perturbed {{by an increase in}} religious enthusiasm on campus and a temperance movement, which he mildly protested. Tucker zealously defended higher salaries for more tenured professors, and he was enraged when the University reduced his annual salary from $1500 to $1000. Having produced documentation proving that Jefferson had intended his salary be guaranteed for life, <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> the university to reinstate his original salary.|$|E

He {{worked for the}} Quebec Provincial Police until the mid-1960s, {{when he decided to}} become a wrestler. His friend Paul LeDuc had competed as a professional wrestler in Mexico and wanted a tag team partner. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> Pigeon to train as a wrestler, and Pigeon trained under Stu Hart in Calgary, Alberta.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{previous}} album, 1989's Mother's Milk {{would become}} the band's second album to enter in the Billboard 200, peaking at number 52 {{and at the time}} the biggest of their career. Although the record was mildly successful, production was weighed down by producer Michael Beinhorn. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> Frusciante to play with an overall heavier tone, and instructed Kiedis to write lyrics that would be more radio viable, thus causing the band to feel restricted creatively.|$|E

5|$|The {{change in}} tactics {{appeared}} to be effective, as October state elections in Ohio and Indiana resulted in Republican victories there, discouraging Democrats about their chances the following month. Democratic party leaders had selected English as Hancock's running mate because of his popularity in Indiana. With their state-level defeat there, some talked of dropping English from the ticket, but <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> them that the October losses owed more to local issues, and that the Democratic ticket could still carry Indiana, if not Ohio, in November.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{convince}} Fermi {{that this was}} the case, Szilard set out on his own. He obtained permission from the head of the Physics Department at Columbia, George B. Pegram, to use a laboratory for three months. To fund his experiment, he borrowed $2,000 from a fellow inventor, Benjamin Liebowitz. He wired Frederick Lindemann at Oxford and asked him to send a beryllium cylinder. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> Walter Zinn to become his collaborator, and hired Semyon Krewer to investigate processes for manufacturing pure uranium and graphite.|$|E
5|$|A {{company board}} member, Victor Coen, was {{convinced}} that the company had been treated wrongly and insisted in bringing it before the courts. In May 1929, <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> the rest of the board to issue a writ against the syndicate and Oppenheimer, alleging fraudulent conspiracy, and began instructing Hastings. Hastings worried that the case would become unmanageable, with the syndicate relying on over 4,000 documents for their defence, but luckily found a certificate showing that the company profits, rather than the five percent Oppenheimer had reported, were in fact seventeen percent.|$|E

5|$|Adams and the {{correspondence}} committees promoted {{opposition to the}} Tea Act. In every colony except Massachusetts, protesters were able to force the tea consignees to resign or to return the tea to England. In Boston, however, Governor Hutchinson was determined to hold his ground. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> the tea consignees, two of whom were his sons, not to back down. The Boston Caucus and then the Town Meeting attempted to compel the consignees to resign, but they refused. With the tea ships about to arrive, Adams and the Boston Committee of Correspondence contacted nearby committees to rally support.|$|E
5|$|After the Boston Massacre, Adams {{and other}} town leaders met with Bernard's {{successor}} Governor Thomas Hutchinson and with Colonel William Dalrymple, the army commander, {{to demand the}} withdrawal of the troops. The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning the outcome of the trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
5|$|After the LCL lost {{government}} in 1970, primarily {{owing to the}} electoral reform, Hall managed to be re-elected as leader. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> {{a majority of the}} party's membership that reform was needed, and sought to remove the influence that the party's representatives in the Legislative Council held. When the Dunstan government again introduced a bill to introduce universal suffrage to the council, Hall gained the support of 7 out of 20 members in the Assembly, but only 2 of 16 LCL members in the Legislative Council supported the bill. Internally, there was much opposition to any electoral reform when the matter was debated at party conferences.|$|E

5|$|Auriemma {{pulled off}} another huge {{recruiting}} coup when <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> All-American guard Diana Taurasi to travel across country to attend Connecticut. Taurasi hailed from Chino, California, and attended Don Lugo High School {{where she was}} {{the recipient of the}} 2000 Cheryl Miller Award, presented by the Los Angeles Times to the best player in southern California. She was also named the 2000 Naismith and Parade Magazine National High School Player of the Year.

5|$|Auriemma {{pulled off}} {{one of his biggest}} and most {{important}} early recruiting successes in 1987 when <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and Tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance; the tournament ended in a first round loss. With Bascom and teammates Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.|$|E
5|$|Before {{his death}} in 1107, Richard the abbot of Ely had {{attempted}} to secure from the papacy the elevation of his abbey into a bishopric. After Richard's death, Hervey was appointed to oversee the abbey during the vacancy. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> the monks of Ely to support Richard's project, which received the conditional approval of Archbishop Anselm, contingent on papal approval. Paschal signalled his approval, and in 1109 the monastery became a bishopric. Ely still remained a monastic house, as the abbey itself became the cathedral and the monks of the abbey became the monks of the cathedral chapter. Also in 1109, the pope approved Hervey's translation to a new see, and he was made Bishop of Ely. He was enthroned at Ely in October 1109.|$|E

Raju hears about an idea for doubling his wealth from a con woman, Anuradha (Bipasha Basu), who is claiming to be a bank manager, and <b>he</b> <b>convinces</b> Shyam and Baburao {{to go along with}} it. Raju first arranges for 30 lakh from Shyam and Baburao and then a further 50 lakh by selling their bungalow. <b>He</b> <b>convinces</b> a small-time goon, Pappu (Rajpal Yadav) to contribute the remaining balance of 20 lakh so that he can come up with the minimum deposit of 1 crore, which Anuradha has promised to double.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of Results May Vary track listing, Page Hamilton of Helmet and Rivers Cuomo of Weezer recorded songs with Limp Bizkit for the album; Al Jourgensen of Ministry also joined the band in the studio. Jourgensen claims that <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> Fred Durst to strip naked and wear a cowboy hat while singing. The contributions of all three were omitted from the finished album. Bubba Sparxxx joined Durst in a Los Angeles studio, but his contributions also {{did not make the}} album. Durst wrote over 30 songs with Limp Bizkit drummer John Otto and the band's bassist, Sam Rivers. During production of Results May Vary, Durst listened to the Cure, Patsy Cline, Mazzy Star and classical music.|$|E
5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before <b>he</b> <b>convinced</b> Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to have a similar biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Bret Hart was {{scheduled}} to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. <b>He</b> <b>convinced</b> his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.|$|E
