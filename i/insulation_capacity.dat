Recently, different types of sandwich components using composite materials have been developed with the purpose of combining the effect of reinforced face-sheets with low weight core materials, such as honeycombs and foams.

Cork composites can be considered as an alternative material for sandwich components since cork is a natural material with some remarkable properties, such as high damage tolerance to impact loads, good thermal and acoustic <b>insulation</b> <b>capacities</b> and excellent damping characteristics for the suppression of vibrations. The experiments carried out in this investigation were oriented in order to optimize the specific strength of cork based composites for sandwich components.

40|$|Since ancient times, the {{enhancement}} of properties of fired clay products was solved by adding different materials to the clay mixtures. The role of added materials, such as sand or vegetal materials (mainly straw) was to reduce the plasticity of mixtures — slenderizing — for shaping. But the non-plastic components introduced also inhibited the shrinkage of products, by two mechanisms. Frequently, excessive plasticity of raw clays was treated {{by the addition of}} vegetal materials, usually straw. The same technique was applied when an increase in the dry mechanical resistance was desired. By the increasing energy demand of heating of buildings for human living, the attention of brick producers was directed towards the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> of building materials.

40|$|When {{exposed to}} a surface fire, the {{probability}} of a tree to survive widely varies, depending on its capability to protect the cambium from lethal temperatures above 60 °C. Thereby, the bark, the entirety of all tissues outside the cambium, serves as an insulation layer. In laboratory experiments, the heat production of a surface fire was simulated and the time span Tau 60 until the temperature of 60 °C is reached in the inner bark surface was measured. Thereby, Tau 60 - as a measure of the fire resistance - was quantitatively determined for seven tree species. In addition, the influence of bark thickness and moisture content on bark heat <b>insulation</b> <b>capacities</b> was examined. Independent of the tree species and bark moisture content a power function correlation between bark thickness and Tau 60 was found. Our results also show that fire resistance increases with decreasing bark density. The seven tree species examined can be classified in two groups differing highly significant in their bark structure: (1) tree species with a faintly structured bark, which show a low fire resistance, and (2) tree species with an intensely structured bark, showing a high fire resistance. Furthermore a mathematical model simulating heat conduction was applied to describe the experimental results, and some ideas for a transfer into biomimetic materials are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{insulation}} panels {{developed in}} our previous study are composed of wood shavings cold-pressed into a mat with a density of around 100 kg/m 3 without any binder. This elastic mat is lapped with plastic film that works as a damp proof course and is installed between studs or joists of timber frame houses. In the fireproof test of this insulation panel, it was observed that our insulation panels remained unbroken between studs after they burned, which suggests that a wood shaving elastic mat can hardly shrink in its compressive direction. This led to the present research work, carbonizing our insulation panels for better <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> and durability since changes of macro and micro-pores caused by carbonization may provide our panels with better <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> and carbonization itself can remove a risk of decay. In this paper, thermal conductivities of the panels are discussed in relation to their manufacturing factors such as initial panel density and carbonizing temperature. Panels with an initial density of 150, 200, 250 and 300 kg/m^ 3 and with a size of 200 by 200 by 50 mm were manufactured and then, they were carbonized at five different temperatures of 300, 400, 500, 600 and 700 ℃. A good panel formability was obtained at a combination of 200 - 300 kg/m^ 3 and 400 - 500 ℃. The smallest thermal conductivity was 0. 044 W/mK and it was obtained at a combination of 250 kg/m^ 3 and 400 ℃ that satisfied above mentioned manufacturing conditions with good panel formability. This thermal conductivity was 20 % less than that of our previous woods having panels. Macro-pore distributions of the panel sections were obtained by micrograph and image analysis. The results revealed that carbonizing at 400 ℃ provides the panels with less macro-pore of 3 mm^ 2 and over which may cause air convection resulting in a higher thermal conductivity. Furthermore, water adsorption isotherm at 20 ℃ was determined, and {{it was found that the}} hygroscopicity was lower than before carbonizing and was different between 400 ℃　and 700 ℃.

The study examined the characteristics of full bricks produced with mud cuttings from ornamental stone including, resistance to uniaxial compression, water absorption and apparent density of mud alone or when mixed with two types of clay at different firing temperatures. As temperature rose, the strength and density of the samples increased, while absorption decreased. The use of clay improved the sintering process during firing, giving a less porous and mechanically stronger material that normally used to produce full bricks for civil constructions. For the second type of product, aerated bricks, the study investigated porosity, density, resistance to uniaxial compression and the thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity</b> of bricks made by adding lime and aluminium powder to trachyte mud at different sintering temperatures, ranging between 980 and 1040 °C.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: In a cold, wet, or windy environment, cold {{exposure}} can {{be considerable}} for an injured or ill person. The subsequent autonomous stress response initially will increase circulatory and respiratory demands, and as {{body core temperature}} declines, the patient's condition might deteriorate. Therefore, the application of adequate insulation to reduce cold exposure and prevent body core cooling {{is an important part}} of prehospital primary care, but recommendations for what should be used in the field mostly depend on tradition and experience, not on scientific evidence. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the thermal insulation properties in different wind conditions of 12 different blankets and rescue bags commonly used by prehospital rescue and ambulance services. METHODS: The thermal manikin and the selected insulation ensembles were setup inside a climatic chamber in accordance to the modified European Standard for assessing requirements of sleeping bags. Fans were adjusted to provide low (< 0. 5 m/s), moderate (2 - 3 m/s) and high (8 - 9 m/s) wind conditions. During steady state thermal transfer, the total resultant insulation value, Itr (m 2 C/Wclo; where C = degrees Celcius, and W = watts), was calculated from ambient air temperature (C), manikin surface temperature (C), and heat flux (W/m 2). RESULTS: In the low wind condition, thermal insulation of the evaluated ensembles correlated to thickness of the ensembles, ranging from 2. 0 to 6. 0 clo (1 clo = 0. 155 m 2 C/W), except for the reflective metallic foil blankets that had higher values than expected. In moderate and high wind conditions, thermal insulation was best preserved for ensembles that were windproof and resistant to the compressive effect of the wind, with insulation reductions down to about 60 - 80 % of the original <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity,</b> whereas wind permeable and/or lighter materials were reduced down to about 30 - 50 % of original <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The evaluated insulation ensembles might all be used for prehospital protection against cold, either as single blankets or in multiple layer combinations, depending on ambient temperatures. However, with extended outdoor, on-scene durations, such as during prolonged extrications or in multiple casualty situations, the results of this study emphasize the importance of using a windproof and compression resistant outer ensemble to maintain adequate <b>insulation</b> <b>capacity...</b>|$|E

Moreover, {{in accordance with the}} technical Standard EN ISO 13790 : 2008, the simulation codes can be employed for refining the steady-state methods, and particularly the utilization factors estimations, in accordance with the procedure proposed. As the various simulation codes implement different capabilities and refer to different mathematical models and calculation assumptions, the necessary validation steps which are used for diagnostic purposes are not enough to ensure the agreement of the results over a wider range of configurations and conditions. The main dynamic simulation codes have been generally evaluated according to the Standard ANSI/ASHRAE 140 : 2007 (BESTEST). By this approach the user can choose a software among those successfully tested, giving acceptable deviations between the computed output and the reference values for a selected number of reference buildings defined in the Standard. However the number of those reference building configurations is limited and the considered features are not representative of the common building stock present for instance in Southern Europe. Moreover, as those configurations were selected for diagnostic purposes, they are expected to produce unacceptable biasing when considered with statistical approaches in order to improve the quasi steady state approaches as the one proposed in the technical standard EN ISO 13790 : 2008. In this work a procedure to identify the main causes of deviation has been developed and has been applied to two well-known dynamic simulation software: TRNSYS (version 16. 1) and EnergyPlus (version 7).

Since the monthly gains to losses ratio is a known variable in an energy performance calculation the dependency function of the heating system efficiency can be added. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cork, {{natural and}} {{renewable}} product, has thermal and acoustic properties very interesting {{because of its}} microstructure and porosity representing {{a significant portion of}} its apparent volume; it’s coming from Moroccan Maamora’s forest. This work is a contribution to understand the thermal behaviour of the composite material based on granular cork embedded in white cement. An experimental investigation of its thermal properties was mainly performed using the asymmetrical device of transient Hot Plate method. The effect of granular cork size on the thermal properties of the mixture was studied. The experimental study of this sustainable material aims to characterize its thermal properties and then compare them with those of white cement without cork for motivate the proposal that this composite material will be used as walls insulator. A comparison of the energy performances of the composite material and white cement was made; it allows deducing a very interesting energy gain. The findings of the experiments indicate that the composite is better than white cement in term of thermal <b>insulation,</b> energy storage <b>capacity</b> and lightness. So, {{it can be used to}} realize the internal walls insulation. Its utilization should contribute to the improvement of the energy efficiency in building especially that this is a mixture based on a sustainable and renewable material...|$|R
