Liu Youqiu, who held the title as Zhi Junguo Zhongshi, was the last person to hold any variation of the title as chancellor as a regular title, although Pei Du would hold the title of Pingzhang Junguo Zhongshi (平章軍國重事) briefly in 830. Toward the end of the dynasty, Li Zhirou was briefly put temporarily in charge of the Office of the Chancellors in 895 with the designation Quanzhi Zhongshu Shi (權知中書事) and therefore could be regarded as a chancellor as well (and was listed in the table of chancellors <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Book</b> of Tang); similarly, Lu Guangqi went through two similar titles.|$|E

500|$|The Old Book of Tang and New Book of Tang {{record that}} the Arabs (Da shi [...] ) sent their {{commander}} Mo-yi ( [...] , pinyin: Móyè, i.e. Muawiyah I, governor of Syria and later Umayyad caliph, r. 661–680 AD) to besiege the Byzantine capital, Constantinople, {{and forced the}} Byzantines to pay them tribute. The same books also described Constantinople in some detail as having strong granite walls and a water clock mounted with a golden statue of man. Henry Yule noted that {{the name of the}} Byzantine negotiator [...] "Yenyo" [...] (the patrician John Pitzigaudes) was mentioned in Chinese sources, an envoy who was unnamed in Edward Gibbon's account of the man sent to Damascus to hold a parley with the Umayyads, followed a few years later by the increase of tributary demands on the Byzantines. The New Book of Tang and Wenxian Tongkao described the land of Nubia (either the Kingdom of Kush or Aksum) as a desert south-west of the Byzantine Empire that was infested with malaria, where the natives had black skin and consumed Persian dates. In discussing the three main religions of Nubia (the Sudan), the Wenxian Tongkao mentions the Daqin religion there and the day of rest occurring every seven days for those following the faith of the Da shi (the Muslim Arabs). It also repeats the claim <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Book</b> of Tang about the Eastern Roman surgical practice of trepanning to remove parasites from the brain. The descriptions of Nubia and Horn of Africa in the Wenxian Tongkao were ultimately derived from the Jingxingji of Du Huan (fl. 8th century AD), a Chinese travel writer whose text, preserved in the Tongdian of Du You, is perhaps the first Chinese source to describe Ethiopia (Laobosa), in addition to offering descriptions of Eritrea (Molin).|$|E

40|$|This essay investigates how the {{chapters}} of the interwar and the Second World War have changed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> high school history textbooks {{during the period from}} 1944 to 2008. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> study eleven history textbooks have been studied, most quantitatively but also qualitatively. For example the number of pages and rows devoted to different subjects and countries are compared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> books over time. The result of the study shows that there are some big changes over time but in most sections there are also big differences between the books, which make it harder to draw general conclusions. There are a lot more names, pictures and dates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> compared to <b>the</b> older ones, although the number of different names is about <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> books. As for how much of the textbooks which are about the interwar and the Second World War there has been a little but discernible increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> compared with <b>the</b> older ones. As for the Scandinavian and Swedish history there have been almost no changes over time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapter of the interwar period, but a distinct increase of both areas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chapter of the Second World War, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> books from the 21 th century. The disposition of the interwar period has also changed a little. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>books</b> write more about the great economic crisis, and less about <b>the</b> democracies. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of <b>the</b> democracies <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> write less about <b>the</b> developments <b>in</b> Great Britain and France, but more about that in USA. When it comes to the dictatorships there are no general changes percentage but <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>books</b> write more rows about <b>the</b> dictatorships. <b>The</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> write more about Germany than the older, especially <b>the</b> two <b>newest</b> ones. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> space devoted to Soviet Union and Spain there are no clear changes over time while the space devoted to Italy and Turkey <b>in</b> <b>the</b> books has decreased with time. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> oldest books there was quite some space devoted to Japan then it decreased in some books but then increased and more is written about Japan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>books.</b> As for China <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> <b>books</b> write less about <b>the</b> development <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country during interwar period than the older books.

2500|$|From {{its capital}} at Xianyang, the Qin dynasty ruled a larger area {{than either of}} the {{preceding}} dynasties. The imperial city of Chang'an during the Han dynasty was located northwest of today's Xi'an. During the Tang dynasty, the area {{to be known as}} Chang'an included the area inside the Ming Xi'an fortification, plus some small areas to its east and west, and a major part of its southern suburbs.

2500|$|After {{the several}} {{innovations}} and reversals, the {{new forms of}} worship took time to settle in.

In practice, as before the English Reformation, many received communion rarely, as little as once a year in some cases; George Herbert estimated it as {{no more than six}} times[...] Practice, however, varied from place to place: very high attendance at festivals was {{the order of the day}} in many parishes and in some regular communion was very popular, in other places families stayed away or sent [...] "a servant to be the liturgical representative of their household." [...] Few parish clergy were initially licensed to preach by the bishops; in the absence of a licensed preacher, Sunday services were required to be accompanied by reading one of the homilies written by Cranmer [...] George Herbert was, however, not alone in his enthusiasm for preaching, which he regarded as one of the prime functions of a parish priest [...] Music was much simplified and a radical distinction developed between, on the one hand, parish worship where only the metrical psalms of Sternhold and Hopkins might be sung and, on the other hand, worship in churches with organs and surviving choral foundations, where the music of John Marbeck and others was developed into a rich choral tradition [...] The whole act of parish worship might take well over two hours; and accordingly, churches were equipped with pews in which households could sit together (whereas in the medieval church, men and women had worshipped separately). Diarmaid MacCulloch describes the new act of worship as, [...] "a morning marathon of prayer, scripture reading, and praise, consisting of mattins, litany, and ante-communion, preferably as the matrix for a sermon to proclaim the message of scripture anew week by week."
