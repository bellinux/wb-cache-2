40|$|During {{the past}} year this grant has funded {{research}} in the interaction between magnetic fields and the hot plasma in the solar outer atmosphere. The following is a brief summary of the published papers, abstracts and talks which have been supported. The paper 'Coronal Structures Observed in X-rays and H-alpha Structures' {{was published in the}} Kofu Symposium proceedings. The study analyzes cool and <b>hot</b> <b>behavior</b> of two x-ray events, a small flare and a surge. We find that a large H-alpha surge appears in x-rays as a very weak event, while a weak H-alpha feature corresponds to the brightest x-ray emission on the disk {{at the time of the}} observation. Calculations of the heating necessary to produce these signatures, and implications for the driving and heating mechanisms of flares vs. surges are presented. A copy of the paper is appended to this report. The paper 'Differential Magnetic Field Shear in an Active Region' has been published in The Astrophysical Journal. We have compared the 3 D extrapolation of magnetic fields with the observed coronal structure in an active region. Based on the fit between observed coronal structure throughout the volume of the region and the calculated magnetic field configurations, we propose a differential magnetic field shear model for this active region. The decreasing field shear in the outer portions of the AR may indicate a continual relaxation of the magnetic field with time, corresponding to a net transport of helicity outward. The paper 'Difficulties in Observing Coronal Structure' has been accepted for publication in the journal Solar Physics. In this paper we discuss the evidence that the temperature and density structure of the corona are far more complicated than had previously been thought. The discussion is based on five studies carried out by our group on coronal plasma properties, showing that any one x-ray instrument does see all of the plasma present in the corona, that hot and cool material may appear to be co-spatial at a given location in the corona, and that simple magnetic field extrapolations provide only a poor fit to the observed structure.

The fourth paper "Analysis and Comparison of Loop Structures Imaged with NIXT and Yohkoh/SXT" has been published in Astronomy and Astrophysics. This paper analyzes and compares a variety of coronal loops, deriving loop pressure and emission measure from loop models.

The processing map was interpreted {{in terms of the}} microstructural processes occurring during deformation, based on the values of dimensionless parameter η which represents the energy dissipation through microstructural processes. An instability criterion (ξ< 0) was also applied to demarcate the flow instability regions in the processing map. Both the parameters (η and ξ) were computed using the experimental data generated by carrying out hot compression tests over a range of temperatures (850 – 1060 °C) and strain rates (3 × 10 − 4 − 1 /s). The deterministic domains observed under the investigated temperature and strain rate conditions were attributed to continuous dynamic recrystallization or globularisation of α lamellae, dynamic recrystallization and growth of β grains through microstructural observations.

True stress–true strain curves corrected for adiabatic temperature rise exhibited rapid strain hardening followed by flow softening behavior irrespective of temperature and strain rate regimes investigated, although anomalous flow behavior is observed at 1200 °C.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the <b>hot</b> deformation <b>behavior</b> of the Ni- 42. 5 Ti- 7. 5 Cu (wt%) alloy, hot compression tests {{were carried out}} at the temperatures from 800 C to 1000 C and at the strain rates of 0. 001 s- 1 to 1 s- 1. The {{results show that the}} occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) is the dominate restoration mechanism during the hot deformation of this alloy. There is an increase in peak and steady state stresses with decreasing the deformation temperature and increasing the strain rate. The experimental results were then used to determine the constants of developed constitutive equations. There is a good agreement between the measured and predicted results indicating a high accuracy of developed model. Zenere-Hollomon (Z) parameter, calculated based on the developed model, indicates that DRX was postponed when the logarithm of the Zenere-Hollomon parameter fell around 33 at strain rate of 0. 001 s- 1 and temperature of 900 C.

The experimental results were then {{used to determine the}} constants for developing constitutive equations. There was an unacceptable fitting between the predicted and experimental results using Zener-Hollomon parameter in a hyperbolic sinusoidal equation form. The mismatches among the experimental and predicted results were observed almost for all tested conditions. By modifying the Zener-Hollomon parameter for the compensation of strain rate, a very good agreement was achieved between the predicted values and experimental ones. Both predicted and experimental stress-strain curves illustrate the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization. Also, in both cases, the peak and steady state stresses raised with decrease of temperature and increase of strain rate.

40|$|Hot {{cracking}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} defects in continuous casting of steels, frequently limiting the productivity. To understand the factors leading to this defect, microstructure formation is simulated for a low-carbon and two high-strength low-alloyed steels. 2 D simulation of the initial stage of solidification is performed in a moving slice of the slab using proprietary multiphasefield software and taking into account all elements which are expected to have a relevant effect on the mechanical properties and structure formation during solidification. To account for the correct thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the multicomponent alloy grades, the simulation software is online coupled to commercial thermodynamic and mobility databases. A moving-frame boundary condition allows traveling through the entire solidification history starting from the slab surface, and tracking the morphology changes during growth of the shell. From the simulation results, significant microstructure differences between the steel grades are quantitatively evaluated and correlated with their <b>hot</b> cracking <b>behavior</b> according to the Rappaz–Drezet–Gremaud (RDG) hot cracking criterion.

In order to identify the rate controlling mechanisms involved in these domains, kinetic analysis was carried out to determine the various activation parameters.

The {{results showed that the}} flow behavior strongly depended on strain rate and temperature, and flow stress increased with increasing strain rate and decreasing temperature. At lower temperatures, many precipitates appeared in ferrite and distributed along the deformation direction, which could restrain processing of discontinuous dynamic recrystallization (DRX) because of pinning grain boundaries. When the temperature increased to 1150 °C, the leading softening behaviors were dynamic recovery (DRV) in ferrite and discontinuous DRX in austenite. When the temperature reached 1250 °C, softening behavior was mainly DRV in ferrite. The increase of strain rate was conducive to the occurrence of discontinuous DRX in austenite. A constitutive equation at peak strain was established and the results indicated that 2707 HDSS had a higher Q value (569. 279 kJ·mol− 1) than other traditional duplex stainless steels due to higher content of Cr, Mo, Ni, and N.

To optimize the hot-working parameters (temperature and strain rate) for the ring rolling process of maraging steel used for the manufacture of rocket casings, a systematic study was conducted to characterize the <b>hot</b> working <b>behavior</b> by developing processing maps for γ-iron and an indigenous 250 grade maraging steel. The <b>hot</b> deformation <b>behavior</b> of binary alloys of iron with Ni, Co, and Mo, which are major constituents of maraging steel, is also studied. Results from the investigation suggest that all the materials tested exhibit a domain of dynamic recrystallization (DRX). From the instability maps, it was revealed that strain rates above 10 s^- 1 are not suitable for hot working of these materials. An important result from the stress-strain behavior is that while Co strengthens γ-iron, Ni and Mo cause flow softening. Temperatures around 1125 °C and strain rate range between 0. 001 and 0. 1 s^- 1 are suitable for the hot working of maraging steel in the DRX domain. Also, higher strain rates may be used in the meta-dynamic recrystallization domain above 1075 °C for high strain rate applications such as ring rolling.

The models of Estrin, Mecking and Berg-strom; Avrami and Tegart, and Sellars were applied to determine the hot working constants used to derive the constitutive equations describing the flow curves. The analysis of modeling parameters of the hot flow curves shows that Ti, V and Nb additions to TWIP steel generated slight increase in the peak stress (sigma(p)), retardation of the dynamic recrystallization (DRX) onset, particularly at low temperature, and decrease in the activation energy required to recrystallization (Q(t)). Likewise, the softening effect promoted by DRV and DRX was more evident at high temperatures and low strain rates. On the other hand, the resulting deformed microstructures, analyzed by the SEM-EBSD technique, showed {{that the most important}} refining effect on recrystallized austenitic grain was in the presence of V and Ti. The good agreement between the experimental and predicted hot flow curves demonstrated that the developed constitutive equations predict with reasonable accuracy the <b>hot</b> flow <b>behavior</b> of the studied TWIP steels.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the applicability of}} the proposed constitutive model to the simulation of the <b>hot</b> forging <b>behavior</b> of P/M Rene 95 in initially coarse-(50 µm) and fine-grained (7 µm) conditions. It is shown, by means of constant true strain rate compression tests, that the microstructures of the coarse and fine grained materials transform into the same equiaxed fine grained micro-duplex structure at which point their flow strengths become identical. Continued deformed at that point produces no further change in grain size or flow strength. Under this steady state regime, grain size and flow strength are independent of the initial microstructure but vary with applied strain rate and temperature...|$|R

The possibilities of the original three-stage model describing a deformation resistance will be documented by an example of {{predicting the}} stress-strain curves of the X 60 grade HSLA-steel microalloyed with niobium. <b>Hot</b> deformation <b>behavior</b> of this material including dynamic recrystallization kinetics will be compared with the behavior of plain carbon steel. The proper calculation of the activation energy values at hot working plays a principal role. For this purpose a new interactive software has been developed that enables to eliminate experimental values connected for example with different structural states...|$|R

The <b>hot</b> {{deformation}} <b>behavior</b> of a {{low carbon}} Nb-microalloyed steel is investigated by hot compression test in the ferrite phase region compared with a low carbon steel with similar compositions, {{and the effect of}} Nb on dynamic recrystallization of ferrite is analyzed. Results indicate that during hot deformation in the ferrite phase region, the effect of Nb solely depends on the size of NbC precipitates. Tiny particles which average size is about 7. 5 nm have a retarding effect on dynamic recrystallization process of ferrite, on the contrary, coarser particles which average size is about 30. 6 nm have a promoting effect and are of benefit to the refinement of recrystallized grains...|$|R
