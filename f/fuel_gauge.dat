5|$|The tests {{conducted}} {{in preparation for}} the parade revealed a number of flaws in the design including poor directional stability, a cramped cockpit without heating or ventilation, poor access to the engine, inadequate fuel capacity, compounded by the lack of a <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge,</b> and poor elevator control forces. Five aircraft were modified to correct these issues before resuming the factory's testing in late 1946. The modifications were not entirely successful and the lateral stability was now too great and the elevator forces remained too weak. Engine problems, however, plagued the tests as the first prototype alone required four engine changes.|$|E
25|$|According to one report, the helicopter's <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> {{had been}} {{reported}} faulty by Powers. The improperly operating <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> would indicate empty when the fuel tank actually contained enough fuel for 30 minutes flying time. It has been alleged the gauge was repaired to function correctly without Powers being notified. This is a possible explanation why an experienced pilot such as Powers could {{have run out of}} fuel.|$|E

50|$|While the {{aircraft}} was {{being prepared for}} its return to Edmonton, a maintenance worker decided to investigate {{the problem with the}} faulty FQIS. To test the system he re-enabled the second channel, at which point the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> in the cockpit went blank. He was called away to perform a floatstick measurement of fuel remaining in the tanks. Distracted, he failed to disable the second channel, leaving the circuit breaker tagged (which masked {{the fact that it was}} no longer pulled). The FQIS was now completely unserviceable and the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> were blank.|$|R

25|$|Post-accident {{investigation}} by the NTSB showed that {{the leading cause of}} the accident was Denver's inability to switch fuel tanks during flight. The quantity of fuel had been depleted during the plane's transfer to Monterey and in several brief practice takeoffs and landings Denver performed at the airport immediately prior to the final flight. His newly purchased experimental Rutan had an unusual fuel selector valve handle configuration. Intended by the plane's designer to be located between the pilot's legs, the builder instead had placed the fuel selector behind the pilot's left shoulder, with the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> also behind the pilot's seat and not visible to the person at the controls. An NTSB interview with the aircraft mechanic servicing Denver's plane revealed that he and Denver had discussed the inaccessibility of the cockpit fuel selector valve handle and its resistance to being turned.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fuel</b> Quantity <b>Gauge</b> - Indicates {{the amount}} of fuel {{remaining}} in the identified tank. One per fuel tank. Some aircraft use a single gauge for all tanks, with a selector switch that can be turned to select the tank one wishes to have displayed on the shared gauge, including a setting to show the total fuel in all tanks. An example of switch settings could be [...] "Left, Right, Fuselage, Total". This saves room on the instrument panel by negating the need for four different dedicated <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges.</b>|$|R
25|$|The updated 2014 Proton Prevé {{was quietly}} {{introduced}} into the Malaysian market in November 2013. All Prevé variants on sale in Malaysia are now equipped standard with all engineered safety features, bringing them up to 5-Star ANCAP specifications and thus placing them on par with the Australian market Proton Prevé. Proton launched a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) variant of the Prevé exclusively for Thailand in early 2014. The Prevé LPG is fitted with a dedicated 58-litre tank in the boot and a <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> module on the dashboard, {{as well as a}} separate inlet inside the petrol filler compartment. Both the CamPro IAFM+ and CFE engines have been modified to run on both LPG and E20 petrol. All other specifications remain unchanged over the launch models, and the Prevé LPG is priced between 664,000 and 798,000 baht, whereas the regular Prevé continues on sale between 625,000 and 759,000 baht respectively.|$|E
500|$|Each {{plane in}} Jane's Attack Squadron is {{composed}} of forty-five parts that may be removed or otherwise damaged in combat. Damage to these parts affects performance; for example, a broken fuel line will leak, quickly decreasing the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge.</b> Various adjustments may {{be made to the}} game's realism, including an [...] "arcade physics" [...] option that drastically reduces flight difficulty.

While keeping the basic design, SYM increased {{the size of}} the front brake from , and added an LED <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge.</b> Instead of leading link front forks, it uses telescopic forks. The Symba engine has a carbureted [...] single claimed to produce [...] at 8500rpm, with a four speed gearbox using a centrifugal clutch semi-automatic transmission.|$|E
50|$|Because {{inconsistencies}} {{had been}} found with the FQIS in other 767s, Boeing had issued a service bulletin for the routine checking of this system. An engineer in Edmonton duly did so when the aircraft arrived from Toronto following a trouble-free flight {{the day before the}} incident. While conducting this check, the FQIS failed and the cockpit <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> went blank. The engineer had encountered the same problem earlier in the month when this same aircraft had arrived from Toronto with an FQIS fault. He found then that disabling the second channel by pulling the circuit breaker in the cockpit restored the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> to working order albeit with only the single FQIS channel operative. In the absence of any spares he simply repeated this temporary fix by pulling and tagging the circuit breaker.|$|R

In addition to the digital electronic climate control that was standard on all Eldorados, the standard analog speedometer and <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> could be replaced with digital displays with features displaying gallons of remaining fuel and approximate range.|$|R
50|$|Contributing to the {{accident}} were the captain's inadequate preflight planning, his subsequent distraction during the flight, and his late initiation of the in-range checklist. Further contributing to {{the accident}} was the flight crew's failure to monitor the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauges</b> and {{to recognize that the}} airplane's changing handling characteristics were caused by a fuel imbalance.|$|R
500|$|The pushrod {{overhead}} valve (OHV) air-cooled four stroke {{single cylinder engine}} had a [...] bore × stroke, displacing , and could produce [...] at 9,500rpm, for [...] maximum speed of , under favorable conditions. The low compression ratio meant the engine could consume inexpensive and commonly available low octane fuel, as well as minimizing the effort to kick start the engine, making the extra weight and expense of an electric starter an unnecessary creature comfort. Though {{some of the many}} Super Cub variations came with both kick and electric start, the majority sold well without it. Even the latest 2011 model year Japanese domestic market (JDM) Super Cub 50 and Super Cub 110 versions, with modern technology and conveniences like fuel injection and a <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge,</b> were not offered with an electric start option.|$|E
500|$|The car {{has three}} {{monitors}} on the dashboard, the first monitors {{the status of}} important components, while the second controls the sound system, and the last is a rev counter, digital speedometer and the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge.</b> CNET described the speed gauge monitor as clear and [...] "close to the driver's natural line of sight", but criticized the other two monitors for being unreadable and possibly dangerous if used by the driver while the car is moving. Some reviewers complained about the vehicle's soundproofing, which could not adequately conceal the screech of the wind. The engine at high speed received mixed reviews, while a number of reviewers reported a fault with the screenwash bottle, which can freeze in cold weather and blow a fuse when used. The reviewer for European Car of the Year 2010 called the nominated C3 Picasso fuel efficient, but said it had [...] "dull steering".|$|E
2500|$|Test pilot Reuben Snodgrass {{flew the}} prototype, {{registration}} No. NX90850, {{for the first}} time on November 15, 1947. On November 18, 1947, while on a one-hour demonstration flight, it made a low fuel forced landing near San Diego, California destroying the car body and damaging the wing. [...] The pilot, who escaped with minor injuries, reportedly took off with little or no aviation fuel aboard. [...] Although the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> he had visually checked during the pre-flight check indicated that the tank was full, it was the automobile's <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge,</b> not the aircraft's gauge. Using the same wing and another car body, the second prototype flew again on January 29, 1948 piloted by W.G. Griswold, but enthusiasm for the project waned and Convair cancelled the program. The rights reverted to Hall, who formed T.R Hall Engineering Corp., but the Model 118 in its new incarnation never achieved production status.|$|E

2500|$|The 1968 Caprice {{received}} a minor facelift {{that included a}} new grille with taillights set into the bumper and optional hidden headlamps. Caprice coupes now came standard with the new Astro Ventilation system, which included extra vents in the dash, {{and the removal of}} vent (wing) windows. Side marker lamps became standard on all U.S. cars and the Caprice carried over the optional white corner marker lamps at the forward edge of the fenders in addition to the amber parking lights which were illuminated with the headlights. All 1968 Chevrolets got front side marker lights on the fender; cars with an optional engine were identified with its cubic inch displacement listed on half the bezel; the light itself occupied the other half. The fiber optics monitoring system was offered again as an option. Chevrolet made the Caprice Coupe's formal roofline available in the Impala series. The Impala Custom Coupe became the best-selling model in the line. The L72 [...] Turbo-Jet V8 returned to the option list after a one-year hiatus. A new [...] Turbo Fire V8 rated at [...] replaced the [...] small block as the standard engine. Inside, the instrument panel was revised with a return to the horizontal sweep speedometer and a revised three-spoke steering wheel. An optional instrument cluster had a narrow speedometer within its opening and flanking it with engine-turned instruments in the place of warning lights. The <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge,</b> placed next to the speedometer within its own pod in the base models, was moved to its new place next to the speedometer. A tachometer took the place of the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> in the large opening left by the <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} on the Fairlane/Torino was all new for 1968. A new dashboard featured four equally sized round pods centred {{around the}} steering wheel. However, the pods {{did not contain}} {{a full set of}} gauges; rather an assortment of warning lights along with the speedometer and <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge.</b> The <b>fuel</b> <b>gauge</b> and temperature warning lights were in the first pod, a [...] speedometer was located in the second pod from the left, alternator and oil pressure warning lights were in the third pod from the left and the fourth pod was blank. An optional tachometer was available, which would be located in the third pod, and an optional clock occupied the fourth pod. Ford offered many upholstery options, including a knitted vinyl option, called [...] "comfortweave." [...] This unique option allowed the vinyl to [...] "breathe" [...] unlike conventional vinyl, offering more comfort in hot weather.
