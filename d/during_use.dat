5|$|The {{reflector}} sight mechanism {{was mounted}} {{in front of}} the gyro, slightly to the left. A metal flap protected the half-mirror from damage when stowed, which was rotated rearward <b>during</b> <b>use,</b> covering the spirit level. The collimator was mounted on a prominent arm that projected above and {{in front of the}} sight when in use, and folded forward when stored. Electrical power was provided to light the collimator as well as the drift scale, which indicated the angle to fly to correct for the wind drift.|$|E

5|$|Early EMA {{systems like}} Hixon's had {{problems}} with accounting for tilting of the tongue <b>during</b> <b>use</b> as tilting of the sensor coils causes changes in the induced current that can skew data. In 1987, Paul Schönle et al. published an improved system that used three transmitter coils (analogous to Hixon's generator coil) and computer software to triangulate the position of sensor coils and account for tilt. However modern two-dimensional systems are still unable to compensate for tilting of sensors past 30 degrees and measurement is distorted if sensor coils are moved off the centerline of the mouth. In 1993, Andreas Zierdt published a description of an articulograph that {{would be able to}} measure movement in three dimensions, though three dimensional articulographs have only been commercially available since around 2009. Zierdt's conceptualization placed six transmitter coils equidistant from each other. Because sensor coils are dipoles, when they are perpendicular to a transmitter coil the current induced is zero, so Zierdt angled the transmitter coils so that for any given rotation of a sensor coil, it was not perpendicular to more than three transmitter coils allowing for at least three transmitter coils to triangulate the position of the sensor.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva {{increases the likelihood of}} dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although it is clear that use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced <b>during</b> <b>use</b> of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
25|$|The cuff {{stabilizer}} is used {{to assist}} snug cuff application and to prevent the cuff from shifting <b>during</b> <b>use.</b> Cuff shifting can interfere with the surgical site and may result in loss of arterial occlusion. Generally, tie ribbons are used as the stabilizer, {{as shown in the}} top figure to the left. However, some newer cuffs use releasable application handles as the stabilizer, as shown in bottom figure to the left. Releasable application handles allow more consistent cuff application, faster cuff removal, and maintain the cuff in a stable position on the limb <b>during</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

25|$|The thermal {{conductivity}} of uranium dioxide is low; it {{is affected by}} porosity and burn-up. The burn-up results in fission products being dissolved in the lattice (such as lanthanides), the precipitation of fission products such as palladium, the formation of fission gas bubbles due to fission products such as xenon and krypton and radiation damage of the lattice. The low {{thermal conductivity}} can lead to overheating of the center part of the pellets <b>during</b> <b>use.</b> The porosity results in a decrease in both the thermal conductivity of the fuel and the swelling which occurs <b>during</b> <b>use.</b>|$|E

25|$|A scuba set is {{characterized}} by full independence from the surface <b>during</b> <b>use,</b> by providing breathing gas carried by the diver. Early attempts to reach this autonomy from the surface {{were made in the}} 18th century by the Englishman John Lethbridge, who invented and successfully built his own underwater diving machine in 1715. The air inside the suit allowed a short period of diving before it had to be surfaced for replenishment.|$|E
25|$|The {{phosphor}} {{drops off}} in efficiency <b>during</b> <b>use.</b> By around 25,000 operating hours, it will typically be half {{the brightness of}} a new lamp (although some manufacturers claim much longer half-lives for their lamps). Lamps that do not suffer failures of the emission mix or integral ballast electronics will eventually develop this failure mode. They still work, but have become dim and inefficient. The process is slow, and often becomes obvious only when a new lamp is operating next to an old one.|$|E
25|$|Solar {{power is}} {{pollution}}-free <b>during</b> <b>use,</b> which enables it {{to cut down}} on pollution when it is substituted for other energy sources.

Production end-wastes and emissions are manageable using existing pollution controls. End-of-use recycling technologies are under development and policies are being produced that encourage recycling from producers.|$|E
