25|$|Brighton is {{situated}} on the English Channel coast {{at a point where}} several valleys meet the sea. One of these was formed by the flow of the River Wellesbourne, a winterbourne which came to the surface at Patcham. The <b>intermittent</b> <b>flow</b> of the stream created a boggy, marshy area of land around which the old village of Brighthelmstone developed. Just before entering the sea, it formed a small pool. As demand for land grew in the late 18th century during a period of rapid growth, the Wellesbourne was diverted into a culvert and built over: the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Marlborough paid for this. The pool was hidden under a new road, Pool Valley, in 1792–93.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2000, Wildcat Creek {{was found}} to have no flow in any of its reaches. It may receive only <b>intermittent</b> <b>flow</b> from its source and may also lose flow to coal measures.

50|$|The Bay Area has {{a network}} of streams that are {{generally}} called creeks, but sometimes called arroyos, due to the Spanish language heritage evident in names such as Santa Rosa Creek and San Pablo Creek. Due to low rainfall in the summer months (May-October), many Bay Area creeks are <b>intermittent,</b> <b>flowing</b> above ground only during part of the year.|$|R
50|$|Quebrada del Condorito {{lies within}} the high {{altitude}} {{of the top}} floor of the Sierras Grandes, which contrasts with the great Pampas' lower plains that surround them. This gives the region characteristics of a biological island, which, depending on climatic variations, is enriched by <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows</b> of Andean and Patagonian wildlife colonization. As a result, the area has a great diversity of endemic species and subspecies, both plants and animals.|$|R
2500|$|Wildcat Creek (also {{known as}} Millers Creek, Tinklepaugh Creek, or Wild Cat Creek) is a {{tributary}} of the Lackawanna River in Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania, in the United States. It is approximately [...] long and flows through Archbald and Blakely. The watershed of the creek has an area of [...] It has one named tributary, which is known as West Branch Tinklepaugh Creek. The creek may lose flow to coal measures and may receive only <b>intermittent</b> <b>flow</b> even at its source. Only {{the upper reaches of the}} creek have a natural channel. It flows through an open box culvert in its lower reaches.|$|E
2500|$|For flow in a pipe of {{diameter}} , experimental observations {{show that}} for [...] "fully developed" [...] flow, laminar flow occurs when [...] < 2300 and turbulent flow occurs when [...] > 2600. At {{the lower end}} of this range, a continuous turbulent-flow will form, but only at a very long distance from the inlet of the pipe. The flow in between will begin to transition from laminar to turbulent and then back to laminar at irregular intervals, called <b>intermittent</b> <b>flow.</b> This is due to the different speeds and conditions of the fluid in different areas of the pipe's cross-section, depending on other factors such as pipe roughness and flow uniformity. Laminar flow tends to dominate in the fast-moving center of the pipe while slower-moving turbulent flow dominates near the wall. As the Reynolds number increases, the continuous turbulent-flow moves closer to the inlet and the intermittency in between increases, until the flow becomes fully turbulent at [...] > 2600. This result is generalized to non-circular channels using the hydraulic diameter, allowing a transition Reynolds number to be calculated for other shapes of channel.|$|E

5000|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, {{a number of}} {{companies}} have produced portable oxygen concentrators. Typically, these devices produce the equivalent of one to five liters per minute of continuous oxygen flow and they use some version of pulse flow or [...] "demand flow" [...] to deliver oxygen only when the patient is inhaling. They can also provide pulses of oxygen either to provide higher <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows</b> or to reduce the power consumption.|$|R

50|$|The {{lake was}} {{originally}} formed by a 42 ft high dam, built in 1913 - 14, on Jack Creek. At that time, {{the water in}} the reservoir came from intermittent surface streams. The dam, managed by the Jordan Valley Irrigation District, was raised to 80 ft in 1933, and in addition to the <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows</b> the higher dam impounds water from Jordan Creek. The water is used to irrigate about 12000 acre of farmland downstream of the lake.|$|R
50|$|<b>Intermittent</b> <b>flow</b> (IF)-only {{products}} {{weighed in}} the range of from 2.8 to 9.9 pounds (1.3 to 4.5 kg). The continuous flow (CF) units were between 10 and 20 pounds (4.5 to 9.0 kg).|$|E

50|$|Salsipuedes Creek runs {{north from}} its source along Jalama Road {{until it is}} met by El Jaro Creek, a 13-mile long tributary, just south of where Jalama Road meets U.S. Highway 1, then Salsipuedes Creek mainstem {{continues}} north along Highway 1 to Santa Rosa Road, where the creek has its confluence with the Santa Ynez River. El Jaro Creek has two tributaries with <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows,</b> Los Amoles Creek and Ytias Creek, which are 3.5 mi and 4.2 mi long, respectively.|$|R
25|$|To {{use less}} space, treat {{difficult}} waste, and <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows,</b> {{a number of}} designs of hybrid treatment plants have been produced. Such plants often combine at least two stages of the three main treatment stages into one combined stage. In the UK, where {{a large number of}} wastewater treatment plants serve small populations, package plants are a viable alternative to building a large structure for each process stage. In the US, package plants are typically used in rural areas, highway rest stops and trailer parks.|$|R
50|$|The major tributaries of the Slough are Tecolotito Creek, Carneros Creek, and Atascadero Creek. Tecolotito Creek's highest flows are {{during winter}} storms; {{during the summer}} <b>flows</b> are <b>intermittent.</b> Carneros Creek's major flows are of the flash flood type, with <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows</b> in the summer months. Atascadero Creek is a stream that {{generally}} has perennial freshwater flow that is augmented by seepage and landscape watering. Highest flows are during winter storms. Other flow sources are runoff from the north-facing bluffs of UC Santa Barbara campus and More Mesa.|$|R
5000|$|Blind valleys are {{typically}} dry at their lower ends. [...] A blind valley {{can also be}} dry.

50|$|The spring {{rises in}} a cave 20 feet by 7. Being intermittent, it {{required}} the excavation of the Pool of Siloam which stored {{the large amount of}} water needed for the town when the spring was not flowing. The spring has the singular characteristic of being <b>intermittent,</b> <b>flowing</b> from three to five times daily in winter, twice daily in summer, and only once daily in autumn. This peculiarity is accounted for by the supposition that the outlet from the reservoir is by a passage {{in the form of a}} siphon.|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{review of}} the {{globally}} subcritical transition to turbulence in shear flows is presented, {{with an emphasis on}} the cases of plane and circular Couette flows (pCf and cCf, respectively). A Swift-Hohenberg-like model is next proposed to interpret the behavior of plane Couette flow in the vicinity of its global stability threshold. We present results of numerical simulations supporting this proposal and helping us to raise "good" questions about the growth and decay of intermittent turbulent domains in this precise context, and more generally about the coexistence of laminar flow and turbulence in other spatio-temporally <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

50|$|Flaser {{beds are}} a {{sediment}}ary, bi-directional, bedding pattern created when a sediment {{is exposed to}} <b>intermittent</b> <b>flows,</b> leading to alternating sand and mud layers. While flaser beds typically form in tidal environments, they can (rarely) form in fluvial conditions - on point bars or in ephemeral streams. Individual sand ripples are created, which are later infilled by mud during quieter flow periods. These mud drapes are typically a minor constituent of the deposit; they can consolidate within three hours, protecting the underlying layer from erosion. Flaser bedding typically forms in high-energy environments but some have also been described in turbiditic sediments reworked by contour currents (Rebesco, 2014).|$|R
