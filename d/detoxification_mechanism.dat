Therefore, {{attention is paid}} to the development of techniques for removing these pollutants from the sites of pollution. One of the possibilities is that heavy metals and organic compounds are removed from soil by using fytoremediation. Fytoremediation uses the ability of some plant species to uptake toxic compounds from soil and accumulate these compounds in its tissues. These plants are able to tolerate higher amounts of toxic compounds than it's usual because of the broad range of <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> which are taking place in these plants.

In the case of arsenic, V. paradoxus is believed to oxidize As (III) to As (V) as a <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanism.</b> V. paradoxus has been found in a range of rocky environments including carbonate caves, mine spoil and deep marine sediments, but the role of this organism within these environments is largely unstudied. The species is also tolerant {{of a large number of}} heavy metals including cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, zinc at mM concentrations. Despite this, very little is known about the physiological adaptions V. paradoxus uses to support this tolerance. The sequenced genome of the endophytic strain V. paradoxus S110 provides some clues to the organism’s metal tolerance by identifying key molecular machinery in processing metals such as the arsenic reductase complex ArsRBC, metal transporting P1-type ATPases and a chemiosmotic antiporter efflux system similar to CzcCBA of Cupriavidus metallidurans. Cupriavidus species, including C. metallidurans, are well characterised in the field of microbe-metal interactions, and are found within the same order (Burkholderiales) as V. paradoxus. Both the species C. necator and C. metallidurans (when not distinguished as separate species) were originally classified in the genera Alcaligenes along with V. paradoxus (Alcaligenes eutrophus and Alicaligenes paradoxus). This relationship with other heavy metal resistant species may help to partially explain the evolutionary history of V. paradoxuss metal tolerance.|$|E
50|$|Tabtoxin {{resistance}} protein (TTR) is {{an enzyme}} that catalyzes the acetylation of tabtoxin rendering tabtoxin-producing pathogens tolerant {{to their own}} phytotoxins. According to the structure based <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanism</b> of TTR, three site-directed mutants Y141F, D130N and Y141F-D130N were constructed and overexpressed in E. coli. The products were then purified and their properties were analyzed by CD and DLS. The crystal structure of TTR complexed with its natural cofactor, acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA), to 1.55 Å resolution. The binary complex forms a characteristic “V” shape for substrate binding and contains the four motifs conserved in the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily, which also includes the histone acetyltransferases (HATs). There are reports that TTR possesses HAT activity and suggest an evolutionary relationship between TTR and other GNAT members. The dipeptide toxin contains tabtoxinine-β-lactam (TβL) linked by a peptide bond to threonine produced, the chlorosis-inducing activity occurs only after hydrolysis of the peptide bond by aminopeptidases of plant or bacterial origin. Cleavage of the peptide bond in tabtoxin releases TβL, the toxic moiety. TβL {{is located at the}} N terminus, and Thr is at the C terminus, resulting in TβL-Thr. TβL-Thr is hydrolyzed, and the resulting TβL irreversibly inhibits glutamine synthetase, causing characteristic chlorosis in plants. TβL is spontaneously isomerized to tabtoxinine-δ-lactam (TδL), and TblF did not recognize TδL as a substrate, yielding no TδL-Thr. Some characteristics were also provided by them, but only from the perspective of tabtoxin biosynthesis. βL-Thr is observed, but Thr-TβL, whose sequence is the reverse of that of tabtoxin, is not. The effects of carbon, nitrogen sources and amino acids on growth and tabtoxin production by pv. tabaci, were examined by varying the components of a defined basal medium, which contained the following nutrients per liter: sucrose (10 g), KNO3 (5 g), MgSO(4).7H2O (0.2 g), CaCl(2).2H2O (0.11 g), FeSO(4).7H2O (20 mg), NaH2PO(4).2H2O (0.9 g) and H2PO(4).3HO (1 g). Both growth and quantity of tabtoxin synthesized were significantly affected by carbon source, nitrogen source and amino acid supplements. Sorbitol, xylose and sucrose proved to be the best carbon sources for tabtoxin production. Specific toxin production was very low using glucose as a single carbohydrate source, although bacterial growth was well supported by glucose. Amount and type of nitrogen sources (NH4Cl or KNO3) affected the growth of pv. tabaci and quantities of tabtoxin produced. Nitrate is the best of these two forms of nitrogen for production of tabtoxin.|$|E

The fact that the cells were most sensitive to cadmium under conditions of phosphate limitation and most sensitive to mercury under conditions of sulfate limitation led to the hypothesis that these inorganic <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> generally depended on a kind of "facilitated precipitation". The process was coined thus because heavy metals were probably accumulated and precipitated near the cell perimeter due to the relatively high local concentrations of sulfide and phosphate there. Depending on the growth-limiting nutrient, mercury proved to be 25 -fold (phosphate limitation), 75 -fold (glycerol limitation), or 150 -fold (sulfate limitation) more toxic than cadmium to this organism. In the presence of lead, PbS formation was suggested. Since no other <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were detected, for example, rendering heavy metal ions innocuous as metallo-organic compounds, it was concluded that formation of heavy metal precipitates is crucially important to this organism.

Therefore, {{there is considerable}} interest in elucidating arsenic toxicity and <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> By an ensemble modelling approach, we identified a best parsimonious mathematical model which recapitulates and predicts intracellular arsenic dynamics for different conditions and mutants, thereby providing novel insights into arsenic toxicity and <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in yeast, which could partly be confirmed experimentally by dedicated experiments. Specifically, our analyses suggest that: (i) arsenic is mainly protein-bound during short-term (acute) exposure, whereas glutathione-conjugated arsenic dominates during long-term (chronic) exposure, (ii) arsenic is not stably retained, but can leave the vacuole via an export mechanism, and (iii) Fps 1 is controlled by Hog 1 -dependent and Hog 1 -independent mechanisms during arsenite stress. Our results challenge glutathione depletion as a key mechanism for arsenic toxicity and instead suggest that (iv) increased glutathione biosynthesis protects the proteome against the damaging effects of arsenic and that (v) widespread protein inactivation contributes to the toxicity of this metalloid.

Ossicles involved in major mechanical functions - sea urchin spine and starfish ambulacral plate - were analyzed for their metal concentration (Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn) and their biometric and mechanical properties. Starfish plates were more contaminated by Cd, Pb and Zn than sea urchin spines. Cu concentrations were at background levels. In E. acutus, metals principally affected size. In A. rubens, material stiffness and toughness were decreased in the most contaminated station.

Also isolated was the known scalarane 12 -deacetoxy- 12 -oxo-deoxoscalarin together with 26 furanoterpenes, nine of which (11 - 19) are reported for the first time. The high diversity of chemical compounds and variation between individuals and locations could reflect a varied sponge diet or an enzymatic <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanism...</b>|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} explore the larvicidal and growth-inhibiting activities, and {{underlying}} <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanism</b> of red palm weevil against phenylpropanoids, an important class of plant secondary metabolites. Toxicity of α-asarone, eugenol, isoeugenol, methyl eugenol, methyl isoeugenol, coumarin, coumarin 6, coniferyl aldehyde, diniconazole, ethyl cinnamate, and rosmarinic acid was evaluated by incorporation into the artificial diet. All of the phenylpropanoids exhibited dose- and time-dependent insecticidal activity. Among all the tested phenylpropanoids, coumarin exhibited the highest toxicity by revealing the least LD 50 value (0. 672 g/L). In addition, the most toxic compound (coumarin) observed in the current study, deteriorated the growth resulting tremendous reduction (78. 39 %) in efficacy of conversion of digested food (ECD), and (ECI) efficacy of conversion of ingested food (70. 04 %) of tenth-instar red palm weevil larvae. The energy-deficient red palm weevil larvae through their intrinsic abilities showed enhanced response to their digestibility resulting 27. 78 % increase in approximate digestibility (AD) compared to control larvae. The detoxification response of Rhynchophorus ferrugineus larvae determined by the quantitative expression of cytochrome P 450, esterases, and glutathione S-transferase revealed enhanced expression among moderately toxic and ineffective compounds. These genes especially cytochrome P 450 and GST detoxify the target compounds by enhancing their solubility that leads rapid excretion and degradation resulting low toxicity towards red palm weevil larvae. On the other hand, the most toxic (coumarin) silenced the genes involved in the red palm weevil <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Based on the toxicity, growth retarding, and masking detoxification activities, coumarin could be a useful future natural red palm weevil-controlling agent...|$|E
40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes NCTC 418, {{growing in}} the {{presence}} of cadmium under glucose-, sulfate-, or phosphate-limited conditions in continuous culture, exhibits two different cadmium detoxifying mechanisms. In addition to sulfide formation, increased accumulation of Pi is demonstrated as a novel mechanism. Intracellular cadmium is always quantitatively counterbalanced by a concerted increase in both inorganic sulfide and Pi contents of the cells. This led to the conclusion that production of sulfide and accumulation of Pi are <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms</b> present in K. aerogenes but that their relative importance is crucially dependent on the strain and the growth conditions employed...|$|R
50|$|In organisms, methylglyoxal {{is formed}} as a side-product of several {{metabolic}} pathways. It may form from 3-aminoacetone, which is an intermediate of threonine catabolism, as well as through lipid peroxidation. However, the most important source is glycolysis. Here, methylglyoxal arises from nonenzymatic phosphate elimination from glyceraldehyde phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, two intermediates of glycolysis. Since methylglyoxal is highly cytotoxic, the body developed several <b>detoxification</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> One of these is the glyoxalase system. Methylglyoxal reacts with glutathione to form a hemithioacetal. This is converted into S-D-lactoyl-glutathione by glyoxalase I, and then further metabolized into D-lactate by glyoxalase II.|$|R

The most classic example is of butterflies and plants outlined in Ehrlich and Raven's original paper, [...] "Butterflies and plants: {{a study in}} coevolution.". Erlich and Raven found in 1964 that hostplants for butterflies had {{a wide range of}} chemical defenses, allowing them to escape herbivory.
