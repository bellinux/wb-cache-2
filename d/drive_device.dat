40|$|A widely {{accepted}} {{definition of a}} medical device is an instrument or apparatus {{that is used to}} diagnose, prevent or treat disease. Medical devices take a broad range of forms and utilize various methods to operate, such as physical, mechanical or thermal. Of particular interest in this paper are the medical devices that utilize magnetic field sources to operate. The exploitation of magnetic fields to operate or <b>drive</b> medical <b>devices</b> has become increasingly popular due to interesting characteristics of magnetic fields that are not offered by other phenomena, such as mechanical contact, hydrodynamics and thermodynamics. Today, there is a wide range of magnetically <b>driven</b> medical <b>devices</b> purposed for different anatomical regions of the body. A review of these devices is presented and organized into two groups: permanent magnetically <b>driven</b> <b>devices</b> and electromagnetically <b>driven</b> <b>devices.</b> Within each category, the discussion will be further segregated into anatomical regions (e. g., gastrointestinal, ocular, abdominal, thoracic, etc.) ...|$|R

50|$|There are two {{variants}} of ARMD, ARMD-FDD and ARMD-HDD. Originally ARMD caused the devices {{to appear as}} a sort of very large floppy drive, either the primary floppy <b>drive</b> <b>device</b> 00h or the secondary device 01h. Some operating systems required code changes to support floppy disks with capacities far larger than any standard floppy disk drive. Also, standard-floppy disk drive emulation proved to be unsuitable for certain high-capacity floppy disk drives such as Iomega Zip drives. Later the ARMD-HDD, ARMD-"Hard disk device", variant was developed to address these issues. Under ARMD-HDD, an ARMD device appears to the BIOS and the operating system as a hard drive.|$|E
