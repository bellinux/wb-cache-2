40|$|One area {{of concern}} among census data users is the {{potential}} for misclassification of <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> status by enumerators. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine what enumerator and other characteristics are associated with the questionable identification of <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> status during Nonresponse Followup (NRFU). We compared the <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> status during the NRFU operation with the status resulting from two followup operations, Coverage Improvement Followup (CIFU) and the Accuracy and Coverage Evaluation (A. C. E.). One of the main results that we found is that the NRFU operation was more likely to result in a discrepant <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> status compared to CIFU than when compared to A. C. E. Perhaps the main reason for this finding is that the CIFU universe disproportionately included units identified as “vacant ” or “delete ” in NRFU (approximately 74 percent of the workload), and thus a larger percentage were likely to be converted to occupied status. The most important determinant of whether or not a <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> status during NRFU will be different in the A. C. E. or CIFU is whether the NRFU respondent was a household member or a proxy...|$|R
