Our standpoint in studying computability problems in mathematics is doing mathematics. That is, {{we would like to}} talk about computable functions and other mathematical objects just as one talks about continuous functions, integrable functions, etc. In any naive notion of computability of a function (on a compact set), uniform continuity is inherent. On the other hand, one often approximates <b>discontinuous</b> <b>functions,</b> for instance in numerical computations and drawing graphs. Very often such approximations are successful and satisfactory. It is therefore meaningful and important to speculate on computability of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>functions.</b> According to our standpoint, it is a mathematical investigation to formulate computability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. By the {{sometimes}} so-called Main Theorem of Recursive Analysis, every computable real function is necessarily continuous. Weihrauch and Zheng (TCS 2000), Brattka (MLQ 2005), and Ziegler (ToCS 2006) have considered different relaxed notions of computability to cover also <b>discontinuous</b> <b>functions.</b> The present work compares and unifies these approaches. This {{is based on}} the concept of the jump of a representation, a TTE–counterpart to the well known recursion-theoretic jump on Kleene’s Arithmetical Hierarchy of hypercomputation. We also consider Markov and Banach/Mazur oracle–computation of <b>discontinuous</b> <b>functions</b> and characterize the computational power of Type- 2 nondeterminism to coincide with the first level of the Analytical Hierarchy. ...|$|R
5000|$|In mathematics, a nowhere {{continuous}} function, {{also called}} an everywhere <b>discontinuous</b> <b>function,</b> {{is a function}} that is not continuous at any point of its domain. If f is a function from real numbers to real numbers, then f(x) is nowhere continuous if for each point x there is an ε > 0 such that for each δ > 0 {{we can find a}} point y such that 0 < [...] < δ and [...] ≥ ε. Therefore, no matter how close we get to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not-nearby values.|$|E
5000|$|In 1875 Smith {{published}} the important paper [...] on the integrability of discontinuous functions in Riemann's sense. In this work, while giving a rigorous {{definition of the}} Riemann integral as well as explicit rigorous proofs {{of many of the}} results published by Riemann, he also gave an example of a meagre set which is not negligible in the sense of measure theory, since its measure is not zero: a function which is everywhere continuous except on this set is not Riemann integrable. Smith's example shows that the proof of sufficient condition for the Riemann integrability of a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>function</b> given earlier by Hermann Hankel was incorrect and the result does not hold: however, his result remained unnoticed until much later, having no influence on successive developments.|$|E
5000|$|Solutions {{based on}} {{discontinuous}} functions {{may also be}} defined. In particular, for some placements of the two points the optimal solution is generated by a <b>discontinuous</b> <b>function</b> that is nonzero at the two points and zero everywhere else. This function leads to a surface of revolution consisting of two circular disks, one for each point, connected by a degenerate line segment along the axis of revolution. This {{is known as a}} Goldschmidt solution after German mathematician Carl Wolfgang Benjamin Goldschmidt, who announced his discovery of it in his 1831 paper [...] "Determinatio superficiei minimae rotatione curvae data duo puncta jungentis circa datum axem ortae" [...] ("Determination of the surface-minimal rotation curve given two joined points about a given axis of origin").|$|E
