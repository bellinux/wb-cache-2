5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{that tried to}} explain how prions replicate in a protein-only manner was the <b>heterodimer</b> model. This model assumed that a single PrPSc molecule binds to a single PrPC molecule and catalyzes its conversion into PrPSc. The two PrPSc molecules then come apart and can go on to convert more PrPC. However, a model of prion replication must explain both how prions propagate, and why their spontaneous appearance is so rare. Manfred Eigen showed that the <b>heterodimer</b> model requires PrPSc to be an extraordinarily effective catalyst, increasing {{the rate of the}} conversion reaction by a factor of around 1015. This problem does not arise if PrPSc exists only in aggregated forms such as amyloid, where cooperativity may act as a barrier to spontaneous conversion. What is more, despite considerable effort, infectious monomeric PrPSc has never been isolated.|$|E
5|$|Activation of AMPK was {{required}} for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that {{plays an important role}} in insulin signaling, whole body energy balance and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK Activation {{was required}} for an increase in the expression of small <b>heterodimer</b> partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. Mouse models in which the genes for AMPKα1 and α2 catalytic subunits (Prkaa1/2) or LKB1, an upstream kinase of AMPK, had been knocked out in hepatocytes, have raised doubts over the role of AMPK, since the effect of metformin was not abolished by loss of AMPK function. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain; however, metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate). Increased cellular AMP has been proposed to explain the inhibition of glucagon-induced increase in cAMP and activation of PKA. Metformin and other biguanides may antagonize the action of glucagon, thus reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.|$|E

5|$|Heterodimeric antibodies, {{which are}} also {{asymmetrical}} and antibodies, allow for greater flexibility and new formats for attaching a variety of drugs to the antibody arms. One of the general formats for a heterodimeric antibody is the “knobs-into-holes” format. This format is specific to the heavy chain part of the constant region in antibodies. The “knobs” part is engineered by replacing a small amino acid with a larger one. It fits into the “hole”, which is engineered by replacing a large amino acid with a smaller one. What connects the “knobs” to the “holes” are the disulfide bonds between each chain. The “knobs-into-holes” shape facilitates antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity. Single chain variable fragments (scFv) {{are connected to the}} variable domain of the heavy and light chain via a short linker peptide. The linker is rich in glycine, which gives it more flexibility, and serine/threonine, which gives it specificity. Two different scFv fragments can be connected together, via a hinge region, to the constant domain of the heavy chain or the constant domain of the light chain. This gives the antibody bispecificity, allowing for the binding specificities of two different antigens. The “knobs-into-holes” format enhances <b>heterodimer</b> formation but doesn’t suppress homodimer formation.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, two {{independent}} efforts have elucidated the molecular {{architecture of the}} 26S proteasome by single particle electron microscopy. More recently, a pseudo-atomic atomic model has been built, again using cryo-EM. In {{the heart of the}} 19S, directly adjacent to the 20S, are the AAA-ATPases (AAA proteins) that assemble to a heterohexameric ring of the order Rpt1/Rpt2/Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4/Rpt5. This ring is a trimer of dimers: Rpt1/Rpt2, Rpt6/Rpt3, and Rpt4/Rpt5 dimerize via their N-terminal coiled-coils. These coiled-coils protrude from the hexameric ring. The largest regulatory particle non-ATPases Rpn1 and Rpn2 bind to the tips of Rpt1/2 and Rpt6/3, respectively. The ubiquitin receptor Rpn13 binds to Rpn2 and completes the base cub-complex. The lid covers one half of the AAA-ATPase hexamer (Rpt6/Rpt3/Rpt4) and, unexpectedly, directly contacts the 20S via Rpn6 and to lesser extent Rpn5. The subunits Rpn9, Rpn5, Rpn6, Rpn7, Rpn3, and Rpn12, which are structurally related among themselves and to subunits of the COP9 complex and eIF3 (hence called PCI subunits) assemble to a horseshoe-like structure enclosing the Rpn8/Rpn11 <b>heterodimer.</b> Rpn11, the deubiquinating enzyme, is placed {{at the mouth of the}} AAA-ATPase hexamer, ideally positioned to remove ubiquitin moieties immediately before translocation of substrates into the 20S. The second ubiquitin receptor identified to date, Rpn10, is positioned at the periphery of the lid, near subunits Rpn8 and Rpn9.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} much {{speculation}} regarding the functional relevance of G protein-coupled receptor <b>heterodimers,</b> primarily because demonstrating their existence in vivo {{has proven to be}} a considerable challenge.

Importantly, 6 ′-GNTI is an analgesic, thereby demonstrating that opioid receptor <b>heterodimers</b> are indeed functionally relevant in vivo. However, 6 ′-GNTI induces analgesia only when it is administered in the spinal cord but not in the brain, suggesting that the organization of <b>heterodimers</b> is tissue-specific. This study demonstrates a proof of concept for tissue-selective drug targeting based on G protein-coupled receptor heterodimerization.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dimerization {{has emerged}} as an {{important}} feature of chemokine G-protein-coupled receptors. CXCR 4 and CCR 5 regulate leukocyte chemotaxis and {{also serve as a}} co-receptor for HIV entry. Both receptors are recruited to the immunological synapse during T-cell activation. However, {{it is not clear whether}} they form <b>heterodimers</b> and whether ligand binding modulates the dimer formation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using a sensitive Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) imaging method, we investigated the formation of CCR 5 and CXCR 4 <b>heterodimers</b> on the plasma membrane of live cells. We found that CCR 5 and CXCR 4 exist as constitutive <b>heterodimers</b> and ligands of CCR 5 and CXCR 4 promote different conformational changes within these preexisting <b>heterodimers.</b> Ligands of CCR 5, in contrast to a ligand of CXCR 4, induced a clear increase in FRET efficiency, indicating that selective ligands promote and stabilize a distinct conformation of the <b>heterodimers.</b> We also found that mutations at C-terminus of CCR 5 reduced its ability to form <b>heterodimers</b> with CXCR 4. In addition, ligands induce different conformational transitions of <b>heterodimers</b> of CXCR 4 and CCR 5 or CCR 5 (STA) and CCR 5 (Delta 4). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, our data suggest a model in which CXCR 4 and CCR 5 spontaneously form <b>heterodimers</b> and ligand-binding to CXCR 4 or CCR 5 causes different conformational changes affecting heterodimerization, indicating the complexity of regulation of dimerization/function of these chemokine receptors by ligand binding...|$|R

40|$|Receptor {{tyrosine}} kinases of the ErbB {{family are}} implicated {{in a number}} of cancers, including that of the breast. ErbB receptors are activated by ligand-induced formation of homodimers and <b>heterodimers.</b> Receptor heterodimerization is thought to {{play a critical role in}} breast cancers overexpressing multiple members of the ErbB family. Although coexpression of ErbB receptors is associated with poor patient prognosis, the mechanisms by which receptor heterodimerization regulates tumor progression are not clear, due in part to a lack of methods that allow controlled activation of specific receptor <b>heterodimers</b> in mammary epithelial cells. Here, we report an approach to activate ErbB 1 -ErbB 2 <b>heterodimers</b> in a nontumorigenic breast epithelial cell line, MCF- 10 A, without interference from endogenous ErbB receptors. Using such a method, we show that whereas both ErbB 2 homodimers and ErbB 1 -ErbB 2 <b>heterodimers</b> were equally potent in activating the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, the <b>heterodimers</b> were more potent in activating the phosphoinositide 3 '-kinase (PI 3 K) and phospholipase Cgamma 1 pathways than ErbB 2 homodimers. We combined the dimerization system with a three-dimensional cell culture approach to show that whereas both ErbB 2 homodimers and ErbB 1 -ErbB 2 <b>heterodimers</b> induced disruption of three-dimensional acini-like structures, only <b>heterodimers</b> promoted invasion of cells through extracellular matrix. The ability of <b>heterodimers</b> to induce invasion required the ErbB 1 kinase activity and required activation of PI 3 K, Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase, and phospholipase Cgamma 1 signaling pathways. Thus, we have identified cell invasion as a heterodimer-specific biological outcome and suggest that coexpression of ErbB 1 may critically regulate invasive progression of ErbB 2 -positive breast cancers...|$|R

The physiological impact of the loss of antithrombin activity either through latent antithrombin formation or through subsequent dimer formation is exacerbated by the preference for dimerisation to occur between heparin activated β-antithrombin and latent antithrombin as opposed to α-antithrombin.|$|E

Here we suggest {{a mechanism for}} the cell specificity and the subunit composition of constitutive B-cell NF-κB based on the observed properties of Rel homo- and <b>heterodimers</b> and IκBα. We show that c-Rel lacks a nuclear export sequence, making the removal of c-Rel-containing complexes from the nucleus less efficient than removal of p 65 -containing complexes. Second, the nuclear import potential of p 65 and c-Rel homodimers but not p 50 -associated <b>heterodimers</b> was attenuated when they were complexed to IκBα, leading to a greater propensity of <b>heterodimers</b> to be nuclear. We propose that subunit composition of B-cell NF-κB reflects the inefficient retrieval of p 50 –c-Rel <b>heterodimers</b> from the nucleus. Cell specificity may be a consequence of c-Rel–IκBα complexes being present only in mature B cells, which leads to nuclear c-Rel due to IκBα turnover and shuttling of the complex...|$|R
