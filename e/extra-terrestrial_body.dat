40|$|Since {{the time}} of the Authors' study on this subject, a great deal of new {{information}} has become available. Concepts of the nature of extinctions have changed materially. The Authors' conclusion that a catastrophic event was not responsible for the extinction of vertebrates has modified to the extent that hypotheses involving either the impact of a massive <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>body</b> or volcanism provide plausible but not currently fully testable hypotheses. Stated changes resulted in a rapid decrease in organic diversity, as the ratio of origins of taxa to extinctions shifted from strongly positive to negative, with momentary equilibrium being reached at about the Permo-Triassic boundary. The proximate causes of the changes in the terrestrial biota appear to lie in two primary factors: (1) strong climatic changes (global mean temperatures, temperature ranges, humidity) and (2) susceptibility of the dominant vertebrates (large dicynodonts) and the glossopteris flora to disruption of the equlibrium of the world ecosystem. The following proximate causes have been proposed: (1) rhythmic fluctuations in solar radiation, (2) tectonic events as Pangea assembled, altering land-ocean relationships, patterns of wind and water circulation and continental physiography, (3) volcanism, and (4) changes subsequent to impacts of one or more massive extra terrestrial objects, bodies or comets. These hypotheses are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Carbonados are {{a type of}} diamond, {{which are}} made up of many aggregrates of small {{crystalline}} diamonds or microdiamonds. The term "carbonado" comes from the Portuguese word carbonated. They are only found in sedimentary deposits in the Central African Republic (CAR) and the Bahia Province of Brazil. They were once the source of the world's supply of industrial diamonds. Their origin is uncertain but several mutually exclusive hypotheses have been proposed. This theories are: (1) extraterrestrial, that is they formed from the dust cloud of original solar nebulae; (2) produced by the high temperatures and pressures of the Earth's mantle; (3) or as the result of an extra-terrestrial impact into a carbon rich layer of sediment. Our study was done to further the understanding of their origin. We measured the magnetic properties on some twenty samples from the CAR. An earlier study was done on whole samples of carbonados and the "common" or kimberlitic diamond. Our work differed in that we started at the surface and subsequently removed the surface layers (by days of acid immersion) into the interior; measuring the magnetic properties at each interval. This procedure permits us to monitor the distribution of magnetic substances within the samples. Our results showed that the magnetic carriers are distributed on the surface including the open pores and that the carbonado interior is essentially non-magnetic. This result suggests that the initial formation environment was deficient in magnetic particles. Such a situation could indicate that their formation was the result of an <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>body</b> impacting carbon-rich sediment. Obviously, more work will be required on isotopic and chemical analyses before a more detailed ori-in can be determined...|$|E
40|$|The Apollo astronauts {{deployed}} {{geothermal heat}} flow instruments at landing sites 15 and 17 {{as part of}} the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Packages (ALSEP) in July 1971 and December 1972, respectively. These instruments continuously transmitted data to the Earth until September 1977. Four decades later, the data from the two Apollo sites remain the only set of in-situ heat flow measurements obtained on an <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>body.</b> Researchers continue to extract additional knowledge from this dataset by utilizing new analytical techniques and by synthesizing it with data from more recent lunar orbital missions such as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. In addition, lessons learned from the Apollo experiments help contemporary researchers in designing heat flow instruments for future missions to the Moon and other planetary bodies. For example, the data from both Apollo sites showed gradual warming trends in the subsurface from 1971 to 1977. The cause of this warming has been debated in recent years. It may have resulted from fluctuation in insolation associated with the 18. 6 -year-cycle precession of the Moon, or sudden changes in surface thermal environment/properties resulting from the installation of the instruments and the astronauts' activities. These types of reanalyses of the Apollo data have lead a panel of scientists to recommend that a heat flow probe carried on a future lunar mission reach 3 m into the subsurface, approx 0. 6 m deeper than the depths reached by the Apollo 17 experiment. This presentation describes the authors current efforts for (1) restoring a part of the Apollo heat flow data that were left unprocessed by the original investigators and (2) designing a compact heat flow instrument for future robotic missions to the Moon. First, {{at the conclusion of the}} ALSEP program in 1977, heat flow data obtained at the two Apollo sites after December 1974 were left unprocessed and not properly archived through NASA. In the following decades, heat flow data from January 1975 through February 1976, as well as the metadata necessary for processing the data (the data reduction algorithm, instrument calibration data, etc.), were somehow lost. In 2010, we located 450 original master archival tapes of unprocessed data from all the ALSEP instruments for a period of April through June 1975 at the Washington National Records Center. We are currently extracting the heat flow data packets from these tapes and processing them. Second, on future lunar missions, heat flow probes will likely be deployed by a network of small robotic landers, as recommended by the latest Decadal Survey of the National Academy of Science. In such a scenario, the heat flow probe must be a compact system, and that precludes use of heavy excavation equipment such as a rotary drill for reaching the 3 -m target depth. The new heat flow system under development uses a pneumatically driven penetrator. It utilizes a stem that winds out of a reel and pushes its conical tip into the regolith. Simultaneously, gas jets, emitted from the cone tip, loosen and blow away the soil. Lab experiments have demonstrated its effectiveness in lunar vacuum...|$|E
40|$|The {{chronology}} of the Solar System, particularly {{the timing of}} formation of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> and their features, is a major outstanding problem in planetary science. Although various chronological methods for in situ geochronology have been proposed (e. g., Rb-Sr, K-Ar), and even applied (K-Ar), the reliability, accuracy, and applicability of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method makes it {{by far the most}} desirable chronometer for dating <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> The method however relies on the neutron irradiation of samples, and thus a neutron source. Herein, we discuss the challenges and feasibility of deploying a passive neutron source to planetary surfaces for the in situ application of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar chronometer. Requirements in generating and shielding neutrons, as well as analysing samples are described, along with an exploration of limitations such as mass, power and cost. Two potential solutions for the in situ extra-terrestrial deployment of the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method are presented. Although this represents a challenging task, developing the technology to apply the 40 Ar/ 39 Ar method on planetary surfaces would represent a major advance towards constraining the timescale of solar system formation and evolution...|$|R
40|$|Autonomous {{exploration}} rovers {{are currently}} {{the primary means}} of research on <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> Due to the circumstances of their deployment {{it is vital to}} ensure their unassisted performance in a harsh environment. Preliminary simulations are therefore indispensable. To facilitate these simulations we introduce the DLR Rover Simulation Toolkit (RST). The RST constitutes a framework of libraries, allowing engineers to quickly assemble digital rover twins, particularly for early design phases. Enabled by the modelling language Modelica it covers a wide range of aspects from different domains in one unifying framework. This paper establishes in detail the RSTâ€™s structure and design decisions before showing its practical application in a Software-in-the loop (SiL) simulator, elaborating on future enhancements and its use during collaborative engineering studies in the DLR Systems and Control Innovation Lab...|$|R
40|$|Shape and Albedo from Shading (SAfS) {{techniques}} recover pixel-wise surface details {{based on}} the relationship between terrain slopes, illumination and imaging geometry, and the energy response (i. e., image intensity) captured by the sensing system. Multiple images with different illumination geometries (i. e., photometric stereo) can provide better SAfS surface reconstruction due to the increase in observations. Photometric stereo SAfS is suitable for detailed surface reconstruction of the Moon and other <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> due to the availability of photometric stereo and the less complex surface reflecting properties (i. e., albedo) of the target bodies as compared to the Earth. Considering only one photometric stereo pair (i. e., two images), pixel-variant albedo is still a major obstacle to satisfactory reconstruction {{and it needs to be}} regulated by the SAfS algorithm. The illumination directional difference between the two images also becomes an important factor affecting the reconstruction quality. This paper presents a photometric stereo SAfS algorithm for pixel-level resolution lunar surface reconstruction. The algorithm includes a hierarchical optimization architecture for handling pixel-variant albedo and improving performance. With the use of Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera - Narrow Angle Camera (LROC NAC) photometric stereo images, the reconstructed topography (i. e., the DEM) is compared with the DEM produced independently by photogrammetric methods. This paper also addresses the effect of illumination directional difference in between one photometric stereo pair on the reconstruction quality of the proposed algorithm by both mathematical and experimental analysis. In this case, LROC NAC images under multiple illumination directions are utilized by the proposed algorithm for experimental comparison. The mathematical derivation suggests an illumination azimuthal difference of 90 degrees between two images is recommended to achieve minimal error in SAfS reconstruction while results using real data presents similar pattern. Although the algorithm is designed for lunar surface reconstruction, it is likely to be applicable on other <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> such as Mars. The results and findings from this research is of significance for the practical use of photometric stereo and SAfS in the domain of planetary remote sensing and mapping...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} a study of the correlation between the performances of wheels for lunar vehicles predicted using the Nepean wheeled vehicle performance model (NWVPM), developed under the auspices of Vehicle Systems Development Corporation, Ottawa, Canada, and the corresponding test data presented in Performance evaluation of wheels for lunar vehicles, Technical Report M- 70 - 2, prepared for George C. Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), USA, by the US Army Engineer Waterways Experiment Station (WES). The NWVPM was originally developed for design and performance evaluation of terrestrial off-road wheeled vehicles. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the potential of the NWVPM for evaluating wheel candidates for the new generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles. Two versions of a wire-mesh wheel and a hoop-spring wheel, which were considered as candidates for lunar roving vehicles for the NASA Apollo program in the late 1960 s, together with a pneumatic wheel were examined in this study. The tractive performances of these wheels and of a 464 test vehicle with the pneumatic wheels on air-dry sand were predicted using the NWVPM and compared with the corresponding test data obtained under Earth s gravity and previously documented in the above-named report. While test data on wheel or vehicle performances obtained under Earth s gravity may not necessarily be representative of those on <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies,</b> because of the differences in gravity and in environmental conditions, such as atmospheric pressure, it is still a valid approach to use test data obtained under Earth s gravity to evaluate the predictive capability of the NWVPM and its potential applications to predicting wheel or wheeled rover performances on <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> Results of this study show that, using the ratio (P 20 /W) of the drawbar pull to normal load at 20 per cent slip as a performance indicator, there is a reasonable correlation between the predictions and experimental data. This indicates that the NWVPM has the potential as an engineering tool for evaluating wheel candidates for a future generation of extra-terrestrial vehicles, provided that appropriate input data are available...|$|R
40|$|The needle probe method (also {{known as}} the' hot wire' or 'line heat source' method) {{is widely used}} for in-situ thermal {{conductivity}} measurements on soils and marine sediments on the earth. Variants of this method have also been used (or planned) for measuring regolith on the surfaces of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> (e. g., the Moon, Mars, and comets). In the near-vacuum condition on the lunar and planetary surfaces, the measurement method used on the earth cannot be simply duplicated, because thermal conductivity of the regolith can be approximately 2 orders of magnitude lower. In addition, the planetary probes have much greater diameters, due to engineering requirements associated with the robotic deployment on <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> All of these factors contribute to the planetary probes requiring much longer time of measurement, several tens of (if not over a hundred) hours, while a conventional terrestrial needle probe needs only 1 to 2 minutes. The long measurement time complicates the surface operation logistics of the lander. It also negatively affects accuracy of the thermal conductivity measurement, because the cumulative heat loss along the probe is no longer negligible. The present study improves the data reduction algorithm of the needle probe method by shortening the measurement time on planetary surfaces by an order of magnitude. The main difference between the new scheme and the conventional {{one is that the}} former uses the exact mathematical solution to the thermal model on which the needle probe measurement theory is based, while the latter uses an approximate solution that is valid only for large times. The present study demonstrates the benefit of the new data reduction technique by applying it to data from a series of needle probe experiments carried out in a vacuum chamber on JSC- 1 A lunar regolith stimulant. The use of the exact solution has some disadvantage, however, in requiring three additional parameters, but two of them (the diameter and the volumetric heat capacity of the probe) can be measured and the other (the volumetric heat capacity of the regolith/stimulant) may be estimated from the surface geologic observation and temperature measurements. Therefore, overall, the new data reduction scheme would make in-situ thermal conductivity measurement more practical on planetary missions...|$|R
40|$|It is {{apparent}} {{the cost of}} planetary exploration is rising as mission budgets declining. Currently small scientific beds geared to performing limited tasks are being developed and launched into low earth orbit (LEO) {{in the form of}} small-scale satellite units, i. e., CubeSats. These micro- and nano-satellites are gaining popularity among the university and science communities due to their relatively low cost and design flexibility. To date these small units have been limited to performing tasks in LEO utilizing solar-based power. If a reasonable propulsion system could be developed, these CubeSat platforms could perform exploration of various <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> within the solar system engaging a broader range of researchers. Additionally, being mindful of mass, smaller cheaper launch vehicles (approximately 1, 000 kgs to LEO) can be targeted. Thus, in effect, allows for beneficial exploration to be conducted within limited budgets. Researchers at the Center for Space Nuclear Research (CSNR) are proposing a low mass, radioisotope-based, dual-mode propulsion system capable of extending the exploration realm of these CubeSats out of LEO...|$|R
40|$|It {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that a floating surface will charge negative when a plasma is applied over it. One can imagine that any macroscopic dust particle on the surface will also get charged. The theory that describes this charging is, however, underdeveloped. It {{has been suggested that}} the particle will share its charge with the surface, leading to roughly the same surface charge density. This is, however, only valid when both the surface and the particle are electrically conductive. In this contribution, we show a novel model to simulate the charge on a non-conducting particle on a surface in a plasma. It is based on balancing the ion and electron fluxes through the plasma sheath towards the particle. With this, we show that the charge on a particle on a surface can be five orders of magnitude higher than what was previously assumed. Knowledge of the charge on a particle on a surface is important, because it, combined with the plasma sheath electric field, will lead to an electric force on the particle. It has been proposed that this force is important in the lofting of dust from the surface of <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> Additionally, it has been suggested, that it can be used for cleaning in high-tech applications, such as lithography machines and spacecrafts...|$|R
40|$|The {{advances}} {{in the field of}} robotics enabled successful exploration of the Moon and Mars. Over the years, rover missions have demonstrated deployment of various scientific payloads for robotic field geology on these <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> The success of these missions clearly emphasizes the need to further advance rover technology in order to maximise scientific return. The success of future robotic surface exploration missions will depend on two key factors- autonomy and mobility on soft sandy and unstructured terrains. The main contribution of this paper is that it brings together vital information pertaining to various terrain characterisation techniques in to a single article. Special care is taken in structuring the paper so that all the relevant terrain characterisation methods that have been used in past planetary exploration missions and those under consideration for future space exploration missions are covered. This paper will not only lists advantages and disadvantages of various terrain characterisation techniques but also presents the methodology for evaluating and comparing terrain characterisation techniques and provides a trade-off study of existing and potential approaches that could improve the mobility of future planetary exploration rovers. This survey shows that further {{advances in}} currently deployed technology are required in order to develop intelligent, on-board sensing systems which will detect and identify near surface and sub-surface terrain properties to enhance the mobility of rovers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTitan is Saturnâ€™s largest satellite. This {{object is}} unique {{in the solar system}} as it hosts a dense {{atmosphere}} [1] mainly made of molecular nitrogen N 2 and methane CH 4, with a surface pressure of 1. 5 bar. The nitrogen-rich atmosphere and the presence of liquid areas at the surface make {{it one of the most}} interesting objects to understand the evolution of the primitive Earth before the emergence of life and to look for habitable worlds outside the solar system. The Cassini-Huygens Mission has been probing Titan since 2004. It has revealed an intense atmospheric photochemistry initiated by the photo-dissociation and ionization of N 2 and CH 4 [2]. Photochemistry on Titan leads to the formation of solid organic aerosols responsible for a smog permanently surrounding the moon [2, 3]. These aerosols are produced in large amounts and have a significant interest for astrobiology because they are among the most complex organic materials ever detected in <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> In the upper atmosphere, the plasma spectrometer onboard Cassini detected signatures compatible with the presence of heavily charged molecules which are precursors for the solid core of the aerosols [4, 5, 6]. These observations hint at the key role of ion chemistry for organic growth. Further, it is now known that aerosols are initiated in the ionosphere, where gas and solid aerosols coexist in a fully coupled ionic and neutral chemistry. However, the processes coupling ion chemistry and aerosol production are mostly still unknown. For the first time, we use an experimental approach, investigating the ion chemistry, responsible for the organic growth that we observe in Titanâ€™s upper atmosphere. To do this, we use a plasma reactor simulating Titanâ€™s heterogeneous ionosphere chemistry [7]. Positive ions are investigated by in situ ion mass spec- trometry, alongside neutral products complementarily studied through infrared absorption spectroscopy and mass spectrometry...|$|R
40|$|Laser induced {{breakdown}} spectroscopy (LIBS) is {{a technique}} that can determine the elemental composition and quantities of a sample by the spectral analysis of a laser induced plume. This study was undertaken to develop, characterise and assess {{the use of the}} LIBS technique on geological samples in different pressure and gaseous environments. The experimental range chosen was dictated by the planetary conditions on Titan and other <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> with the samples analysed chosen to complement a range of rock types. A LIBS system was developed, together with associated experimental apparatus able to acquire results in varying pressure and gaseous environments. The capability of LIBS to analyse weathered rock samples was investigated under various ambient conditions; pressures of 160 x 103 Pa to 0. 4 x 10 - 3 Pa and ambient gaseous mixtures of air, nitrogen and methane. Particular attention was paid to temporal and power considerations under such regimes. As was expected, the chosen delay time to optimise the emission signals needed to be increased with increasing ambient pressure. At power values as low as 28. 5 mJ/pulse (using a 6 ns pulse from a doubled Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm) a valid emission signal could be obtained. Increasing the laser power resulted in a reduction in the overall signal to noise ratio. It was observed that ambient methane quenches the optical emission signal due to non-radiative transitions. In spite of this, valid qualitative data are obtainable, even when emissions due to carbon transitions from both the sample and the gaseous environment, are present. Results are presented which support the premise that the LIBS technique can be used to investigate both the surface and depth compositions of geological samples under extra-terrestrial conditions.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{achieving}} pinpoint landing accuracy in future space missions to <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies</b> {{such as the}} Moon or Mars presents many challenges, including the requirements of higher accuracy and more flexibility. These new challenges may require the development of novel and more advanced guidance algorithms. Conventional guidance schemes, which generally require a combination of off-line trajectory generation and real-time, trajectory tracking algorithms, have worked well {{in the past but}} may not satisfy the more stringent and difficult landing requirements imposed by future mission architectures to bring landers very near to specified locations. In this paper, a novel non-linear guidance algorithm for planetary landing is proposed and analyzed. Based on Higher-Order Sliding Control (HOSC) theory, the Multiple Sliding Surface Guidance (MSSG) algorithms has been specifically designed {{to take advantage of the}} ability of the system to reach the sliding surface in a finite time. The high control activity seen in typical sliding controllers is avoided in this formulation, resulting in a guidance law that is both globally stable and robust against unknown, but bounded perturbations. The proposed MSSG does not require any off-line trajectory generation and therefore it is flexible enough to target a large variety of point on the planetâ€™s surface without the need for calculation of multiple reference trajectories. However, after initial analysis, it has been seen that the performance of MSSG is very sensitive to the choice in guidance gains. MSSG generated trajectories have been compared to an optimal solution to begin an investigation of the relationship between the optimality and performance of MSSG and the selection of the guidance parameters. A full study has been performed to investigate and tune the parameters of MSSG utilizing reinforcement learning in order to truly optimize the performance of the MSSG algorithm. Results show that the MSSG algorithm can indeed generate trajectories that come very close to the optimal solution in terms of fuel usage. A full comparison of the trajectories is included, as well as a further study examining the capability of the MSSG algorithm under perturbed conditions using the optimized set of parameters...|$|R
40|$|The {{collision}} of the Earth with <b>extra-terrestrial</b> ice-volatile <b>bodies</b> is proposed {{as a mechanism}} to produce rapid changes in the geologic record. These bodies would be analogs of the ice satellites found for the Jovian planets and suspected for comets and certain low density bodies in the Asteroid belt. Five generic end-members are postulated: (1) water ice; (2) dry ice: carbon-carbon dioxide rich, (3) oceanic (chloride) ice; (4) sulfur-rich ice; (5) ammonia hydrate-rich ice; and (6) clathrate: methane-rich ice. Due to the volatile nature of these bodies, evidence for their impact with the Earth would be subtle and probably best reflected geochemically or in the fossil record. Actual boloids impacting the Earth may have a variable composition, generally some admixture with water ice. However for discussion purposes, only {{the effects of a}} dominant component will be treated. The general geological effects of such collisions, {{as a function of the}} dominant component would be: (1) rapid sea level rise unrelated to deglaciation, (2) decreased oceanic pH and rapid climatic warming or deglaciation; (3) increased paleosalinities; (4) increased acid rain; (5) increased oceanic pH and rapid carbonate deposition; and (6) rapid climatic warming or deglaciation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} two challenges {{associated with}} advanced space and planetary exploration: characterizing {{and improving the}} mobility of current and future gas pressurized space suits; and developing effective domestic Planetary Protection policies for the emerging private space industry. Gas-pressurized space suits {{are known to be}} highly resistive to astronaut movement. As NASA seeks to return to planetary exploration, there is a critical need to improve full body space suit mobility for planetary exploration. Volume effects (the torque required to displace gas due to internal volume change during movement) and structural effects (the additional torque required to bend the suit materials in their pressurized state) are cited as the primary contributors to suit rigidity. Constant volume soft joints have become the design goal of space suit engineers, and simple joints like the elbow are believed to have nearly achieved such performance. However, more complex joints like the shoulder and waist have not yet achieved comparable optimization. As a result, it is hypothesized that joints like the shoulder and waist introduce a third, and not well studied, contributor to space suit rigidity: pressure effects (the additional work required to compress gas in the closed operating volume of the suit during movement). This thesis quantifies the individual contributors to space suit rigidity through modeling and experimentation. An Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) space suit arm was mounted in a - 30 kPa hypobaric chamber, and both volume and torque measurements were taken versus elbow angle. The arm was tested with both open and closed operating volumes to determine the contribution of pressure effects to total elbow rigidity. These tests were then repeated using a full EMU volume to determine the actual impact of elbow pressure effects on rigidity when connected to the full suit. In both cases, structural and volume effects were found to be primary contributors to elbow joint rigidity, with structural effects dominating at low flexion angles and volume effects dominating at high flexion angles; pressure effects were detected in the tests that used only the volume of the arm, but were found to be a secondary contributor to total rigidity (on average 75 Â°) flexion angles, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms of these effects are not yet fully understood, and that current models predicting structural effects behavior do not fully represent the actual mechanisms at work. The detection of pressure effects in the well-optimized elbow joint, even if only in a limited volume, suggests that these effects may prove significant for sub-optimized, larger, multi-axis space suit joints. A novel, fast-acting pressure control system, developed in response to these findings, was found to be capable of mitigating pressure spikes due to volume change (and thus, pressure effects). Implementation of a similar system in future space suit designs could lead to improvements in overall suit mobility. A second study, which focused on the implications of the development of the US private space industry on domestic Planetary Protection policy, is also presented. As signatories of the 1967 Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space (commonly known as the Outer Space Treaty), the United States is responsible for implementing Planetary Protection procedures designed to prevent biological contamination of the Solar System, as well as contamination of the Earth by any samples returned from <b>extra-terrestrial</b> <b>bodies.</b> NASA has established policies and procedures to comply with this treaty, and has successfully policed itself independently and autonomously since the signing of the treaty. However, {{for the first time in}} the history of the American space program, private entities outside of NASA have developed the capability and interest to send objects into space and beyond Earth orbit, and no current protocol exists to guarantee these profit-minded entities comply with US Planetary Protection obligations (a costly and time-consuming process). This thesis presents a review of US Planetary Protection obligations, including NASA's procedures and infrastructure related to Planetary Protection, and based on these current protocols provides policy architecture recommendations for the emerging commercial spaceflight industry. It was determined that the most effective policy architecture for ensuring public and private compliance with Planetary Protection places NASA in control of all domestic Planetary Protection matters, and in this role NASA is charged with overseeing, supporting, and regulating the private spaceflight industry. The underlying analysis and architecture tradeoffs that led to this recommendation are presented and discussed. by Bradley Thomas Holschuh. Thesis (S. M.)
