40|$|Excellent {{passenger}} comfort {{should become}} a competitive advantage for railways again. For a long time railways lost the alignment to other modes of transport for example automobiles. In {{the frame of the}} Next Generation Train (NGT) project plenty of passenger comfort aspects, including ride smoothness, vibration, acoustic noise, pressure fluctuation, lighting, and air-conditioning in high-speed trains are addressed. The current paper is the second one in a series [1, 2] giving a comprehensive overview on the passenger comfort activities at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) since 2007. The focus is on the new built test environment for the passenger comfort trials concerning lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). In particular, the generic laboratory developed according to the NGT high speed train geometry is presented. It represents the 8 m long doubledeck mock-up prepared for thermal comfort and energy efficiency trials on HVAC as well as on illumination. A detailed <b>description</b> <b>of</b> thermal <b>manikins,</b> infrared thermography, and laser smoke visualization together with an in-depth sight into the measurement system utilized in a generic laboratory is presented. To analyse the lighting concept the generic laboratory was equipped with corresponding luminaire systems. The analyses of subject trials are described in [2]...|$|R

Whereas, manikin {{is a human}} body model which is increasingly used in different technical applications as science and technology are progressing. Manikins provide useful information about the effects on the human body when exposed to heat, flame, and shock without involving a real human into the test. In such scenarios, maintenance practices <b>of</b> <b>manikins</b> are crucial on accurate performance evaluation and risk assessment in an extreme environmental condition.

40|$|The {{vibration}} attenuation {{performance of}} suspension seats employed in heavy vehicles {{are influenced by}} energy dissipation property of the seated body. Owing to complexities associated with biodynamic response behavior of the human body, the performance assessments of suspension seats are invariably accomplished through laboratory or field experimentation. Such laboratory experiments involve certain safety and ethical concerns, while field measurements yield difficulties in interpretation of the results {{due to lack of}} controlled conditions. In this dissertation, two prototype anthropodynamic manikins, designed to replace human subjects in assessments of seat, are evaluated through laboratory experiments and analyses of the biodynamic responses. The apparent mass (APMS) responses <b>of</b> <b>manikins</b> are characterized under different levels of vibration excitations and three body masses (55 kg, 75 kg and 98 kg). The measured responses are compared with the standardized values to assess the APMS prediction abilities <b>of</b> the <b>manikins.</b> The results suggest the need for deriving more reliable APMS responses of seated humans of particular masses. The applicability <b>of</b> the <b>manikins</b> for seating dynamics is then assessed for a range of seats and vibration spectra of different vehicles. The seat effective acceleration transmissibility (S. E. A. T) of five different seats are measured using human subjects, equivalent inert mass and the prototype manikins. The results suggest that equivalent inert mass could provide reasonably good prediction of seat performance, when excitations dominate in the low frequency range. Under high frequency excitations, the inert mass yields poor estimate of the seat-human system performance, while the manikins provide better estimations. The need for tuning <b>of</b> the <b>manikins</b> was identified to improve their biodynamic response prediction abilities. An analytical model of one <b>of</b> the <b>manikin</b> was thus formulated and analyzed to perform the necessary design refinements. System identification technique was applied to derive uncertain parameters of the model so as to satisfy the measured APMS responses for three body masses. Additional parameter identification was performed to realize desirable parameters that would satisfy the standardized biodynamic response. The results suggested that only minor refinements of the prototype would be needed to enhance the biodynamic response prediction ability <b>of</b> the <b>manikin,</b> which may translate into improved applicability <b>of</b> the <b>manikin</b> for assessment <b>of</b> suspension seats...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a comparison <b>of</b> <b>manikin</b> posturing within and between simulation engineers. Five simulation engineers were asked to simulate and visualize four manual assembly cases. They repeated each task six times, three times with a posture prediction tool and three times with manual adjustment of the body angles. The results show that the posture prediction tool was not used in an optimal manner. Although the prediction tool was quick at suggesting a likely posture, the simulation engineers were reluctant to consider a simulation task completed until the manikin’s posture was realistic in all aspects, not only in the configurations for the major body joints postures but also for fingers, wrists and feet. This fine tuning of fingers is performed with manual manipulation of joints and cancels out the time gained with the posture prediction tool. The fine tuning does not affect the results in objective evaluation methods. Therefore, a lower acceptance level of correctness among managers, simulation engineers and ergonomic specialists is desired, or a shift from visualization to simulation is necessary. Manikin postures differ between simulation engineers. A posture variation exists and this variation in working behaviour should be accepted and simulated. However, simulation engineers also need more extensive knowledge of how workers actually behave on the assembly line; study visits are thus recommended. A shift is also recommended from simulations and visualizations of normal working behaviours to that of ergonomically correct behaviours. This comparison <b>of</b> <b>manikin</b> posturing within and between simulation engineers is an attempt to understand the use of the tool in a practical sense. The comparison indicates that if a posture prediction tool is to be beneficial for the whole organisation, all disciplines involved in the use <b>of</b> <b>manikins</b> must accept simulation results with postures containing some non-cosmetic elements. It is not until such an acceptance is achieved that the successful use of a posture prediction tool will become a reality...|$|R
40|$|The third {{international}} {{meeting for}} users <b>of</b> thermal <b>manikins</b> was organised by the National Institute for Working Life in Stockholm, Sweden on October 12 - 13, 1999. The first meeting was organised {{at the same}} place in February, 1997. Proceedings can be obtained from the organisers. The second meeting took place in Halifax, Canada in June, 1997. Thermal manikins provide a useful and valuable complement to direct experiments with human subjects. In conditions where the heat exchange of is complex and transient measurements with a thermal manikin produce relevant, reliable and accurate values for whole body as well as local heat exchange. Such values are useful for - detailed assessment of thermal stress in environments with human occupancy : determination of heat transfer and thermal properties of clothing : prediction of human responses to extreme or complex thermal conditions : validation of results from human experiments regarding thermal stress : simulation of responses in humans exposed to thermal environments. Thermal manikins are traditionally used by research institutes for climate research. In recent years manikins are increasingly used in many practical applications. Today are manikins frequently used for testing and product development by the building industry and by the automobile industry for evaluation of the performance of heating and ventilation systems. The clothing industry uses <b>manikins</b> for development <b>of</b> clothing systems with improved thermal properties. Test houses perform tests on protective clothing according to defined European or international standards. This kind of work results in continuous improvement of environments and products of importance for comfort, health and safety in working life.

This study attempts to compare the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>manikin</b> demonstration and didactic lectures in teaching conservative management of post-partum haemorrhage. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>manikin</b> demonstration and didactic lectures in teaching conservative management of postpartum haemorrhage. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is an observational study. Eighty four ninth-semester MBBS students posted in Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Government Medical College, Kottayam were selected. They were divided into 2 groups by lottery method. Pre-test was conducted for both groups. Group A was taught by manikin demonstration. Group B was taught by didactic lecture. Feedback response from the students collected after demonstration class was analysed. Post-test was conducted for both the groups after one week. Gain in knowledge of both the groups were calculated from pre-test and post-test scores and compared by Independent sample t test. RESULTS The mean gain in knowledge in group A was 6. 4 when compared to group B which is 4. 3 and the difference {{was found to be}} statistically significant. All of the students in group A felt satisfied and more confident after the class and wanted more topics to be taken by demonstration.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare {{thermal insulation}} and moisture evaporative resistance of a set of protective clothing measured using different type <b>of</b> <b>manikins.</b> The total thermal insulation of seven EU project ensembles (Subzero A and B, Permeable (PERM), Impermeable (IMP), Nomex coverall (with two types of underwear) and Cotton coverall) were measured using the manikin Tore in Sweden, the sweating fabric manikin Walter in Hong Kong, and the manikin Newton in the UK. The results showed that total thermal insulation is reproducible for the seven clothing ensembles measured on the manikins Walter and Tore. The coefficient of variance is less than 8 %. Nomex coverall with cotton underwear has 8 - 16 % higher total insulation than that with polypropylene underwear. The apparent evaporative resistance of the impermeable coverall with cotton underwear measured on Newton was 44. 5 % lower than the evaporative resistance measured on Walter. The effect of condensation and conduction at room temperature environment and measuring time allowing full accumulation of moisture in clothing ensembles might be two important factors affecting the evaporative resistance...|$|R
