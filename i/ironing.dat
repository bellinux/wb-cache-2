As such, his apartment is filled with them. After meeting with Weems, Scully concludes {{that there is no}} X-File, but Mulder believes that his luck is the X-File in question. As the agents begin to leave the complex, one of Cutrona's enforcers comes to kill Weems. However, the assassin dies in an improbable cascade of events reminiscent of a Rube Goldberg machine: after being distracted when Mulder buzzes the intercom (when he forgot the car keys), he accidentally shoots a lamp that knocks over an <b>ironing</b> board, then trips over the <b>ironing</b> board and ends up getting strangled in a fan. The two agents rush back up stairs and find Weems unscathed. Mulder notes that Weems was the sole survivor of a commuter jet crash that killed 20 people in December 1989, where he was placed in Seat 13 of Flight 7: lucky numbers.|$|E

40|$|Remarkable {{progress}} was recently {{achieved in the}} studies on molecular regulators of <b>iron</b> metabolism. Among the main regulators, storage <b>iron,</b> <b>iron</b> absorption, erythropoiesis and hepcidin interact in keeping <b>iron</b> homeostasis.

On the other hand, the research on storage <b>iron</b> metabolism has not advanced since the pioneering research by Shoden in 1953. However, we recently developed a new method for determining ferritin <b>iron</b> and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> by computer-assisted serum ferritin kinetics. Serum ferritin increase or decrease curves were measured in patients with normal storage <b>iron</b> levels (chronic hepatitis C and <b>iron</b> deficiency anemia treated by intra-venous <b>iron</b> injection), and <b>iron</b> overload (hereditary hemochromatosis and transfusion dependent anemia). We thereby confirmed the existence of two <b>iron</b> pathways where <b>iron</b> flows followed the numbered order (1) labile <b>iron,</b> (2) ferritin and (3) hemosiderin in <b>iron</b> deposition and mobilization among many previously proposed but mostly unproven routes. We also demonstrated the increasing and decreasing phases of ferritin <b>iron</b> and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> in <b>iron</b> deposition and mobilization.

40|$|Background. Evidence of iron-mediated {{oxidative}} stress, neutrophil dysfunction {{and enhanced}} bacterial growth after intravenous (IV) <b>iron</b> {{administration has been}} ascribed to a labile or bioactive <b>iron</b> fraction present in all IV <b>iron</b> agents. Methods. To quantify and compare {{the size of the}} labile fraction in several classes of IV <b>iron</b> agents, we examined <b>iron</b> donation to transferrin (Tf) in vitro. We added dilutions of ferric gluconate, <b>iron</b> sucrose and each of two <b>iron</b> dextran preparations to serum in vitro, passed the resulting samples through alumina columns to remove <b>iron</b> agent and free organic <b>iron,</b> and measured Tf-bound <b>iron</b> in the resulting eluates. Comparing results to serum samples without added <b>iron,</b> we calculated delta Tf-bound <b>iron</b> for each agent at each concentration. Finally, we compared delta Tf-bound <b>iron</b> to the concentration of added agent and calculated the percent <b>iron</b> donation to Tf. Results. We found that Tf-bound <b>iron</b> increased with added <b>iron</b> concentration for each agent: delta Tf-bound <b>iron</b> was directly related to the concentration and type of <b>iron</b> agent (P< 0. 001). Mean percent <b>iron</b> donation to Tf ranged from 2. 5 to 5. 8 % with the following progression: <b>iron</b> dextran-Dexferrum< <b>iron</b> dextran-INFeD<iron sucrose<ferric gluconate. Pairwise differences between agents for percent <b>iron</b> donation were statistically significant (P< 0. 05) only between ferric gluconate and both <b>iron</b> dextran agents, and between <b>iron</b> sucrose and <b>iron</b> dextran-Dexferrum.

40|$|We {{attempted}} {{to clarify the}} mechanism of the storage <b>iron</b> metabolism. A new program of serum ferritin kinetics was applied for studying the increasing and decreasing phases of ferritin and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> in <b>iron</b> addition and removal in patients with a normal level of <b>iron</b> stores or <b>iron</b> overload. The change of ferritin <b>iron</b> in response to <b>iron</b> addition and removal was rapid in the initial stage, but it was slow later. In contrast, the change of hemosiderin <b>iron</b> was slow in the initial stage, but it became rapid later. These changes of ferritin and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> suggest that the turnover of ferritin <b>iron</b> is preferential to that of hemosiderin <b>iron,</b> and that the initially existed ferritin <b>iron</b> is gradually replaced by the ferritin <b>iron</b> recovered by taking <b>iron</b> from hemosiderin in <b>iron</b> mobilization. The crossing of the increasing curves of ferritin and hemosiderin <b>iron</b> in <b>iron</b> addition indicates a switching of the principal storage <b>iron</b> from ferritin to hemosiderin. The crossing point shifted toward a higher storage <b>iron</b> level in the increase of <b>iron</b> deposition. <b>Iron</b> storing capacity can be increased {{not only by the}} transformation of ferritin into hemosiderin, but also by the expansion of cell space as seen by hepatomegaly in hereditary hemochromatosis.

40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIFerritin <b>iron</b> {{from food}} is readily {{bioavailable}} to humans {{and has the}} potential for treating <b>iron</b> deficiency. Whether ferritin <b>iron</b> absorption is mechanistically different from <b>iron</b> absorption from small <b>iron</b> complexes/salts remains controversial. Here, we studied <b>iron</b> absorption (RBC Fe- 59) from radiolabeled ferritin <b>iron</b> (0. 5 mg) in healthy women with or without non-ferritin <b>iron</b> competitors, ferrous sulfate, or hemoglobin. A 9 -fold excess of non-ferritin <b>iron</b> competitor had no significant effect on ferritin <b>iron</b> absorption. Larger amounts of <b>iron</b> (50 mg and a 99 -fold excess of either competitor) inhibited <b>iron</b> absorption. To measure transport rates of <b>iron</b> that was absorbed inside ferritin, rat intestinal segments ex vivo were perfused with radiolabeled ferritin and compared to perfusion with ferric nitrilotriacetic (Fe-NTA), a well-studied form of chelated <b>iron.</b> Intestinal transport of <b>iron</b> absorbed inside exogenous ferritin was 14. 8 % of the rate measured for <b>iron</b> absorbed from chelated <b>iron.</b> In the steady state, endogenous enterocyte ferritin contained > 90 % of the <b>iron</b> absorbed from Fe-NTA or ferritin.
