Hamilton Chu, {{executive producer of}} Hearthstone, stated that [...] "a <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> for us was focusing on ... playing the game", and that trading and market features would dilute this experience. Blizzard wanted to do things such as avoid a free market where card values could fluctuate, discourage cheating methods like bots and duping, reduce the unauthorized third party sales (all against the terms of use), and keep the profit derived from the game for the company.|$|E
2500|$|The {{buddy system}} is {{expected}} to provide a level of redundancy within the pair of divers, as a safety backup in case of any equipment failure. Within the overall buddy pair almost all equipment {{can be seen as}} part of a combined [...] "redundant system": two tanks, two depth gauges/ dive computers, two lights, two knives or line-cutters, – even two brains. During the dive the measurement instruments (gauges, dive computers, compass etc.) are available to cross check one another, a second set of life support equipment (i.e. gas supply) is there as a backup in case of a failure in one of the divers' systems. [...] Sometimes a single special-purpose but non-critical piece of equipment is shared by the buddy team, like a single deployable surface marker buoy on which to ascend and mark the team’s position or a single underwater metal detector. [...] The one <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> however, that a buddy team always shares together is a dive plan - and the responsibilities of executing it. [...] A key principle drummed into scuba divers is “plan the dive and dive the plan”. [...] Before a dive a buddy team agree on a plan, which aside from the basic parameters of the dive itself – e.g. [...] depth, course, time, who leads and who follows, - [...] also includes the objectives of the dive: is it general sightseeing, is it the way the divers intend to view a wreck, is it photography, is it hunting a type of game. In technical diving these objectives often become much more complex and very specific – penetration of a particular part of a cave to a particular point. Many diving objectives require allocation of specific roles and responsibilities. [...] For example, in lobster hunting on the west coast of America, buddy teams often split into the assigned roles of hunter and game-catcher, and stower and catchbag-carrier, and the overall dive success is highly dependent on the teamwork of the buddies carrying out their assigned roles.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the live}} session, Miles Davis had already {{established}} {{a reputation as}} one of the jazz era's top live performers, following well-received performances at such venues as Birdland, also known as [...] "The Jazz Corner of the World", in New York and the Newport Jazz Festival in Rhode Island during the mid-1950s. The set at the Plaza Hotel further expanded Davis' repertoire in concert venues and increased his popularity among jazz fans and writers. Even though Milestones was Davis' first use of modes and Cannonball Adderley's presence helped make the band became a more powerful sextet, these sessions helped introduce Bill Evans to the music of Miles Davis. The May 26 session, in particular, exposed Evans to Davis' spontaneous ability in the studio to simplify complicated musical structures. In a 1979 interview for the jazz radio station WKCR, Evans remarked on his recording experience with Davis, stating [...] "Miles occasionally might say, 'Right here, I want this sound', and it turn out be a very <b>key</b> <b>thing</b> that changes the whole character of the [...] For instance, on 'On Green Dolphin Street', the original changes of the chorus aren't the way : the vamp changes being a major seventh up a minor third, down a half tone. That was [...] he leaned over and said, 'I want this here.'" [...] Evans' influence would be apparent on the Kind of Blue sessions as it was during the initial 1958 sessions. All recorded studio work by Davis from 1958 for Columbia was later reissued on the box set compilation The Complete Columbia Recordings of Miles Davis with John Coltrane. Following the implementation of his first modal compositions with the title track of Milestones and his first sessions with Bill Evans, the 1958 Sessions, Davis became satisfied with the results. This led to his preparation of an entire album based on modality, his 1959 masterwork, Kind of Blue.|$|E
