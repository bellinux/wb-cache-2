30|$|For many alliances, {{the ocean}} {{carriage}} part takes {{most of the}} time, and therefore the inventory (which hits the books of the owner) is doing nothing; but it cannot be avoided. The <b>inland</b> <b>transit</b> pieces in the model have a much shorter time, at least in perception, {{to do their work}} and move the merchandise on, and there are many partners. Efficient management by these partners and their agreements is therefore {{the only way to make}} up time. In addition, these <b>inland</b> <b>transit</b> pieces compose more of the cost than the ocean voyage. Coordination of the service requirements should also allow cost reductions through efficient management.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the travel patterns of residents of multi-family housing in Californiaâ€™s Inland Empire. The results {{are intended to}} support local community planning and the vehicle miles traveled reduction goals of SB 375. Using telephone and mail back surveys, the study finds that multi-family housing residents rely primarily on driving alone in private vehicles for their work and non-work trips. Looking at work trips, however, shows that the residents of multi-family housing have higher reported bus/rail transit shares than county averages {{for all types of}} housing. Yet the percentage of work trips in single occupant vehicle trips is similar to county-wide data for all residents, indicating that the use of alternative modes, such as carpooling, is lower for these multi-family housing residents. Comparing the portion of survey respondents that are close to transit services with those that are farther away does not reveal significant differences in transit use, although those close to transit use the carpool mode more frequently. The projects studied near transit showed less transit use than found in mature transit oriented developments (TOD) elsewhere in California, but this is expected since <b>Inland</b> Empire <b>transit</b> service are les...|$|R
