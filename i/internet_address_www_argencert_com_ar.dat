It recommends the following formats (when dialing the area code is optional for local calling) : Telephone number: National notation (042) 123 4567 International notation + 31 (0) 42 123 4567 E-mail address: name@provider. com <b>Internet</b> <b>address</b> / URL: <b>www.</b> company. com It also recommends that a hypen (-), space (), or period (.) {{can be used}} to visually separate groups of numbers. The parentheses are used to indicate digits that are sometimes not dialed. a slash (/) is used to indicate alternate numbers.

With the fast {{growth in the number of}} Internet devices, it looked as if IPv 4 addresses would be exhausted. However, researchers and technologists in the Internet standards organizations anticipated this problem in the early 1990 s and developed methods to extend the life of IPv 4. Meanwhile, they also initiated the development of the “next generation ” of IP, an effort that led to the development and standardization of IPv 6 (version 6 of the Internet Protocol) ...|$|R
