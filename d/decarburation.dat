40|$|Nanocrystalline WC-Co {{coatings}} were deposited by {{high velocity}} oxyfuel from commercial nanostructured composite powders. Processing parameters were optimized for maximal retention of the nanocrystalline size and for minimal <b>decarburation</b> of the ceramic reinforcement. Thermochemical and gas-dynamical properties {{of gas and}} particle flows within the combustion flame were identified in various operating conditions by computational fluid-dynamics (CFD) simulation. Significant improvements of the mechanical properties of the coatings were obtained: a decrease of the friction coefficient was measured for the nanostructured coatings, together with an increase of microhardness and fracture toughness...|$|E
40|$|Microstructured and nanostructured WC-Co {{composite}} coatings can be deposited by HVOF {{starting from}} commercial composite powders. However, {{the reduction in}} powder size of the ceramic reinforcement is responsible for a significant increase of WC reactivity, enhancing the <b>decarburation</b> phenomena taking place within the spraying torch, and potentially affecting the mechanical and tribological properties of the deposited coatings. In order to limit the thermal degradation of the reinforcement, it is therefore necessary to strictly control the main combustion parameters of the torch, such as composition, velocity and temperature of the combustion gases. Using a CFD code, thermo-chemical and gas-dynamic properties of the gas flow within an HVOF JP- 5000 (Hobart Tafa Inc.) torch were simulated. Results of the simulation were used to reconstruct the thermo-chemical history of the powders during their residence in the gas stream...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} focused on the failure {{analysis}} of a cable way rope composed by different wires in which the magnetoscopic analysis has pointed out a significant and abnormal number of failure indications after a relatively short time of service. Such a phenomenon has taken place in one of the longest worldwide cableway plant and it is interesting that the performed microstructural analysis has clearly indicated that the applied steel seems featured by a good soundness of the very fine perlite micro-structure that has not been interested in any way by the <b>decarburation</b> phenomena. Moreover, the realized microhardness tests indicate a reliable homogeneity of the strength properties featuring the steel along the wire section. On the other hand, the fractographic analysis clearly indicates that the source of the failure mechanism is the initiation of the cracks in the surface of the z-shaped wire of the outer wire layer in contact with the wires of the inner layer. The coupling of the different results seems to indicate that the most probable cause of the failure mechanism has {{to be found in the}} excessive pressure applied on the rope and to the consequent sliding between the external wire layer and the inner adjacent one that produces debris and the nucleation of the crack...|$|E
40|$|The Iron {{and steel}} {{industry}} is a key sector {{in the implementation of}} the Circular Economy (CE) and Industrial Symbiosis (IS). It encompasses an intensive material/energy consuming process, with cross-linked input/output flows [1]. A wide literature is available on strategies for CE and IS in steel industry, like the recovery of flue gas and steam to nearby industries and Blast Furnace Slag (BFS) in cement industries [1, 2]. Despite the successful implementation of these strategies, {{there is a need for}} research focused on the valorisation of other steel production residues, whose potential for recycling is not explored at present. The current study presents an environmental evaluation of a novel process aiming at the recycling of Stainless Steel Slag (SSS) as a binder for the production of construction materials. SSS, a residue from the stainless steel production, is usually treated and disposed as an hazardous waste or recycled (after stabilization) as low-quality aggregates. Since chromium is used in the production of stainless steel alloy, a fraction of it appears also in the slag, together with other heavy metals, posing environmental and health threats [2]. In particular Argon Oxygen <b>Decarburation</b> (AOD) slag, produced during the refining process of stainless steel, presents a dusty texture (in the scale of some µm diameter) that makes the handling of the slag difficult. Treatments including the addition of boric oxide, aimed at preventing the disintegration of the slag, have been tested and successfully implemented in industry [3]. However due to costly and energy intensive processes, hazardous content (Cr), additives (boron) and low-value final product, research for more sustainable solutions is needed [4]. The chemical composition of AOD slag is similar to BFS, having analogous cementation characteristics [5]. Some studies [5, 6] have discussed the possibility of applying AOD slag to produce new binders by means of different processes, among which thermo alkali-activation is a very promising option. It involves the activation of the binding property of SSS through the use of alkali silicate compounds and high temperature. The resulting product ensures a safety immobilization of the hazardous components of the slag, which are trapped within its stable matrix. Furthermore, the dusty texture of AOD slag increases the efficiency of the binding process since it generates sufficient reactive surface area, hence foregoing the need of stabilization by boron addition [4]. For the presented study, two different blocks (called S-Blocks) were developed through Alkali- Activation using AOD slag as binder: 1) Solid S-Block- with similar characteristic of paver concrete block and 2) Aerated S-Block- with a porous internal structure resembling to traditional aerated block. Both S- Blocks were produced by mixing AOD slag with river sand at 1 : 3 wt ratio and a mixture of Na/K hydroxides and Na/K silicates. Subsequently they were cured in a steam curing chamber to enhance the hardening process. For solid block the steam curing temperature was maintained at 90 °C at atmospheric pressure, whereas the aerated block was cured at 150 °C and 4 bar pressure. 0, 05 wt% aluminium powder was used to generate air voids within the Aerated S-Block. The purpose of this study is to analyse the environmental performances and economic benefits for the production of S-Blocks, in order to highlight the main gains and drawbacks of this new possible industrial application. status: publishe...|$|E
