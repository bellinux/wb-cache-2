500|$|The {{court held}} that, when the tribes {{conveyed}} {{millions of acres}} of land in Washington State through a series of treaties signed in 1854 and 1855, they reserved the right to continue <b>fishing.</b> The <b>court</b> looked at the minutes of the treaty negotiations to interpret the meaning of the treaty language [...] "in common with" [...] as the United States described it to the Tribes, holding that the United States intended for there to be an equal sharing of the fish resource between the Tribes and the settlers. As the court stated, the phrase means [...] "sharing equally the opportunity to take fish ... therefore, nontreaty fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to 50% of the harvestable number of fish ... and treaty right fishermen shall have the opportunity to take up to the same percentage". The formula used by Boldt gave the tribes forty-three percent (43%) of the Puget Sound harvest, which was equivalent to eighteen percent (18%) of the statewide harvest. The order required the state to limit the amount of fish taken by non-Indian commercial fishermen, causing a drop in their income from about $15,000–20,000 to $500–2,000.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Fish states {{election}} results from other ridings {{should not be}} published in a riding before its polls close so voters can vote without knowing how other voters have voted. Fish says section 329 of the Canada Elections Act does violate section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights for a short while, but section 329 is constitutional because it [...] "relates to a pressing and substantial concern in a free and democratic society", thus satisfying one part of section 1 of the Charter which can limit the rights of Canadians. Section 329 is also constitutional because according to <b>Fish,</b> the <b>court</b> is dealing with [...] "an important element of Canada’s electoral system" [...] so section 1 of the Charter of Rights can be invoked. Fish refers to both a Royal Commission on Electoral Reform and Party Financing publication and a 2005 joint Decima Research-Carleton University Poll; both state Canadians {{do not want to}} know {{election results}} before their polls close. Fish believes even if there is no harm in releasing results early, the information release would create a [...] "perception" [...] of unfairness, which in itself is a problem.|$|R
