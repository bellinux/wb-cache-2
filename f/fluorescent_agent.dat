50|$|The {{laboratory}} {{analysis of}} homocysteine itself is complicated because most homocysteine (possibly above 85%) {{is bound to}} other thiol amino acids and proteins {{in the form of}} disulphides (e.g., cysteine in cystine-homocysteine, homocysteine in homocysteine-homocysteine) via disulfide bonds. Since as an equilibrium process the proportion of free homocystene is variable a true value of total homocysteine (free + bound) is useful for confirming diagnosis and particularly for monitoring of treatment efficacy. To this end it is prudent to perform total homocyst(e)ine analysis in which all disulphide bonds are subject to reduction prior to analysis, traditionally by HPLC after derivatisation with a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>agent,</b> thus giving a true reflection of the quantity of homocysteine in a plasma sample.|$|E

30|$|The <b>fluorescent</b> {{brightener}} <b>agents</b> (FBAs) {{could be}} primarily applied to paper {{to enhance their}} whiteness and brightness characteristics, because it increases the ultraviolet-blocking properties by absorbing light in the near ultraviolet region and re-emitting at a longer wavelength in the blue and visible regions [4 – 7]. As an important class of <b>fluorescent</b> brightener <b>agents,</b> 4, 4 ′-diamino-stilbene- 2, 2 ′-disulfonic acid (DSD), which includes great conjugated system containing double carbon bonds, is widely used for whitening paper [8 – 10]. However, there still exist some deficiencies. DSD-based FBAs on paper tended to have a poor light fastness resulting from the trans–cis photoisomerization during the irradiation, and, consequently, had negative effects on the visual quality and value of paper. In addition, the solutions of the DSD-based FBAs in water have no adhesive property and film-forming property. Therefore, the practical applications of them are limited. To overcome the shortcomings mentioned above, the synthesis of a high-performance <b>fluorescent</b> brightener <b>agent</b> has become an intriguing topic. Zhang et al. prepared many kinds of triazine–stilbene <b>fluorescent</b> brightener <b>agents</b> which include different substitutes in the triazine rings [11 – 16]. Konstantinova et al. prepared polymeric <b>fluorescent</b> brightener <b>agent</b> based on the DSD acid-triazine structure [17 – 19]. Grabachev and Konstantinova et al. prepared polymeric fluorescent brightener by fixing DSD acid-triazine monomer on the long chain of styrene or acrylonitrile [20 – 23]. However, the triazine–stilbene <b>fluorescent</b> brightener <b>agent</b> and the synthetic polymeric <b>fluorescent</b> brightener <b>agent</b> had poor water solubility and single function, which also restrict the practical applications of them.
