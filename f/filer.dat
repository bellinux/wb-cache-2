25|$|The GUI is centred {{around the}} concept of files. The <b>Filer,</b> a spatial file manager, {{displays}} {{the contents of a}} disc. Applications are run from the <b>Filer</b> view and files can be dragged to the <b>Filer</b> view from applications to perform saves. Application directories are used to store applications. The OS differentiates them from normal directories {{through the use of a}} pling (exclamation mark, also called shriek) prefix. Double-clicking on such a directory launches the application rather than opening the directory. The application's executable files and resources are contained within the directory, but normally they remain hidden from the user. Because applications are self-contained, this allows drag-and-drop installation and removal.|$|E
25|$|Plings {{are also}} used in Acorn RISC OS to denote an {{application}} directory: a folder that when double clicked executes a program file inside called !Run. Other files in the appfolder generally contain resources the application needs to run. The appfolder {{can be viewed as}} a normal folder by double-clicking with the shift key held down. In addition, other special resource files such as !Boot (executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the <b>filer),</b> !Sprites (an icon file containing icon definitions loaded if !Boot cannot be found) and !Help (a text, HTML or other executable file listed in the <b>filer</b> menu for the application) also start with a pling.|$|E

40|$|I examine {{three issues}} related to {{internal}} control reporting by non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> Motivation for the three studies {{comes from the fact}} that Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) continues to be controversial, as evidenced by the permanent exemption from Section 404 (b) of SOX granted to non-accelerated <b>filers</b> by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act also requires the SEC to study compliance costs associated with smaller accelerated <b>filers.</b> ^ In the first part of my dissertation, I document that the audit fee premium for non-accelerated <b>filers</b> disclosing a material weakness in internal controls (a) is significantly lower than the corresponding premium for accelerated <b>filers,</b> and (b) declines significantly over time. I also find that in the case of accelerated <b>filers</b> remediating clients pay lower fees compared to clients continuing to report internal control problems; however, such differences are not observed in the case of non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> ^ The second essay focuses on audit report lag. The results indicate that presence of material weaknesses are associated with increased audit report lags, for both accelerated and non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> The results also indicate that the decline in report lag following remediation of problems is greater for accelerated <b>filers</b> than for non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> ^ The third essay examines early warnings (pursuant to Section 302 disclosures) for firms that subsequently disclosed internal control problems in their 404 reports. The analyses indicate that non-accelerated firms with shorter CFO tenure, presence of accounting experts on the audit committee, and more frequent audit committee meetings are more likely to provide prior Section 302 warnings. ^ Overall the results suggest that there are differences in internal control reporting between the accelerated and non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> The results provide empirical grounding for the ongoing debate about internal control reporting by non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> ...|$|R

In addition, the technical process of removal and re-instatement of content on Second Life is subject to failure which can result in content becoming unusable to its owner. This does not effectively prevent content theft; a thief who is subject to a DMCA takedown notice will not challenge it, but will simply create a new account and re-upload the content, often releasing it with all permissions available to maximize propagation out of spite.|$|E

Section 404 is not applied uniformly across different <b>filers.</b> This thesis focuses on the analyses of small companies as these companies, i. e. non-accelerated <b>filers,</b> got exemption from Section 404 (b), which requires a publicly-held company’s auditor to attest to, and report on, management’s assessment of its internal controls. Because this exemption allows non-accelerated <b>filers</b> to avoid significant compliance cost, the purpose of the thesis is to provide a trend analysis of changing proportion of non-accelerated <b>filers</b> from 2002 - 2016 to see if companies have taken advantage of the exemption only applicable to non-accelerated <b>filers.</b> I find that there was a larger proportion of non-accelerated <b>filers</b> right before the effective date of the exemption rule for Section 404 (b) in 2010. In addition, I find that the proportion of companies changing from accelerated to non-accelerated <b>filers</b> is the largest right before 2010. These results are consistent with the notion that non-accelerated <b>filers</b> have the incentive to avoid the huge cost to comply with Section 404 (b) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper uses {{a unique}} data set to shed {{new light on}} credit {{availability}} to consumer bankruptcy <b>filers.</b> In particular, our data allow us to distinguish between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings, to observe changes in credit demand and credit supply explicitly, and to differentiate existing and new credit accounts. The paper has four main findings. First, despite speedy recovery in their risk scores after bankruptcy filing, most <b>filers</b> have much reduced access to credit in terms of credit limits, and the impact seems to be long lasting (well beyond the discharge date). Second, the reduction in credit access stems mainly from the supply side as consumer inquiries recover significantly after the filing, while credit limits remain low. Third, new lenders do not treat Chapter 13 <b>filers</b> more favorably than Chapter 7 <b>filers.</b> In fact, Chapter 13 <b>filers</b> are {{much less likely to}} receive new credit cards than Chapter 7 <b>filers</b> even after controlling for borrower characteristics and local economic environment. Finally, we find that Chapter 13 <b>filers</b> overall end up with a slightly larger credit limit amount than Chapter 7 <b>filers</b> (both after the filing and after discharge) because they are able to maintain more of their old credit from before bankruptcy filing. Our results casts doubt on the effectiveness of the current bankruptcy system in providing relief to bankruptcy <b>filers</b> and especially its recent push to get debtors into Chapter 13...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{filing for bankruptcy}} under Chapter 13 helps financially distressed debtors save their homes. We develop a model of debtors’ decisions to default on their mortgages and file for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 and evaluate the model using new data on Chapter 13 bankruptcy <b>filers.</b> We also {{examine the effect of}} allowing bankruptcy judges to reduce debtors’ mortgage payments, i. e., introducing “cram-down” of mortgages in Chapter 13. We find that 96 % of Chapter 13 <b>filers</b> are homeowners and 79 % of <b>filers</b> repay mortgage debt in their repayment plans; while just 9 % of <b>filers</b> repay only unsecured debt in their plans. These results suggest that <b>filers</b> use Chapter 13 almost exclusively as a “save-your-home” procedure. But under current law, only about 1 % Chapter 13 <b>filers</b> save their homes when they would otherwise have defaulted. If cram-down were introduced, we predict that this fraction would increase to 10 %.

40|$|After {{decades of}} {{lobbying}} to “get tough” on bankruptcy repeat <b>filers,</b> Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA). The Bankruptcy Code now {{requires that the}} automatic stay, which prevents creditors from pursuing the property of bankruptcy debtors, expires after thirty days for petitioners who file for bankruptcy within one year of a previously failed petition. Debtors can file a motion to extend the stay, {{but there is a}} presumption of a bad faith filing, only overcome if a debtor can show there has been a “substantial change in his or her financial or personal affairs” that makes discharge likely. Despite the Congressional focus on repeat <b>filers,</b> there has been little scholarly study of them. This study uses a national random sample to analyze post-BAPCPA repeat <b>filers.</b> I find that even post-BAPCPA, there is a significant number of repeat <b>filers.</b> Indeed, 14. 7 % of all bankruptcy petitions filed in 2007 were repeaters, and of Chapter 13 repeat <b>filers,</b> 69 % filed a new petition within a year after a previous petition’s failure. Further, the strict new Congressional rules for repeat <b>filers</b> have effected little practical change: 98 % of petitions to extend the automatic stay are granted, even though the majority of repeat <b>filers</b> provide no evidence of changed circumstances. Based on these findings, interviews with bankruptcy judges, trustees, and lawyers, and analysis of relevant case law, I explain why BAPCPA’s crack-down on repeat <b>filers</b> has effected little practical change, and argue that effectively tackling the refiler problem will likely require very different tactics than those employed in BAPCPA...|$|R
