As the season progressed, their winning ways continued, and with only two games remaining (both home contests against the St. Louis Ambush), the Drillers needed only one win to clinch the conference title.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Pillman {{had left}} the Horsemen, but they added Steve McMichael and his wife Debra in June, which didn't sit well with Woman. In her next angle, the two bickered, not getting along in general. The Four Horsemen were often given {{interview}} time on Nitro and when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Debra to speak on the mic, she'd often go into a soliloquy regarding Woman's looks and fashion sense — usually when the two weren't within the vicinity of each other. Despite the heavy tension, the two managers never had a physical altercation.|$|E
25|$|When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> CBS to {{broadcast}} Game 6 of the 1980 Finals (on Friday, May 16), the network gave its affiliates {{the option of}} either airing the game live or on tape delay (in fact, WAGA-TV in Atlanta did not carry the NBA on CBS for numerous years). If the affiliate chose to air the game later that night, then the prime time schedule would consist of reruns of The Incredible Hulk, The Dukes of Hazzard and Dallas (CBS, NBC and ABC ended the 1979–80 seasons in late March and early April {{in anticipation of a}} strike by the Screen Actors Guild, which came to fruition in July 1980). The clinching Game 6 of the 1980 Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Philadelphia 76ers was most notably, aired live in the Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Portland and Seattle markets; CBS stations in the latter three markets were able to air the game live and still show most of the CBS prime time schedule since the game tipped at 6:00p.m. Pacific Time. Otherwise, most CBS affiliates chose to air Game 6 on tape delay.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead and Russell {{had thought}} {{originally}} that Principia Mathematica {{would take a}} year to complete; it ended up taking them ten years. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> publication, the three-volume work was so long (more than 2,000 pages) and its audience so narrow (professional mathematicians) that it was initially published at a loss of 600 pounds, 300 of which was paid by Cambridge University Press, 200 by the Royal Society of London, and 50 apiece by Whitehead and Russell themselves. [...] Despite the initial loss, today there is likely no major academic library in the world which does not hold a copy of Principia Mathematica.|$|E

500|$|The {{reasons for}} Wagner's strong {{negative}} {{reaction to the}} ATC's request {{have been the subject}} of much speculation. The most commonly told account is that Wagner rejected the deal because he did not want young baseball fans to purchase the tobacco packs for his baseball card. Wagner held high respect for many of his fans, most particularly his young fans. His granddaughter, Blair, remarked that [...] "e loved children. He wanted to teach kids good sportsmanship. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> that card to come out, it wasn't that he wasn't paid. He didn't want kids to have to buy tobacco to get his card." [...] However, Wagner chewed tobacco, and he had previously appeared in advertisements for many tobacco products, including a cigar baseball trading card in 1899 and a newspaper ad for Murad cigarettes during the 1909 World Series.|$|E

Interscope Records president Jimmy Iovine played Furtado a few of Timbaland's latest productions, which she responded positively to. According to Furtado, [...] "It sound like he's listening to all the same stuff as me— everything from System of a Down to Bloc Party and Death from Above 1979, {{and a lot of}} Coldplay, too". [...] "Within no time", the two were working on music at The Hit Factory in Miami, Florida, alongside Timbaland's protege Danja. There, they produced ten of Looses thirteen tracks.|$|E

When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> his ceremonial [...] "seating" [...] Mickal refused to appear for the ceremony, despite the urging of Long. After Long reasoned with the senate and spectators that Mickal [...] "had to study," [...] Mickal was granted a five-day leave of absence by senator Harvey Peltier to [...] "do his work at school and go forward with his preparation for his football duties." [...] Mickal remained silent on the matter, however; he did not give a reason for his refusal of the honor.

500|$|While {{both sides}} busied {{themselves}} with shipbuilding, the growing American fleet patrolled {{the waters of}} Lake Champlain. At one point in August, Arnold sailed part of the fleet to the northernmost end of the lake, within [...] of Saint-Jean, and formed a battle line. A British outpost, well out of range, fired a few shots at the line without effect. On September 30, expecting the British to sail soon, Arnold retreated to the shelter of Valcour Island. During his patrols of the lake Arnold had commanded the fleet from the schooner , carrying 12guns and captained by David Hawley. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the battle, Arnold transferred his flag to , a row galley.

500|$|On October 14, West, in {{collaboration}} with Italian artist Vanessa Beecroft, hosted a promotional album listening event at Ace Gallery. Over 700 guests were invited to preview the entirety of 808s & Heartbreak. Under Beecroft's guidance, the event featured approximately forty nude women wearing nothing besides wool masks who silently {{stood in the center}} of the room. The women were illuminated by multicolored lights that would change as the music progressed. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> him to speak, West stated that he'd been a fan of Beecroft's work and strong imagery, saying that he liked the idea of nudity because [...] "society told us to wear clothes at a certain point". Beecroft had been contacted a month prior and conceptualized and generated the installation in a week. Beecroft admitted that while he had caught her offguard, she had the opportunity to hear the album for herself and heard things that touched her own life. Five days later, promotional photos for the album by photographer Willy Vanderperre were released. The images portrayed West wearing a grey glen plaid suit, large browline glasses, and a heart-shaped pin.|$|E
500|$|The band's {{follow-up}} single, [...] "Get Me to the World on Time", {{which put}} distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged Bo Diddley beat, {{was released in}} May 1967. The song managed to chart at number 27 in the US and number 42 in the UK, and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> The Electric Prunes to record songs for their first album, they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of Tucker and Mantz's (also Jill Jones) songwriting partnership, which composed {{the majority of the}} album's material. The group's debut album, The Electric Prunes possessed exotically-combined effects, and violin-like guitar riffs, mixed with a diverse, and somewhat uneven, selection of pop songs, with only [...] "Train For Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Luvin'" [...] being penned by the band. Tracks such as the soft rock tune, [...] "Onie" [...] and [...] "Toonerville Trolley" [...] suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound. Reflecting on the album, Tulin said, [...] "Consequently there are definitely songs that I believe do not belong on the album and were, in fact, a waste of our time and energy. There were several other ideas we were working on, but [...] realized there was no use pursuing them because they too would have been 'too weird.'" ...|$|E
500|$|When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a {{video for}} [...] "Jurassic Park", Yankovic opted to use stop-motion and claymation; he joked during a Q {{that this was}} because [...] "it's just too hard to find real live dinosaurs these days." [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was Yankovic's first video that was entirely animated—previous videos, such as [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] and [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] had {{featured}} elements of animation. The video was directed by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund. Yankovic initially heard of the duo from Bill Manspeaker, the lead singer of the comedy rock band Green Jellÿ. After being hired for the project, the two [...] "basically turned a private residence in Los Angeles into a clay animation studio." [...] The two worked between July and August 1993, and slept in shifts, so that the final project would be ready for its release in October 1993. One critic noted that the music video {{seems to have been}} done in the style of Will Vinton's Dinosaurs! – A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time! The video parodies scenes from, as well as the general plot of the 1993 movie, and contains a myriad of sight-gags—as is usual for Yankovic's videos—such as a claymation version of Steven Spielberg running from dinosaurs, Barney having his head ripped off, and a Velociraptor attempting to break down a door, only to realize it has a key.|$|E
5000|$|Reception for {{the film}} was positive. Entertainment Weekly film critics Rob Gonsalves and Filmcritic.com's Christopher Null praised the movie, with Null stating [...] "the movie gets its real kick when <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> {{everyone}} to sell their rights to Hollywood... with one writer remarking she has 'Holly Hunter' in mind for the lead."

500|$|O'Toole {{relished the}} {{opportunity}} {{that came with}} Jonathan's passing, {{even though she was}} saddened to see a friend leave the show. Martha taking the senate seat was a chance to explore more adult stories with her character beginning midway through season five, which was important for the actress since Clark was becoming an adult on the show. It also allowed for O'Toole the chance to depict [...] "strong emotions" [...] over Jonathan's death. Al Gough feels that Jonathan's passing allowed for them to explore more of Martha's smart and strong side, as well as her relationship with Lionel. The idea was to show that there was some form of attraction between Martha and Lionel, but that Martha would never have any romantic relationship with the billionaire, especially after all that he had done to her family. O'Toole likens Martha's interest in Lionel with that of watching a dangerous animal: [...] "It's that attraction you have for a very beautiful, dangerous animal. You know you can't stop watching it, {{but at the same time}} you feel, 'Oh my God, he's going to kill me.'" [...] The actress believes that Martha's ultimate motivation was to get close enough to Lionel to know what he is planning to do to Clark. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> Martha to leave the show, writer Todd Slavkin contends that they wanted to give the character [...] "more of a send-off" [...] than they achieved on film. Slavkin explains that they could not do anything equivalent to what they gave John Schneider, as there were already so many storylines going on by the season six finale that they could not fit anything else in. The writers also realized that they could not kill off the character, and so chose to send her to the US Senate, creating a parallel to Clark where Martha fights injustice on the political stage.|$|E
