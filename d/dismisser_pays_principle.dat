In this article we will illustrate how these guidelines may be helpful to solve current environmental issues. We will argue that the guidelines of the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> apply to the establishment of coherent programmes of measures, as required under the Air Quality Directive and Water Framework Directive.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the implementation of}} the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> to the prosecution of offenders under the Environment Protection Act 1970 (Vic.). The history of the legislation and the mechanisms it establishes are examined. Alternative mechanisms of implementing the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> are considered. The study is limited in the conclusions it reaches by concentrating upon prosecution, which is only one of a range of strategies available to implement the principle. Further research is needed to reach a final conclusion. However, the study reveals that a rational implementation of the principle is not possible unless the Environment Protection Authority takes an integrated approach to the available strategies, and guidelines are introduced for the imposition of penalties. It is recognized that the long-term significance of the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> may be limited if pollution prevention approaches are successful. While pollution continues, implementation of the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> should be sought as a fair allocation of the social costs caused by pollution.

40|$|According to Article 9 of the European Water Framework Directive, water-pricing {{policies}} {{have to provide}} adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently by 2010. In this paper, we investigate some of the conflicts that may arise when introducing the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> for the recovery of costs of {{water supply and sanitation}} services. We argue that conceptually, there are no a priori reasons to question the co-existence of the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> with other principles of environmental policy, although the latter do influence its practical implementation. There also seem to be no major formal conflicts with the rules that govern services of economic interest. This, however, does not mean that it is easy to implement the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> in the water sector. Rather, it is a consequence {{of the fact that the}} Water Framework Directive does not reflect a strong commitment to a very stringent implementation of the principle that the polluter should pay. This does not imply that the ideas that lie behind the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> should therefore be abandoned, but the neoclassical motive of cost-efficiency might not be the main argument to recommend its use in the context of water supply and sanitation services. ...|$|R
40|$|Climate change poses grave {{threats to}} many people, {{including}} the most vulnerable. This {{prompts the question}} of who should bear the burden of combating 'dangerous' climate change.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{two distinct}} questions of distributive justice raised by climate change. Stated very roughly, one question concerns how much protection is {{owed to the}} potential victims of climate change (the Just Target Question), and the second concerns how the burdens (and benefits) involved in preventing dangerous climate change should be distributed (the Just Burden Question). In Section II, I focus {{on the first of}} these questions, the Just Target Question. The rest of the paper examines the second question, the Just Burden Question. To answer this question, I argue, it is necessary to address two important methodological questions (one concerning the choice between what I term Integrationism and Isolationism and the other concerning the choice between what I term Holism and Atomism). Sections III-V, thus, set out and explore these two methodological issues. Having done so, the paper then turns from methodological issues to substantive analysis, and in Section VI it examines three principles of distributive justice that, it has been suggested, should determine how the burden of addressing dangerous climatic changes should be distributed (the Polluter <b>Pays</b> <b>Principle,</b> the Ability to <b>Pay</b> <b>Principle</b> and the Beneficiary <b>Pays</b> <b>Principle)</b> ...|$|R

50|$|The {{water sector}} {{is subject to}} ongoing {{reorganization}} by a government reform initialized {{with the help of}} international development partners in 2006, especially the German GIZ water reform project. In 2010, a comprehensive Water Code geared towards national development goals was adopted by the government of the DRC, which provides a national legislative framework for sustainable water management. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) is a fundamental principle stated in the Water Code, which aims at the establishment of a structured process to reconcile the interests of the different stakeholders. Key concepts include a land zoning system to ensure protection of strategic drinking water resources and their watersheds, user <b>pays</b> <b>principle,</b> polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle,</b> precautionary principle, subsidiary principle and public dialogue and consultation.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{and compares}} two different legal means [...] full liability and standard – to reduce and to regulate pollution {{at a local}} level accounting for private information about benefits and costs. The familiar polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> makes the polluter liable for any damage. Since the courts lack information about the true damage the pollutee can and presumably will overstate this damage. Nevertheless, voluntary arrangements bypassing the courts exist (e. g., for Coasean reasons). However, such out-of court arrangements fail to improve {{in many cases the}} inefficient allocation of pollution due to agency costs. Given these unsatisfactory consequences of the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> even after allowing for contracts around the law, we propose a modification of standards: the pollutee is entitled that a certain standard is satisfied, yet can trade this right for financial compensations. Contracts induced by this legal rule are countervailing (the optimal mechanism switches between subsidies and payments and first best efficiency holds at both ends) and this characteristic allows such a “privatized” standard to track the first best quite well and (often) better than the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle.</b> This relative ranking under private information is the opposite of the one that holds under uncertainty (here liability dominates the standard).

40|$|The {{debate whether}} {{university}} {{education should be}} “free ” seems misconstrued. Even in a system without tuition fees, someone will have to foot the bill. This paper argues that {{from the viewpoint of}} justice, a strong case can be made in higher education for adopting the beneficiary <b>pays</b> <b>principle,</b> and for institutionalising it {{in the form of a}} graduate tax. My evaluation from the perspective of justice will focus on the comparison between a “free ” university system funded through the general tax system on the one hand, and one financed through a graduate tax on the other. On the beneficiary <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> defended here, the regressive nature of the general-tax-funded higher education system renders it unjust. Furthermore, I believe we have three reasons to favour a graduate tax in practice. First, I will sug-gest that it does a better job at implementing the beneficiary <b>pays</b> <b>principle.</b> Second, I will argue that even though the distributive outcome of a corrected general-tax-funded education may be just, it is unlikely to be perceived to be just. A third point of comparison between the two approaches to fund higher education will be international mobility, which will reinforce the case for a graduate tax from the viewpoint of justice.

30|$|Most interested, {{informed}} {{consumers in}} the present study considered legislators as responsible for the reduction of harmful substances in products, followed by consumers and in the third place manufacturers. This assignment of responsibility is not in line with the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle</b> {{which is one of the}} basic principles in environmental policy and which puts the responsibility on the shoulders of manufacturers. The REACH Regulation [34] demands that producers and importers take responsibility for managing chemical risks and prove that their products are safe before they can be placed on the market. Legally defined responsibilities depend on the legal frameworks and product types. In contrast to the REACH Regulation and the polluter <b>pays</b> <b>principle,</b> consumers bear a large part of the responsibility in the application of personal care products [4].|$|R

Both accepted that the alternative Receiver <b>Pays</b> <b>Principle</b> (RPP) would solve the monopoly problem, but rejected it primarily because RPP might lead to significant numbers of users switching off their mobile phones. Evidence from RPP countries is consistent with RPP solving market power problems. CPP is almost certainly less efficient than RPP. US and other evidence suggests that the argument about customers switching off phones is not tenable. If the aim is efficient resource allocation, undistorted by excessive termination charges and subsidised handsets, to be achieved by competition rather than price controls, then RPP is preferable to CPP...|$|R
