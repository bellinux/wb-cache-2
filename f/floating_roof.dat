25|$|Architects were Aviaplan, a {{joint venture}} between the {{agencies}} Nordic — Office of Architecture, Niels Torp, Skaarup & Jespersen and Hjellnes Cowi. Main architect was Gudmund Stokke. The terminal building has a light, <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> that gives a simple construction. First the walls were erected, and a roof put on top. Afterwards, internal facilities could be added. The roof is held up with wooden reefers. The main construction materials are wood, metal and glass. The airlines were required to follow the same design rules for their buildings as the terminal.|$|E
500|$|The {{facility}} {{was designed by}} Graham McCourt Architects. [...] While {{they set out to}} design a unique building, the idea of a western theme never occurred to Barry Graham or his team. [...] The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid, allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one-third when compared to traditional arenas, resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs, plus the <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> can flex to compensate for the city's frequent temperature fluctuations. [...] When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped. [...] Of 1,270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena, 735 involved the word Saddle. [...] The winning name in the contest, Olympic Saddledome, was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names. At the time the name received a tepid reception from some, including the chairman of Calgary's Olympic Organizing Committee (OCO), Frank King, who was quoted as saying [...] "It is neither Olympic nor western, and it's not even dome".|$|E
50|$|<b>Floating</b> <b>roof</b> {{tanks are}} broadly divided into {{external}} <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks (usually called <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tanks: FR Tanks) and internal <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> types (IFR Tanks).|$|E
50|$|Liquids {{subject to}} {{breathing}} losses may {{be stored in}} tanks with <b>floating</b> or expansion <b>roofs</b> for conservation.|$|R

40|$|The Chair ?Construction and Maintenance of Oil and Gas Pipelines and Storages? has {{developed}} a new construction of a covering with dampers that increases stability for vertical steel tanks. For an evaluation of dampers influence on stability of a Covering a mathematical model permitting to receive design performances of stability for a Covering with dampers and without dampers was developed. The issues of strength synthetic covering when mounted on the supporting structure {{in the form of}} multi-beam stars. Increased load to seal gates assembly appears in tanks of large capacity with <b>floating</b> <b>roofs,</b> which may lead to their destruction. For reasonable conclusion about safe exploitation of noticed tanks the model of such tank was constructed and researched, which gave possibility to determine the liquid speed during the process of uploading the product for storage and optimal position of directing racks inside the tank...|$|R
5000|$|Chapter 7 [...] "Liquid Storage Tanks" [...] {{is devoted}} to the {{methodology}} for calculating the emissions losses from the six basic tank designs used for organic liquid storage: fixed roof (vertical andhorizontal), external <b>floating</b> <b>roof,</b> domed external (or covered) <b>floating</b> <b>roof,</b> internal <b>floating</b> <b>roof,</b> variable vapor space, and pressure (low and high). The methodology in Chapter 7 was developed by the American Petroleum Institute in collaboration with the EPA.|$|E
50|$|IFR {{tanks are}} used for liquids with low {{flash-point}}s (e.g., ATF, MS. gasoline, ethanol). These tanks are nothing but cone roof tanks with a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> inside which travels up and down along with the liquid level. This <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> traps the vapor from low flash-point fuels. Floating roofs are supported with legs or cables on which they rest.FR tanks {{do not have a}} fixed roof (it is open in the top) and has a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> only. Medium flash point liquids such as naphtha, kerosene, diesel, and crude oil are stored in these tanks.|$|E
50|$|Some {{storage tanks}} need a <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> in {{addition}} to or {{in lieu of the}} fixed roof and structure. This <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> rises and falls with the liquid level inside the tank, thereby decreasing the vapor space above the liquid level. Floating roofs are considered a safety requirement as well as a pollution prevention measure for many industries including petroleum refining.|$|E
50|$|Costello's {{work was}} characterised {{by the use}} of an {{architectural}} language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, <b>floating</b> flat <b>roofs,</b> masses set against voids and monumentality. Though modest in scale and form, the design of the shelters is characteristic of work in this idiom. The reusable shelters were often sited under fig trees, to aid in camouflage.|$|R

25|$|Two former {{employees}} of Toyō Itō, Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa formed a collaborative partnership in 1995 called SANAA. They {{are known for}} creating lightweight, transparent spaces that expose the fluidity and movement of their occupants. Their Dior store in Shibuya, Tōkyō, in 2001 was reminiscent of Itō's Mediatheque, with cool white acrylic sheets on the external facade that filter the light and partially reveal the store's contents. Their dynamic of fluidity is demonstrated by the Rolex Learning Centre at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, completed in 2010. This building has an undulating floor plane set under a continuous concrete shell roof that was poured in one go over two days. The plan is like a biological cell punctuated with tables and courtyards alike. In 2009 they designed the Serpentine Gallery Pavilion in London that comprised a reflective, <b>floating</b> aluminium <b>roof</b> supported by slender columns.|$|R

50|$|The former ES&A Bank {{building}} {{was built on}} the corner of Elizabeth and Franklin Street Melbourne in 1959-60 by Melbourne architects Chancellor and Patrick. Originally intended to be a 12-storey office tower, only the base banking chamber section was built at the time. The most distinctive features of the building are the massive rock-faced random coursed Dromana granite pier/wall sections, dominating the side elevation, topped by a thin <b>floating</b> slab <b>roof</b> projecting over the recessed front elevation. The space between the stone piers on the Franklin Street elevation is filled with a patterned, vertical ribbed concrete screen. The building is considered to display influences from International modernism, and the organic sensibilities of Frank Lloyd Wright as well as the Griffins. The extra floors were added in 2004, but as an apartment building with regular glass balconies, rather than the originally proposed solid masonry balconies projecting every second floor, and various changes to the original base section have infilled openings in the front facade, and undermined the floating qualities of the original roof.|$|R
60|$|Every {{minute that}} white woolly plain which covered {{one half of}} the moor was {{drifting}} {{closer and closer to the}} house. Already the first thin wisps of it were curling across the golden square of the lighted window. The farther wall of the orchard was already invisible, and the trees were standing out of a swirl of white vapour. As we watched it the fog-wreaths came crawling round both corners of the house and rolled slowly into one dense bank, on which the upper floor and the <b>roof</b> <b>floated</b> like a strange ship upon a shadowy sea. Holmes struck his hand passionately upon the rock in front of us and stamped his feet in his impatience.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour {{afterwards}} he rode {{into the}} town. The small square houses were dark {{and there was}} nobody in the narrow street, but he heard a confused uproar farther on. Although the glare in the sky was fainter, it leaped up now and then and {{a cloud of smoke}} <b>floated</b> across the <b>roofs.</b> A red glow shone down the next street and he saw the pavement was torn up. Broken furniture lay among piles of stones, the walls were chipped, and when Kit got down he had some trouble to lead the mule across the ruined barricade. Although he saw nobody yet, the shouts that came from the neighborhood of the presidio were ominous.|$|R

40|$|The aim of my diploma {{thesis is}} to {{elaborate}} project documentation for {{the execution of}} a new building home for elderly people. The intention is to construct a new apartment building for pensioners {{who are able to}} do activities of daily living. There can be found 24 lease flats for a maximum of 30 accommodated people. The home offers 12 hours care service and has rooms for carers, dining rooms, places for rehabilitation, outpatient care and stores for keeping accommodated people’s things. The whole area has wheelchair access and counts with the movement of people with reduced mobility. The building is designed as brick, using clay blocks which are put on concrete foundation strips. Thermal insulation is a combination of contact thermal insulation system and ventilated facade with hanging plates. The roofing is designed partly as a <b>float</b> double-shell <b>roof</b> with timber truss girder, and partly as a single-shell roof with concrete load-bearing structure. The drawing documentation has been created using computer programs AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, and the programs by doc. Dr. Ing.

40|$|Tank {{fires are}} rare but carry {{significant}} potential risk {{to life and}} property. For this reason fire protection of tanks is critical. Fixed Low expansion foam and water spray cooling systems {{are one of the}} most effective and economical ways to reduce damages to a tank from fire.

This paper studies in a systematic way the problems of foam and cooling systems currently installed in a few domestic companies which operate storage tanks with focus on <b>floating</b> and fixed <b>roof</b> atmospheric tanks containing hydrocarbons and offers possible solutions for more efficient installation, design and operation of such systems...|$|R
50|$|An {{external}} <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank is {{a storage}} tank {{commonly used to}} store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate. It comprises an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats {{on the surface of}} the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a fixed roof tank there is no vapor space (ullage) in the <b>floating</b> <b>roof</b> tank (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates breathing losses and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid. There is a rim seal system between the tank shell and roof to reduce rim evaporation.|$|E

60|$|The {{girls and}} women in our {{carriage}} behaved themselves modestly and becomingly all the way out, except that they smoked. When {{we arrived at the}} garden in Asnieres, we paid a franc or two admission and entered a place which had flower beds in it, and grass plots, and long, curving rows of ornamental shrubbery, with here and there a secluded bower convenient for eating ice cream in. We moved along the sinuous gravel walks, with the great concourse of girls and young men, and suddenly a domed and filigreed white temple, starred {{over and over and over}} again with brilliant gas jets, burst upon us like a fallen sun. Nearby was a large, handsome house with its ample front illuminated in the same way, and above its <b>roof</b> <b>floated</b> the Star-Spangled Banner of America.|$|R

The little boat moved un easily from left to right, backed, yawed again, went ahead, and at last the gray blunt gun's nose was held as straight as a rifle-barrel on the mark indicated. Then Mr. Davies allowed the whistle to speak as it is not allowed to speak in Her Majesty's service on account of waste of steam. The soldiery of the village gathered into knots and groups and bunches, and the firing up the hill ceased, and every one except the crew of the flatiron yelled aloud.

50|$|In the USA, {{storage tanks}} operate under no (or very little) pressure, {{distinguishing}} them from pressure vessels. Storage tanks are often cylindrical in shape, {{perpendicular to the}} ground with flat bottoms, and a fixed flangible or <b>floating</b> <b>roof.</b> There are usually many environmental regulations applied to the design and operation of storage tanks, often depending {{on the nature of the}} fluid contained within. Above ground storage tanks (AST) differ from underground (UST) storage tanks in the kinds of regulations that are applied.|$|E
50|$|A {{fixed roof}} tank {{is a type}} of storage tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many fixed roof tanks, allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. Fixed roof tanks without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a fixed roof tank can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, <b>float</b> gauges, and <b>roof</b> manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Herbert Stewart-Narine, who {{had also}} {{designed}} other Bundaberg buildings, including the fire station, the building was opened in 1957. Stuart-Nairne incorporated {{a number of very}} distinctive elements associated with 1950s architecture. Like many similar designs, both non-domestic and domestic, the building was designed with a flat roof, a distinct 1950s departure from the domination of buildings by roof forms. Brisbane architects, Hayes and Scott produced many houses that experimented with the composition of windows, fine detailing of glass up to roof line and exaggerated projection of roof line, to heighten the illusion of the flat <b>roof</b> <b>floating.</b> By 1948, the initial problems of gaining the confidence of builders had been solved, consequently, this paved the way for interesting variations of ceiling forms during the 1950s. Stuart-Nairne's use of floor to ceiling glass {{in the design of the}} former 4BU radio station is architecturally typical of this era.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Gibson Costello, Brisbane City Council City Architect between 1941 and 1952, was {{responsible}} for the design of the surface air raid shelters, and his variants of the standard pillbox were designed to provide a post-war utility for {{at least part of the}} Council's shelter building programme. In an address delivered to the Constitutional Club in Brisbane on February 1942, Costello noted that [...] "if the emergency for their use does not arise ...(unused shelters)... remain in brick and concrete, in many cases having no further value and being a possible source of nuisance. He added that I can assure you that wherever it is possible, without sacrificing the primary requirements of shelter from air attack, I have endeavoured in our Council buildings to so plan the shelters that they will fit into schemes of improvement which we hope will proceed immediately after the war". Costello's work was characterised by the use of an architectural language inspired by the modern movement in architecture. This movement pursued the rational use of modern materials and principles of functionalist planning and established a visual aesthetic largely inspired by the machine. It was part of an architecture employing the language of vertical and horizontal volumes and planes, <b>floating</b> flat <b>roofs,</b> masses set against voids and monumentality.
