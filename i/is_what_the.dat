5|$|Because {{of limited}} data {{concerning}} gong music prior to European exploration, theories abound {{as to when}} the prototypes {{of what is now}} the kulintang came to be. One theory suggest that the bronze gong had an ancient history in Southeast Asia, arriving in the Malay archipelago two or even three thousand years ago, making its way to the Philippines from China in the 3rd century AD. Another theory lays doubt to the former claim, suggesting the kulintang could not have existed prior to the 15th century due to the belief that Javanese gong tradition, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> kulintang was believed to be derived from, developed only by the 15th century.|$|E

After he investigates extraterrestrial cases at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, Mulder is given a new partner, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), and meets a secretive informant, X (Steven Williams). Mulder is recruited to assist in a hostage negotiation when Duane Barry, an alien abductee, captures four people. Barry eventually kidnaps Scully, believing that if he brings her to his original abduction site, Skyland Mountain, aliens will take her instead of him. Mulder follows but is delayed by Krycek, who is revealed to be a mole working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). When Mulder reaches Skyland Mountain, Scully is gone. Barry, who insists that aliens took him, dies soon after an interrogation by Krycek.

5|$|General Motors is {{sponsoring}} the Pecan Street demonstration project in Austin, Texas.

The Mueller neighborhood is the test ground, and , the community has nearly 60 Chevrolet Volt owners alone. This cluster of Volts was achieved thanks to GM's commitment to match the federal government's $7,500 rebate incentive, which effectively halves the purchase price of the plug-hybrid electric cars.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{the album}} debuted at number 1 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 84,000 album-equivalent {{units in the}} week ending March 24, {{according}} to Nielsen Music. In addition, This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like was also the best-selling album of the week, ranking number 1 on Billboards Top Album Sales chart, with pure album sales of 76,000 copies (90% of overall units). It became Stefani's first number 1 and third top five album as a solo artist. The only time she previously reached the top was with her band No Doubt with their third record Tragic Kingdom (1995). With this feat, she became the fifth woman to first reach number 1 {{as part of a}} band or group, and then later earn their own solo leader. However, it also marked the lowest first week sales for one of her albums, with Love. Angel. Music. Baby. and The Sweet Escape selling 309,000 copies and 243,000 copies in their first weeks, respectively. With the release Stefani peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Artist 100 chart, up approximately 557% from her previous peak of 53, the chart's fourth-highest jump ever. The following week, Billboard reported that the album dropped 16 places on the Billboard 200, with sales decreasing 78% to 17,700 copies. For the next five weeks, the album continued to drop down the charts. In its seventh week, it jumped from number 82 to number 59, the same week she appeared on The Late Late Show with James Corden. The record was on the chart for 13 weeks; its final position for the week ending August 6, 2016, was number 114. On May 27, 2016, This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like was made available on vinyl exclusively at Barnes & Noble in the United States; after its release, it debuted and peaked at number 23 on the Vinyl Albums component chart.|$|E
5|$|Later {{authors have}} used the term in a {{different}} sense, to mean the delimitation of species (not subspecies or taxa of other ranks), using whatever investigative techniques are available, and including sophisticated computational or laboratory techniques.

5|$|MasterCard Priceless Surprises Presents Gwen Stefani is {{a promotional}} concert tour by American singer and {{songwriter}} Gwen Stefani. This became Stefani's first tour since 2007's The Sweet Escape Tour; however, tickets {{available for the}} tour were only accessible by MasterCard holders. Stefani's recent partnership with MasterCard allowed her to create a concert experience for her fans in a more intimate setting, as she did not perform in large concert venues. The shows contained material from Stefani's first two studio albums, as well as songs that would later appear on her third release, This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like (2016).|$|E

5|$|On June24,2011, it was {{reported}} that Brulé had been traded along with a fourth-round draft pick to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for forward Ryan Smyth. Due to health concerns, the deal never materialized as Brulé had not yet been cleared to play following his concussion (under league rules, an injured player can be traded but cannot be bought out, which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Kings had planned on doing). Furthermore, Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi made it apparent to the media that the team wanted someone with a smaller salary cap hit if Brulé could not be bought out. The Oilers ultimately acquired Smyth in exchange for forward Colin Fraser (whose cap hit was over $1 million less) and a seventh-round pick in the 2012 draft.|$|E
5|$|On the Canadian Albums Chart {{compiled}} by Billboard, the record debuted and peaked at number 3, becoming her third consecutive album to do so. The album sold 4,400 copies {{in its first}} week, and was held back from the top spot by compilation album La Voix IV, and Justin Bieber's Purpose. In the week ending April 16, 2016, the album dropped to number 18, before dropping off the charts altogether seven weeks later. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 14, becoming the week's fifth highest debut. The debut, and Stefani's two earlier albums coincidentally made their first appearance on the UK chart at number 14. It was the week's fifth highest debut, and second highest debut outside the top 10. The following week, This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like dipped 54 positions, the week's largest drop. In Australia, the album debuted at number 6, becoming her third consecutive top-ten solo album. This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like was the week's second highest debut, and was present for two weeks before departing the chart. On France's SNEP album chart, it premiered at number 44, becoming her lowest debut behind The Sweet Escapes peak at number 33.|$|E
5|$|The album fared {{moderately}} well on Switzerland's Hitparade, {{where it}} became her second highest performing album, peaking at number 10. Similarly in Spain, the album peaked at No. 42, lasting {{a total of}} two weeks on the chart. Stefani's 2006 release, The Sweet Escape, did not chart. On Belgium's Ultratop Wallonia chart, it became her highest peaking album, where it debuted at number 21 and charted for four consecutive weeks. On Belgium's Flanders chart, it peaked at number 32 and lasted six consecutive weeks. In Scotland and Ireland, the album debuted at numbers 13 and 17 respectively. Elsewhere, This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like peaked in the lower regions of the charts. In Italy, the album peaked at number 56 before dropping off the chart the next week. In Japan and South Korea, it peaked at numbers 74 and 75, respectively, despite Stefani's promotional efforts in the former country.|$|E

5|$|The {{roads that}} have carried US12 in Michigan {{have been given}} a number of {{memorial}} highway names. In 1922, after the publication of Main Street by Sinclair Lewis that street name took on a pejorative connotation. The newspaper in Jackson advocated that the main road from Detroit to Chicago which formed the main street through many communities in southern Michigan should be given a new name. It was already labeled the Michigan–Detroit–Chicago Highway on travel maps of the time, so the paper suggested that the roadway should be renamed to create the longest street in the country. Both Chicago and Detroit had streets named Michigan Avenue, so that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> newspaper suggested for a new name.

5|$|This <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>the</b> Truth Feels Like is {{the third}} studio album {{recorded}} by American singer and songwriter Gwen Stefani.

However, after the underperformance of her 2014 singles and the writer's block Stefani suffered, she did not feel comfortable curating an album and scrapped the whole record in favor of starting again. The album's release was scheduled after Stefani hinted at it on her Twitter account.|$|E
