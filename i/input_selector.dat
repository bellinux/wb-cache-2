Any Boolean function of n variables and one result can be implemented with a multiplexer with n <b>selector</b> <b>inputs.</b> The variables are connected to the <b>selector</b> <b>inputs,</b> and the function result, 0 or 1, for each possible combination of <b>selector</b> <b>inputs</b> is connected to the corresponding data input. This is especially useful in situations when cost is a factor, for modularity, and for ease of modification. If one of the variables (for example, D) is also available inverted, a multiplexer with n-1 <b>selector</b> <b>inputs</b> is sufficient; the data inputs are connected to 0, 1, D, or ~D, according to the desired output for each combination of the <b>selector</b> <b>inputs.</b>|$|R

These networks selectively realise a linear mapping of their input. Using this property, the dynamics {{as well as}} the number and the stability of stationary states can be investigated. The important property of the boundedness of neural activities can be guaranteed by global inhibition.

50|$|Power {{supplies}} {{designed for}} worldwide use were {{equipped with an}} <b>input</b> voltage <b>selector</b> switch that allowed the user to configure the unit for use on local power grid. In the lower voltage range, around 115 V, this switch is turned on changing the power grid voltage rectifier into a voltage doubler in delon circuit design. As a result, the large primary filter capacitor behind that rectifier was split up into two capacitors wired in series, balanced with bleeder resistors and varistors that were necessary in the upper input voltage range, around 230 V. Connecting the unit configured for the lower range to a higher-voltage grid usually resulted in an immediate permanent damage. When the power factor correction (PFC) was required, those filter capacitors were replaced with higher-capacity ones, together with a coil installed in series to delay the inrush current. This is the simple design of a passive PFC.|$|R
40|$|Master-Slave {{configuration}} is {{a suitable}} alternative to droop control method used in microgrids. In this configuration, only one inverter is the master, {{while the others}} are slaves. The slave inverters are always current controlled whereas the master inverter should have two selectable operation modes: current controlled, when the microgrid {{is connected to the}} grid; and voltage controlled, when it is operating in island mode. In gridconnected mode, the master needs a synchronization system to perform the accurate control of its delivered power, and, in island mode, it needs a voltage reference oscillator that serves as a reference to the slave inverters. Based on the master-slave concept, this paper proposes a single system that perform both functions, i. e., it can act as a synchronization system or as a voltage reference oscillator depending on an <b>input</b> <b>selector.</b> Moreover, the system ensures a smoothly transition between the two operation modes, guaranteeing the safety operation of the microgrid.

40|$|Graduation date: 1965 This paper {{discussed}} the human electrocardiogram, the instrumentation used to graphically record it, {{and the design}} and performance of a specialized system for vector cardiography: the Vector Electrocardioscope (VECS) System. The introduction reviews in considerable detail the pertinent known physiology of the heart, especially the electrophysiology responsible for {{the genesis of the}} electrocardiogram. The development of electrocardiography in both its concepts and apparatus is traced from the early 19 th century to the present day. Vector cardiography is defined with a discussion of its concepts, theoretical bases, and present day instrumentation. The general design considerations of gain, noise and bandwidth as applied to electrocardiography are considered, as well as, display conventions and electrical hazards. Customer specifications and the wishes of the system designer are shown to interact to influence the particulars of system design. In discussing the VECS System it is first "blocked out" to meet specifications, and then the specific requirements of each functional operation described. The modifications required to adapt commercial instruments to their system task are detailed. The design of two instruments peculiar to the VECS System are reported. The VECS Control Panel is the operational heart of the VECS System and provides signal conditioning (system gain and positioning) and display (system mode, blanking, z-axis intensification, time markers, calibrator) functions.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to learn driving {{behaviour}} by associating the actions recorded from a human driver with pre-attentive visual input, implemented using holistic image features (GIST). All images are labelled according to a number of driving–relevant contextual classes (eg, road type, junction) and the driver’s actions (eg, braking, accelerating, steering) are recorded. The association between visual context and the driving data is learnt by Boosting decision stumps, that serve as <b>input</b> dimension <b>selectors.</b> Moreover, we propose a novel formulation of GIST features that lead to an improved performance for action prediction. The areas of the visual scenes that contribute to activation or inhibition of the predictors is shown by drawing activation maps for all learnt actions. We show good performance not only for detecting driving–relevant contextual labels, but also for predicting the driver’s actions. The classifier’s false positives and the associated activation maps can be used to focus attention and further learning on the uncommon and difficult situations. ...|$|R
50|$|If the SMPS has an AC input, {{then the}} first stage is to convert the input to DC. This is called rectification. A SMPS with a DC input does not require this stage. In some power {{supplies}} (mostly computer ATX power supplies), the rectifier circuit can be configured as a voltage doubler {{by the addition of}} a switch operated either manually or automatically. This feature permits operation from power sources that are normally at 115 V or at 230 V. The rectifier produces an unregulated DC voltage which is then sent to a large filter capacitor. The current drawn from the mains supply by this rectifier circuit occurs in short pulses around the AC voltage peaks. These pulses have significant high frequency energy which reduces the power factor. To correct for this, many newer SMPS will use a special PFC circuit to make the input current follow the sinusoidal shape of the AC input voltage, correcting the power factor. Power supplies that use active PFC usually are auto-ranging, supporting input voltages from ~100 VAC - 250 VAC, with no <b>input</b> voltage <b>selector</b> switch.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} on-sensor neuromorphic vision {{hardware}} implementation of denoising spatial filter. The mean or median spatial filters with fixed window shape {{are known for}} its denoising ability, however, have the drawback of blurring the object edges. The effect of blurring increases {{with an increase in}} window size. To preserve the edge information, we propose an adaptive spatial filter that uses neuron's ability to detect similar pixels and calculates the mean. The analog input differences of neighborhood pixels are converted to the chain of pulses with voltage controlled oscillator and applied as neuron input. When the input pulses charge the neuron to equal or greater level than its threshold, the neuron will fire, and pixels are identified as similar. The sequence of the neuron's responses for pixels is stored in the serial-in-parallel-out shift register. The outputs of shift registers are used as <b>input</b> to the <b>selector</b> switches of an averaging circuit making this an adaptive mean operation resulting in an edge preserving mean filter. System level simulation of the hardware is conducted using 150 images from Caltech database with added Gaussian noise to test the robustness of edge-preserving and denoising ability of the proposed filter. Threshold values of the hardware neuron were adjusted so that the proposed edge-preserving spatial filter achieves optimal performance in terms of PSNR and MSE, and these results outperforms that of the conventional mean and median filters.

This form of temporal learning underlies the ability of the networks to learn temporal sequences of behaviour. We show that the continuous attractor network models developed here are able to demonstrate the key features of motor function. That is, (i) the movement can occur at arbitrary speeds; (ii) the movement can occur with arbitrary force; (iii) the agent spends the same relative proportions of its time in each part of the motor sequence; (iv) the agent applies the same relative force in each part of the motor sequence; and (v) the actions always occur in the same sequence...|$|R
