50|$|An {{epicyclic}} gear train can be assembled so the planet gear rolls {{on the inside}} of the pitch circle of a fixed, outer <b>gear</b> <b>ring,</b> or ring gear, sometimes called an annular gear.

50|$|All SA gear hubs use {{epicyclic}} (planetary) geartrains {{of varying}} complexity. The AW is the simplest, using {{one set of}} planetary gears with four planets. The AM uses three compound planets with differently sized cogs on a common shaft to engage the <b>gear</b> <b>ring</b> and sun gear separately, while the close-ratio three-speeds, and hubs with four or more speeds, use multiple planetary geartrains. Depending on the specific hub these may be in series with each other, or with {{one or the other}} set being selectable at any given time by locking a particular sun gear to the axle.|$|E
50|$|The {{flywheel}} is a disk or wheel {{attached to}} the crank, forming an inertial mass that stores rotational energy. In engines with only a single cylinder the flywheel is essential to carry energy over from the power stroke into a subsequent compression stroke. Flywheels are present in most reciprocating engines to smooth out the power delivery over each rotation of the crank and in most automotive engines also mount a <b>gear</b> <b>ring</b> for a starter. The rotational inertia of the flywheel also allows a much slower minimum unloaded speed and also improves the smoothness at idle. The flywheel may also perform {{a part of the}} balancing of the system and so by itself be out of balance, although most engines will use a neutral balance for the flywheel, enabling it to be balanced in a separate operation. The flywheel is also used as a mounting for the clutch or a torque converter in most automotive applications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Voith Ltd, Bangalore {{is facing}} {{distortion}} of gears during the heat treatment. Because of this, gears are unusually given an extra machining allowance which {{is leading to}} increased production cost. In this work using the reactive improvement methodology, efforts are made to understand the problem of gear distortion and find the remedial measures. The study reveals that the many parameters affect the distortion but the most predominant is the heavy weight of the gear. In the process of analyzing the effect of gear weight on distortion problem it was identified that three parameters; (i) use of improved fixture to hold the gear during heat treatment, (ii) better cooling mechanism, and (iii) reduction of gear weight by making gear design modification can reduce the distortion. All these parameters are analyzed and discussed. The study reveals that the reduction of gear weight with suitable gear design modification will be more effective. The gear design modification is studied further by identifying different parameters to reduce weight. It was found that by adopting stepped shaft {{to take away the}} substantial weight of the gear and providing <b>gear</b> <b>ring</b> on the stepped shaft will be most effective for reducing the distortion. Modified setup was further studied using FE analysis for verification of distortion during the heat treatment process. The study reveals that the distortions due to heat treatment process are within the acceptable limits.
