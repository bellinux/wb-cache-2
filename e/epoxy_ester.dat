Although yields are moderate, enantioselectivity is extremely high.(3)3-Alkyl glutarates with small alkyl substituents are hydrolyzed to the (R)-monoester; however, when a large alkyl substituent is present, the (S)-monoester forms. This switch in enantioselectivity is accurately predicted by the active site model given above.(4)An opposite trend is observed in desymmetrizing hydrolyses of 2-methyl malonates, which afford the (S) enantiomer when the other substituent on C-2 is small, and the (R) enantiomer when the other C-2 substituent is large.(5)A number of meso diesters other than the substrates described above may be hydrolyzed by PLE with high enantioselectivity. Cyclic meso diesters tend to be hydrolyzed more selectively than acyclic diesters. The predominant enantiomer of product depends on ring size.(6)7-Oxabicyclo2.2.1heptane-2,3-dicarboxylates are an interesting class of diesters that are hydrolyzed by PLE with high enantioselectivity. These substrates {{have been used for}} the enantioselective construction of biologically relevant sugars (see Synthetic Applications below).(7)Racemic mixtures of all of the substrates described above, as well as additional chiral diesters (such as the <b>epoxy</b> <b>ester</b> in equation (8)), may be resolved using PLE for kinetic resolution. A significant disadvantage of kinetic resolution is a maximum yield of hydrolyzed product of 50%. However, if rapid racemization is occurring alongside hydrolysis (an example of dynamic kinetic resolution), a maximum yield of 100% is possible.(8)Esterase enzymes may also be used for hydrolysis of base-sensitive monoesters.

40|$|AbstractThe {{demand for}} a {{sustainable}} and non-toxic alternative insulating fluid {{has been on the}} increase because of the negative environmental impact of mineral-based insulating fluids. Natural ester appeared to be a viable alternative, but it has poor thermo-oxidative properties and higher melting temperature. This report presents the influence of chemical modification on the properties of natural ester-based alternative insulating fluid. Alkyl ester derivatives were synthesized from laboratory purified palm kernel oil. A straight chain alkyl ester was first synthesized to enhance the flow properties of the oil. It was then followed by a process that converts the double bond to an <b>epoxy</b> group. Side-branched <b>ester</b> samples were synthesized from the laboratory synthesized <b>epoxy</b> alkyl <b>ester</b> of palm kernel oil. The chemical modification was performed through esterification reaction involving the <b>epoxy</b> alkyl <b>ester</b> of palm kernel oil and acid anhydrides under nitrogen and in the presence of boron trifluoride etherate as catalyst. The reactions were monitored and the products confirmed using FTIR and GC–MS. The melting point and thermo-oxidative stability of the fluids were examined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The melting point of the ester derivatives was found to reduce with side chain attachment and antioxidant significantly improved the thermal stability. The dielectric behavior and electrical breakdown properties of the ester derivatives were analyzed and compared. The dielectric loss was dominated by mobile charged particles and the charged particles appeared to exhibit faster dynamics compared with purified palm kernel oil. This may be attributed to the mobility of the charges which is related to the viscosity of the esters. The esters possessed excellent breakdown strengths suggest that the processing to optimize the physical properties did not have a negative influence on the electrical breakdown strength. This product may prove useful as an insulation fluid in Electrical Power Transformers...|$|R
