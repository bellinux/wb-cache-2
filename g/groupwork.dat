Through semi-structured interviews the participants’ perceptions of their symptoms, beliefs and attitudes towards their <b>groupwork</b> within rehabilitative palliative care were explored.

40|$|Abstract This paper reviews {{some of the}} {{literature}} on the use of <b>groupwork</b> as a form of assessment in tertiary institutions. It outlines the considerable advantages of <b>groupwork</b> but also its systemic associated problems. In discussing the problems, the paper considers issues such as ‘‘free riding’ ’ and the ‘‘sucker effect’’, issues associated with ethnic mix in groups, and the social dilemma problem—in which students face conflicting demands between altruism and self-interest. The paper then outlines several models of effective <b>groupwork</b> and makes suggestions for implementing <b>groupwork</b> tasks. The paper also looks at the key assessment tasks which are commonly employed—namely, additive, conjunctive, disjunctive and discretionary tasks—and assesses which are most suited to <b>groupwork.</b> The paper considers the related issues of task complexity, recognition for effort, and strategies for minimising issues concerning group size. The paper also briefly considers strategies for implementing incentives for <b>groupwork</b> members, and outlines the issue of penalties for unproductive group members. The paper concludes by providing recommendations for how to maximise the advantages of <b>groupwork</b> while trying to minimise the disadvantages...|$|E

40|$|Despite {{increasing}} number of mainland Chinese students studying in western tertiary settings, there is limited information available on their learning experiences and responses to popular educational practices in these contexts. There is an assumption in the literature that Chinese students respond well to the collaborative demands of <b>groupwork</b> due to the collectivist nature of their culture, however there are few reports to substantiate this claim. This paper reports on mainland Chinese students’ perception of <b>groupwork</b> in two Australian tertiary settings. Thirteen students from mainland China were interviewed on their <b>groupwork</b> experiences. All interviews were completed in either Mandarin or Cantonese. Two types of <b>groupwork</b> were identified: assignment <b>groupwork</b> (AGW) and student generated <b>groupwork</b> (SGGW). Three criteria for collaboration: level of interaction, construction of knowledge and a shared goal were used to search for signs of collaborative elements in the Chinese students’ recall of their <b>groupwork</b> experience. Indicators of collaboration were identified in the reports of AGWs but were less consistent in SGGWs. The {{findings of this study}} suggest that Chinese students perceive out-of-class <b>groupwork</b> in an Australian context as a positive learning experience, reporting enhanced understanding of academic contents, application of knowledge and socializing with other Chinese students. Background of This Study Globalisation has brought a rapidly growing number of students from China to study overseas. Australian Education International (AEI) (2007) annual statistics indicate that in the last seven years, the number of Chinese international students enrolled in higher education in Australia has increased significantly each year.

40|$|<b>Groupwork</b> is {{consistently}} a requirement in tertiary course assessment for many reasons, particularly in those professions that demand <b>groupwork</b> skills as criteria for professional accreditation. Yet <b>groupwork</b> is often extremely unpopular with {{both students and}} teachers. Principal reasons for disliking and avoiding <b>groupwork</b> include the high rates of social loafing that are reported and embittered student complaints of “unfair!” in consequent marking. This paper contributes {{to the number of}} publications and courses that offer means to counter some negative aspects of <b>groupwork</b> and enable a better and more effective learning experience and assessment method in <b>groupwork.</b> This is not a researched paper. It is shared praxis – it offers reason and directions (based on experience) for using one simple exercise, Group Sorter, which has proven effective in circumventing many <b>groupwork</b> problems associated with group-based assessment. The exercise is based on adult education principles of learner engagement and sociological group theories. It directs student interaction and discussion in such a manner as to allow rational self-sorting into groups intentionally chosen to minimise problematic groupings and maximise shared goals. These self-sorting groups develop tacit selection criteria of shared motivation, commitment to workload investment and balance of personal group-work strengths and weaknesses. Experience shows that this process results in groups that have fewer-than-usual problems and better-than-usual output. Future trials of the method should produce substantiated results that support the anecdotal evidence presented here. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Face-to-face <b>groupwork</b> {{sessions}} {{combined with}} online participatory social media {{could be a}} quite promising pedagogical strategy. In this paper, we present the pedagogical design and the rationale for <b>groupwork</b> in a blended educational landscape. In traditional teaching, the emphasis is given on the dissemination of information, on rich content delivery by a sage on the stage. In the proposed model, the educator acts as a facilitator, as the active guide {{on the side of}} the group, delegating authority and responsibility to the participating students. Human societies are confronted today with complex problems that cannot be addressed by isolated individuals’ actions. Where concerted group action is required in order to tackle with quite complex problems, <b>groupwork</b> in blended educational settings could be a quite promising pedagogical model. In well-organized <b>groupwork,</b> self-organization dynamics are in play and complex properties emerge as the byproduct of members’ synergies and group’s transaction in the here and now of the group.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine {{variables}} explaining students&# 039; positive and negative experiences of <b>groupwork</b> and connect country of residence with the perception of generic skills development and self-reported satisfaction with <b>groupwork.</b> It also aims to examine the effect of prior training in groups from the perspective of Australian and Non-Australian permanent residency Business students. Design/methodology/approach - Respondents were 389 undergraduate and postgraduate Business students at an Australian metropolitan university. A path model was developed and analysed using partial least squares modeling. Findings - Students&# 039; country of residence had a significant influence on reporting of generic skill development and experience of <b>groupwork.</b> Self-reported improvement in generic skills after <b>groupwork</b> assessment was associated with reporting of fewer negative and more positive aspects of working in groups. Research limitations/implications - The findings were limited by using data collected from students enrolled in one undergraduate and one postgraduate subject at the conclusion of a group assignment from one university. Future research should test the model by extending it to other universities and non-Business units. Future research should rely on a longitudinal design, where the survey is carried out at the beginning and the end of the group assessment. Practical implications - It is important to ensure both domestic and international students acquire generic skills through <b>groupwork</b> and that prior training in <b>groupwork</b> takes place before group assessments. Originality/value - The study provides empirical evidence supporting the incorporation of generic skill teaching into academic practice prior to assigning <b>groupwork</b> to students...|$|E

40|$|The use of book {{groups as}} a {{learning}} medium in social work education has evolved rapidly {{over the last few}} years, with universities and practice settings across the UK and beyond adopting the approach to supplement traditional teaching methods (Taylor, 2014).
