5|$|The parkway was {{proposed}} to help bridge {{a gap in}} the eastern part of the Long Island Parkway system. Construction began in 1949 with the opening of an interchange between Bay Shore Road and the Southern State Parkway. Work on the parkway itself began the following year, with plans calling for connections to three spurs: the Captree State Parkway (now Robert Moses Causeway), the Sunken Meadow Spur (Sunken Meadow State Parkway), and the Heckscher Spur (Heckscher State Parkway). The parkway was completed in 1952, closing the highway loop on Long Island. In 2001, a study by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) called for the Sagtikos State Parkway to be widened to include new bus and carpool lanes <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{the value}} of the towpath as a leisure amenity began to be recognised. The Deputy County Clerk for Hampshire walked along the towpath <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> in 1966, {{together}} with members of the Ramblers Association. He decided that rather than challenge the legality of the towpath diversions, he would invite the local authorities through which the navigation ran to assume responsibility for maintaining the towpath. These organisations were Southampton County Borough Council, Eastleigh Borough Council, Winchester Rural District Council and Winchester City Council. The construction of weirs at most of the locks by the Southern Water Authority resulted in water levels being restored on significant parts of the navigation. The powers of the navigation were enshrined in Acts of Parliament obtained in 1665, 1767, 1795, 1802, 1811 and 1820, none of which have been repealed.|$|E
5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. Previous to the NSW conversion to alphanumeric routes in 2013, the highway was signed as National Route 18 shield along its entire length. In addition to this, {{the section of the}} Monaro Highway between Cooma and Steeple Flat was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length within NSW; this kind of arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the highway <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> The Snowy Mountains Highway was allocated the alphanumeric route B72 as part of New South Wales' 2013 conversion. The route duplex along the Monaro Highway remains intact with B72 used in addition to B23 between Cooma and Steeple Flat.|$|E

5|$|Route markers {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Australia in late 1954. Over the following decades they were progressively rolled {{out to the}} various highways around the nation, under a nationwide route numbering scheme. The highway originally carried the National Route 23 route marker. Although after {{the construction of the}} Eastern Parkway extension, the highway north of Canberra Avenue was signed with the Alternate National Route 23 route marker. The section of the Monaro Highway between Steeple Flat and Cooma was also signed the National Route 18 shield in addition to the National Route 23 route marker used along the remainder of its length; this arrangement is known as a duplex or concurrency. This allowed one route to cover the Snowy Mountains Highway <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end,</b> as the Monaro Highway forms a link between that highway's two sections.|$|E

The Netherlands, a long term bogey team of the Brits, skated to a 4–2 win over GB. GB's final game against Italy proved too much for them and they were defeated as they had been the previous year to an experienced Italian side, this time 4–2.|$|E

25|$|Waters {{exiting the}} {{flocculation}} basin may enter the sedimentation basin, also called a clarifier or settling basin. It {{is a large}} tank with low water velocities, allowing floc to settle to the bottom. The sedimentation basin is best located close to the flocculation basin so the transit between the two processes does not permit settlement or floc break up. Sedimentation basins may be rectangular, where water flows <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end,</b> or circular where flow is from the centre outward. Sedimentation basin outflow is typically over a weir so only a thin top layer of water—that furthest from the sludge—exits.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half Australia {{tightened}} their discipline, and solid play forced mistakes from England. The game swung <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end,</b> with both sides having try-scoring opportunities, but neither able to take them. Australia managed to get points {{on the board and}} Elton Flatley scored two penalties to make the score 14–11 to England. In the 79th minute, Australia were putting pressure on England in their half, and Australia were awarded a penalty right before full-time, with the potential to tie the scores. Flatley converted it to make the score 14–14 and take the game into an additional 20 minutes' extra time.|$|E
25|$|The {{park has}} three {{entrance}}s, one each to the north, south, and west, the north entrance being the main one. The three entrances are near European route E4, {{which is the}} main road in northern Sweden, and which traverses the country <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end.</b> Near these entrances one can find parking and information panels about the park. It is possible {{to spend the night}} in the park in one of five shelters (Norrsvedjebodarna, Tärnettvattnen, Tärnettholmarna, Tärnettsundet, and Näskebodarna). These were private homes before the foundation of the park. It is also possible to go camping in the dedicated campgrounds.|$|E

Waiting times were approximately five to seven minutes per bus during peak hours and ten minutes per bus during mid-afternoons. In the evening and at night, the waiting time was around fifteen minutes per bus, {{and in the early}} morning the waiting time was around 20 to 30 minutes. Total travel time <b>from</b> <b>end</b> <b>to</b> <b>end</b> on the route was approximately 42 minutes, but could increase to one hour during peak hours due to traffic.|$|E

40|$|This is {{an attempt}} to give a {{strictly}} formal and semantically motivated definition of the syntactic concepts of government, agreement, and adjunction. Government and adjunction are related to the strength of the syntactic connection, which, in its turn, is determined by the comparison of the syntactic representation – the tree – with the semantic one – the graph. If the semantic valency confirms the syntactic dependency the connection is regarded as strong. Government is always a strong connection, whereas adjunction is weak. Both are, however, in conformity with the syntactic tree. Agreement relations may or may not conform to the tree structure and in the former case they can be either strong or weak. A distinction is also made between word and its ending; a syntactic dependency arrow can be directed to or from either of these. Government is primarily a relation <b>from</b> word <b>to</b> <b>ending,</b> secondarily <b>from</b> word <b>to</b> word. Adjunction is directed exclusively from word to word. One type of agreement, the flectional one, is directed <b>from</b> <b>ending</b> <b>to</b> <b>ending,</b> the other type, the semi-flectional, <b>from</b> word <b>to</b> <b>ending.</b> Semiflectional gender agreement is further divided into lexical and referential agreement. As a result of syntactic transformations certain transitions between these connection types can be observed...|$|R
