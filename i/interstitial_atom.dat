50|$|Cottrell atmospheres {{occur in}} body-centered cubic (BCC) and face-centered cubic (FCC) {{materials}} , such as iron or nickel, with small impurity atoms, such as carbon or nitrogen. As these interstitial atoms distort the lattice slightly, {{there will be}} an associated residual stress field surrounding the interstitial. This stress field can be relaxed by the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> diffusing towards a dislocation, which contains a small gap at its core (as it is a more open structure), see Figure 1. Once the atom has diffused into the dislocation core the atom will stay. Typically only one <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> is required per lattice plane of the dislocation.|$|E
50|$|The way {{to inhibit}} the {{movement}} of planes of atoms, and thus make them harder, involves the interaction of dislocations {{with each other and}} <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms.</b> When a dislocation intersects with a second dislocation, it can no longer traverse through the crystal lattice. The intersection of dislocations creates an anchor point and does not allow the planes of atoms to continue to slip over one another A dislocation can also be anchored by the interaction with <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms.</b> If a dislocation comes in contact with two or more <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms,</b> the slip of the planes will again be disrupted. The <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> create anchor points, or pinning points, {{in the same manner as}} intersecting dislocations.|$|R
40|$|The {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the atmospheric changes of silicon intrinsic point defects, testifies that concentration of silicon <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> and concentration of vacancies in silicon defects atmosphere are bi-state, transitions between which can be determined quasichemical reactions of Schlegel. Bi-state enables to control the existence of silicon <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> in certain conditions (for instance, creation of divacancy (traps and) in the course of bombardement). Thereby, the author develops the hypothesis of nanomaterials high properties in terms of synergetic approach, explaining nanomaterials high properties on the basis of silicon in terms of synergetic approaches (for instance, layers of flexible silicon of nanometric size). In this case the surface of flexible silicon is the trap for silicon <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> and vacancies. In terms of nanomaterials, interfaces, pinholes, interstices, vacancies, etc. of nanometric size can serve as traps for <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms.</b> The amount of such nanoobjects in nanomaterials is very high. That’s why mainly (- critical value, wherein,) is used. It may prevent nanomaterials from dislocation of generation, disordered regions and pinholes, originated from <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> and vacancies, formed in the process of nanomaterials work (especially under extreme conditions), {{which is one of the}} reasons of it high properties if compared to the properties of common materials...|$|R

50|$|In 2003, it was {{postulated}} that Wigner energy {{can be stored}} by the formation of metastable defect structures in graphite. Notably, the large energy release observed at 200-250 °C has been {{described in terms of}} a metastable interstitial-vacancy pair. The <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> becomes trapped on the lip of the vacancy, and there is a barrier for it to recombine to give perfect graphite.|$|E
50|$|Small {{impurity}} interstitial atoms {{are usually}} on true off-lattice sites between the lattice atoms. Such sites {{can be characterized}} by the symmetry of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> position with respect to itsnearest lattice atoms. For instance, an impurity atom I with 4 nearest lattice atom A neighbours (at equal distances) in an fcc lattice is in a tetrahedral symmetry position, and thus can be called a tetrahedral interstitial.|$|E
5000|$|A well-studied {{class of}} {{solid-state}} compounds {{related to the}} chalcohalides are molybdenum clusters of the type AxMo6X8 with X sulfur or selenium and Ax an <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> such as Pb. These materials, called Chevrel phases or Chevrel clusters, have been actively studied because they are type II superconductors with relatively high critical fields. [...] Such materials are prepared by high temperature (1100 °C) reactions of the chalcogen and Mo metal. Structurally related, soluble analogues have been prepared, e.g., Mo6S8(PEt3)6.|$|E
50|$|By {{varying the}} {{presence}} of <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> and the density of dislocations, a particular metal's hardness can be controlled. Although seemingly counter-intuitive, as the density of dislocations increases, there are more intersections created and consequently more anchor points. Similarly, as more <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> are added, more pinning points that impede the movements of dislocations are formed. As a result, the more anchor points added, the harder the material will become.|$|R

40|$|After {{electron}} irradiation of Cr at 20 K to 2. 1019 e-/cm 2 the intemal friction was measured between 20 K and 300 K (7. 2 Hz). Two IF peaks appear at 35 K and 50 K. Both anneal out below 77 K. The peaks are interpreted with the relaxation of self <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> (35 K) and clusters of self <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> (50 K). Unirradiated Cr exhibits discontinuities in modulus at 128 K (with IF peak) and 308 K (Neel temperature) ...|$|R
50|$|The atoms that do {{not find}} a vacancy come to rest in non-ideal locations; that is, not along the {{symmetrical}} lines of the lattice. These atoms {{are referred to as}} interstitial atoms, or simply interstitials. An <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> and its associated vacancy are known as a Frenkel defect. Because these atoms are not in the ideal location, they have an energy associated with them, much as a ball {{at the top of a}} hill has gravitational potential energy. This energy is referred to as Wigner energy. When a large number of interstitials have accumulated, they pose a risk of releasing all of their energy suddenly, creating a rapid, very great increase in temperature. Sudden, unplanned increases in temperature can present a large risk for certain types of nuclear reactors with low operating temperatures; one such was the indirect cause of the Windscale fire. Accumulation of energy in irradiated graphite has been recorded as high as 2.7 kJ/g, but is typically much lower than this. Graphite, having a heat capacity of 0.720 J/g°C, could see a sudden increase in temperature of about 3750 °C (6780 °F).|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} {{irradiation}} on materials {{is rooted in}} the initial event in which an energetic projectile strikes a target. While the event is made up of several steps or processes, the primary result is the displacement of an atom from its lattice site. Irradiation displaces an atom from its site, leaving a vacant site behind (a vacancy) and the displaced atom eventually comes to rest in a location that is between lattice sites, becoming an <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom.</b> The vacancy-interstitial pair is central to radiation effects in crystalline solids and is known as a Frenkel pair (FP). The presence of the Frenkel pair and other consequences of irradiation damage determine the physical effects, and with the application of stress, the mechanical effects of irradiation by the occurring of interstitial, phenomena, such as swelling, growth, phase transition, segregation, etc., will be effected. In addition to the atomic displacement, an energetic charged particle moving in a lattice also gives energy to electrons in the system, via the electronic stopping power. This energy transfer can also for high-energy particles produce damage in non-metallic materials, as so called ion tracks.|$|E

Predicted frequencies of the metal-bound CO, QM/MM-optimized geometries, and calculated redox potentials of the FeMo cofactor with different central ligands show that the oxygen atom is the candidate for the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom.</b> Calculations on the interactions of the FeMo cofactor with CO and N- 2 reveal that there is a remarkable dependence of the binding energy oil the binding site and the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom.</b> Generally, the Fe 2 site of the FeMo cofactor has stronger interactions with CO and N, than Fe 6, and both the Fe 2 and Fe 6 sites in the N-centered and O-centered clusters of the FeMo cofactor can effectively bind N- 2 while the coordination of N 2 to the Fe 6 site of the C-centered active Cluster is unfavorable energetically. Present results indicate that the protein environment is important for computational characterization of the Structure of the FeMo cofactor and properties of the metal-bound CO and N- 2 are sensitive to the <b>Interstitial</b> <b>atom.</b> National Science Foundation of China [20673097, 20733002, 20473062, 20423002]; Ministry of Science and Technology [2004 CB 719902...|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{discontinuous}} yielding behaviour is produced in the steel due to the presence of <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> and the yield point phenomenon in the steel {{is a function of the}} composition and heat treatment of the material. In the investigated steel, the carbide formers (Mo and Nb) and nitride formers (Al, Si and Nb) reduce the level of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> of carbon and nitrogen, which are strong lockers of dislocation. Consequently, the continuous yielding is promoted as shown in Fig.  3.|$|R

40|$|Molecular {{dynamics}} {{simulations of}} displacement cascades up to 40 keV {{have been performed}} using an EAM potential that mimics Fe-Cr alloys, by favouring interstitial configurations containing solute atoms. Both pure α-Fe and Fe- 10 at. %Cr alloys were studied. The interstitial population {{at the end of}} the cascade was analysed from the standpoint of clustered fraction and chemical nature of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms.</b> For pure α-Fe the results obtained are comparable with previous work. Two are the main effects of the presence of a high concentration of solute atoms strongly interacting with interstitials. First, a large number of solute <b>atoms</b> in <b>interstitial</b> position, mostly isolated, are found, in a proportion far above the average solute concentration in the alloy. Secondly, interstitial clusters containing a fraction of solute <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> always larger than the average solute concentration in the alloy are produced and this solute aggregation inside clusters may be a thermal spike effect. However, the total number of <b>interstitial</b> <b>atoms</b> produced in the cascade and even the in-cascade interstitial clustered fraction do not appear to be significantly influenced by the presence of solute atoms in high concentration, possibly because the masses of Fe and Cr are very similar. © 2004 Elsevier B.

For all calculations, the hybrid functional of Heyd, Scuseria, and Ernzerhof {{in the framework of}} density functional theory was used. Defects formation energies, charge state transition levels and minimum energy configurations of the AlGe, IAl and IAlAlGe were obtained for 2, 1, 0, þ 1 and þ 2 charge states. The calculated formation energy shows that for the neutral charge state, the IAl is energetically more favourable in the T than the H configuration. The IAlAlGe forms with formation energies of 2. 37 eV and 2. 32 eV, when the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> is at the T and H sites, respectively. The IAlAlGe is energetically more favourable when the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> is at the T site with a binding energy of 0. 8 eV. The IAl in the T configuration, induced a deep donor (þ 2 /þ 1) level at EV þ 0 : 23 eV and the AlGe induced a single acceptor level (0 / 1) at EV þ 0 : 14 eV in the band gap of Ge. The IAlAlGe induced double-donor levels are at EV þ 0 : 06 and EV þ 0 : 12 eV, when the <b>interstitial</b> <b>atom</b> is at the T and H sites, respectively.
