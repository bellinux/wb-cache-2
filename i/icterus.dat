5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves {{tend not to}} show any clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not appear}} to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, <b>icterus,</b> and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Leukopenia and liver-damage of the cholostatic type with {{or without}} {{jaundice}} (<b>icterus)</b> have additionally been seen; the original manufacturer Roche recommends regular laboratory examinations to be performed routinely.|$|E
25|$|Acute Type I Fasciolosis: {{infectious}} dose is {{more than}} 5000 ingested metacercariae. Sheep suddenly die without any previous clinical signs. Ascites, abdominal haemorrhage, <b>icterus,</b> pallor of membranes, weakness may be observed in sheep.|$|E
25|$|Jaundice, or <b>icterus</b> is yellow {{discoloration}} of {{the skin}} and mucous membranes, (with {{the white of the}} eye being especially noticeable) due to increased bilirubin (at least 2–3mg/dL or 30µmol/L). The urine may also appear dark.|$|E

60|$|In {{the diagram}} {{opposite}} twenty males of <b>Icterus</b> Baltimore are registered, {{so as to}} exhibit to the eye the proportionate number of specimens which vary, {{to a greater or}} less amount, in the length of the tail, wing, tarsus, middle toe, hind toe, and bill. It will be noticed that there is usually no very great accumulation of dots about the median line which shows the average dimensions, but that a considerable number are spread at varying distances on each side of it.|$|E
60|$|The gloomy woods are {{inhabited}} by few birds: occasionally the plaintive note of a white-tufted tyrant-flycatcher (Myiobius albiceps) may be heard, concealed near {{the summit of}} the most lofty trees; and more rarely the loud strange cry of a black woodpecker, with a fine scarlet crest on its head. A little, dusky-coloured wren (Scytalopus Magellanicus) hops in a skulking manner among the entangled mass of the fallen and decaying trunks. But the creeper (Oxyurus tupinieri) is the commonest bird in the country. Throughout the beech forests, high up and low down, in the most gloomy, wet, and impenetrable ravines, it may be met with. This little bird no doubt appears more numerous than it really is, from its habit of following with seeming curiosity any person who enters these silent woods: continually uttering a harsh twitter, it flutters from tree to tree, within a few feet of the intruder's face. It is far from wishing for the modest concealment of the true creeper (Certhia familiaris); nor does it, like that bird, run up the trunks of trees, but industriously, after the manner of a willow-wren, hops about, and searches for insects on every twig and branch. In the more open parts, three or four species of finches, a thrush, a starling (or <b>Icterus),</b> two Opetiorhynchi, and several hawks and owls occur.|$|E

5000|$|The Bahama Oriole (<b>Icterus</b> northropi) is {{a species}} of {{songbird}} in the New World blackbird family - Icteridae. It is endemic to the Bahamas. It is listed as critically endangered by IUCN (CR). The taxon was originally classified as its own distinct species in 1890 by Joel Asaph Allen before it was lumped with the Cuban Oriole (<b>Icterus</b> melanopsis), Hispaniolan Oriole (<b>Icterus</b> dominicensis), and Puerto Rican oriole (<b>Icterus</b> portoricensis) into a single species by the ornithologist James Bond in his book [...] "Birds of the West Indies".
