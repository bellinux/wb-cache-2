50|$|<b>Halofantrine</b> is a {{relatively}} new drug developed by the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in the 1960s. It is a phenanthrene methanol, chemically related to Quinine and acts acting as a blood schizonticide effective against all Plasmodium parasites. Its mechanism of action is similar to other anti-malarials. Cytotoxic complexes are formed with ferritoporphyrin XI that cause plasmodial membrane damage. Despite being effective against drug resistant parasites, <b>halofantrine</b> is not commonly used in the treatment (prophylactic or therapeutic) of malaria due to its high cost. It has very variable bioavailability and has been shown to have potentially high levels of cardiotoxicity. It is still a useful drug and can be used in patients that are known to be free of heart disease and are suffering from severe and resistant forms of acute malaria. A popular drug based on <b>halofantrine</b> is Halfan. The level of governmental control and the prescription-only basis on which it can be used contributes to the cost, thus <b>halofantrine</b> is not frequently used.|$|E
50|$|A dose of 8 mg/kg of <b>halofantrine</b> is {{advised to}} be given in three doses at six-hour {{intervals}} {{for the duration of}} the clinical episode.

The most frequently experienced side-effects include nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and itch. Severe ventricular dysrhythmias, occasionally causing death are seen when high doses are administered. This is due to prolongation of the QTc interval. <b>Halofantrine</b> is not recommended for use in pregnancy and lactation, in small children, or in patients that have taken mefloquine previously.

50|$|Mefloquine {{may cause}} {{abnormalities}} with heart rhythms that are visible on electrocardiograms.

50|$|The use of anti-malarials {{developed}} from similar basic chemical compounds {{can increase the}} rate of resistance development, for example cross-resistance to chloroquine and amiodiaquine, two 4-aminoquinolones and mefloquine conferring resistance to quinine and <b>halofantrine.</b> This phenomenon may reduce the usefulness of newly developed therapies prior to large-scale usage.|$|E
50|$|Consumption of {{grapefruit}} {{combined with}} certain medications can cause serious side effects, even death. <b>Halofantrine</b> combined with this fruit or grapefruit juice is dangerous.

50|$|The first type of {{resistance}} to be acknowledged was to chloroquine in Thailand in 1957. The biological mechanism behind this resistance was subsequently discovered {{to be related to}} the development of an efflux mechanism that expels chloroquine from the parasite before the level required to effectively inhibit the process of haem polymerization (that is necessary to prevent buildup of the toxic byproducts formed by haemoglobin digestion). This theory has been supported by evidence showing that resistance can be effectively reversed on the addition of substances which halt the efflux. The resistance of other quinolone anti-malarials such as amiodiaquine, mefloquine, <b>halofantrine</b> and quinine are thought to have occurred by similar mechanisms.|$|E
50|$|Food, in {{particular}} fat, enhances {{the absorption of}} both artemether and lumefantrine, and patients are advised to take the tablets with food {{as soon as a}} meal can be tolerated. Coartem has a potential to prolong the QT interval, so combinations with other drugs having that property can cause irregular heartbeat, potentially leading to lethal ventricular fibrillation. The combination with <b>halofantrine,</b> another antimalarial, can cause a life-threatening QT prolongation. Drugs and other substances influencing the activity of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, including grapefruit juice, can either increase or lower blood levels of artemether/lumefantrine, depending on the sort of substance. This can either lead to more severe side effects or to reduced efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Mefloquine {{is useful}} for the {{prevention}} of malaria in all areas except for those where parasites may have resistance to multiple drugs, and is one of several anti-malarial drugs recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control for this purpose. It is also recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for malaria prophylaxis as a first or second line agent, depending on resistance patterns in the malaria found in the geographic region visited. It is typically taken for one to two weeks before entering an area with malaria. Doxycycline and atovaquone/proguanil provide protection within one to two days and may be better tolerated. If a person becomes ill with malaria despite prophylaxis with mefloquine, the use of <b>halofantrine</b> and quinine for treatment may be ineffective.|$|E

In 1993, he co-created his own pharmaceutical company, Romark Laboratories, L.C., to develop his own invention nitazoxanide, the first of the thiazolides. At Romark, he is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the company and its Chief Science Officer. Following the discovery of the antiviral activity of the thiazolides Rossignol went to Stanford University in California to study interferon stimulated gene pathways and chronic viral hepatitis under Prof. Emmet Keeffe and Prof. Jeffery Glenn.

40|$|The {{antimalarial}} drug <b>halofantrine</b> can prolong the QT interval {{and this may}} be enhanced by prior use of mefloquine. This possible interaction has been investigated by examining the effects of <b>halofantrine</b> and mefloquine alone and in combination. In anaesthetized rabbits (n= 6 per group), <b>halofantrine</b> given as bolus doses of 1, 3, 10, and 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 at 25 [*]min intervals dose-dependently prolonged the rate-corrected QT (QTc) interval from 313 ± 12 [*]ms pre-drug to 410 ± 18 [*]ms after the highest dose. Similar doses of mefloquine did not alter QTc intervals significantly. The highest dose of mefloquine (30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) caused cardiac contractile failure. Pretreatment with 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 mefloquine 25 [*]min before the first dose of <b>halofantrine</b> potentiated the effects of all doses of <b>halofantrine</b> on QTc intervals. The blood concentrations of <b>halofantrine</b> were two to six times higher in the group pretreated with mefloquine compared to the <b>halofantrine</b> alone group; e. g. 1. 03 ± 0. 17 and 0. 16 ± 0. 02 μM respectively after 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>halofantrine.</b> There was a significant correlation between blood <b>halofantrine</b> concentrations and QTc intervals (r= 0. 673). Even after making allowance for overestimation of the potency of <b>halofantrine</b> that may result from the hypokalaemia that is prevalent in anaesthetized rabbits, these effects occurred with concentrations of <b>halofantrine</b> that are found in clinical use. These data indicate clearly that while mefloquine does not alter QTc intervals itself, it does enhance the effects of <b>halofantrine</b> by increasing the circulating concentration of <b>halofantrine...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Halofantrine</b> is {{a widely}} used {{antimalarial}} agent which {{has been associated with}} prolongation of the ‘QT interval' of the electrocardiogram (ECG), torsades de pointes and sudden death. Whilst QT prolongation is consistent with halofantrine-induced increases in cardiac ventricular action potential duration, the cellular mechanism for these observations has not been previously reported. The delayed rectifier potassium channel, IKr, is a primary site of action of drugs causing QT prolongation and is encoded by the human-ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG). We examined the effects of <b>halofantrine</b> on HERG potassium channels stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K 1) cells. <b>Halofantrine</b> blocked HERG tail currents elicited on repolarization to − 60 [*]mV from + 30 [*]mV with an IC 50 of 196. 9 [*]nM. The therapeutic plasma concentration range for <b>halofantrine</b> is 1. 67 – 2. 98 [*]μM. Channel inhibition by <b>halofantrine</b> exhibited time-, voltage- and use-dependence. <b>Halofantrine</b> did not alter the time course of channel activation or deactivation, but inactivation was accelerated and there was a 20 [*]mV hyperpolarizing shift in the mid-activation potential of steady-state inactivation. Block was enhanced by pulses that render channels inactivated, and channel blockade increased with increasing duration of depolarizing pulses. We conclude that HERG channel inhibition by <b>halofantrine</b> is the likely underlying cellular mechanism for QT prolongation. Our data suggest preferential binding of <b>halofantrine</b> to the open and inactivated channel states...|$|E

In anaesthetized guinea-pigs consecutive bolus doses of <b>halofantrine</b> (0. 3, 1, 3, 10 and 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v.) at 25 [*]min intervals caused dose-dependent prolongation of the rate corrected QTc interval and bradycardia. The change in heart rate became significant after administration of 10 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>halofantrine</b> (− 23 ± 9 beats min− 1) whereas the increase in QTc was significant with only 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>halofantrine</b> (22 ± 10 [*]ms). It was only with the highest dose of <b>halofantrine</b> that the PR interval was increased (from 52 ± 3 to 67 ± 4 [*]ms) and second degree atrioventricular (AV) block (type 1 Mobitz) occurred in all animals. No changes were observed in any parameters in a separate group of guinea-pigs which received vehicle (dimethylacetamide 60 % propylene glycol 40 %) at equivalent time points. The blood concentrations of <b>halofantrine</b> ranged from 0. 26 ± 0. 17 [*]μM after administration of 0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 to 2. 79 ± 0. 87 [*]μM after 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, i. v. There was a significant correlation between the blood concentrations of <b>halofantrine</b> and the changes in QTc interval. In guinea-pig left papillary muscles the effective refractory period was increased significantly 60 [*]min after addition of halofantrine; from 161 ± 4 to 173 ± 6 [*]ms with 10 [*]μM, 156 ± 8 to 174 ± 6 [*]ms with 30 [*]μM and 165 ± 6 to 179 ± 5 [*]ms with 100 [*]μM <b>halofantrine.</b> However, the vehicle (0. 1 % Tween 80 in DMSO; final concentration of vehicle in Krebs, 1 %) also increased the effective refractory period from 164 ± 5 to 173 ± 6 [*]ms. Similar results were obtained in right ventricular strips but left atrial effective refractory periods were not altered by either the vehicle or <b>halofantrine.</b> The results of these experiments suggest that any direct effects that <b>halofantrine</b> may have had on the effective refractory period of cardiac muscle cannot be separated from those of the vehicle. The prolongation of QTc and consistent observation of AV block with <b>halofantrine</b> in anaesthetized guinea-pigs suggest that in vivo models may be more useful for further studies investigating the mechanisms underlying the cardiotoxicity of <b>halofantrine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{continuing}} {{spread of}} multidrug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria makes {{the search for}} alternative treatments ever more urgent. We have investigated the relative efficacy of <b>halofantrine</b> and mefloquine in two paired randomised trials on the Thai-Burmese border, a multidrug-resistant area. In the first trial, 198 patients with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were randomly assigned either the standard <b>halofantrine</b> regimen (24 mg/kg) or mefloquine (25 mg/kg). The cumulative failure rates by day 28 were 35 % with <b>halofantrine</b> and 10 % with mefloquine (p = 0. 0002). In the second study of 437 patients, a higher dose of <b>halofantrine</b> (8 mg/kg every 8 h for 3 days = 72 mg/kg) was both more effective and better tolerated than mefloquine 25 mg/kg; the failure rates were 3 % and 8 % (p = 0. 03), respectively, or 1 % vs 6 % after adjustment for possible reinfections (p = 0. 009). The rate of failure was higher after retreatment than after primary treatment in all study groups. <b>Halofantrine</b> 72 mg/kg was especially effective in the retreatment of these recrudescent infections; the failure rate was 44 % with mefloquine and 15 % with high-dose <b>halofantrine</b> (relative risk 3. 0 [95 % CI 1. 2 - 7. 3], p = 0. 008).

They were compared with a previously described intravenous <b>halofantrine</b> preparation. No toxic effects were observed with <b>halofantrine</b> in form of nanocapsules after intravenous administration for doses of up to 100 mg/kg, whereas the solubilized form in polyethylene glycol-dimethylacetamide was toxic at this dose. The halofantrine-loaded nanocapsules showed activity that was similar to or better {{than that of the}} solution in the 4 -day test and as a single dose in severely infected mice, with only minimal differences between the two nanocapsule formulations. <b>Halofantrine</b> pharmacokinetics were determined in parallel with parasite development in severely infected mice. Nanocapsules increased the area under the curve for <b>halofantrine</b> in plasma more than sixfold compared with the solution throughout the experimental period of 70 h. Furthermore, nanocapsules induced a significantly faster control of parasite development than the solution in the first 48 h posttreatment. While the parasitemia fell more rapidly with PLA nanocapsules, the effect was more sustained with the surface-modified ones. This is consistent with surface-modified nanocapsules remaining longer in the circulation.

Electrocardiograms (ECGs) were recorded from 48 hours before dosing until 48 hours thereafter.
