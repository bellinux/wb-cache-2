The Bauschinger effect contributes to work softening of the workpiece, {{for example in}} straightening of <b>drawn</b> <b>bars</b> or rolled sheets, where rollers subject the workpiece to alternate bending stresses, thereby reducing the yield strength and enabling greater cold drawability of the workpiece.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Die {{design was}} {{optimized}} for suppressing the void growth in multi-pass drawing. The void index {{to evaluate the}} void fraction in multi-pass drawing was rst proposed, based on the well-known equation to predict the fracture limit in cold working. Using nite element analysis, the in uence of die geometries on the void index was investigated and dies were designed to {{have the effect of}} suppressing void with the least minimum die length. A series of experiments was then carried out to verify the validity of the numerical analysis. The densities of <b>drawn</b> <b>bars</b> were measured and voids in microstructures were observed to verify the validity of the proposed void index...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—In this paper, creep {{constitutive}} equations of base (Parent) and weld {{materials of}} the weldment for cold-drawn 304 L stainless steel {{have been obtained}} experimentally. For this purpose, test samples have been generated from cold <b>drawn</b> <b>bars</b> and weld material according to the ASTM standard. The creep behavior and properties have been examined for these materials by conducting uniaxial creep tests. Constant temperatures and constant load uni-axial creep tests {{have been carried out}} at two high temperatures, 680 and 720 o C, subjected to constant loads, which produce initial stresses ranging from 240 to 360 MPa. The experimental data have been used to obtain the creep constitutive parameters using numerical optimization techniques...|$|E

5000|$|A trailer coupler is used {{to secure}} the trailer to the towing vehicle. The trailer coupler {{attaches}} to the trailer ball. This forms a {{ball and socket connection}} to allow for relative movement between the towing vehicle and trailer while towing over uneven road surfaces. The trailer ball is mounted to the rear bumper or to a <b>draw</b> <b>bar,</b> which may be removable. The <b>draw</b> <b>bar</b> is secured to the trailer hitch by inserting it into the hitch receiver and pinning it. The three most common types of couplers are straight couplers, A-frame couplers, and adjustable couplers. Bumper-pull hitches and <b>draw</b> <b>bars</b> can exert tremendous leverage on the tow vehicle making it harder to recover from a swerving situation.|$|R
40|$|The work {{hardening}} of metals subjected to complex processing paths {{is different from}} that in monotonic deformation. Changes in the deformation mode can promote transients in the strain-hardening rate, leading to anomalous softening or hardening of the material. This paper investigates the influence of strain path changes on the tensile behavior of drawn 0. 12 % steel rods. Annealed or predrawn specimens were submitted to cyclic twisting and then tested in tension. The results show that the cyclic deformation causes changes in the mechanical behavior of the metal, and the effect will depend on the previous "history" of the material. Cyclic twisting causes hardening in annealed samples, but leads to softening of the <b>drawn</b> <b>bars.</b> These phenomena are in line with the corresponding substructural aspects...|$|E
40|$|Manufacturing {{methods and}} the applied heat {{treatment}} {{are important for}} the properties of materials. Building safe constructions with the materials used depends on the knowledge and correct use of their properties. In this study, cold drawn bar specimens of Ç 1040 are heat treated in three different temperatures (500 o C, 650 o C, 840 o C) and the strength, hardness, and strain values are {{compared with those of}} untreated materials. Cold <b>drawn</b> <b>bars</b> has shown higher strength values when compared with the hot rolled bars. This is because of the type of process selected for manufacturing. By heat treatment, strain has increased, hardness and strength have decreased. It has been observed that the rate of increasing or decreasing depends on the temperature and duration of the heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} aging {{behavior}} of the recently developed ZnAl 15 Cu 1 alloy and its change of mechanical properties with time. Samples obtained from <b>drawn</b> <b>bars</b> were artificially aged at 80 and 220 °C for up to several weeks. The mechanical properties were monitored periodically by hardness testing, until a plateau was reached. The microstructural evolution was studied by optical and scanning electron microscope analyses. Bidimensional X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy and {{selected area electron diffraction}} experiments were carried out to study the recrystallization phenomena. Nanoindentation measurements were also performed to determine the hardness of the single constituents. It was demonstrated that the aging causes a drop of about 30 % in hardness with time. This reduction was related to the recrystallization of the Zn-rich phase network, occurring at both the studied temperatures...|$|E

40|$|Cold forming {{is usually}} {{associated}} with the "work hardening" of the material being formed. The work hardening behavior of metals subject to complex processing paths {{is different from that}} in monotonic deformation. The results show that, after some initial hardening, {{there is a possibility that}} further deformation will cause softening in the material ("work softening"). Recent work showed that cyclic torsion applied to drawn products causes changes in the subsequent tensile behavior of low carbon steel, and that the effect will depend on the previous "history" of the material. For annealed samples, the cyclic torsion leads to an increase in the yield strength, but does not affect the tensile strength and elongation. For the case of previously <b>drawn</b> <b>bars,</b> the cyclic deformation caused a decrease in the yield and tensile strength and an increase in the total elongation. The present paper discusses the dislocation structure changes associated with different strain paths in mild steel...|$|E
