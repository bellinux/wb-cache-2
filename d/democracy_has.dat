5000|$|Numerous {{studies using}} many {{different}} kinds of data, definitions, and statistical analyses have found support for the democratic peace theory. The original finding was that liberal <b>democracies</b> <b>have</b> never made war with one another. More recent research has extended the theory and finds that <b>democracies</b> <b>have</b> few Militarized Interstate Disputes causing less than 1000 battle deaths with one another, that those MIDs that <b>have</b> occurred between <b>democracies</b> <b>have</b> caused few deaths, and that <b>democracies</b> <b>have</b> few civil wars. There are various criticisms of the theory, including at least as many refutations as alleged proofs of the theory, some 200 deviant cases, failure to treat [...] "democracy" [...] as a multidimensional concept, and that correlation is not causation (Haas 2014).|$|R
50|$|A further {{distinction}} that liberal <b>democracies</b> <b>have</b> rarely made war with one another; research has extended {{the theory and}} finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called militarized interstate disputes) causing fewer battle deaths with one another, and that <b>democracies</b> <b>have</b> far fewer civil wars.|$|R

25|$|<b>Democracy</b> <b>has</b> taken {{a number}} of forms, both in theory and practice. Some {{varieties}} of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. However, if any democracy is not structured so as to prohibit the government from excluding {{the people from the}} legislative process, or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its own favour, then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy.|$|E

25|$|A {{succession}} of controversial political appointments {{to the highest}} offices of the Institutions of the European Union - who have failed to garner favourable public opinion for their vision of the European project and demonstrate leadership required to steer the European project - has resulted in successful electoral challenges to prevent any further devolution of sovereignty from the national parliaments to the Institutions of the European Union in Brussels. European electorates have become deeply suspicious of the democratic deficit, corporate lobbying activities and opacity of political arrangements brokered in Brussels. The transition from authoritarian rule to libertarian <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> not been fully completed by Eastern European countries and is affecting the elimination of corruption & nepotism, religious & ethnic tolerance, humanitarian solidarity, respect of human rights, etc.|$|E
25|$|Although Robert Barro, an American {{economist}} from Harvard University, did {{not directly}} respond to the arguments posed by the book, his research {{on the relationship between}} democracy and growth disagrees with the argument that inclusive institutions give rise to economic growth. According to Barro's 1996 paper Democracy and Growth, the econometric analysis reveals a weak relationship between democracy and growth in a study of 100 countries from 1960 to 1990. After fixing factors like rule of law and free market, <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> a statistically insignificant influence on economic growth. At the same time, raising the standard of living—including health service, education—will substantially raise the probability of political freedom. Barro is essentially arguing the reverse of Acemoglu and Robinson: that economic growth gives rise to better political institutions, especially when a country is poor.|$|E
25|$|American {{political}} scientist Peter Roman’s {{work on the}} subject led him to believe that Cuba’s “grassroots democracy” goes beyond the power to vote freely for one of several candidates representing both pro or anti-socialist positions. He argues that at the “people level” democracy exists in Cuba today and that this <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> been strengthened during the 1990s by conscious decisions made at the top. Roman also writes that the historical origins of contemporary Cuban democracy are {{the ideas of the}} centrality of unity and consensus, and the rejection of a distinction between political and civil society. Thus, unanimous votes in representative bodies do not represent, as critics charge, imposition by the PCC, but rather legitimate consensus worked out in lengthy discussion at several levels. British political professor Steve Ludlum wrote in his paper “Participation is key to Cuba’s democracy” that “Two models of democracy competed for support in nineteenth century Europe. The one we know is based on indirect representation by professional politicians controlled by party factions. The other model, associated with Rousseau’s concept of the ‘general will’ and made famous by the Paris Commune of 1870”. Ludlum likens Cuba’s local participation to the latter model.|$|E

However, nothing happens, and Stewie comments, [...] "Oh, no clip? Thought we had a clip". This scene was described as being a one off.|$|E
500|$|A UNPA {{might begin}} as an inter-parliamentary institution–an {{assembly}} of parliamentarians from their respective countries' legislatures–and then {{change to a}} directly elected body. This {{would be similar to}} the evolution of the European Parliament. Beginning with the European Common Assembly's founding in 1952, MEPs were appointed by each of the Member States' national parliaments; in 1979, direct election was instituted. Sen. Douglas Roche, O.C., in The Case for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, analyzes the tradeoffs between the two choices. A UNPA based on existing parliamentarians may be easier to establish, because it avoids several hurdles, such as decisions on electoral cycles, a universally acceptable electoral body, legitimacy of elections, and so on: [...] "A body comprising national parliamentarians has the 'stamp of approval' built-in. National parliamentarians can claim electoral legitimacy in their own right. Admittedly, the credibility of domestic franchised can be called into question, but the trend toward <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> been strengthening rapidly." ...|$|E

500|$|The CEUNPA {{proposes that}} the UNPA's begin as a consultative body whose powers could be {{augmented}} as it {{evolved into a}} directly elected assembly: [...] "Step by step, it should be provided with genuine rights of information, participation and control vis-à-vis the UN and the organizations of the UN system." [...] An article in the Asian-Pacific Law & Policy Journal notes that precedents for this idea include the British Parliament, French Estates-General, U.S. Congress, and Europarl, which are all systems in which, over time, power shifted to directly elected officials: [...] "In the past, fledgling <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> always had to compromise {{with the realities of}} power and evolve step-by-step, where possible. This is often accomplished {{in the form of a}} 'non-democratic' additional house in the parliamentary structure. Thus, in Britain, the necessity of compromise of the 'common people' with the powers and interests of the armed and titled nobility necessitated a bicameral system incorporating the House of Lords, as well as the House of Commons. The French Estates-General included similar power blocs as 'estates' or functional separate houses, and the United States Senate reflected a necessary compromise of the interests of less populous states hesitant to subject themselves to 'democratic inundation' by the more populous states." ...|$|E
500|$|Representative <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> been {{described}} as [...] "a system of government where the people in free elections elect their representatives to the legislative chamber which occupies the most powerful position in the political system". The {{meaning of the term}} was discussed in the Parliament of Singapore on 27 August 2008 upon a motion moved by Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann, a professor of constitutional law at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, for the House to affirm the importance of representative democracy and to call on the Government to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act to make the calling of by-elections mandatory in Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) in certain situations. According to Thio, under the view of representative democracy taken by the 18th-century British Member of Parliament (MP) and philosopher Edmund Burke, [...] "an MP is no mere delegate who simply mouths his constituents' views. An MP is chosen for his 'mature judgment' and 'enlightened conscience.'" [...] Thus, an MP [...] "has to represent his constituents in tending to municipal affairs", but also [...] "be concerned with national affairs", and, [...] "as a party member, he must toe the party line". In addition, an MP of a minority ethnic group in a GRC [...] "has to carry the concerns of his particular minority community as well". For this reason, she felt that if the seat of a minority MP in a GRC became vacant, it should be incumbent on the Government to call a by-election to fill it.|$|E
500|$|A U.S. Army {{recruitment}} officer {{comes to}} the high school to hold an assembly and entices the students with a glamorized, deceptive video presentation, which impresses every one including Chris. Chris returns home and tells the family during dinner that he wants to enlist, but Lois attempts to dissuade him, for the military is not a place for him. The next day, while driving Stewie to Gymboree Play & Music for parachute day, Brian decides to take a detour to the recruitment office to scold the recruiting officer for trying to trick Chris through devious means. The two arrive at the office but the wait is long; when Brian goes to top-up the parking meter [...] Stewie walks into the office. Stewie ends up enlisting in the Army and signs Brian up as well when told there [...] "is a $100 bonus for signing up a buddy." [...] Brian returns and is shocked. Brian and Stewie begin basic training, but Brian becomes stressed from the discipline and decides one night to leave. Stewie wakes up and finds Brian packing his suitcase, but he manages {{to talk him out of}} leaving, insisting that he had never finished anything significant in his life and that the Army will provide him the discipline. With this, Brian decides to stay. After they complete their training, Stewie and Brian are deployed to Iraq. Meantime, the two are patrolling the streets of a village, commenting on the [...] "good situation so far"; however, after the pair get caught up in a terrorist attack, they become dissuaded and decide to find a way to get out of the Army. They first attempt to be discharged by pretending to be homosexual (only to discover that one of their superiors is gay). As a last resort, they attempt to get [...] "Wounded in Action" [...] by shooting each other in the foot; they do this only to find out that the Army now takes anyone no matter what, going so far as to allow two corpses to guard the ammunition. They are then told that <b>democracy</b> <b>has</b> kicked in and the war is over, thus meaning all the soldiers can return to the United States.|$|E
