The evaluation of the genotoxicity of such materials is mostly based on experiments with model substances or mixtures and condensates in the standard Ames assay. Due to the methodological difficulties of testing air contaminants in their natural gaseous or aerosolised state, there are no generally accepted concepts and techniques for effective exposure of bacteria under such conditions. Therefore, we established a novel experimental approach using an <b>exposure</b> <b>device</b> based on the cell exposure system CULTEX.

Although there are some differences {{in the rate of}} cooling following cessation of RF exposure, there is reasonable agreement between modeling and both probe measurement and dye estimation of temperature.

40|$|The {{in vitro}} study of adverse {{cellular}} effects induced by inhaled pollutants poses a special problem {{due to the}} difficulties of exposing cultured cells of the respiratory tract directly to test atmospheres that can include complex gaseous and particulate mixtures. In general, there is no widely accepted in vitro exposure system. However, in vitro methods offer the unique possibility for use of human cells, developed and validated cell culture and <b>exposure</b> <b>device</b> (CULTEX 1) using {{the principle of the}} air/liquid exposure technique. Cells of the respiratory tract are grown on porous membranes in transwell inserts.

In comparison with other experimental approaches, the goal of our studies is to analyze the biological effects of test atmospheres under environmental conditions, i. e. without humidifying the atmosphere or adding additional CO 2. The system used is small and flexible enough independent of a cultivation chamber and thus offers the opportunity for onsite study of indoor and outdoor atmospheres in the field.

40|$|The {{application}} of {{in vitro methods}} {{to the analysis of}} the effects of airborne materials is still limited, because there are no generally accepted concepts and technologies for efficiently exposing adherent growing cells to test atmospheres, especially those comprising complex mixtures of gaseous and particulate phases. The introduction of in vitro research into the field of inhalation toxicology offers a unique possibility for using human cells and tissues for pre-screening studies, thus reducing the necessity for animal experiments, and cutting the numbers of animals used in toxicological testing.

A foot-long stick of radioactive cobalt could be taken from a food irradiation plant and combined with ten pounds of explosives to contaminate 1,000 square kilometers and make some areas uninhabitable for decades. There are other radiological weapons called radiological <b>exposure</b> <b>devices</b> where an explosive is not necessary.

40|$|Investigations {{into the}} {{toxicity}} of {{airborne particulate matter}} (PM) commonly employ in vitro techniques (the exposure of cell cultures to air pollutants) as methods to provide rapid and cost efficient insight before more extensive research. However, there are currently limitations associated with in vitro methodologies in regards to delivery efficiency, physiological relevance, and preservation of the chemical and physical composition of the pollutant under investigation. The purpose {{of this research was}} to develop an innovative exposure technique that can overcome these limitations by using airborne magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to deliver PM to cells grown at an air liquid interface. A specially fabricated Magnetic Precipitator Single <b>Exposure</b> <b>Device</b> (MPSED) was used to deliver MNPs to cultures of human airway epithelial cells. Our research indicates that use of magnetic nanoparticles coated in amorphous silica is advantageous in this delivery system due to their stability against acidic erosion and negligible cellular influence on the cultured cells. Using a series of derived dose models, it is possible to estimate the amount of nanoparticle delivered to the cell cultures when using this system, which is beneficial to establish dose response relationships. Finally, a Magnetic Precipitator Multiple <b>Exposure</b> <b>Device</b> (MPMED) was fabricated to facilitate toxicity assessment and strengthen statistical analysis by conducting multiple exposures simultaneously. Coupled with the MPMED, a specially designed aerosol generation system provides a constant and uniform distribution of MNPs to the delivery device.
