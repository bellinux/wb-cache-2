5|$|In agriculture, fungi may {{be useful}} if they {{actively}} compete for nutrients and space with pathogenic microorganisms such as bacteria or other fungi via the competitive exclusion principle, or if they are parasites of these pathogens. For example, certain species {{may be used to}} eliminate or suppress the growth of harmful plant pathogens, such as insects, mites, weeds, nematodes, and other fungi that cause diseases of important crop plants. This has generated strong interest in practical applications that use these fungi in the biological control of these agricultural pests. Entomopathogenic fungi can be used as biopesticides, as they actively kill insects. Examples that have been used as biological insecticides are Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium spp, Hirsutella spp, Paecilomyces (Isaria) spp, and Lecanicillium lecanii. Endophytic fungi of grasses of the genus Neotyphodium, such as N. coenophialum, produce alkaloids that are toxic to a range of invertebrate and vertebrate herbivores. These alkaloids protect grass plants from herbivory, but several endophyte alkaloids can poison grazing animals, such as cattle and sheep. Infecting cultivars of pasture or <b>forage</b> <b>grasses</b> with Neotyphodium endophytes is one approach being used in grass breeding programs; the fungal strains are selected for producing only alkaloids that increase resistance to herbivores such as insects, while being non-toxic to livestock.|$|E

40|$|Human {{health is}} closely linked with soils via plants, grazers, or plant-based products. This study {{estimated}} plantbeneficial elements (macronutrients: K, P; secondary macronutrients: Ca, Mg; micronutrients: Mo, Mn, Na, Ni, Se) in both soils and shoots of two <b>forage</b> <b>grass</b> species (Eriophorum angustifolium and Lolium perenne) {{prevalent in the}} vicinity of a chemical industry complex (Estarreja, Portugal). Both soils and plants from the chemical industrial areas exhibited differential concentrations of the studied elements. In soils, the role of contamination was evidenced as insignificant in context of its impact on all the tested macro and secondary macronutrients except P, and micronutrients such asMo and Ni. In <b>forage</b> <b>grass</b> plant shoots, the role of contamination was evidenced as insignificant in relation to its impact on all the tested macro and secondary macronutrients except K. Between the two <b>forage</b> <b>grass</b> plants, high Se-harboring L. perenne cannot be recommended for its use as animal feed...|$|R

50|$|It {{is an easy}} {{grass to}} {{establish}} by seed, having both high germination rates and high seedling vigour. It also establishes rapidly relative to many other grasses. Under non-irrigated conditions in low precipitation areas, Crested Wheatgrasses are consistently some of, if not the, highest yielding and persistent of domestic <b>forage</b> <b>grasses.</b> However, A. cristatum is lower yielding, although it is slightly more palatable, relative to other Crested Wheatgrasses.|$|E
50|$|Studies have {{demonstrated}} that future long-term warming trends {{may lead to a}} longer growing season and hence positive impacts on agricultural yields. This effect would increase progressively from south to north. In Northern Norway this is projected to be in the order of an increase of 1-4 weeks for the period 2021-2050, compared with 1961-1990. A longer season could also increase the use of legumes and more productive perennial <b>forage</b> <b>grasses,</b> vegetables and grains.|$|E
50|$|Smuts are {{cereal and}} crop {{pathogens}} that most notably affect {{members of the}} grass family (Poaceae). Economically important hosts include maize, barley, wheat, oats, sugarcane, and <b>forage</b> <b>grasses.</b> They eventually hijack the plants' reproductive systems, forming galls which darken and burst, releasing fungal teliospores which infect other plants nearby. Before infection can occur, the smuts need to undergo a successful mating to form dikaryotic hyphae (two haploid cells fuse to form a dikaryon).|$|E

50|$|Introduced {{species such}} as Brachiaria grasses can degrade habitat and compete with native species. In Northern Australia, the exotic B. decumbens competes with the native tree Alphitonia petriei by {{inhibiting}} the growth of seedlings, slowing the conversion of abandoned pastureland to natural forest. In the Paragominas area of Brazil, however, native forest outcompetes cultivated stands of Brachiaria and other exotic <b>forage</b> <b>grasses,</b> and ranchers struggle to maintain pasture cover. Native species may also utilize exotic Brachiaria as a food resource, such as the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris), a native rodent of the Caatinga.|$|E
50|$|Sheep were grazed on {{the island}} for many years. There are records from the 1870s through the 1930s. Many writers {{reported}} that {{in the absence of}} springs on Anacapa sheep would lick the moisture that accumulated on each other's fleeces from the coastal fog. The native flora was affected by the <b>forage</b> <b>grasses</b> that farmers introduced to feed their flocks, and by soil-compaction caused by the sheep's hooves. Reproduction of ground-nesting species such as the meadowlark and horned lark is also thought to have been harmed by grazing.|$|E
50|$|Festuca (fescue) is a genus of {{flowering}} plants {{belonging to the}} grass family, Poaceae (subfamily Pooideae). They are evergreen or herbaceous perennial tufted grasses with a height range of 10 - 200 cm and a cosmopolitan distribution, occurring on every continent except Antarctica. The genus {{is closely related to}} ryegrass (Lolium), and recent evidence from phylogenetic studies using DNA sequencing of plant mitochondrial DNA shows that the genus lacks monophyly. As a result, plant taxonomists have moved several species, including the <b>forage</b> <b>grasses</b> tall fescue and meadow fescue, from the genus Festuca into the genus Lolium.|$|E

50|$|Mixed farms {{with both}} {{livestock}} and crops {{can operate as}} ley farms, whereby the land gathers fertility through growing nitrogen-fixing <b>forage</b> <b>grasses</b> such as white clover or alfalfa and grows cash crops or cereals when fertility is established. Farms without livestock ("stockless") may find {{it more difficult to}} maintain soil fertility, and may rely more on external inputs such as imported manure as well as grain legumes and green manures, although grain legumes may fix limited nitrogen because they are harvested. Horticultural farms that grow fruits and vegetables in protected conditions often relay even more on external inputs.|$|E
