40|$|The muon {{spectrometer}} of the ATLAS detector at CERN uses drift tubes {{as basic}} detection elements {{over most of}} the solid angle. The performance of these monitored drift tubes (MDTs), in particular their spatial resolution of 80 µm, determines the precision of the spectrometer. If ageing effects occur, the precision of the drift tubes will be degraded. Hence ageing effects have to be minimized or avoided altogether if possible. Even with a gas mixture of Ar:CO 2 (93 : 7), which was selected for its good ageing properties, ageing effects were observed in test systems. They were caused by small amounts of impurities, in particular volatile silicon compounds. Systematic studies revealed the required impurity levels deteriorating the drift tubes to be well below 1 ppm. Many components of the ATLAS MDT gas system are supplied by industry. In a newly designed ageing experiment in Freiburg these components were validated for their use in ATLAS. With a fully assembled ATLAS gas <b>distribution</b> <b>rack</b> as test component ageing effects were observed. It was therefore decided to install gas filters in the gas distribution lines to remove volatile silicon compounds efficiently from the gas mixture. Finally a filter was designed that can adsorb up to 5. 5 g of volatile silicon compounds, hereby reducing the impurities in the outlet gas mixture to less than 30 ppb...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{assess the}} long-run {{implications}} for consumer welfare of proposed uniform gasoline price regulation. Such regulation would allow lessee dealers {{to ignore the}} terms of their lease agreements and purchase gasoline at the 'rack' (i. e., a wholesale distribution terminal) or from whomever and wherever they choose (most typically a 'jobber', i. e., an independent distributor). We show that such regulation would harm consumer welfare by raising wholesale and retail prices without benefiting lessee dealers. Prices would increase because the proposed regulation would prohibit efficient pricing that reflects differences in costs and demand that vary by geographic area and by type of distribution. We also show that even {{under the assumption that}} price differences result solely from price discrimination, uniform price regulation will not necessarily benefit consumers or all lessee dealers.

40|$|Abstract—Temperature-aware {{computing}} {{is becoming}} {{more important in the}} design of computer systems as power densities are increasing and the implications of high operating temperatures result in higher failure rates of components and increased demand for cooling capability. Computer architects and system software designers need to understand the thermal consequences of their proposals and develop techniques for lowering operating temperatures to reduce both transient and permanent component failures. Until recently, tools for understanding the temperature ramifications of the designs of the server and the rack have been mainly restricted to the industry for studying packaging and cooling mechanisms and they have been mainly concerned with the static thermal characteristics of computer systems. Recognizing the need for such tools, there has been recent work on modeling temperatures of processors at the microarchitectural level, which can be easily understood and employed by computer architects for processor designs. However, there is a dearth of such tools in the academic/research community for undertaking architectural/systems studies beyond a processor—a server box, rack, or even a machine room. In this paper, we present a detailed three-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based thermal modeling tool, called ThermoStat, for rack-mounted server systems. We conduct several experiments with this tool to show how different load conditions affect the thermal profile and to also illustrate how this tool can help design dynamic thermal management techniques. We propose reactive and proactive thermal management for rack-mounted server and isothermal workload <b>distribution</b> for <b>rack.</b> Index Terms—Simulation, energy-aware systems, power management, thermal modeling.

40|$|Adaptive {{sampling}} and sleep scheduling can help realize the much needed resource efficiency in densely deployed autonomic sensorbased systems that monitor and reconstruct physical or environmental phenomena. This paper presents a data-centric approach to distributed adaptive sampling aimed at minimizing the communication and processing overhead in autonomic networked sensorbased systems. The proposed solution exploits the spatio-temporal correlation in sensed data and eliminates redundancy in transmitted data through selective representation without compromising on accuracy of {{reconstruction of the}} monitored phenomenon at a remote monitor node. In addition, the solution also exploits the same correlations for adaptive sleep scheduling aimed at saving energy in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) while also providing a mechanism for ensuring connectivity to the monitor node. The datacentric joint adaptive-{{sampling and}} sleep-scheduling solution, SI-LENCE, has been evaluated through real experiments on a testbed monitoring temperature and humidity <b>distribution</b> in a <b>rack</b> of servers {{as well as through}} extensive simulations on TOSSIM, the TinyOS simulator...|$|R
40|$|During the construction, {{installation}} and initial {{operation of the}} Evaporative Cooling System for the ATLAS Inner Detector SCT Barrel Sub-detector, some performance characteristics were observed to be inconsistent with the original design specifications, therefore the assumptions made in the ATLAS Inner Detector TDR were revisited. The main concern arose because of unexpected pressure drops in the piping system {{from the end of}} the detector structure to the <b>distribution</b> <b>racks.</b> The author of this theses made a series of measurements of these pressure drops and the thermal behavior of SCT-Barrel cooling Stave. Tests were performed on the installed detector in the pit, and using a specially assembled full scale replica in the SR 1 laboratory at CERN. This test setup has been used to perform extensive tests of the cooling performance of the system including measurements of pressure drops in different parts of system, studies of the thermal profile along the stave pipe for different running conditions / parameters and coolant flow measurements in the system. The pressure drops in the system and the associated temperatures in the barrel cooling loops have been studied as a function of the system variables, for example; input liquid pressure, vapour back pressure, module power load and input liquid temperature. Measurements were performed with 10, 11, 12, 13 barabs inlet liquid pressure in system, 1. 2, 1. 6, 2. 0, 2. 5, 3. 0, 4. 0, 5. 0, 6. 0 barabs vapour back pressure in system, and 0 W, 3 W, 6 W, 9 W, 10. 5 W power applied per silicon module. The measurements clearly show that the cooling system can not achieve the design evaporation temperature of - 25 C in every part of the detector (SCT Barrel loops) in case of 13 barabs nominal inlet liquid pressure, 1. 2 barabs minimum possible back pressure and 6 W nominal power per SCT Barrel silicon module and especially at the end of the ATLAS ID operation period when modules will work on full power of 10. 5 W. This will lead to the problem of thermal run-away of the ATLAS SCT, especially near the end of the operational period after significant radiation exposure has occurred. The LHC luminosity profile, depletion voltage and leakage current values and the total power dissipated from the modules were revised. Thermal runaway limits for the ATLAS SCT sub-detector were also revised. Results show that coolants evaporation temperature necessary for the sub-detector's safe operation over the full lifetime (10 years) is - 15 C with a safety factor of 2. Laboratory measurements clearly show that the cooling system can not achieve even this necessary evaporation temperature of - 15 C. It is now impossible to make mechanical modifications to the cooling system, for example; changing the diameter of the cooling pipes, or the thermal performance of the in-system heat exchanger or reducing the vapour back pressure. It was therefore decided to investigate changes to the cooling fluid and to test mixtures of Hexafluoroethane (R 116) C 2 F 6 and Octafluoropropane(R 218) C 3 F 8 at differing ratios instead of just pure C 3 F 8 coolant presently used. For this purpose, a new "blending" machine was assembled in the SR 1 laboratory, with a new device an "on-line acoustic flow meter and fluorocarbon coolant mixture analyzer" (Sonar Analyzer) attached to it. The Machines were connected to the already existing laboratory test station and new extensive tests were performed to investigate different proportion of C 3 F 8 /C 2 F 6 blends to find the mixture ratio which resulted in the best operational performance as measured by: the temperature distribution, pressure drops and flow parameters over the system, to ensure best cooling performance of SCT Barrel cooling loops for long term ATLAS SCT operation. Measurements were performed with different percentage of C 2 F 6 (1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} aims at {{improvements}} of the airflow and temperature distribution {{in a container}} data center. Simulation is carried out based on a raised floor design. It is found that the height of raised floor casts {{significant impact on the}} flow distribution. Generally, the flow rate of the perforated tile near the entrance region of CRAC unit is lower than that of the rear part of the perforated tile. The mal-distribution becomes even more severe when the height of the raised floor is reduced. The mal-distribution can be significantly improved using a smaller opening perforated tile but it also gives rise to higher pumping power and impairs the effective flow rate from CRAC. Hence, a variable opening design with a larger opening near the CRAC outlet, followed subsequently with smaller opening perforated tiles, the mal-distribution can be eliminated without additional pumping power. For improvement of the airflow/temperature <b>distribution</b> into the <b>rack,</b> we propose a drawer-type rack which can increase the effective hot aisle space and reducing the cold aisle space. Through this design, hot air recirculation and cold air bypass will be significantly reduced. As a result, the rack maximum inlet temperature of drawer-type rack can be reduced as much as 13. 3 °C when compared with the traditional one...|$|R
40|$|Uncertainties {{associated}} with the core bypass flow {{are some of the}} key issues that directly influence the coolant mass flow distribution and magnitude, and thus the operational core temperature profiles, in the very high-temperature reactor (VHTR). Designers will attempt to configure the core geometry so the core cooling flow rate magnitude and distribution conform to the design values. The objective of this project is to study the bypass flow both experimentally and computationally. Researchers will develop experimental data using state-of-the-art particle image velocimetry in a small test facility. The team will attempt to obtain full field temperature <b>distribution</b> using <b>racks</b> of thermocouples. The experimental data are intended to benchmark computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes by providing detailed information. These experimental data are urgently needed for validation of the CFD codes. The following are the project tasks: • Construct a small-scale bench-top experiment to resemble the bypass flow between the graphite blocks, varying parameters to address their impact on bypass flow. Wall roughness of the graphite block walls, spacing between the blocks, and temperature of the blocks are some of the parameters to be tested. • Perform CFD to evaluate pre- and post-test calculations and turbulence models, including sensitivity studies to achieve high accuracy. • Develop the state-of-the art large eddy simulation (LES) using appropriate subgrid modeling. • Develop models to be used in systems thermal hydraulics codes to account and estimate the bypass flows. These computer programs include, among others, RELAP 3 D, MELCOR, GAMMA, and GAS-NET. Actual core bypass flow rate may vary considerably from the design value. Although the uncertainty of the bypass flow rate is not known, some sources have stated that the bypass flow rates in the Fort St. Vrain reactor were between 8 and 25 percent of the total reactor mass flow rate. If bypass flow rates are on the high side, the quantity of cooling flow through the core may be considerably less than the nominal design value, causing some regions of the core to operate at temperatures in excess of the design values. These effects are postulated to lead to localized hot regions in the core that must be considered when evaluating the VHTR operational and accident scenarios...|$|R

Low entry costs {{and the nature of}} the product which is very generic lure many players to enter the business. This leads to tight competition which leads to price war and slim margin.

The objective was to analyze the process evaluation of the “Saude na Boa” intervention and to test differences between successful participants and dropouts. Twenty schools were randomly selected to receive the intervention (n= 10) or the control (n= 10), in Recife-PE and Florianopolis-SC. The process evaluation was performed in the intervention schools using a checklist of items from five domains (knowledge, visibility, environment, Physical Education classes and extracurricular activities). The operational intervention quality was classified using the median score from each domain (median from 0. 0 to 1. 0 = low, from 1. 1 to 2. 0 = moderate, and from 2. 1 to 3. 0 = high). Student characteristics were assessed at baseline (March 2006) and were compared between the participants who successfully completed the intervention (n= 989) and the dropouts (n= 1, 166). We verified moderate to high operational quality of the intervention for knowledge (median= 2. 0), fruit <b>distribution</b> and bike <b>rack</b> installation (median= 1. 5), acquisition of materials (median= 3. 0) and distribution of journals (median= 2. 0).

5000|$|With {{the quick}} {{turnover}} at the top, Shooter rapidly found himself {{rising in the}} ranks, and in 1978 he succeeded Archie Goodwin to become Marvel's ninth editor-in-chief. During this period, publisher Stan Lee relocated to Los Angeles to better oversee Marvel's animation, television and film projects, leaving Shooter largely {{in charge of the}} creative decision-making at Marvel's New York City headquarters. Although there were complaints among some that Shooter imposed a dictatorial style on the [...] "Bullpen", he cured many of the procedural ills at Marvel, successfully managed to keep the line of books on schedule (ending the widespread practice of missed deadlines), add new titles, and develop new talent. Marvel enjoyed some of its best successes during Shooter's nine-year tenure as Editor-in-Chief, such as Chris Claremont and John Byrne's run on the Uncanny X-Men, Byrne's work on the Fantastic Four, Frank Miller's series of Daredevil stories, Walt Simonson's crafting of Norse mythology with the Marvel Universe in Thor, and Roger Stern's runs on both the Avengers and The Amazing Spider-Man.In 1981, Shooter brought Marvel into the lucrative comic book specialty shop market with Dazzler #1. Featuring a disco-themed heroine with ties to the X-Men (based upon an unproduced motion picture set to star Bo Derek), the first issue of this series was sold only through specialty stores, bypassing the then-standard newsstand/spin <b>rack</b> <b>distribution</b> route altogether, as a recognition by Marvel of the growing comics shop sector. Subsequent issues of Dazzler, however, were sold through newsstand returnable accounts as well. Dazzler was the first direct sales-only ongoing series from a major publisher; other Marvel titles, such as Marvel Fanfare and Ka-Zar, soon followed. Later that same year, Shooter wrote Marvel Treasury Edition No. 28 which featured the second Superman and Spider-Man intercompany crossover. Additionally in 1981, Shooter was recognized as one of six [...] "New Yorkers of the Year" [...] by the New York chapter of the JayCees, for his [...] "contributions toward revitalizing the comics industry and helping Marvel Comics achieve a new pinnacle of success." [...] Shooter also institutionalized creator royalties, starting the Epic imprint for creator-owned material in 1982; introduced company-wide crossover events, with Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions and Secret Wars; and launched a new, albeit ultimately unsuccessful, line named New Universe, to commemorate Marvel's 25th anniversary, in 1986.|$|R
