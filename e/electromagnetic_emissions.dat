40|$|Abstract. The Kaiser Effect in {{acoustic}} emission {{is often}} used for an estimation of the stress to which rocks have been subjected. However, there are {{cases in which the}} Kaiser Effect is not clear, since the noises due to the contact and/or the stick slip between the pre-induced fracture surfaces are measured during the reloading process. In such cases, estimation of previous stress is difficult by the conventional method which is based on the acoustic emission activity observed under reloading process. In the tests for the Kaiser Effect on rocks, therefore, the noises must be eliminated from the acoustic emission generated from newly created cracks during the second loading process. Such techniques as analysis of the difference between the acoustic emission activity observed in the first and second reloading and the analysis of the change in the slope of the acoustic emission amplitude distribution have been proposed. In this paper we present a new method by which the maximum previous stress in rocks can be directly estimated without any post signal analysis. In the new method, simultaneous measurement of acoustic and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>emission</b> during loading test of rock sample is employed. The <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>emission</b> in the deformation of rock sample generates only when the fresh surfaces due to cracking are created in the material, and the source of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>emission</b> is the electrification between the fresh crack surfaces.

40|$|The {{electromagnetic}} compatibility (EMC) {{became a major}} concern for integrated circuits (ICs) during the last years. As the operating frequency has increased and the supply voltage has become lower, the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>emission</b> {{as well as the}} susceptibility of integrated circuits increased tremendously. Generally speaking, EMC is defined as the ability of an electrical system to work properly in its electromagnetic environment without unduly interfering with this environment. This is the reason why EMC is of importance to all of us. Consider, for example, the omnipresent electromagnetic environment in our motor vehicles generated by devices like ABS braking systems, airbag sensors, or the motor management. Without a proper design, EMC of integrated circuits will become a limiting factor in the performance of every advanced electronic system. In this paper, the new standards to characterize the {{electromagnetic compatibility}} of integrated circuits will be presented.
