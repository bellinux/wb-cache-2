Two of the ground-floor rooms {{have now been}} opened: the living-room is {{furnished}} in a 1930s/40s style, while the old kitchen area currently holds a couple of <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> {{with a view to}} showing hitherto unseen artefacts from the museum's collection of smaller items. The upper floors remain closed to visitors.|$|E

5|$|When {{specimens}} are to {{be placed}} in any size of container for long-term storage or display, the consistent use of only archival-quality materials prevents the development of Byne's disease. Thus, materials such as metal cabinets and <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> archival quality paper labels and card trays are used in museum collections of specimens that might be vulnerable to this reaction.|$|E
5|$|Bynesian decay usually starts when {{specimens}} {{are stored}} or displayed for considerable {{periods of time}} in an enclosed space. The storage method itself usually causes this problem, when containers, cabinets or <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> are entirely or partially made of wood, plywood or other wood products such as Masonite, or when the specimens are surrounded by, or in contact with, various other kinds of materials that are cellulose-based and can turn water vapor acidic.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> {{that are}} entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl {{groups in the}} wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E

25|$|The pre-Columbian {{galleries}} were redesigned by Jorge Pardo, a Los Angeles {{artist who}} works in sculpture, design, and architecture. Pardo's <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> are built from thick, stacked sheets of medium-density fiberboard (MDF), with spacing of equal thickness in between the 70-plus layers. The laser-cut organic forms undulate and swell out from the walls, sharply contrasting to the rectangular <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> found in most art museums.|$|E

25|$|The Longyear Museum {{exhibition}} gallery is {{centrally located}} in Alumni Hall on campus. The museum has approximately 20,000 archaeological artifacts from North, Central, and South America {{as well as}} artworks from Africa, Native North America, Asia, and Oceania.

25|$|As {{the number}} of shops grew, they {{underwent}} a transformation. The trappings of a modern shop, which had been entirely absent from the sixteenth and early seventeenth century store, gradually made way for store interiors that are more familiar to modern shops. Prior to the eighteenth century, there were no counters, <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> chairs, mirrors, changing-rooms, etc. However, the opportunity for the customer to browse merchandise, touch and feel products began to be available, with retail innovations from the late 17th and early 18th centuries.|$|E
25|$|The Cenotaph Hall is {{decorated}} with the flags of the different Voortrekker Republics and contains wall tapestries depicting the Voortrekkers {{as well as several}} <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> with artefacts from the Great Trek. Against the northern wall of the hall is a niche with a lantern in which a flame has been kept burning ever since 1938. It was in that year that the Symbolic Ox Wagon Trek, which started in Cape Town and ended at Monument Hill where the Monument's foundation stone was laid, took place.|$|E

25|$|The Sanford Hall of North American birds is a one-story hall {{located on}} the third floor of the museum, above the Hall of African Peoples and between the Hall of Primates and Akeley Hall’s second level. Its 25 dioramas depict birds from across North America in their native habitats. Opening in 1909, the dioramas in Sanford Hall were the first to be {{exhibited}} in the museum and are, at present, the oldest still on display. At the far end of the hall are two large murals by renowned ornithologist and artist, Louis Agassiz Fuertes. In addition to the species listed below, the hall also has <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> devoted to large collections of warblers, owls, and raptors.|$|E
25|$|Items {{obtained}} by the museum initially were received, conserved, and stored at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland. Dozens of permanent curatorial staff and temporary contractors accessed the items, repaired them, and conserved them in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment. Renée Anderson, the NMAAHC's head of collections, oversaw the effort. After artifacts were selected for display, graphics and labels for each item were manufactured. <b>Display</b> <b>cases</b> for each item were also purchased, and exhibiting mounts or specially designed cases handcrafted for particularly fragile, important, or unusually sized objects. Museum officials said all artifacts and displays will be moved into the new museum {{in the summer of}} 2016, along with the museum's 175 full-time employees.|$|E
25|$|Human {{interaction}} with objects {{poses a threat}} of accidental contamination. Moisture and oils from human skin can cause staining of organic materials and corrosion of metals. This risk can be mitigated through implemented handling protocols such as washing hands and wearing protective gloves to minimize direct contact. Objects may also be enclosed in protective casing to further reduce direct handling when possible. Proper storage techniques, {{such as the use}} of neutral tissue or untreated cotton packed in polyethylene sheeting or acid-free corrugated cardboard, may be used to individually wrap pieces to prevent accidental contamination of objects between handling and display. Storage and <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> should be carefully evaluated for off-gassing risks, and following storage procedures such as those outlined above will all reduce the risk of contaminant damage to objects.|$|E

25|$|The {{school has}} a {{successful}} debate team, having won the inaugural AA State Championship in 2004, coming within two points of the title in 2005 (losing to cross-town rival Stone Bridge), and winning its tenth Group AA debate title since 1991 at the 2006 Virginia High School League (VHSL) Debate Tournament. More recently, in 2009 the debate team took the state title for the 12th time in 19 years. Prior to 2004, team championships were not awarded in debate at the state level, though Broad Run regularly filled the ranks of individual champions: from 2000 to 2006 Broad Run had 20 individual VHSL champions. Three <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> around the school are dedicated solely to trophies won by the debate team (see image). The debate team is the only Broad Run team to consistently send members to national tournaments across the United States.|$|E
25|$|When {{planning}} {{these new}} facilities, Metcalf {{was concerned about}} the security of the collection – damage to manuscripts and books from variations in heat and humidity, or worst of all, damage from a flood. In the case of Houghton, the building that was to house the rare collections at Harvard, many features were designed into the air conditioning and plumbing systems that were meant to mitigate the risk of damage. Catch basins were installed under any pipe running horizontally to catch and divert any water from leaks. The plumbing system itself was designed so that the location of leaks could be found quickly through a series of shut-off valves, and the walls were designed with easy access to plumbing. The <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> themselves were designed so that they were well ventilated. This allowed lighting to be installed in the cases (rather than outside) without impacting the temperature and humidity levels. It was features like these that helped keep the collections safe.|$|E
25|$|When {{a new set}} {{of county}} commissioners decided to remove the <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> the local American Legion post then {{displayed}} Brostrom's Medal of Honor. In time, local veterans dwindled and the Legion Hall was taken over by the County. The last commander of the Preston American Legion Chapter in Preston then took Brostrom's display home for safe keeping. By this time, all of Brostrom's family had died except for a niece, who did not want the Medal of Honor display, citing that she {{would not be able to}} preserve it properly. A local lawyer, Jay MacKenzie, was asked to keep the display safe in his office. The medal sat there until a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel, Sherman L. Fleek, who was then the command historian for the United States Military Academy at West Point and doing research on Pfc. Brostrom's life, called MacKenzie. This eventually led to a discussion of how to properly honor Brostrom and display his Medal of Honor. Since Brostrom had been a lifetime member of the LDS Church, the Church History Library was contacted and agreed to preserve and display the medal there.|$|E
