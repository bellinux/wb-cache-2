40|$|The use of beam {{data for}} open photon fields when calculating absorbed dose {{distributions}} for beams with wedge filters has been studied. The depth doses for beams with wedge filters are changed through beam hardening and the <b>dose</b> <b>maximum</b> can be shifted; both these changes result in {{errors in the}} final dose calculations of several per cent if open beam data are used. The errors are larger for 6 MV than for 18 MV x-rays. The depth of measurement for determining the wedge factor {{and the influence of}} other beam modifying devices are discussed. It is recommended that the reference depth be used instead of the <b>dose</b> <b>maximum</b> for these kinds of measurements since the influence of contaminating electrons in the beam will then be avoided and the wedge factor will be correct at a clinically relevant depth...|$|E

40|$|Radiosurgery is {{characterized}} by high radiation doses, delivered via small diameter radiation beams in a single session, placing stringent requirements on the numerical and spatial accuracy of dose delivery to the target volume within the brain. In this thesis, physical and clinical aspects of radiosurgery are discussed, including a method {{for the production of}} cylindrical dose distributions with rectangular beams using cylindrical dynamic rotation. The measurements of radiosurgical x-ray beam parameters are presented. Monte Carlo simulations determine that a measured increase depth of <b>dose</b> <b>maximum</b> with increasing field size is a result of primary dose deposition in phantom for small diameter beams. An analytical representation based on a curve-fitting process is developed to parametrize radiosurgical x-ray beam percentage depth doses as a function of depth in phantom, field diameter and beam energy using bi-exponential and polynomial functions. Measurements of dose in the build-up region of x-ray beams ranging from 1 x 1 cm$ sp 2 $ to 30 x 30 cm$ sp 2 $ show that the depth of <b>dose</b> <b>maximum</b> increases rapidly with increasing field size at small fields, reaches a maximum around 5 x 5 cm$ sp 2 $ and then gradually decreases with increasing field size for large fields.

30|$|The weight-based mean dose (WMD) of {{vasopressor}} {{was strongly}} associated with mortality with a cutoff of 0.75  µg/kg/min, {{to a greater extent}} than the weight-based maximum dose (WMax) with a cutoff of 2.30  µg/kg/min. The calculation of the WMD integrates each variation of vasopressor dose. Thus, WMD reflects the temporal evolution of hemodynamic status and is consequently a better prognostic factor than WMax. Accordingly, Kastrup et al. [22] found a significant difference between survivors and non-survivors for WMD although the authors did not assess the latter as a prognostic factor. Nonetheless, the performance of the various studied parameters (mean <b>dose,</b> <b>maximum</b> dose and cumulative dose) has been found to be systematically better when they are weight-based [26].|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} PACS for {{radiation}} therapy has become the norm in hospital environment and has suggested for collecting data and management from different TPSs with DICOM objects. However, some TPS does not provide the DVH exportation with text or other format. In addition, plan review systems for various TPSs often allow DVH recalculation with different algorithms. These algorithms result in the inevitable discrepancy between the values obtained with the recalculation and those obtained with TPS itself. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a simple method for generating reproducible DVH values obtained from the TPSs. Treatment planning information including structures and delivered dose was exported by the DICOM format from planning systems. The supersampling and trilinear interpolation methods were employed to calculate DVH data from 35 treatment plans. The discrepancies between DVHs extracted from each TPS and the proposed calculation method were evaluated with respect to the supersampling ratio. The volume, minimum <b>dose,</b> <b>maximum</b> dose, and mean dose were compared. The variation of DVHs from multiple TPSs was compared with a commercially available treatment planning comparison tool. The overall comparisons of the volume, minimum <b>dose,</b> <b>maximum</b> dose, and mean dose showed that the proposed method generated relatively smaller discrepancies compared with TPS than those by MIM software and TPS. As the structure volume decreased, the overall percent difference increased. Most large difference was observed in the small organs such as eye ball, lens, optic nerve which had below 10 cc volume. A simple and useful technique was developed to generate DVH with acceptable error from a proprietary TPS.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop, {{implement}} and evaluate an independent system with which to calculate the absorbed dose, delivered by high-energy X-ray beams, to the prescription point {{and the depth of}} <b>dose</b> <b>maximum.</b> The introduction of such a system in the clinical routine may help ensure high-quality treatment and avoidance of errors which may jeopardise the clinical outcome of the treatment (i. e. under- or overdose). A set of equations for calculating the absorbed dose to the prescription point was compiled in a software application (“HandCalc”), which is completely independent of the treatment planning system (TPS). For instance, HandCalc includes models to calculate the absorbed dose from photons scattered in the patient, the transmission of the primary kerma in the patient, the variation of the primary kerma in air with collimator setting (i. e. head scatter), and corrections for heterogeneities in the patient. A new expression for the transmission of the primary kerma in the patient was derived in which the coefficients are strictly defined (and given a physical interpretation) by the first two moments of the spectral distribution of the incident beam. Further investigations also revealed that these moments can be used to determine water-to-air stopping power ratios more accurately than other beam quality indices. In practice, the moments are derived from “in-air equivalent”, narrow-beam measurements using a mini-phantom. The degree of in-air equivalence was investigated with Monte Carlo simulations, which showed that the optimum measurement depth in a mini-phantom is somewhat below the depth of <b>dose</b> <b>maximum.</b> Based upon comparisons with measurements and the TPS, a clinical action level of +/- 4 % was chosen for HandCalc. Deviations greater than this are, with all probability, due to erroneous handling of the patient dataset during the preparation phase. An “entrance dose factor” was added in order to correct the dose calculations at the depth of <b>dose</b> <b>maximum</b> where electron equilibrium has not been established. The entrance dose factor was found to vary with beam quality and collimator setting, while no variation was detected with the presence of an acrylic tray (for block support) or with the source-surface distance (SSD). HandCalc was implemented in a hand-held PC which makes dose calculations inside the treatment room at the time of administration of the first fraction possible. An important feature of HandCalc is the built-in report function, which logs results from the calculation for later evaluation. In a study including 700 patients, deviations greater than the action level were found to be due either to limitations in HandCalc or to a systematic deviation between the planned and measured SSD. HandCalc {{has proven to be a}} fast and accurate tool for independent dose calculations inside the treatment room and it requires only a limited amount of extra time for the user to perform the calculations. Thus, it can easily be incorporated as part of the daily clinical quality control programme in order to prevent errors which may jeopardise the clinical outcome of the treatment...|$|E
