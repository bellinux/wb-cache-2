5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess {{were the}} missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, {{and their ability}} to play defense was secondary.|$|E
5|$|After Union Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant {{captured}} Fort Henry on the Tennessee River in February 1862, {{he turned}} <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> nearby Fort Donelson on the Cumberland.

5|$|Nikolai Volkoff competed at Survivor Series 1990 in a {{match that}} pitted {{him and his}} {{partners}} against Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express.

He set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> higher office, believing he could be elected president in 1896 even though he remained a relatively minor figure in the Democratic Party. In anticipation of a presidential campaign, {{he spent much of}} 1895 and early 1896 making speeches across the United States; his compelling oratory increased his popularity in his party.|$|E
5|$|Christian's old WWE {{enforcer}} Tyson Tomko (now going {{simply by}} Tomko) made his TNA debut on the November 23, 2006 episode of Impact! helping Cage in a match against Sting.

50|$|Horn {{was born}} in Orlando, Florida {{and grew up in}} Tarpon Springs, Florida, {{although}} he spent a good amount of his life in Orlando, Florida. He began piano lessons at the age of 7 thanks to his Grandmother's urging. While in middle school he joined the local theatre and performed in many plays. By this point he was a pretty accomplished pianist and turned <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> <b>on</b> combining <b>his</b> loves of theatre and music: directing musicals.|$|R
5|$|Despite these reverses, {{in early}} 1261, Emperor Michael VIII set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> {{capturing}} the great prize: Constantinople, {{the capital of}} the Byzantine Empire, which had been the seat of the Latin Empire since its capture by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. To this end, Michael concluded an alliance with Genoa in March, and in July 1261, as the one-year truce concluded after the previous failed Nicaean attack was nearing its end, Strategopoulos, recently released from Epirote custody, was sent with a small advance force of 800 soldiers (most of them Cumans) to keep a watch on the Bulgarians and spy out the defences of the Latins.|$|E
5|$|He {{attended}} New York's School of Industrial Art {{where he}} studied painting and music and would later appreciate their emphasis on proper technique. But he dropped out at age 16 to help support his family. He worked as a copy boy and runner for the Associated Press in Manhattan and in several other low-skilled, low-paying jobs. However, he mostly set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> a professional singing career, returning to performing as a singing waiter, playing and winning amateur nights all around the city, and having a successful engagement at a Paramus, New Jersey, nightclub.|$|E
5|$|Owen Hart's victory {{intensified}} his {{feud with}} his brother Bret. Having defeated him at WrestleMania X and replicated Bret's victory in the 1993 King of the Ring tournament, Owen set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> Bret's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The two met at SummerSlam 1994 in a Steel Cage match for the title. Jim Neidhart was in the audience to support Owen. Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers, got involved with the feud by siding with Bret after Neidhart attacked Smith after the cage match.|$|E

5|$|Relations between Parthia and Greco-Bactria {{deteriorated}} {{after the}} death of Diodotus II, when Mithridates' forces captured two eparchies of the latter kingdom, then under Eucratides I (r. c.170–145BC). Turning <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> the Seleucid realm, Mithridates invaded Media and occupied Ecbatana in 148 or 147BC; the region had been destabilized by a recent Seleucid suppression of a rebellion there led by Timarchus. This victory was followed by the Parthian conquest of Babylonia in Mesopotamia, where Mithridates had coins minted at Seleucia in 141BC and held an official investiture ceremony. While Mithridates retired to Hyrcania, his forces subdued the kingdoms of Elymais and Characene and occupied Susa. By this time, Parthian authority extended as far east as the Indus River.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, {{he began}} {{by focusing on the}} 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships, and he won the 60m at the UK trials in 6.50seconds (a time only he had bettered in the previous two seasons). His closest competitor, Ivory Williams, received a ban for marijuana usage, leaving Chambers as a strong favourite. He was the fastest in all rounds of World 60m competition and surged ahead of Mike Rodgers in the final to win his first world title with a time of 6.48seconds. Banned from the 2010 Commonwealth Games, he set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> making the team for the 2010 European Athletics Championships.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach {{had already}} set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> {{defensive}} rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, {{who would go}} on {{to become one of the}} greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing that defense was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
5|$|At 80years of age, Buckner memorized five of Shakespeare's plays because {{cataracts}} {{threatened to}} blind him, but an operation saved <b>his</b> <b>sight.</b> <b>On</b> {{a visit to}} the White House in 1904, Buckner asked President Theodore Roosevelt to appoint his only son as a cadet at West Point, and Roosevelt quickly agreed. His son would later serve in the U.S. Army and be killed at the Battle of Okinawa, making him the highest-ranking American to have been killed by enemy fire during World War II.|$|R
5000|$|Jovito Salonga {{was among}} those most seriously injured. The blast left him blind in one eye and deaf in one ear. Small pieces of {{shrapnel}} are still lodged in his body. Councilor Ambrosio [...] "King" [...] Lorenzo, Jr. {{was in a coma}} for two (2) weeks. He lost <b>his</b> <b>sight</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> left eye and his hearing on the same side. Ramon Bagatsing, the Liberal Party mayoralty candidate for Manila, lost his left leg and suffered a crushed right cheek bone and a shattered right arm.|$|R
60|$|The {{street was}} a sharp descent and was crooked too, and the man (who {{although}} not drunk had the air of being flushed with some strong drink) went down it so fast that Clennam lost him {{as he looked at}} him. With no defined intention of following him, but with an impulse to keep the figure in view a little longer, Clennam quickened his pace to pass the twist in the street which hid him from <b>his</b> <b>sight.</b> <b>On</b> turning it, he saw the man no more.|$|R
5|$|By summer 821, Thomas had {{consolidated}} {{his position}} in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full legitimacy to an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built siege machines. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the Cibyrrhaeot and Aegean Sea naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of Hellas. Thomas recalled Gregory Pterotos, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of Skyros, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to Thomas had finished assembling at Lesbos, and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards Abydos, where he intended to cross over into Europe.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{reclaiming}} the Drivers' Championship lead at {{the preceding}} Singapore Grand Prix, Hamilton {{said that he}} was not relieved because of the closeness of the race. He said that he would take Rosberg's race-by-race approach and was happy to be performing well. Hamilton, who had yet to win the Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, set <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> a victory at the circuit. Red Bull team principal Christian Horner said that the championship was out of their reach, although he hoped further reliability problems with the Mercedes cars would prolong the battle. Horner ruled out team orders favouring one driver over the other. Rosberg said he was looking forward to the race, and his car's speed gave him hope for a good result.|$|E
5|$|In August 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany {{signed the}} Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, in which Eastern European {{countries}} {{were divided into}} spheres of interest; Finland belonged to the Soviet sphere of interest. In October 1939, Stalin gained control of the Baltic states and turned <b>his</b> <b>sights</b> <b>on</b> Finland, confident that control could be gained without great effort. The Soviet Union demanded territories on the Karelian Isthmus, the islands of the Gulf of Finland and a military base near the Finnish capital Helsinki, similar to the demands presented in the previous years. The Finns again refused, and the Red Army attacked on 30 November 1939. Simultaneously, Stalin set up a puppet government for the Finnish Democratic Republic, headed by the Finnish communist Otto Wille Kuusinen.|$|E

The series follows his expansionist plans and attempts by the Starjammers, Havok, Rachel Summers, Lilandra Neramani, Korvus and others to stop him. Failing in their attempts, they flee to enlist the aid of the Kree. The events narrated in the comic book served as a lead to War of Kings, in March 2009.|$|R
