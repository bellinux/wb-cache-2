50|$|Flake McFlurry {{raspberry}} - a McFlurry with crushed bits of <b>flake,</b> <b>chocolate</b> and raspberry juice. Limited edition {{run along}} with original flake McFlurry.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Flake</b> <b>chocolate</b> bar {{manufactured}} {{and marketed}} by Cadburys itself was first {{developed in the}} UK in 1920. An employee of Cadbury's noted that when the excess from the moulds used to create other chocolate bars was drained off, it fell off in a stream and created folded chocolate with flaking properties. [...] In 1930, Cadbury started producing a smaller version of the standard Flake bar especially for ice cream cones. These were marketed under the name 99 Flake and sold loose in boxes rather than individually wrapped like the traditional Flake.|$|E

5000|$|Soft whip is {{the term}} used in Ireland. When served in a cone with a <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake</b> it is {{commonly}} referred to as a 99.|$|R
50|$|Launched in August 2000, {{it was a}} crumbly <b>flaked</b> white <b>chocolate</b> inside {{covered in}} smooth milk chocolate. Weighing {{approximately}} 32 g, producing a small bite size bars, it was produced and sold in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In 2003 the <b>chocolate</b> was renamed <b>Flake</b> Snow and was discontinued in 2008. It was subsequently launched {{for the first time}} in Australia in 2015.|$|R
5000|$|Mr Whippy is {{the term}} used for soft-serve in the United Kingdom, or a 99 if a <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake</b> is added (99 Flake), {{especially}} when sold from an ice cream van.|$|R
50|$|Flake Mint - flake {{which has}} a pale green mint-flavoured centre. In South Africa it is a mint-flavoured milk <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake</b> with no colouring. Flake Mint was {{introduced}} in Australia in late 2016 as a Special Edition flavor.|$|R
5000|$|Gelato: an Italian {{variant of}} ice-cream, flavored with fresh fruit purees, cocoa or nut pastes. If other {{ingredients}} such as <b>chocolate</b> <b>flakes,</b> nuts, small confections, cookies, or biscuits are added, they are added after the gelato is frozen. Gelato made with fresh fruit sugar, water, and without dairy ingredients {{is known as}} sorbet. Brought by the Italian immigrants.|$|R
50|$|Asbach Uralt {{brandy and}} sugar cubes {{are added to}} a cup. In Rüdesheim, a cup that is {{specially}} designed for this beverage is used. The brandy is flambéed and stirred for a minute until the sugar dissolves. Strong coffee is added, followed by a topping of thickly whipped cream sweetened with vanilla sugar. <b>Chocolate</b> <b>flakes</b> are scattered onto the cream as a garnish.|$|R
5000|$|A steamer or babyccino is a {{drink of}} frothed milk without coffee (hence no caffeine), which is {{available}} in some coffeehouses. In North America it often has flavored syrup added, while in Commonwealth countries outside North America it is primarily marketed to children as a coffee-free cappuccino, as the name indicates, and is sometimes topped with marshmallows, a <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake,</b> or sprinkles.|$|R
50|$|Most {{ice cream}} vans tend to sell both pre-manufactured ice pops in wrappers, and soft serve ice cream from a machine, {{served in a}} cone, and often with a <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake</b> (in Britain) or a sugary syrup {{flavoured}} with, for example, strawberry. Soft serve ice cream is served topped with sprinkles for a slight extra charge. While franchises or chains are rare within the ice cream truck community (most trucks are independently owned/run), some do exist.|$|R
5000|$|In Slovenia, iced {{coffee is}} called [...] "ledena kava". It is served in coffee shops and {{restaurants}} all across this tiny Alpine state. More popular during the summer than winter time. Ledena kava is composed with double espresso, vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, almond or <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake</b> and waffle. The most popular coffee brand Barcaffè is selling Prestige ice coffee in all supermarkets. Ice coffee is commonly prepared at home during summers and served typically as a desert.|$|R
5000|$|Another possibility, {{is that it}} {{was named}} by Italian ice-cream sellers (many from mountainous areas in the Veneto, Trentino, Bellunese, and Friuli) in honour of the final wave of conscripts from the First World War, born in 1899 and {{referred}} to as [...] "i Ragazzi del 99" [...] - the Boys of '99. They were held in such high esteem that some streets in Italy were named in honour of them. The <b>chocolate</b> <b>flake</b> may have reminded them of the Alpine Regiment's hat, with a long dark feather cocked at an angle.|$|R
50|$|For breakfast, the Dutch {{typically}} eat sliced {{bread with}} {{butter or margarine}} and three choices of toppings: dairy products (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, syrup (from sugar beets or fruit), honey, Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or peanut butter. Another type of sweet toppings are the chocolate toppings; the Dutch have chocolate toppings in all variations: hagelslag (chocolate sprinkles), chocoladevlokken (<b>chocolate</b> <b>flakes)</b> (both typically Dutch), and chocoladepasta (chocolate spread). Tea, dripolator coffee, milk, and juice {{are the most popular}} breakfast beverages. Breakfast may also include raisin bread and fried or boiled eggs. On special occasions, such as Easter, Christmas, Mother's Day etc., breakfast is usually the same, but with a wider range of choices (i.e. premium cheeses, special ham, hot buns, croissants etc.).|$|R
40|$|Extraction of DNA {{from the}} sample matrix is a {{critical}} step in the detection of transgenic DNA in food and feed. The extraction efficiency can be affected by several {{factors such as the}} degree of processing of the foodstuffs and the presence of PCR inhibitors in the food sample. The aim of this work was the comparative analysis of the following five commercial DNA extraction and purification methods: Wizard“ Minipreps DNA Purification Resin (Promega), Custom Magnetic DNA Purification Reagents (Promega), Generation TM Capture Column Kit (Gentra Systems), Puregene“ DNA Isolation Kit (Gentra Systems), Gene Elute Plant Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). DNA was isolated from simple (flours), complex (feeds) and processed matrixes (bread, cakes and cookies) containing maize and/or soy among the ingredients. The quality and the concentration of the extracted DNA were determined spectrophotometrically while its suitability to PCR reaction was examined using a PCR system based on the amplification of two endogenous DNA sequences of maize and soy (zein and lectin, respectively). If amplifiable DNA was found, samples were then checked for the presence of the 35 S promoter and of the cryia (Bt 176 maize) and GTS (Roundup Ready soy) genes. As expected, the efficiency of DNA extraction was related to the type of matrix and to extraction method used. When compared for efficiency, the Wizard method showed the best results in terms of recovery and quality of DNA. Furthermore, by introducing some modifications to the standard procedure, the Wizard method allowed the recovery of amplifiable DNA also from highly processed food matrixes such as cookies and cakes. However, when the speed of the methods was compared, the Wizard method and the DNA Elution Kit (Gentra) showed the longest processing times. Finally, from a few processed matrixes (corn <b>flakes</b> and <b>chocolate</b> wafers) {{it was not possible to}} obtain DNA with any of the five tested method...|$|R
40|$|We {{grasp and}} lift objects {{many times a}} day. Most of us perform such a task without any difficulty. However even just {{grasping}} the packet of <b>chocolate</b> <b>flakes</b> {{at the breakfast table}} is in fact a complex task. Our brain has to – among others - coordinate and select multiple muscles, select the appropriate grasping points and guide the movement {{in such a way that}} any unwanted obstacles are avoided. As soon as our arm, hand or fingers do not function properly, it becomes clear that grasping an object is not so simple. Fundamental research on how the human body performs these daily tasks may therefore be important for designing effective diagnostic procedures and rehabilitation therapies. Knowledge on how grasping behaviour is controlled may for instance be useful for designing and optimizing prosthetic arms or hands. Next to the esthetical value of a prosthetic arm, nowadays prosthetic arms are designed to be capable of grasping and manipulating objects in a close to natural manner. To be able to design such prostheses, the knowledge of how humans naturally use their hands is useful. Therefore defining the requirements of a grasping task (difficulty of the movement, selecting the appropriate grasping points) could be helpful. Knowledge of grasping behaviour is not only useful for prosthetics. The reverse is also true. Prosthetic hand design gives us an opportunity for understanding prehension better. Grasping behaviour can be modelled and tested directly on the mechanical hand, showing the results of intervention immediately. In this thesis, we explored what and how healthy humans control when reaching with the hand and grasping with the fingers. We did so by using the model of Smeets and Brenner (1999) ...|$|R
5000|$|Cake {{opens on}} a baker {{cracking}} eggs into {{a mixing bowl}} to the opening strains of [...] "My Favorite Things", performed by Julie Andrews. This begins a montage of shots of white-uniformed cooks moving trolleys of ingredients and performing cake preparation work such as zesting oranges and mechanically mixing cake batter. Several large blocks of madeira cake are taken from the oven, starting a time-lapse sequence of the brick-like cakes being arranged into a pile and being mortared with buttercream icing. After a shot of gloved hands kneading orange sugar paste, a woman pours melted chocolate into a pot of Rice Krispies. The sugar paste is pressed between rollers, and the pot of Rice Krispies emptied into a mould. Layers of Battenberg cake are mortared together with raspberry jam. The Rice Krispies are removed from the moulds and arranged as panels around the madeira structure, creating the rough outline of a car. Jelly mixture is poured into a mould while another cook attaches Fox's Glacier Mints to a fondant base to create a headlamp. Long lines of liquorice are wrapped as belts around pieces of a madeira engine. A tin of golden syrup is poured in place of lubricant. The engine is lowered into {{the front of the}} car while pastry chairs are lowered into the interior. The jelly mould is removed to reveal a brake light, and a tyre made of chocolate fondant is wheeled in and various details such as liquorice windscreen wipers and a front grille made of <b>chocolate</b> <b>Flakes</b> are added to the car. The bonnet is lowered and icing sugar is dusted onto the roof before a fondant Škoda logo is attached to the front. The closing shot is of the team lined up around their creation, which now appears to be a cake replica of a Škoda Fabia, with the tagline [...] "The new Fabia. Full of lovely stuff." [...] across the bottom.|$|R
