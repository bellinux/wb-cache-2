5|$|During Operation Desert Storm, Loring's tankers were {{responsible}} for refueling aircraft transiting the Atlantic. It was also used as a stopover for aircraft travelling to the Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> due to its vital position. The base was also vital because it allowed planes to be maintained, planes which sometimes {{would be unable to}} reach their destination without maintenance. Between 2 August 1990 and 10 May 1991, more than 1,700 aircraft transiting between America and the Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> landed at Loring. These included the C-141 Starlifter, C-5 Galaxy, C-130 Hercules, C-21A, A-4 Skyhawk, A-10 Thunderbolt II, Boeing 707, F-16 Fighting Falcon, F/A-18 Hornet, F-111 Aardvark, P-3 Orion, TR-1A Dragonlady, U-2 Dragonlady, B-52 Stratofortress, KC-10 Extender, KC-135 Stratotanker, E-3A Sentry, EA-6B Mercury, and E-8A Joint Stars aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In {{the buildup}} to the {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, six F-15s and 161 personnel {{were sent to the}} Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>region.</b> The wing also patrolled the skies of the Northeastern United States during this time period. The wing though never deployed for Operation Iraqi Freedom. The wing converted from the F-15A/B to the F-15C/D in 2004. These planes came from Kadena Air Base.|$|E
5|$|More than 330 {{species of}} birds were {{recorded}} in the Bahrain archipelago, 26 species of which breed in the country. Millions of migratory birds pass through the Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> {{in the winter and}} autumn months. One globally endangered species, Chlamydotis undulata, is a regular migrant in the autumn. The many islands and shallow seas of Bahrain are globally important for the breeding of the Socotra cormorant; up to 100,000 pairs of these birds were recorded over the Hawar islands.|$|E

5|$|The Saudi Arabian {{government}} and other <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 survey found that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E
5|$|The weather of Mount Washington is {{notoriously}} erratic. This is {{partly due to}} the convergence of several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from the summit of the mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E
5|$|In Asia, nearly 70% of the {{population}} occurs in India and Pakistan. The combined population of the dromedary and the Bactrian camel decreased by around 21% between 1994 and 2004. The dromedary is sympatric with the Bactrian camel in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and central and southwestern Asia. India has a dromedary population of less than one million, with most (0.67 million) {{in the state of}} Rajasthan. Populations in Pakistan decreased from 1.1 million in 1994 to 0.8 million in 2005 â€“ a 29% decline. According to the FAO, the dromedary population in six countries of the Persian Gulf was nearly 0.67 million in 2003. In the Persian <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> the dromedary is locally classified into breeds including Al-Majahem, Al-Hamrah, Al-Safrah, Al-Zarkah and Al-Shakha, based on coat colour. The UAE has three prominent breeds; Racing camel, Al-Arabiat and Al-Kazmiat.|$|E

5|$|In May 1982, three Phantoms from 29 Squadron were forward {{deployed}} to RAF Wideawake on Ascension Island to provide air {{cover for the}} RAF's operations during the Falklands War, replacing Harriers of 1 Squadron, which were transiting to the war zone. In August 1982, {{following the end of}} the conflict and the reconstruction of the runway, 29 Squadron detached a number of its aircraft to RAF Stanley to provide air defence for the Falkland Islands. Late the following year, 23 Squadron took up the role, remaining stationed there until October 1988, when they were replaced by 1435 Flight. To make up for the loss of an entire squadron from the UK Air Defence Region, the RAF procured 15 second-hand F-4J Phantoms that had previously been used by the US Navy. These aircraft were operated by 74 Squadron from 1984 until 1991, when they were replaced by FGR.2 Phantoms that had been released by other squadrons following their conversion to the Tornado. Initially, it was intended that Phantoms and Tornados serve alongside each other. A total of 152 Tornado F.3s were ordered for the RAF, enough to convert four squadrons of Phantoms and two of Lightnings, but insufficient to completely convert every air defence squadron. Both 23 and 29 Squadrons converted from the Phantom FGR.2 to the Tornado between 1987 and 1988, alongside the conversion of the final two remaining Lightning squadrons. The intention was to retain a pair of UK based Phantom squadrons at RAF Wattisham, alongside a pair of Tornado units at RAF Coningsby to provide air defence cover for the southern half of the UK Air Defence Region. Another two squadrons stationed in Germany would also be retained. The end of the Cold War however led to a more rapid withdrawal of Phantom units than had originally been planned; under the Options for Change defence review the Phantom was to be withdrawn from service, with the two Germany based units disbanded as part of the gradual run down of the RAF's presence, and a {{reduction in the number of}} air defence squadrons leading to the two UK based units being disbanded in late 1992. However, just prior to the final withdrawal of the Phantom, it was recalled operationally as a result of Operation Granby, the UK's participation in the First Gulf War, when a total of six aircraft from 19 and 92 Squadrons were forward {{deployed to}} provide air defence cover at RAF Akrotiri; this was to replace the Tornados that had been originally deployed there on exercise, and were subsequently sent to the <b>Gulf</b> <b>region.</b> Following their final withdrawal from service, with a few exceptions, the bulk of the RAF's FGR.2 fleet was scrapped. Over its service life, 37 FGR.2s were lost to crashes.|$|E

25|$|The {{second wave}} {{may be defined}} as the {{migration}} which took place after the British arrived in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> in 1820. The British conflict with the Al Qasimi family, who held control over the Strait of Hormuz, started with the British refusal to pay toll for British ships passing through the Strait. Conflict broke out and the Qawasim fleet was destroyed. Pax Britannica was applied to the whole region, which included a series of treaties imposed on the region's leaders and which further cemented the position of Great Britain as the dominant power in the region. The British took control over the region and created the structures needed for increased trade. The British interest in the Gulf is often {{explained by the fact that}} Great Britain wanted to protect the sea route to India from rival colonial powers. The East India Company played an important role in this endeavour. Britain made Abu Dhabi a protectorate in 1820 and established control over Aden in 1839. Thereafter Great Britain gained power over Bahrain, Dubai, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. The power of the British in the <b>Gulf</b> <b>region,</b> combined with the structures put in place to promote trade, strengthened the relationship between the <b>Gulf</b> <b>region</b> and India further. This, in turn, advanced migration from India to the Gulf, especially Indian civil servants who would manage the relations between the Gulf and India.|$|E
