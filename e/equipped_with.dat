In December 1971, the squadrons embarked on the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant saw action in the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War. Between 1976–1977, INAS 312 and INAS 315 were commissioned with Super Constellation and Ilyushin Il-38s respectively. In December 1980, another helicopter squadron intended for anti-submarine warfare—INAS 333—was commissioned. It was initially <b>equipped</b> <b>with</b> Ka-25s, and with Ka-28s in late 1980s.

40|$|The Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS) II is {{mandated}} for carriage {{by certain}} fixed-wing aircraft in European airspace. The mandate {{does not extend}} to helicopters. Operational experience and safety studies have demonstrated the benefit to be derived by fixed-wing aircraft that <b>equip</b> <b>with</b> ACAS II but the same benefit would not necessarily be enjoyed by helicopters due to limitations in helicopter performance, and {{the design of the}} hardware and software components of ACAS II. This study has further developed techniques and tools used in previous projects to perform a preliminary safety study of the potential benefits of <b>equipping</b> helicopters <b>with</b> ACAS II. The conclusion is that those helicopters that have the performance to comply with ACAS Resolution Advisories can benefit from a reduction in the risk of mid-air collision by <b>equipping</b> <b>with</b> ACAS, provided that adequate surveillance performance can be demonstrated.
