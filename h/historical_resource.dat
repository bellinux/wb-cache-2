500|$|Designed by noted American {{architect}} G. Albert Lansburgh, the Beaux-Arts structure had six tall {{stained glass}} windows, an [...] "elliptical dome", and an entrance characterized by [...] "graceful Corinthian columns supporting a Greco-Roman portico". Carved into the entablature above the entrance was the Biblical verse [...] "MY HOUSE SHALL BE CALLED A HOUSE OF PRAYER FOR ALL PEOPLE" [...] (...) [...] More modest in size than most Beaux-Arts buildings, it nevertheless had features typical of that style, including its [...] "cross-axial composition". However, it was adorned with [...] "simpler {{materials such as}} pressed brick and carved wood", rather than the usual [...] "florid Classical design elements". Along with the sanctuary, the building included a social hall and classrooms. It is the only example of Lansburgh's work in Oakland, and one of about 150 Oakland buildings given an [...] "A" [...] or [...] "Highest Importance" [...] rating by the Oakland Cultural Heritage Survey, which signifies [...] "outstanding architectural example or extreme historical importance".

[...] The disturbance of wrecks by dredging is also of concern for potential disturbance of human remains and because of damage to an important <b>historical</b> <b>resource.</b> [...] A project undertaken in 2007-2008 by Wessex Archaeology funded under the Aggregates Levy Sustainability Fund managed by English Heritage, looked at the potential of the <b>historical</b> <b>resource</b> of such wrecks and also for issuing guidance to the aggregates industry to manage the impact of finding remains.|$|E

In {{a feature of the}} series in Anime Invasion McCarthy recommends the series as being [...] "the first, the freshest and the funniest" [...] of Takahashi's works and also for the large cast, stories and as a cultural and <b>historical</b> <b>resource.</b> Writing in , Susan J. Napier dedicates several pages to discussion of the series, regarding it as [...] "a pioneering work in the magical girlfriend genre". Napier contrasts the series to Western shows such as Bewitched and I Dream of Jeannie, highlighting their harmonious resolution to the chaos in comparison to Urusei Yatsura's [...] "out of control" [...] ending to each episode. Napier later compares the series to other magical girlfriend series such as Ah! My Goddess and Video Girl Ai. Fred Patten writing in Watching anime, reading manga: 25 years of essays and reviews credits the series with being the first program to inspire translations from fans. Patten later credits the series for introducing the phenomenon of using anime to advertise pop songs, claiming it was a deliberate decision by Kitty Films. Writing further about the series for website Cartoon Research, Patten notes that the series was aimed at adults who could buy their own merchandise, as opposed to being subsidised by toy sales like many other shows at the time. Like Napier, Patten compares the series to Bewitched, but also to Sabrina the Teenage Witch.|$|E
