A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks.

The lack of clear diagnostic criteria and clearly defined standards of diagnostics contributes to applying punitive psychiatry to vigorous and gifted citizens who disagree with authorities. At the same time, most psychiatrists incline to believe that such a misdiagnosis is less dangerous than not <b>diagnosing</b> mental illness.|$|E

This study’s aim was to identify the causes and characteristics of uncoded <b>diagnoses.</b> Methods: Uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> from computerized HICs (outpatient, inpatient, and the diagnosis procedure-combination per-diem payment system [DPC/PDPS]) submitted to the National Health Insurance Organization of Kumamoto Prefecture in May 2010 were analyzed. The text documentation accompanying the uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> was used to classify <b>diagnoses</b> in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases- 10 (ICD- 10). The text documentation was also classified into four categories using the standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses</b> defined in the master files of the computerized HIC system: 1) standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses,</b> 2) standard descriptions with a modifier, 3) non-standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses,</b> and 4) unclassifiable text documentation. Using these classifications, the proportions of uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> by ICD- 10 disease category were calculated. Results: Of the uncoded <b>diagnoses</b> analyzed (n = 363 753), non-standard descriptions of <b>diagnoses</b> for outpatient, inpatient, and DPC/PDPS HICs comprised 12. 1 %, 14. 6 %, and 1. 0 % of uncoded <b>diagnoses,</b> respectively.

40|$|In fault {{detection}} and isolation, diagnostic test results {{are commonly used}} to compute a set of <b>diagnoses,</b> where each diagnosis points at a set of components which might behave abnormally. In distributed systems consisting of multiple control units, the test results in each unit {{can be used to}} compute local <b>diagnoses</b> while all test results in the complete system give the global <b>diagnoses.</b> It is an advantage for both repair and fault-tolerant control to have access to the global <b>diagnoses</b> in each unit since these <b>diagnoses</b> represent all test results in all units. However, when the <b>diagnoses,</b> for example, are to be used to repair a unit, only the components that are used by the unit are of interest. The {{reason for this is that}} it is only these components that could have caused the abnormal behavior. However, the global <b>diagnoses</b> might include components from the complete system and therefore often include components that are superfluous for the unit. Motivated by this observation, a new type of diagnosis is proposed, namely, the condensed diagnosis. Each unit has a unique set of condensed <b>diagnoses</b> which represents the global <b>diagnoses.</b> The benefit of the condensed <b>diagnoses</b> is that they only include components used by the unit while still representing the global <b>diagnoses.</b> The proposed method is applied to an automotive vehicle, and the results from the application study show the benefit of using condensed <b>diagnoses</b> compared to global <b>diagnoses.</b> Funding Agencies|Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research||Scania CV AB|...|$|R
