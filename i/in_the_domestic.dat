5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Chadderton's {{early history}} {{is marked by}} {{its status as a}} manorial township, with its own line of lords and overlords, who {{included}} the Asshetons, Chethams, Radclyffes and Traffords. Chadderton in the Middle Ages was chiefly distinguished by its two mansions, Foxdenton Hall and Chadderton Hall, and by the prestigious families who occupied them. Farming was the main industry of the area, with locals supplementing their incomes by hand-loom woollen weaving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> system.|$|E

5|$|Archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans was a {{guest in}} a Serbian highlander family {{in the region of}} Krivošije, Montenegrin Littoral. Analyzing the practices, he {{concluded}} that the badnjak customs were connected with ancestor worship. The lighting of the log on the ognjište could be seen as a solemn annual rekindling of the sacred hearth fire, regarded as the center of the family life and the seat of the ancestors. The belief that ancestral spirits dwell <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> hearth was attested among Slavic and other peoples. Fire worship in the old Slavic religion was mostly transformed into the cult of domestic fire, and thus joined with ancestor worship. A trace of sacrifice to the fire is the coin thrown into it by the polaznik after the ritual of making sparks fly from the badnjak.|$|E

Babangida started two of his team's opening Champions League games. The European season, however, ended in disappointment as Ajax finished bottom of their group behind Olympiacos, Dinamo Zagreb and Porto. Overall, Babangida appeared in 18 league games for Ajax that season, starting only seven. He didn't feature in the Dutch Cup final where Ajax managed to retain the trophy after beating Fortuna Sittard in the final.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by {{the nape of her neck}} and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E
5|$|Credit Suisse {{developed}} the CreditRisk+ model of risk assessment in loans, which is focused {{exclusively on the}} chance of default based on the exogenous Poisson method. As of 2002 about 20 percent of Credit Suisse's revenue was from its insurance business it gained through the 1997 acquisition of Winterthur. The investment bank's insurance products are primarily popular <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> market and include auto, fire, property, life, disability, pension and retirement products among others. Historically 20–40 percent of the bank's revenue has been from private banking services, one of its higher profit-margin divisions.|$|E
5|$|Despite this {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>domestic</b> manufacturing industry {{there was still}} a significant shortfall in many items. In part this was due to the priority that military consumption and production necessarily had over civilian, however, there was also a considerable scarcity of raw materials and other components required for manufacturing. This was due both to the lack of shipping available from the United Kingdom, as well as the limitations placed upon the flow of such goods from Britain due to their own increased requirements. The result of this was inflationary. Domestic prices went up, while the cost of exports was deliberately kept lower than market value in an effort to prevent further inflationary pressures worldwide. As a result, the cost of living for many average Australians was increased considerably.|$|E
