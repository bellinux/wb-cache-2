5|$|While Burrows' {{offensive}} numbers increased <b>from</b> <b>playing</b> {{on the top}} line, the Sedins' mutually benefitted <b>from</b> <b>playing</b> with him.

Since then, Vigneault had used a variety of wingers, including Markus Naslund, Taylor Pyatt and Steve Bernier, to fill in the unit. In those years, Daniel and Henrik were point-a-game players; with Burrows on their line, they vaulted into top scorers in the league, as Henrik won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading point-getter (Daniel scored at a similar pace, but played less due to an injury).|$|E

5|$|After {{exiting the}} Natives tour, Keogh {{continued}} to play for Otago until 1891, but that year was suspended <b>from</b> <b>playing</b> by the ORFU after admitting to have bet on rugby. The ORFU had launched an inquiry after Keogh's Kaikorai club lost to their rivals Alhambra, and several spectators accused some of Kaikorai's players of betting on their opposition. Keogh retired from rugby following the accusations, and along with several of his teammates was banned <b>from</b> <b>playing.</b> He was eventually reinstated into the game in 1895, but his rugby career was over. Outside of sport, Keogh was a brass moulder, and his later life was characterised by mental illness. He died in Seacliff Lunatic Asylum in 1940, after spending {{much of the last}} 20 years of his life institutionalised there.|$|E

Though he gave up his position after their 2014 FIFA World Cup Qualification campaign, giving way to former u-21s boss Pierangelo Manzaroli.|$|E
5|$|Along with Charles Madigan, Keogh withdrew <b>from</b> <b>playing</b> Manchester on 11 March after {{tour manager}} James Scott refused to lend them money. It is {{unlikely}} that the players, including Keogh, would have had much recourse over disputes with the tour organisers; they would struggle to access the funds to necessary for passage back to New Zealand without them.|$|E
