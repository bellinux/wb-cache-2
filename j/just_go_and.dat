"it [...] was {{the kind}} of movie I would have gone to see when I was a kid" [...] further {{clarifying}} [...] " [...] I feel sorry for all those people that are going through that whole trip of ‘Why would Samuel Jackson do something like this?’ and ‘It’s lowbrow.’ It’s a movie. People go to movies on Saturday {{to get away from the}} war in Iraq and taxes and election news and pedophiles online and <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> have some fun and I like doing movies that are fun.” ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Mike Shinoda {{revealed}} info on {{the album}} in a Billboard magazine story, saying: [...] "I feel like we've been writing a lot. I'd say we've got about half the music done, though I shouldn't say halfway because {{who knows how long}} the next batch of songs will take. But all the material's just kind of coming together, and every week we meet up and assess the situation {{and for the rest of}} the week we <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> work on whatever we find exciting." [...] He also explained the experimentation that the band would be working with, saying, [...] "It's not going to be Hybrid Theory. It's not going to be Minutes to Midnight. And if we do it right, it'll have a cutting edge sound that defines itself as an individual record separate from anything else that's out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Latvian President Andris Bērziņš urged a {{thorough}} and conclusive {{investigation of the}} MH17 disaster to pinpoint the perpetrators responsible for the downed passenger airliner. The president called it [...] "a horrific precedent that madmen could <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> murder so many innocent people". He added [...] "the guilty must be punished {{so that no one}} would ever again feel the itch to play with such heavy sophisticated weapons without considering the consequences" [...] – [...] "let it loose, see where it hits". While Latvian Foreign Affairs Minister Edgars Rinkēvičs has banned three popular Russian musicians - Oleg Gazmanov, Joseph Kobzon and Alla Perfilova from travelling to Latvia for an indefinite period of time. The decision has been made in accordance with the Immigration Law and Rinkēvičs previously announced that he had decided to ban [...] "apologists of Russian imperialism and aggression from attending [...] "high society" [...] events in Latvia". The ministry's press secretary Karlis Eihenbaums told LETA that the minister's decision is connected with the events in Ukraine over the past few days, when a passenger plane crashed in eastern Ukraine resulting in 298 casualties.|$|E

2500|$|Star Wars: The Clone Wars {{was made}} to serve as both a {{stand-alone}} story and a lead-in to the weekly [...] George Lucas had {{the idea for a}} film after viewing some of the completed footage of the early episodes on the big screen. Those first few episodes, originally planned for release on television, were then woven together to form the theatrical release. The story of the kidnapped Hutt was inspired by the Sonny Chiba samurai film titled Shogun’s Shadow. Warner Bros. had tracked the series' development from the beginning, and Lucas decided on a theatrical launch after viewing early footage declaring [...] "This is so beautiful, why don't we <b>just</b> <b>go</b> <b>and</b> use the crew and make a feature?" [...] Lucas described the film was [...] "almost an afterthought." [...] Howard Roffman, president of Lucas Licensing, said of the decision, [...] "Sometimes George works in strange ways." [...] Producer Catherine Winder said the sudden decision added to an already large challenge of establishing a show [...] "of this sophistication and complexity," [...] but she felt it was a good way to start the series, and thought budgetary constraints forced the production team to think outside the box in a positive way.|$|E
2500|$|Fletch {{became a}} cult film. In an {{interview}} for the New York Post, Bergman tried to explain its appeal: [...] "It's so bizarre, but Fletch strikes a chord. There's a group of movies {{like that in the}} '80s, like Caddyshack, too, that captured a certain wise-ass thing." [...] In particular, the film appeals to college students who have asked Chase to talk about it at film classes. The actor has said that the appeal of the character is [...] "the cheekiness of the guy[...] [...] everybody at that age would like to be as quick-witted as Fletch, and as uncaring about what others think." [...] Chase has said that this film is his favorite to date because [...] "it allowed me to be myself. Fletch was the first one with me really winging it. Even though there was a script, the director allowed me to <b>just</b> <b>go,</b> <b>and</b> in many ways, I was directing the comedy." [...] Perhaps the most meaningful praise comes from Mcdonald himself: [...] "I watched it recently, and I think Chevy and Michael Ritchie did a good job with it." [...] The film was voted as the 23rd best film set in Los Angeles in the last 25 years by a group of Los Angeles Times writers and editors with two criteria: [...] "The movie had to communicate some inherent truth about the L.A. experience, and only one film per director was allowed on the list." [...] The 2005 animated feature Hoodwinked depicted the Big Bad Wolf (from Little Red Riding Hood) as a sarcastic investigative reporter in a direct parody of Fletch, right up to the Lakers shirt, disguises, and a version of Fletch's theme playing during his scenes.|$|E

"Trimblett has not behaved well," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Truefitt, slowly, [...] "by no means, but I {{must say}} that he has displayed a certain amount of dash; he didn’t allow anything or anybody to come between him <b>and</b> matrimony.
