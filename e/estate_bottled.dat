25|$|In Spain, wineries are {{commonly}} referred to as bodegas though this term may also refer to a wine cellar or warehouse. For quite some time, the Rioja wine industry has been dominated by local family vineyards and co-operatives that have bought the grapes and make the wine. Some bodegas would buy fermented wine from the co-ops and age the wine to sell under their own label. In recent times there has been more emphasis on securing vineyard land and making <b>estate</b> <b>bottled</b> wines from the bodegas.|$|E
2500|$|The Beaujolais wine {{industry}} {{is dominated by}} the more than 30 négociants who produce nearly 90% of the wine sold outside the Beaujolais region. Many of these négociants are based in Burgundy-such as Maison Louis Jadot ( [...] through Château des Jacques) and Bouchard Père et Fils. One of the most well known Beaujolais producers is the négociants Georges Duboeuf. There are more than 4000 vineyard owners in Beaujolais and the fractional amount that is not sold to négociants are bottled by the nearly 20 village co-operatives with a growing amount being <b>estate</b> <b>bottled.</b> Very little of the <b>estate</b> <b>bottled</b> Beaujolais wines are exported into the United States or United Kingdom though a few exporters specialize in this small niche-the most notable being Kermit Lynch and Alain Jugenet.|$|E
50|$|The château was {{acquired}} by the Marquis de Jouennes in 1932 and in 1934 he decided to begin <b>estate</b> <b>bottling</b> at Château de Chamirey. His son-in-law, Bertrand Devillard, took over the estate after that, and expanded the holdings to their present size.|$|R
25|$|Like most Grand cru {{vineyards}} in Burgundy {{ownership of}} the vines on Corton-Charlemagne is spread out among several growers with some doing <b>estate</b> <b>bottling</b> while other selling their portion of the crop to négociants who combine it with the produce of other parcels to make a single Corton-Charlemagne wine.|$|R

25|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, Chablis {{wine was}} {{produced}} more for the export than the domestic French market, which tended to favor the Côte d'Or Chardonnays. Négociants are not now as influential in the Chablis wine industry, compared with other areas of Burgundy. Trends towards <b>estate</b> <b>bottling</b> and co-operatives have shifted the economics towards the individual growers and producer.

2500|$|Many {{producers}} in Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil own vineyard land in both Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil {{as well as}} the greater Bourgueil region and will often blend to make one Bourgueil AOC bottling. Among the producers who make separate Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil and Bourgueil bottlings are Domaine Yannick Amirault which owns the Les Malgagnes vineyard that contains some of the oldest vines in Saint-Nicolas-de-Bourgueil.

5000|$|Domaine Ponsot's wines were at {{the center}} of a scandal {{involving}} counterfeit bottles. Rudy Kurniawan consigned several vintages of the domaine's wine for auction at the New York auction house of Acker, Merrall & Condit, including Clos St. Denis 1945, 1949, 1959, 1962, 1966 and 1971, and a 1929 Clos de la Roche. However, the domaine did not <b>estate</b> <b>bottle</b> prior to 1934, and only started making a wine from Clos St. Denis in 1982, so according to Laurent Ponsot, those bottles were faked. There were also label and sealing inconsistencies with several lots, according to Laurent. He contacted the auction house, and flew to New York to see for himself that the lots (worth an estimated $603,000 — $ in [...] dollars) were pulled.|$|R

5000|$|Clos Mogador {{produces}} <b>estate</b> <b>bottled</b> wines in Gratallops, Catalonia in the DOQ Priorat. Founded in 1979 by René Barbier III and his wife, Isabelle Meyer, {{the winery}} {{was part of}} a new wave of [...] "Clos" [...] wineries that released their first joint 1989 vintage to great acclaim.

50|$|After fermentation, {{the wine}} {{is placed in}} an aging barrel {{for two to three}} years before it is bottled where it will {{continue}} aging. A Sauterne from a reputable <b>estate</b> can <b>bottle</b> age for over 30 years though they normally hit their peak 10 years after the vintage date.|$|R
50|$|Originally and {{up until}} the mid-20th century, before <b>estate</b> <b>bottling</b> was as {{standard}} as it is today, wines of more ordinary quality auctioned off by the barrel would also appear at these auctions. Today, the auctions are intended for small lot wines not sold through regular channels. Some of these wines are produced in quantities less than 100 litres. In the 2007 auctions, the smallest lot of a young wine corresponded to just 6 bottles (3 full and 6 half bottles) of a 2006 Trockenbeerenauslese, and the largest lot corresponded to 648 bottles of a 2006 Spätlese. The auctions are {{to a large extent}} focused on semi-sweet and sweet Riesling wines, but some dry Riesling wines, Spätburgunder wines and a few other wines are also auctioned, depending on the region.|$|R
25|$|By the mid-20th century, wine {{production}} in the Barolo zone was dominated by large negociants who purchased grapes and wines from across the zone and blended it into a house style. In the 1960s, individual proprietors began <b>estate</b> <b>bottling</b> and producing single vineyard wines from their holdings. By the 1980s, {{a wide range of}} single vineyard bottlings were available, which led to a discussion among the region's producers about the prospect of developing a Cru classification for the area's vineyards. The cataloging of Barolo's vineyards has a long history dating back to the work of Lorenzo Fantini in the late 19th century and Renato Ratti and Luigi Veronelli in the late 20th century, but as of 2009 there is still no official classification within the region. However, in 1980 the region as a whole was elevated to DOCG status. Along with Barbaresco and Brunello di Montalcino, Barolo {{was one of the first}} Italian wine regions to attain this designation.|$|R

50|$|A wine label {{may include}} the producer, the bottler and the merchant's names. The bottler's name {{must always be}} {{included}} in the label. The importer's name must {{be included in the}} label only for countries outside the Common Market. While it is not necessary for a wine to be bottled at its place of origin, it is obligatory for classed growth claret and vintage port to be bottled in Bordeaux and Oporto. Also, bottling of Alsace must be done within the appellation. Thus, it is important to look for terms such as mis en bouteille au château or mis au domaine because they tell you the wine is <b>estate</b> <b>bottled.</b>|$|E
