[...] Numerous promotional materials were released through Xbox Live, and many more via online and television advertising.

500|$|The [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{video was}} a source of {{inspiration}} for Justin Timberlake's music video for his 2006 single, [...] "SexyBack". According to Timberlake, he decided to work with director Michael Haussman on his [...] "SexyBack" [...] video because [...] "Take a Bow" [...] is one of his favorite Madonna videos. He went on to say [...] "Even today, I still remember the visuals, the images, how he captured her. A lot of times, Madonna seems like she's the person in control, and in that video, she seemed vulnerable. It was a cool thing to see." [...] According to director Dave Meyers, the music video for Britney Spears' 2009 single [...] "Radar" [...] is a [...] "tribute" [...] to Madonna's [...] "Take a Bow" [...] video. When speaking of Spears and the [...] "Radar" [...] video, Meyers explained, [...] " [...] {{looking for a way to}} take her into a contemporary, classy environment.

500|$|To prevent similar occurrences {{happening}} in future game telecasts, a special [...] "Heidi phone", a hotline {{connected to a}} different exchange and unaffected by switchboard meltdowns, was installed in BOC. The network quickly changed its procedures to allow games to finish before other programming begins, which is now standard practice. Three weeks after the Heidi Game, NBC aired a special presentation of Pinocchio (a live-action version starring Peter Noone, the lead singer of the rock band Herman's Hermits, in the title role). In the promotional newspaper advertisement for the film, Pinocchio himself assured football fans that they would view the entire game before the film {{and that he would}} sooner cut off his nose than [...] "have them cut off" [...] the action. On December 15, the nationally televised game between the Raiders and the San Diego Chargers ran over its allotted time slot. NBC started The New Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (the usual program airing at 7 p.m. EST) at 7:08 Eastern, and announced that all network programming that evening would be started eight minutes late. [...] "I can't remember when we've <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this before", stated an NBC executive. [...] "It's very unusual." ...|$|E

500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Indestructible" [...] was {{directed}} by Max Vitali and Nils Ljunggren. Vitali had previously worked with Robyn on the music videos for [...] "Hang with Me" [...] and [...] "Dancing on My Own". For the video, Australian artist Lucy McRae, who makes [...] "body architecture", designed a special [...] "tube dress" [...] for Robyn to wear. McRae also designed the outfits Robyn wore on the Body Talk album covers. The dress for the video {{was made up of}} plastic pipes that were periodically filled with colored fluids and wrapped around Robyn's body. Robyn recalled that the machine that kept the liquid flowing was [...] "very complicated". It was powered by drills and required [...] "a whole lot of complex machinery to function". The machine was built by McRae, who had to do it quickly because of the video's budget. McRae said, [...] "Me and the dream team had never <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> this before, the whole project was happening for the first time. The machine was super loud." [...] The shooting stopped four times due to leaks, and the team had to mop and re-set the technology. The shooting took twenty hours, and by 3 a.m. McRae said that Robyn was wrapped [...] "in a kilometre of tubing draped over her head and body". She praised Robyn's stamina throughout the shoot, saying that [...] "there were chaotic moments that could have been potentially disastrous and the entire time Robyn was working with us, smiling, moving when the tubes were stuck and just super happy we were making it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|The role of {{the chief}} witch Muriel, {{described}} by Arterton as [...] "the queen bee of witches", was given to Dutch actress Famke Janssen. Janssen too described the film as [...] "Tarantino-esque", with [...] "a lot of blood, gore and exploding witches." [...] Wirkola {{said he had a}} crush on Janssen since he saw her in GoldenEye as Xenia Onatopp, [...] "an amazing villain," [...] and that in his opinion her being not only a good actress but also a beautiful woman who is [...] "huge" [...] and [...] "menacing somehow" [...] made her [...] "a perfect combination" [...] of [...] "sexy and dangerous". Janssen said that at first the initial appeal was just money, but she quickly took a liking of the script and of Wirkola personally. She also thought the idea of playing an [...] "evil to the core" [...] witch [...] "was appealing and different", saying, [...] "I hadn't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it…A character like a witch feels like you would have so much freedom, because there are no restrictions as to what you can do." [...] Later, however, she was constantly being distracted by the special effects work and felt that she [...] "really understood the character" [...] only {{in one part of the}} film. She found the time-consuming process of applying such makeup (taking three hours to apply and one hour to remove) [...] "very strange" [...] and also felt restricted and afraid of acting over-the-top in her witch role. In the end, she still had [...] "a lot of fun" [...] playing someone who is completely evil, and felt that it was [...] "so empowering" [...] to have [...] "an inner witch to get in touch with once in a while." [...] Janssen said the film might appeal to women and girls, too: [...] "There's a brother and a sister story. And there's a romance in it too - but obviously not with the witch. Nobody falls in love with the witch." ...|$|E

500|$|In June 2008, Spears' manager Larry Rudolph told The Sun that a {{video for}} [...] "Radar" [...] {{directed}} by Spears {{was to be}} shot in Chelsea, London. The concept would have Spears and her friends chasing a man in different clubs. However, this was scrapped along with the single’s release. The music video for [...] "Radar" [...] from Circus was filmed on May 27 and 28, 2009, at the Bacara Resort & Spa located in Santa Barbara, California. It was directed by Dave Meyers, who previously worked with Spears on her music videos for [...] "Lucky", [...] "Boys" [...] and [...] "Outrageous" [...] {{as well as the}} Curious commercials. Meyers claimed the video pays tribute to the music video of Madonna's 1994 single [...] "Take a Bow". He added, [...] " [...] {{looking for a way to}} take her into a contemporary, classy environment. I felt empowered by referencing Madonna's video. Britney hasn't <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that". He had a very clear idea of how he wanted the story line to work: [...] "There is a narrative going on, a romantic triangle on a weekend at this polo mansion," [...] he said. [...] "A soap-opera romance." [...] Meyers commented that working with Spears again was [...] "a great celebration of trusting one another", explaining that both wanted [...] "to do something fresh and new, seeking out an actual different technique and stylistic choices and trying to find a form to celebrate them in." [...] Since the song was not the first single from Circus, Meyers chose to experiment and not have dancing scenes, saying that [...] "the videos are a chance for her to vocalize a sense of herself. The media tends to attack her, so I thought, 'Let's show the classy side of Britney and focus on a classy experience, very European-inspired'. And she's at the point in her career where I think this would be a nice step." [...] After the video was finished, Meyers said he was happy with the lack of dancing scenes, because the cuts and dissolves kept the pace of the song.|$|E
500|$|First Class {{employed}} 1,150 {{visual effects}} shots, which {{was done by}} six companies: Rhythm & Hues was responsible for Emma Frost, Mystique and Angel, as well as set extensions; Cinesite handled Azazel, the visuals for Cerebro and environment effects; Luma Pictures did Banshee, Havok and Darwin; Moving Picture Company did Beast, Riptide, and the scene where Shaw's yacht is destroyed and he escapes in a submarine; Digital Domain created Sebastian Shaw's powers, and Weta Digital {{was responsible for the}} climactic battle in Cuba. The overall coordination was provided by visual effects designer John Dykstra, who said the biggest difficulty was the tight schedule: [...] "It was slightly less than a year and I've never <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> that before (Spider-Man was frequently two years)." [...] British company 4dMax employed special 3D scanners to digitize data of the sets and actors which would be used by the effects companies. This allowed for computer-generated sets such as the mirrored nuclear reactor where Magneto battles Shaw—for which the effects team used the mirror maze fight in Enter the Dragon as a reference—and the domed walls of Cerebro. Digital models of Washington and Moscow were also created based on photographs of the actual cities, with the Russian one in particular having vehicles and military hardware based on videos of a 1962 Red Square, and a digital army doing an actual Soviet-style march. With the exception of scenes featuring the actors on ships (shot on a small bridge set) and the X-Jet (done on a set replicating the front two-thirds of the aircraft, which was mounted atop a roller wheel so it could be spun) the naval battle was entirely digital, featuring a simulated ocean and high resolution 3D models of the X-Jet, Shaw's submarine and 16 warships. The designs were mostly based on real vehicles, with the jet being a modified SR-71 Blackbird, the submarine a combination of various models from the 1940s and 1950s, and replicas of the actual US and USSR fleets in the 1960s — though a few were not in service in 1962. A particular Soviet cruiser was a larger version of the Kresta I and II, leading Weta to dub it the Kresta III. Practical effects were still used whenever possible, such as having on location most of the objects young Erik throws after his mother's death, actors and stuntmen dangled from wires, and real explosions and light effects as reference for Havok's beams.|$|E
2500|$|The digital {{intermediate}} {{was completed}} by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on Gravity, but needed to approach Birdman differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, [...] "we have never <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it before." [...] The color timing {{had to be done}} {{in such a way that}} the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to [...] "do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another." [...] Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, Iñárritu remarked that [...] "everyone was out of their comfort zone", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.|$|E

60|$|It was a boisterous day, half a gale of wind {{against the}} flood tide. Two fellows managed her.

These two youngsters at my request kept her stationary for ten minutes, with a touch of engine and helm now and then, within three feet of a big, ugly mooring buoy over which the water broke and the spray flew in sheets, and which would have holed her if she had bumped against it. But she kept her position, it seemed to me, to an inch, without apparently any trouble to these boys. You could not have done it with oars. And her engine did not take up the space of three men, even on the assumption that you would pack people as tight as sardines in a box.|$|E
60|$|When {{the first}} light of the rising moon touched the sail, {{illuminating}} the boat with pearly radiance, Ruth moved away from him. And, even as she moved, she felt him move away. The impulse to avoid detection was mutual. The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate. She sat apart from him with burning cheeks, while {{the full force of}} it came home to her. She had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers see, nor Olney see. Why had she done it? She had never <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> it in her life, and yet she had been moonlight-sailing with young men before. She had never desired to do anything like it. She was overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood. She stole a glance at Martin, who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack, and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful thing. And he, of all men! Perhaps her mother was right, and she was seeing too much of him. It would never happen again, she resolved, and she would see less of him in the future. She entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were alone together, of lying to him, of mentioning casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up. Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing moon, and she knew he would know it for a lie.|$|E
6000|$|I {{had from}} you some ten days ago a most {{delightful}} letter written {{just after the}} heroic perusal of my interminable novel--which, according to your request, I sent off almost too precipitately to Alice, so that I haven't it here to refer to.

I can only thank you tenderly for seeing so much good in the clumsy thing--as I thanked your Alice, who wrote me a most lovely letter, {{a week or two}} ago. I have no illusions of any kind about the book, and least of all about its circulation and [...] "popularity." [...] From these things I am quite divorced and never was happier than since the dissolution has been consecrated by (what seems to me) the highest authorities.

I shall never make my fortune--nor anything like it; but--I know what I shall do, and it won't be bad.--I am lingering on late in Italy, as you see, so as to keep away from London till August 1st or thereabouts. (I stay in this exquisite spot till that date.) I shall then, returning to my normal occupations, have had the best and clearest and pleasantest holiday of three months, that I have had for many a day. I have been accompanied on this occasion by a literary irresponsibility which has caused me to enjoy Italy perhaps more than ever before;--let alone that I have never before been perched (more than three thousand feet in the air) in so perfect a paradise as this unspeakable Vallombrosa. It is Milton's Vallombrosa, the original of his famous line, the site of the old mountain monastery which he visited and which stands still a few hundred feet below me as I write, [...] "suppressed" [...] and appropriated some time ago by the Italian Government, who have converted it to the State school of [...] "Forestry." [...] This little inn--the Paradisino, as it is called, on a pedestal of rock overhanging the violet abysses like the prow of a ship, is the Hermitage (a very comfortable one) of the old convent. The place is extraordinarily beautiful and [...] "sympathetic," [...] the most romantic mountains and most admirable woods--chestnut and beech and magnificent pine-forests, the densest, coolest shade, the freshest, sweetest air and the most enchanting views. It is full 20 years since I have <b>done</b> <b>anything</b> <b>like</b> so much wandering through dusky woods and lying with a book on warm, breezy hillsides. It has given me a sense of summer which I had lost in so many London Julys; given me almost the summer of one's childhood back again. I shall certainly come back here for other Julys and other Augusts--and I hate to go away now.
