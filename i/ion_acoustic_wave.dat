However, because the waves propagate through positively charged ions, ion acoustic waves can interact with their electromagnetic fields, as well as simple collisions.

They commonly govern the evolution of mass density, for instance due to pressure gradients, on time scales longer than the frequency corresponding to the relevant length scale. Ion acoustic waves can occur in an unmagnetized plasma or in a magnetized plasma parallel to the magnetic field.

The importance of these broadband emissions for transverse ion heating and electron acceleration in the auroral regions is now reasonably well established. However, the exact mechanism(s) for mediating this energy transfer and the wave mode(s) involved are not well known. In this thesis we focus on the identification of broadband waves by different methods. Two wave analysis methods, involving different approximations and assumptions, give consistent results concerning the wave mode identification. We find that much of the broadband emissions can be identified as a mixture of <b>ion</b> <b>acoustic,</b> electrostatic <b>ion</b> cyclotron and, ion Bernstein waves, which all can be described as different parts of the same dispersion surface in the linear theory of waves in homogeneous plasma. A new result is that <b>ion</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>waves</b> occur on auroral magnetic field lines. These are found in relatively small regions interpreted as acceleration regions without cold (tens of eV) electrons.

40|$|The region {{upstream}} of {{a planetary}} bow shock, {{known as the}} foreshock, contains a variety of phenomena. Electrons and ions are reflected and energized at the shock. As these stream back upstream, they generate both VLF and ULF waves. Studies of the terrestrial foreshock have provided most of our understanding of these phenomena. However, comparisons with other planetary foreshocks are beneficial, even though the instrumentation used to provide the data may be less sophisticated than that flown on Earth orbiting spacecraft. In particular, maps of the VLF emissions upstream of the Venus bow shock, using data acquired by the Pioneer Venus Orbiter are particularly illuminating. These maps show that the tangent field line is clearly marked {{by the presence of}} plasma oscillations.
