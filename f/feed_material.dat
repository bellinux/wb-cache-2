5|$|A {{major problem}} was that of loss of <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> and product. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> became {{finished}} product. About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks. The problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons. Extraordinary {{efforts were made to}} recover product, including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them. Despite everything, some 17.4 percent of Alpha product and 5.4 percent of Beta product was lost. Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods. The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the process conditions had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, by compromising CIA methods, Ames {{enabled the}} KGB and its successor, the SVR, to filter <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> to the CIA from 1986 to 1993. In 1987, KGB agent Aleksandr Zhomov offered {{to sell the}} CIA {{intelligence}} on how the Soviets had detected and arrested the CIA's agents. The SE Division accepted Zhomov and assigned him the cryptonym GTPROLOGUE. Zhomov, who was actually a Soviet double agent assigned to protect Ames, furnished fake documents ascribing the CIA's agent losses to superior KGB surveillance and luck. He then told the CIA that he would identify upcoming KGB plants, but only {{on the condition that}} the CIA treat them as genuine, lest the KGB discover the leak and arrest him. The fake agents soon overwhelmed Moscow Station's resources, and Zhomov disappeared in July 1990 after receiving payment from the U.S. The spurious sources and the disinformation they provided reportedly convinced the CIA that the 1985–1986 debacle was an anomaly, thus protecting Ames. Other genuine CIA agents were compromised by the Soviets, who used them to feed false intelligence back to the U.S.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} resolve {{the problem of the}} {{excessive}} growth of phumdis that affects the lake ecosystem and local community, a study sponsored by the IndiaCanada Environment Facility was undertaken by the Tata Energy Research Institute (TERI) to examine efficient ways of converting phumdis into briquettes as fodder and fuel pellets, which could be used to meet both energy demands within the region. Two options for the biomass conversion were studied. The first involved making briquettes of vegetative part of phumdis for use as fodder while the second proposed to pelletise the lower part of phumdis for use as fuel. The study observed that phumdis have nutritional potential as <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> due to its higher crude fibre and crude protein content, but the inorganic content in the root and mat zone was found to be unsuitable for the purpose. The second option of making briquettes from the upper vegetative portion of the phumdis by mixing 12% de-oiled rice bran was found to be feasible for using them as fodder. The lower portion, which was densified to make fuel pellets, was found to be suitable for use as fuel. Such pellets were found to have an average calorific value of 3,400calories per kilogram (14,200kJ/kg) with ash content of 27%. Cost economics were worked out and the study had found it to be “an economically viable and an attractive proposition for the benefit of local population.” The study concluded that extraction of phumdi from the lake could also generate income for the local people who are dependent on the lake for their livelihood. Such a step would protect the lake from the adverse effects of proliferation of phumdis and maintain the ecological balance of the lake, thus converting the waste into wealth. The Planning Commission has also concurred with project proposals to engage interested individuals and private enterprises to begin the commercial venture of manufacturing compost from the phumdis and thus improve the environment of the Keibul Lamjao National Park. The project also envisages removal of 3630 artificial phumdis and compensation to their owners; this is reported to have been implemented.|$|E

The cecum quickly distends due to fluid and gas accumulation, often leading to rupture within 24–48 hours if not corrected. This impaction may be missed since decreased manure production can be attributed secondarily to surgery, and often rupture occurs before severe signs of pain. Horses are most at risk {{for this type of}} impaction if surgery is greater than 1 hour in length, or if inadequate analgesia is provided postoperatively.|$|E

On 5 August 1945, K-25 started producing feed enriched to 23 percent, enough to be fed straight into the Beta racetracks. The remaining Alpha product was then fed into K-25. By September 1945, the calutrons had produced 88 kilograms of product with an average enrichment of 84.5 percent, and the Beta racetracks turned out another 953 kilograms enriched to 95 percent {{by the end of the}} year.

2500|$|There {{are several}} methods for forming {{internal}} cavities in extrusions. One {{way is to}} use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the <b>feed</b> <b>material</b> then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have [...] "legs" [...] that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.|$|E

40|$|Gyvulių sveikatai įtaką daro daugelis veiksnių. Svarbiausi jų – laikymo sąlygos, priežiūra ir pašarai. Priklausomai nuo ūkininkavimo sąlygų, mikromicetai pašaruose produkuoja toksiškus gyvuliams ir žmonėms junginius – mikotoksinus. Jie neigiamai veikia organizmą – hepatotoksiškai, nefrotoksiškai, imunosupresyviai, estrogeniškai, kancerogeniškai. Tai gali sukelti žmonių ir gyvulių mikotoksikozes (Bakutis, 2004). Vis didesnis dėmesys skiriamas mikotoksinų užterštoms pašarinėms žaliavoms. Sandėliuojant pašarus būtina laikytis sanitarinių higieninių reikalavimų, kadangi pašarinėse žaliavose gausu įvairių maisto medžiagų, yra palanki terpė daugintis daugeliui mikroorganizmų. Dėl visuotinio išplitimo mikotoksinai laikomi vienu svarbiausių žmogaus ir gyvulių sveikatos rizikos veiksnių (Bakutis, 2004). Vienintelis patikimas būdas išvengti pašarinių žaliavų užterštumo mikotoksinais – užkirsti kelią mikromicetams daugintis. Šiam tikslui taikomi skirtingi pašarų užsikrėtimo mikromicetais ir užterštumo mikotoksinais kiekio bei toksiškumo nustatymo metodai. Turi būti taikomos ir kompleksinės profilaktikos priemonės: tinkamos žaliavų sandėliavimo sąlygos, fizikiniai bei cheminiai grūdų apdorojimo būdai (konservantai, detoksikuojamieji preparatai) (Bakutis, 2004). Darbo tikslas: Atlikti, 2005 - 2009 metų laikotarpyje, tirtų LSMU VA Gyvūnų gerovės tyrimų laboratorijoje, atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų užterštumą mikotoksinais, analizę. Darbo uždaviniai: 1. Atlikti literatūros šaltinių analizę. 2. Įvertinti atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų užterštumą mikotoksinais (deoksinivalenoliu, zearalenonu, aflatoksinu B 1) 2005 – 2009 metų laikotarpiu. 3. Palyginti skirtingų atvežtinių žaliavų (kukurūzų, sojos rupinių, rapsų išspaudų saulėgrąžų išspaudų,) užterštumą mikotoksinais. 4. Įvertinti atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų pavojingumą gyvūnams. Aim of study: The {{purpose was}} to analyse <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> samples of {{mycotoxin}} concentration, which were researched {{in the period of}} 2005 - 2009 in the Animal Welfare Research Laboratory. Main tasks: 1. To analyze literature sources. 2. To assess mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, aflatoxin B 1) contamination of imported <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> in the period of 2005 – 2009. 3. To compare mycotoxin contamination of different <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> (maize, soybean meal, rapeseed cake, sunflower cake). 4. To assess the risk for animals of imported <b>feed</b> <b>materials.</b> Material and methods: - it was selected 72 samples of <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> i. e. 36 maize samples, 21 soybean meal sample, 6 rapeseed cake samples and 9 sunflower cake samples. - it was analyzed each mycotoxin concentration separately (DON,ZON, AFB 1) in maize, soybean meal, rapeseed cake and sunflower cake. Aflatoxin B 1, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol concentration were assessed with thin-layer chromatography method. Diffusion of mycotoxins in <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> during 2005 – 2009 was determined using statistical analysis methods. Results and discussion: 1. During the investigation period (2005 - 2009) aflatoxin B 1 concentration varied from 0, 0007 to 0, 005 mg/kg in maize, from 0, 001 to 0, 02 mg/kg in soybean meal, from 0, 001 to 0, 0033 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 0013 to 0, 007 mg/kg in sunflower cake. During this period zearalenone concentration varied from 0, 1 to 1, 33 mg/kg in maize, from 0, 17 to 2 mg/kg in soybean meal, from 0, 08 to 1, 2 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 05 to 1, 3 mg/kg in sunflower cake. The minimum concentration of deoxynivalenol was 0, 06 mg/kg, the maximum concentration – 3, 5 mg/kg in maize, minimum – 0, 15 mg/kg and maximum – 1, 2 mg/kg in soybean meal, minimum – 0, 125 mg/kg and maximum – 0, 8 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 3 mg/kg to 0, 9 mg/kg varied in sunflower cake. 2. During the investigation period mycotoxin concentrations were compared in the <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> and assessed, that AFB 1 concentration was decreased 46 per cent in maize, and in sunflower cake – 78 per cent. ZON concentration was decreased 36 per cent in maize, 88 per cent – in soybean meal, 14 per cent increased in sunflower cake. DON was decreased 56 per cent in maize, 54 per cent was increased in soybean meal and 51 per cent in sunflower cake. 3. The most contaminated <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> were maize and sunflower cake. AFB 1 was assessed 0, 02 mg/kg, ZON – 0, 65 mg/kg and DON 1, 15 mg/kg in maize. AFB 1 was 0, 0095 mg/kg, ZON – 1, 1 mg/kg and DON – 0, 5125 mg/kg in sunflower cake. The least contaminated was soybean meal – AFB 1 concentration was 0, 001 mg/kg, ZON – 0, 09 mg/kg and DON – 0, 24 mg/kg. AFB 1 concentration was 95 per cent higher than was in soybean meal, ZON was higher 84 per cent and DON concentration was higher 79 per cent. 4. Assessed mycotoxin concentrations in <b>feed</b> <b>materials</b> don‘t exceed recommended rates, but if these materials will be added to the mixed feed, ZON and DON quantities can be dangerous for the animals health.
