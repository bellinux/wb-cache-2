40|$|Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) {{finds its}} use {{in a wide range}} of {{microfluidic}} applications due to its flexibility and low cost. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) attracts growing interest in microfluidics research community due to its low cost, high transparency, good mechanical and chemical properties. Combining PMMA with PDMS allows a high degree of flexibility in designing microfluidic devices. Bonding of PMMA to PDMS is a critical step for this hybrid approach. We present here a novel technique for bonding PMMA to PDMS. This technique is simple, fast and reliable. A <b>dry</b> <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> was laminated onto the PMMA substrate. A pre-cured PDMS mixture was spin coated onto the adhesive to form a PDMS membrane. The bonding quality and the strength of the PDMS/adhesive membrane was tested using a precision pressure source.

40|$|Functional <b>dry</b> <b>adhesives</b> are <b>dry</b> <b>adhesives</b> {{that rely}} on <b>dry</b> <b>adhesive</b> {{structures}} for adhesion but also include additional functionality that enables adhesion switching or sensing capabilities. This thesis describes the design and testing of functional <b>dry</b> <b>adhesives.</b> Electro-dry-adhesives with flexible electrodes were fabricated. When a high voltage {{was applied to the}} flexible electrodes, fabricated from mixing and curing Carbon Black (CB) and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), an electrostatic field was generated between opposing electrodes and between the Electro-dry-adhesive and the surface it was attached to. The generated electrostatic field resulted in an increased shear adhesion force over the shear adhesion measured without the applied electrostatic field applied as well as the ability to self-preload. Magnetic field switchable <b>dry</b> <b>adhesives</b> were designed with a backing layer composed of iron oxide particles embedded within PDMS. The design of the <b>dry</b> <b>adhesive</b> backing <b>layer</b> allowed increased or decreased measured adhesion forces when the magnetic field was present during only the pull-off portion of the normal dry adhesion test cycle depending on the orientation of the magnetic field. Decreased adhesion was observed when the magnetic field was present during either the entire adhesion test cycle or when the magnetic field was present during only the preload portion of the dry adhesion test cycle regardless of the orientation of the magnetic field. Force and torque sensing <b>dry</b> <b>adhesives</b> were designed and fabricated by molding CB-PDMS. Force sensing was observed when the device was both compressed and extended by measuring a change in the resistance across the device terminals. Torque sensing was observed when the <b>dry</b> <b>adhesive</b> backing <b>layer</b> was twisted again by comparing resistance changes across the device terminals. The design of the force and torque sensing <b>dry</b> <b>adhesives</b> allowed the user to differentiate between forces in compression and extension as well as torques.

40|$|Mechanical Behaviour of <b>Adhesive</b> <b>Layers</b> Methods to Extract Peel and Mixed Mode Properties TOBIAS ANDERSSON Department of Applied Mechanics Chalmers University of Technology ABSTRACT This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with methods to extract material properties of thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> loaded in peel and in mixed mode. The {{first part of the}} thesis is devoted to an experimental method to determine the complete stress-elongation relation (or cohesive law) for an <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> loaded in peel using the DCB-specimen. The method is based on the concept of equilibrium of the energetic forces acting on the specimen. Two sources of energetic forces are identified: the start of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> and the positions of the two acting loads. By use of the concept of equilibrium of energetic forces, it is possible to measure the energy release rate of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> instantaneously during an experiment. The complete stress-elongation relation is found to be the derivative of the energy release rate with respect to the elongation of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> at its start. By this procedure, an effective property of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> is measured. The validity of the approach is investigated by experiments where the adherends deform 1) elastically and 2) plastically. It is found that a unique stress-elongation is obtained when the adherends deform elastically. The same relation cannot be used to predict the experiments where the adherends deform plastically indicating that the approach has limited applicability. 	The second part of the thesis {{is concerned with}} the development of a mesomechanical finite element model of a thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> loaded in mixed mode. The model is calibrated to previously performed experiments. In these, the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> is loaded in monotonically increasing peel or shear. An in situ SEM-study is also performed and used to guide the modelling and calibration. The purpose of the mesomechanical finite element model is to facilitate the development of constitutive laws for <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> The modelling is based on Xu and Needlemans method where all continuum finite-elements are surrounded by interface elements that allow for the development of micro cracks. Thus, this enables the modelling of the entire process of degradation and fracture of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> A genetic algorithm is developed for the calibration. The simulations are shown to be in reasonably good agreement with the experiments.

40|$|Methods {{have been}} {{developed}} for measuring the linear viscoelastic properties of thin <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> and for determining the stress intensity factor characterizing the driving force for adhesive failure. Both methods involve bringing a hemispherical indenter in contact with the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> while simultaneously monitoring the load, displacement, and radius of contact between the indenter and the adhesive. Dynamic moduli for the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> are obtained by oscillating the indenter, and the adhesive properties are obtained by pulling the indenter completely out of contact with the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer.</b> Existing theories of viscoelastic contact mechanics were extended to account {{for the fact that the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> thickness is not substantially larger than the contact radius, as is generally assumed. A variety of correction factors were introduced that depend on the ratio of the contact radius to the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> thickness. These methods were applied to a model adhesive based on an acrylic triblock copolymer. Determination of the time-dependent creep and relaxation functions for this material was simplified by the power-law frequency response of the dynamic moduli.

40|$|ABSTRACT In {{manufacturing}} of multi-material products, a {{joining method}} that {{is able to}} cost-effectively assemble components made of dissimilar and similar material, with irregular geometries, is optimal. As an alternative, adhesive bonding is in-creasingly adapted by the industry, which is also used in manufacturing of multi-phase materials. In practice, adhesives are constrained to thin <b>layers.</b> An <b>adhesive</b> as a constrained layer behaves differently compared to the adhesive as a bulk material. In general, <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers</b> are loaded in peel (mode I), or in shear (mode II or III), or in a combination of peel and shear (mixed mode). This thesis deals with mixed mode loaded <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> from measurement of ma-terial data to analysis of structural behaviour. For studying of structural behaviour of adhesive joints, an integrated approach is developed. Arbitrarily end-loaded single-layer adhesive joints with arbitrary ad-herends of arbitrary length are analysed with the Beam/Adhesive layer (B/A) model. Closed-form solutions are obtained for the <b>adhesive</b> <b>layer</b> {{as well as for}} the adherends. For joints with a semi-infinite symmetric geometry, i. e. relative long joints with identical adherends loaded at one end, basic loading cases are obtained. Solutions to these basic loading cases are easy to use in designing of joints with this type of geometry. For nonlinear or general <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> a mode-dependent cohesive law is de-veloped. The normalized formulation is easy to implement in numerical simula-tions, yet, it captures the characteristics of <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> For experimental studies, this cohesive law is used to obtain the constitutive behaviour of an adhe-sive layer. The results confirm the ability and suitability of this cohesive law in modelling of <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers.</b> To obtain material data of <b>adhesive</b> <b>layers,</b> experimental methods are developed based on the J-integral.
