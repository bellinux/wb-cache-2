5|$|By December, {{there was}} still no word of García de Celís, nor had Spanish {{assistance}} arrived <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> direction, and the Spanish at Buena Esperanza had lost hope. They were pressed on all sides by hostile natives, with resistance led by Sicumba. Cerezeda got word of a plan by Sicumba to assault Buena Esperanza and destroy it. In response he sent parties to seize and execute hostile Indian leaders, thus defusing the imminent threat, although Sicumba managed to escape.|$|E
5|$|Cuba {{has been}} the most {{successful}} team, winning the most gold and silver medals and never finishing outside the podium.

Nine other Cuban players won three medals; no player <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> nation accomplished this feat. From the 25 athletes who won two medals in baseball, 18 were Cuban, while the remaining seven included 4 South Korean and 3 Japanese players.|$|E

His Monitor design employed over forty patented inventions and was completely different <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> naval warship at the time. Because Monitor was an experimental craft, urgently needed, hurriedly constructed and almost immediately put to sea, {{a number of problems}} were discovered during her maiden voyage to Hampton Roads and during the battle there. Yet Monitor was still able to challenge Virginia and prevent her from further destroying the remaining ships in the Union flotilla blockading Hampton Roads.|$|E

The canal company was also authorised to improve the River Tone near Taunton, and to raise £220,000, plus an additional £110,000 if required. Navigation onwards from Taunton was via the River Tone and the River Parrett. Construction did not start immediately.|$|E

5|$|As of {{that time}} and in the {{following}} decades, Western Pomerania, plus some of Greater Poland, Lower Silesia and some areas west of the middle and lower Oder River made up the Sukow-Dziedzice culture group. Its origin {{is the subject of}} debate among archeologists. First settlements appear in the early 6th century and cannot be directly derived <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> Slavic archeological culture. They reveal certain similarities to the artifacts of the Dobrodzień group of the Przeworsk culture. According to scholars such as Siedow, Kurnatowska and Brzostowicz, it might be a direct continuation of the Przeworsk tradition. According to allochthonists, it represents a variant of the Prague culture and is considered its younger stage. The Sukow-Dziedzice group shows significant idiosyncrasies, such as no graves and (typical {{for the rest of the}} Slavic world) rectangular dwellings set partially below the ground level were found within its span.|$|E
5|$|Attached to {{the dome}} is a three-storey {{rectangular}} building which houses the telescope control room, computer room, kitchen etc. Almost no human presence is required inside the dome, {{which means the}} environmental conditions can be kept very stable. As a result, the WHT obtains perfect dome seeing. This building also houses a detector laboratory and a realuminising plant. Because the WHT has the largest single mirror at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, its realuminising plant has a vacuum vessel {{large enough to accommodate}} the mirrors <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> telescope on the mountain. As a result, all of the other telescopes at the observatory contract to use the WHT plant for their realuminising (with the exception of the Gran Telescopio Canarias, which has its own plant).|$|E
5|$|Burnet was, however, {{unable to}} prove this experimentally. Peter Medawar, Rupert E. Billingham and Leslie Brent did find support for Burnet's {{hypothesis}} in 1953 when they showed that splenocytes could be engrafted by intravenous infusion into mice in utero or just after birth and that when these mice matured, they could accept skin and other tissues from the donor but not <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> mouse strain. Burnet and Medawar were co-recipients of the 1960 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for this work, as it provided the experimental basis for inducing immune tolerance, thereby allowing the transplantation of solid organs. Burnet and Medawar were able to coordinate their work effectively despite the rather different personalities and physical separation; Burnet was taciturn whereas Medawar was a young and urbane Englishman, but they greatly respected one another.|$|E

Nash retired from VFL football {{at the end of the}} 1945 season to play and coach in the country before returning to coach South Melbourne in 1953. After retiring, Nash wrote columns for newspapers, was a panellist on football television shows and was a publican before his death in Melbourne, aged 76.|$|E
5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's story, and the player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island, on {{the eastern}} limits of the South Shetland Islands, was remote from {{anywhere}} that the expedition had planned to go, and far beyond normal shipping routes. No relief ship would search for them there, {{and the likelihood of}} rescue <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> outside agency was equally negligible. The island was bleak and inhospitable, and its terrain devoid of vegetation, although it had fresh water, and a relative abundance of seals and penguins to provide food and fuel for immediate survival. The rigours of an Antarctic winter were fast approaching; the narrow shingle beach where they were camped was already being swept by almost continuous gales and blizzards, which destroyed one of the tents in their temporary camp, and knocked others flat. The pressures and hardships of the previous months were beginning to tell on the men, many of whom were in a run-down state both mentally and physically.|$|E

5|$|Heterodontosauridae {{includes}} the genera Abrictosaurus, Lycorhinus, and Heterodontosaurus, all from South Africa. While Richard Thulborn once reassigned all three to Lycorhinus, all other authors consider the three genera distinct. Within the family, Heterodontosaurus and Lycorhinus are considered sister taxa, with Abrictosaurus as a basal member. Geranosaurus {{is also a}} heterodontosaurid, but is usually considered a nomen dubium because the type specimen is missing all its teeth, making it indistinguishable <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> genus in the family. More recently, the genus Echinodon has been considered a heterodontosaurid in several studies. Lanasaurus was named for an upper jaw in 1975, but more recent discoveries have shown that it belongs to Lycorhinus instead, making Lanasaurus a junior synonym of that genus. Dianchungosaurus was once considered a heterodontosaurid from Asia, but it has since been shown that the remains were a chimera of prosauropod and mesoeucrocodylian remains. José Bonaparte also classified the South American Pisanosaurus as a heterodontosaurid at one time, but this animal is now {{known to be a}} more basal ornithischian.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{the group}} moved to WMQM's Millington-based sister station, AM1380 WLRM, and {{switched}} to a nightly schedule, Monday through Friday. Farley left the program in November of that year. Two years later, Geoff Melton, a former co-host, joined to help set up the show's website and the show entered syndication with Dixie Broadcasting Radio Network. The program went on hiatus on February 15, 2008, because staff members said they needed a break, but returned to the airwaves in June 2008 on WLRM on Saturday nights. One year later, it switched from Republic Broadcasting Network to Liberty News Radio Network. As of August 2009, Bonds and Melton are no longer affiliated with the program. Frith now lives in Nashville, Michigan, but remains {{a part of the}} show's staff. Since WLRM is not audited by Arbitron, the show's ratings are unknown. The show is listener-supported and, according to Edwards, receives more donations from Florida than <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> state.|$|E
5|$|The film's idea {{originated}} in the late 1990s in screenwriter K. V. Vijayendra Prasad mind. At that time, he was joking about a housefly seeking revenge on a human {{in a conversation with}} his son S. S. Rajamouli. Prasad later developed the idea as a script for an English-language film set in 1830s America, in which an African-American boy dies in an attempt to free his family from slavery and is reincarnated as a fly. After completing Maryada Ramanna (2010), Rajamouli reconsidered the concept after thinking of directing a film that was distinct <b>from</b> <b>any</b> <b>other.</b> He decided to make Eega a bilingual film in Telugu and Tamil– each scene including speech was filmed twice, once for each language. The Tamil version, titled Naan Ee, was Rajamouli's directorial debut in Tamil cinema. The film was presented by Daggubati Suresh Babu of Suresh Productions.|$|E
