40|$|A {{microphone}} array {{was designed and}} tested {{for the purpose of}} measuring the noise radiated by a moving acoustic source. Beamforming is used to enhance the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR), with interfering sources moving at the same speed and along the same straight path as the measured source. A method is described for calculating moving source beampatterns that illustrates the SNR enhancement. The beamforming algorithm includes a de-Dopplerisation process to correct for the Doppler shift that occurs in the signals received at the array. This process leads to SNR enhancements that differ depending on whether the <b>interfering</b> <b>source</b> leads or lags the measured source when passing the array. The de-Dopplerisation process also causes grating lobes associated with spatial aliasing to move to lower frequencies when the <b>interfering</b> <b>source</b> leads the measured source. The described effects of the de-Dopplerisation process become more pronounced at higher speeds and when the interfering sources are farther away from the measured source. Hence, when designing a {{microphone array}}, it is important to conduct simulations that involve the use of a moving, rather than stationary, acoustic source, especially when the source moves at high speed. The modelling method presented in this paper was used to design an array which was tested in an anechoic chamber. The measured beampatterns for a stationary source are presented.

30|$|The {{conventional}} noise {{estimation methods}} other than BM-based approaches are mostly based on source activity estimation [43] or minimum statistic noise power estimation [44, 45]. For those approaches, {{it is usually}} assumed that the sources are statistically independent and the noise is more stationary than the target signal. The recently well-studied model-based NMF approaches [5 – 7] can be used directly for noise reduction [46, 47] or for noise estimation [48]. Those methods usually rely on the prior knowledge of the noise type (point source or diffuse noise) to define the model parameters. Therefore, they can only be as efficient as the models match the current scenario and are prone to fail if the model assumptions do not hold or the parameters could not be properly learned. The latter is especially crucial for online algorithms in time-varying scenarios. On the other hand, Directional BSS will fail if the <b>interfering</b> <b>source</b> arrives from {{the same direction as}} the target source, as then Directional BSS is not able to provide an estimate for the <b>interfering</b> <b>source.</b> Compared to these alternative approaches, the main advantage of the proposed approach is that no target source activity estimation or prior knowledge on the source characteristics is necessary and no model needs to be matched, but only a coarse DoA estimation is required.|$|E
40|$|Extended Symbol OFDM (ES-OFDM) {{is applied}} {{in case of}} a {{multiple}} antenna receiver. The receiver architecture is based on the observation that OFDM constellation points can be determined by means of correlation. Summing correlations between multiple antennas leads to an interferometer receiver. This approach gives the freedom to choose which correlations are summed. Three antenna structures are explored: a Uniform Linear Array (ULA) and a sparse array where all correlations are summed and a sparse array where only a selection of correlations are summed. The sensitivity of the Bit Error Rate (BER) of an ES-OFDM communication link to an <b>interfering</b> <b>source</b> from different directions is studied. The ULA leads to a relatively wide BER main lobe, the range of angles around the Direction of Arrival of the ES-OFDM signal where the BER is high. Outside this range, the <b>interfering</b> <b>source</b> is suppressed to low BERs, in many cases beyond requirements. By using sparse arrays, the width of the BER main lobe can be traded against the BER levels outside the BER main lobe. This effect is shown for a sparse array where all possible correlations are summed. By summing only those correlations that lead to a uniform co-array, BER levels outside the BER main lobe are lower for an interferometer receiver compared to a traditional beamforming receiver...|$|E

The diffuse noise sources will mainly act as a disturbance. Depending on the signal enhancement technique used, they might even be partly removed.

Hence the amount of bias introduced by the <b>interfering</b> <b>sources</b> will largely depend on the interference rejection performance of the BAF. However, like in the unilateral hearing aids, the main source of estimation errors comes from the target source.
