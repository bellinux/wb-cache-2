5|$|American Pharoah {{made his}} track debut in a maiden race over {{six and a}} half furlongs on the Polytrack surface at Del Mar Racetrack on August9. Ridden by Martin Garcia, he started as the 7–5 {{favorite}} against eight opponents. He became unsettled before the race and, after running in second place until the stretch, faded to finish fifth behind Om, Iron Fist, One Lucky Dane, and Calculator, more than nine lengths behind the winner. He ran in a blinker hood, which appeared to unnerve him, as did the commotion in the saddling paddock. Baffert addressed <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> issues by removing the hood and stuffing cotton in the horse's ears for subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble {{endured a}} period where {{he was not able}} to take wickets consistently. With {{selection}} of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the lunch break to revive his spirits. Previously a teetotaler, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.|$|E
5|$|Lamenting at a bar, {{she meets}} Johnnie (Mark Proksch), a former mate at their {{secondary}} school. Johnnie confesses <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> regarding a scheduled interview with Bubblegum {{for a business}} venture. Lumpy advises that he fix his posture as to appear more confident. Johnnie thanks Lumpy for her advice and invites her to his complex. There, the two {{fall in love and}} share good nights. When Johnnie finds Lumpy absent in the morning, he suspects that she has abandoned him. Much to his relief, he finds her waiting for breakfast in his kitchen. When he returns from the interview, he reveals he has been invited to a separate meeting with Bubblegum at her castle. Lumpy asks that she appear with him, but Johnnie says the meeting is private. Supposing Bubblegum has stolen his heart, Lumpy leaves in a fit of rage.|$|E
60|$|ON {{the next}} day Mountjoy heard news of Iris, which was not of a nature to relieve <b>his</b> <b>anxieties.</b> He {{received}} a visit from Fanny Mere.|$|R
60|$|Having so said, the sedate Scot {{dismissed}} <b>his</b> <b>anxieties,</b> {{and thereafter}} appeared {{to regard the}} surrounding chaos of water with no other feelings than philosophic interest and curiosity.|$|R
50|$|Det. McGully, a jokester {{who does}} not take Palace's {{theories}} seriously. He has begun to dress very casually at work and sometimes smokes marijuana to dull <b>his</b> <b>anxieties,</b> especially after he kills J.T. Toussaint.|$|R
25|$|Critics {{have claimed}} that Yuri Katsuki, the title {{character}} in the Japanese anime series Yuri on Ice, is an unreliable narrator due to <b>his</b> <b>anxiety.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{were the}} only attacks south of the Chickahominy River in {{conjunction}} with Gaines's Mill, but they helped to convince McClellan {{that he was being}} subjected to attacks from all directions, increasing <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> and his determination to get his army to safety at the James.|$|E
25|$|Raj also {{seeks to}} date Sheldon's {{attractive}} twin sister, Missy. To do so, he takes an experimental drug to correct <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> disorder. He {{is the only}} one, out of himself, Howard and Leonard, in whom Missy showed any interest, but the medication wears off {{when he tries to}} ask her out.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{agreed with}} Sadie; she often wished Stephen {{would talk to}} her about <b>his</b> <b>anxieties.</b> He wanted to save her and had {{confidence}} in himself, but she felt that he left her out too much.|$|R
60|$|At first <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> were past mention; but he grew restless under them, and the {{instinct}} {{of going to}} Mrs. Ponsonby prevailed. At least, she would know what had transpired from James, or from Fitzjocelyn to Mrs. Frost.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there!" [...] cried Sir Eric, {{with a long}} breath, as if {{relieved}} of half <b>his</b> <b>anxieties,</b> [...] "the boy has sped well. Bernard is here at last! Now his head and hand are there, I doubt no longer." ...|$|R
25|$|Dulles {{never lost}} <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> about the {{destructive}} power of nuclear weapons, but {{his views on}} international control and on employing the threat of atomic attack changed {{in the face of}} the Berlin blockade, the Soviet detonation of an A-bomb, and the advent of the Korean war. These convinced him that the communist bloc was pursuing expansionist policies.|$|E
25|$|He died in London of a {{congenital}} malformation of the bladder; but his end was hastened by an unhealthy life of over-study, and by <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> to acquit himself creditably in his criticism on Baronius. He {{was buried in}} Westminster Abbey. The monument by which his name is there commemorated was erected in 1632 by his friend Thomas Morton when Bishop of Durham.|$|E
25|$|Latham's own written {{account of}} his final weeks in the bush {{described}} his unease over the discipline of his team of bearers, and also <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> over the levels of discord and violence that ruled this military administered area. The official investigation into Latham's death took no cognisance of his concerns and recorded the incident as a tragic hunting accident.|$|E
60|$|As, however, {{he could}} come to no certain {{conclusion}} on this point, he resolved not to tell what he had heard either to his sister or Minnie, but to confine <b>his</b> <b>anxieties,</b> {{at least for the}} present, to his own breast.|$|R
60|$|This truth {{soon began}} to force itself upon Karlsefin's understanding; but as he feared to damp the spirits of his less {{thoughtful}} comrades, he kept <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> to himself, and made the best disposition of his force that was possible in the circumstances.|$|R
60|$|The {{disposition}} {{of this great}} wealth was evidently an anxiety and a burden, but in her heart she believed that the greatest of <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> was caused by his doubt {{in regard to the}} construction she might now place upon that vague, weird ceremony on the desert coast of Peru.|$|R
25|$|Darley's longest period {{administering}} {{the government was}} from 1 November 1900 to 27 May 1902, a significant period in Australia's political history with the lead up to and the aftermath of federation of the then Australian colonies. But <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> for New South Wales's supremacy {{may have contributed to}} the 'Hopetoun Blunder'. According to Bennett, Darley's private assessment in 1902 was that 'Australian Federation is so far a pronounced failure'.|$|E
25|$|The events {{begin the}} same way as the security-based strategy. A person {{perceives}} something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or <b>his</b> <b>anxiety,</b> and distances herself or himself from the attachment.|$|E
25|$|The inquest on 27 October 1980 {{showed that}} in 24 hours, Bonham had {{consumed}} around 40 shots (1–1.4 litres) of 40% ABV vodka, after which he vomited and choked. The finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's body, {{in keeping with his}} recent abstention from heroin, which he had used intermittently for several years; although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the tricyclic antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat <b>his</b> <b>anxiety,</b> it is unclear if these substances interacted with the alcohol in his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish church, Worcestershire.|$|E
50|$|On November 2006, Ahmadinejad {{wrote an}} open letter to the American people, {{representing}} some of <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> and concerns. He stated that there is an urgency to have a dialog because of the activities of the US administration in the Middle East, and that the US is concealing the truth about current realities.|$|R
60|$|It was a strange, romantic position; and Lewis rejoiced, in {{the midst}} of <b>his</b> <b>anxieties,</b> as he lay there wakefully {{guarding}} the chamois-hunter while he slept. It appeared to Lewis that his companion felt the need of a guardian, for he grasped with both hands the arm which he had thrown round him.|$|R
60|$|As fate {{would have}} it the {{opportunity}} was also given her, for that evening Deringham, who had heard nothing of the story, was able to secure a few minutes alone with his daughter. He was, she noticed, looking unusually pale and ill, and that reminded her that he owed all <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> to Alton.|$|R
25|$|Cornell spent {{a two-year}} period {{between the ages of}} nine and eleven solidly {{listening}} to The Beatles after finding a large collection of Beatles records abandoned {{in the basement of a}} neighbor's house. He described himself at this age as a loner; he was able to deal with <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> around other people through rock music. During his teenage years, he spiraled into severe depression, dropped out of school, and almost never left the house. At the age of 12, he had access to alcohol, marijuana, acid, mushrooms and prescription drugs and used them daily by 13, stopped for a year, but relapsed at age 15 for another year until he turned to music.|$|E
25|$|In November 1657 Henry {{himself was}} made lord-deputy; but before {{this time he}} had refused a gift of {{property}} worth £1500 a year, basing his refusal {{on the grounds of}} the poverty of the country, a poverty which was not the least of his troubles. In 1657 he advised his father not to accept the office of king, although in 1654 he had supported a motion to this effect; and after the dissolution of Cromwell's second parliament in February 1658 he showed <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> that the protector should act in a moderate and constitutional manner. After Oliver's death Henry hailed with delight the succession of his brother Richard to the office of protector, but although he was now appointed lieutenant and governor-general of Ireland, it was only with great reluctance that he remained in that country.|$|E
25|$|Alex Reiger (Judd Hirsch)– Alex is {{the main}} protagonist in the sitcom, {{sometimes}} caustic, but level-headed core of the show, the one everyone else turns to for advice. At one point, he reveals <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> with this unwanted burden. He once worked in an office, with {{a good chance of}} advancement, but lost his job owing to his refusal to follow the company line. He was married to Phyllis Bornstein (Louise Lasser), and when she divorced him because of his lack of ambition she sought sole custody of their baby daughter, Cathy. He gave in rather than fight it. He is also estranged from his lothario father, Joe (Jack Gilford). Alex is a recovered compulsive gambler, although he relapses in one episode. A deadpan cynic, he has resigned himself to driving a cab {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Gladstone {{was much}} pleased {{to observe that}} the Emperor of [...] Russia {{appeared}} to be entirely released from the immediate [...] pressure of <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> supposed to weigh much upon his mind. [...] The Empress of Russia has the genial and gracious manners which on [...] this, and on every occasion, mark H.R.H. the Princess of Wales.|$|R
50|$|He {{published}} his poetic works and art criticisms {{in the journal}} Moderní revue (Modern review). He was also active as an artist, creating works that suggest <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> about sex, such as Exile. He was the founding member and {{the first president of}} the nationalist and athletic Sokol group in the Prague suburb of Libeň. He died of tuberculosis aged 23.|$|R
50|$|The New York Times {{profiled}} al-Fadl on December 9, 2007. Their {{review of}} the transcripts described <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> over testifying, the emotional difficulties enforced idleness caused, and the emotional difficulties his entire family faced due to isolation and culture shock. The article describes his wife, who didn't speak English, demanding he refuse to testify, and demanding to leave him and return to Sudan.|$|R
25|$|At 6:00 PM on July 23, Forbes and Beach {{drove to}} the Afro Culture Shop and Bookstore at 11105 Superior Avenue to see Evans. Not finding him there, they {{drove to the}} Evans' {{apartment}} at 12312 Auburndale Avenue and were {{surprised to discover that}} the Cleveland Police had, in fact, established a stationary surveillance around Evans' home. One unmarked car with white officers sat on Lakeview Avenue between Moulton and Auburndale, and another with white officers sat at the intersection of Auburndale and E. 124th Street. At 7:50 PM, Forbes and Beach arrived at Evans' home. They talked with him for 15 minutes, during which time Evans expressed <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> about the police and his concern {{that he was going to}} be harassed again. Forbes attempted to have the stationary surveillance removed, but was advised by the city's Safety Director, James McManamon, to speak with Mayor Stokes. Forbes reached Stokes, but Stokes was interrupted by another call and asked Forbes to call back in 15 minutes. During this time, Forbes drove to the home of Harllel Jones, an Evans associate. While speaking with Jones, they learned that the shootout had begun.|$|E
500|$|He {{expanded}} on his email {{two weeks}} later in response to Cook's query about the supposed link between major depressive disorder and creativity. He explained that <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> and melancholy during the scriptwriting period still allowed him to keep {{on top of his}} work; on the other hand, he thought [...] "Depression with a capital D [...] any such luxury".|$|E
500|$|Bakke applied late to UC Davis in 1973 {{because his}} {{mother-in-law}} was ill. [...] This delay {{may well have}} cost him admission: although his credentials were outstanding even among applicants {{not part of the}} special program, by the time his candidacy was considered under the school's rolling admissions process, there were few seats left. His application reflected <b>his</b> <b>anxiety</b> about his age, referring to his years of sacrifice for his country as a cause of his interest in medicine.|$|E
60|$|Sir Jasper recollected {{what his}} brother had written to him of <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> and {{disappointment}} in his son Henry, and of his absconding from Manitoba, since which time all trace of him had been lost, except in the restoration to the two brothers in Canada. To the surprise and indignation of Sir Jasper, {{there had been no}} attempt to follow it up.|$|R
60|$|Being, as {{the reader}} knows, a practical, matter-of-fact sort of man, our hero at last {{resigned}} {{himself to his}} fate, whatever that might be, and beguiled the time by making many shrewd remarks and observations to Cuffy. When the afternoon meal was brought to him, he heaved a deep sigh, and apparently, with that effort flung off all <b>his</b> <b>anxieties.</b>|$|R
60|$|Much talk we {{had that}} night, {{especially}} Pilate, who spoke in detail of the local situation, and who seemed lonely and desirous to share <b>his</b> <b>anxieties</b> with some one and even to bid for counsel. Pilate was of the solid type of Roman, with sufficient imagination intelligently to enforce the iron policy of Rome, and not unduly excitable under stress.|$|R
