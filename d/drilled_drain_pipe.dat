40|$|The {{protection}} against environment pollution requests active actions for land remediation, with removal of pollutantnts and pathogenic agents. The waste landfills are incumbent dangers, with leachates polluting water beds. The fact is main {{concern of the}} EU and the enacted regulations requests decommissioning operations. Today techniques transfer and encapsulate the landfills, by expensive and humans unsafe methods, without fully cancelling out the leachate risk. This project overcomes the limitations of current solutions with resort to a mixed technique, mainly based on a robotic equipment, capable of creating a draining manifold through remotely operated fixtures. The technique combines micro-tunnelling technology, to create proper collecting lines under the landfill [1], with implantation in the waste bulk of the patented SIDRA® draining elements, to obtain a cost effective system for safe and final remediation of landfills. The SIDRA® pipes consist of hollow rods with draining slots covered by water soluble plastic caps, to prevent occlusion by the debris during drilling. To bring this concept into an exploitable industrial set-up, the project required the ideation and implementation of a reliable and effective robotic equipment, capable of moving and positioning within the small microtunnels, while accomplishing the drilling from the bottom, up to 20 - 30 m afar in the waste bulk with implantation of the piping system. No operator is allowed (nor would accept) to drill below leachate pools; thus the all task needs be fulfilled without human intervention. The paper gives details {{on the development of}} the <b>drilling</b> sequence and <b>draining</b> <b>pipes</b> implantation robot, with annexed local feeding, buffering and pre-setting modules and related monitoring and governing equipment.

40|$|Detailed {{bacterial}} {{and chemical}} studies {{were conducted on}} Cardinal Creek, flowing through the Ball State University campus from May to December, 1972. Samples were collected from <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> flowing into the stream and also {{from the center of}} the stream between <b>drain</b> <b>pipes.</b> Results of the study show human waste materials are entering Cardinal Creek at the sampling site located behind the Ball State trailer courts. Forty-four percent of the time, ratios of fecal coliforms to fecal streptococci at this site were above 4. 0 indicating human waste contamination. The presence of pathogens in the water is another clue to the quality of the surface water. Salmonella and Shigella are associated with gastro-intestinal diseases that may be spread by ingestion of water contaminated with these bacteria. Salmonella and Shigella were isolated on several occasions from the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> behind the trailer courts. Salmonella paratyphi was found on the December 28 sampling date. It's presence in the creek shows human wastes are entering the stream. Chemical data, collected on December 28, indicate a heavy load of organic matter is entering Cardinal Creek at the Ball State trailer court <b>drain</b> <b>pipe.</b> Of all the sites sampled on this date, highest values for nitrogen and phosphorus and the lowest values for oxygen were found at the trailer court location. In conclusion, data collected in this study shows that water entering Cardinal Creek from the <b>drain</b> <b>pipe</b> located by the Ball State trailer courts, contains human fecal material.

The purpose of the investigation is to study thedeficiencies caused in the strength and load carrying capacity of these columns through experimental and numerical analyses. A total number of 28 columns have been cast and only the appropriate ones which were without defects, have been tested under the axial compressive load. An approximate method of alignment for constructed columns has been developed and the alignment of the alignment of the columns has been carried out before their testing. The study shows these columns have huge reduction in their load carryingcapacities. The investigation showed that concealing <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> inside these columns had significant effects on their strength and mode of failure. Three-dimensional finite element analysis of the above mentioned columns have also been carried out to investigate the effects of <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> on load carrying capacities of the columns. The numerical investigation predicts higher factors of safety than the experimental results. In conculsions, the factors of safety obtained from experimental study shows that, the performance of the columns are in a critical level and could be hazardous to the safety of the building. Therefore, an improved method of positioning the <b>drain</b> <b>pipes</b> outside the columns as well as the replacement of the PVC pipes by steel has been proposed. ...|$|R
