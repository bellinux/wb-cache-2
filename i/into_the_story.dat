5|$|Hergé {{introduced}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> {{the character}} of Boris Jorgen, who had previously appeared as an antagonist in King Ottokar's Sceptre (1939).|$|E
5|$|Woven <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> is a subplot {{following}} a girl (Kutty Padmini), {{who is in}} the same hospital Murali works in and undergoes treatment for the same disease that Venu contracted. However, her fate is contrary.|$|E
5|$|As Part III progresses, the {{narrative}} switches to describing their upper-class {{life on the}} island, and filling details of the lifestyle the family was born <b>into.</b> <b>The</b> <b>story</b> of the voodoo practicing Haitian family maid is elucidated: she escaped Trujillo's massacre of Haitians and came to work for Laura, although much of her family was not so lucky.|$|E

5|$|During {{the casting}} process, she was {{compared}} to Paris Hilton. Naveen Andrews, who played the character Sayid on the show, had the idea of encouraging the writers to write a romantic relationship between his character and Shannon <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> Critics found {{her to be a}} largely unsympathetic character until only shortly before her death. Nonetheless, Grace received a Teen Choice Award nomination for her role as Shannon.|$|E
5|$|Hergé also {{inserted}} a cameo of Jacobs <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> using {{him as the}} basis for a scientist that appears on page 40 of Destination Moon, a nod to Jacobs' inclusion of a reference to Hergé in one of his Blake and Mortimer mysteries, The Mystery of the Great Pyramid (1954).|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then There Were None and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
50|$|Louis L'Amour wrote four Hopalong Cassidy novels, {{which are}} still in print. In 2005, author Susie Coffman {{published}} Follow Your Stars, new <b>stories</b> starring <b>the</b> character. In three of these <b>stories,</b> Coffman wrote <b>the</b> wife of actor William Boyd <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1952, Awdry volunteered as a {{guard on}} the Talyllyn Railway in Wales, then {{in its second}} year of preservation. The railway {{inspired}} Awdry to create the Skarloey Railway, based on the Talyllyn, {{with some of his}} exploits being written <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another {{issue is}} the [...] "narrative fallacy" [...] which refers to our {{tendency}} to construct stories around facts, which in love for example may serve a purpose, but when someone begins to believe <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> and accommodate facts <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> {{they are likely to}} err. The historian Professor Hayden White discusses this phenomenon in his writings.|$|R
5|$|Cagney made a rare TV {{appearance}} in the lead role of the movie Terrible Joe Moran in 1984. This was his last role. Cagney's health was fragile and more strokes had confined him to a wheelchair, but the producers worked his real-life mobility problem <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> They also decided to dub his impaired speech, using the impersonator Rich Little. The film made use of fight clips from Cagney's boxing movie Winner Take All (1932), {{despite the fact that}} the TV movie is about an entirely different character.|$|E
5|$|Hergé also {{introduced}} a new character, Peggy Alcazar, whom he had based upon the American secretary to a Ku Klux Klan spokesman whom Hergé observed in a television documentary. In his preparatory notes for the story, Hergé had considered introducing Peggy {{as the daughter of}} arms dealer Basil Bazaroff– the satirical depiction of the old times real-life arms dealer Basil Zaharoff, who had appeared in The Broken Ear. He {{also introduced}} the Jolly Follies <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> a group who were based on three separate touring party groups that Hergé had encountered. He had initially considered a number of alternative names for the troupe, including the Turlupins, Turlurans, and Boutentrins.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Sharman {{reunited with}} O'Brien to do Shock Treatment, a {{stand-alone}} feature {{that was not}} a direct sequel to the original film. This film reunites characters Brad and Janet and was originally conceived and written to depict the characters filmed in normal settings until the production changed to work around a Screen Actor's Guild strike. The eventual production would now entail the full film being shot entirely within a sound stage and purposely blending that <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> line. Shock Treatment has a cult following but not nearly as strong as the first film, and was a commercial failure in no small part due to the principal cast of Curry, Sarandon and Bostwick not returning.|$|E

50|$|Numerous {{conflicting}} legends grew {{up about}} the life and martyrdom of St Theodore so that, {{in order to bring}} some consistency <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> it seems to have been assumed that there must have been two different saints, St Theodore Tiron of Amasea and St Theodore Stratelates of Heraclea.|$|R
5|$|Like most RPGs, the Final Fantasy {{installments}} use {{an experience}} level system for character advancement, in which experience points are accumulated by killing enemies. Character classes, specific jobs that enable unique abilities for characters, are another recurring theme. Introduced {{in the first}} game, character classes have been used differently in each title. Some restrict a character to a single job to integrate it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> while other games feature dynamic job systems that allow the player to choose from multiple classes and switch throughout the game. Though used heavily in many games, such systems have become less prevalent in favor of characters that are more versatile; characters still match an archetype, but are able to learn skills outside their class.|$|E
5|$|Limited-time events {{sometimes}} introduced {{additional material}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> For instance, during the game's first anniversary event (July 2014), the player meets and befriends Goofy and Donald Duck, whose Gummi Ship has crash landed in Daybreak Town and broken into many Gummi Blocks. The player agrees to help collect the Gummi Blocks {{to repair the}} ship, and meets King Mickey, Chip, and Dale while doing so. Once the Gummi Ship is repaired, the player watches the others depart for their world. Meanwhile, a Moogle has constructed a Gummi Ship in his own image, but is unable to locate an entrance into his design.|$|E
5|$|Nemec's {{character}} replaced Daniel Jackson (portrayed by Michael Shanks) during season6 after Shanks {{had left}} the show amid controversy after season5. The producers based Jonas's motivation to join Stargate Command on his momentary reluctance to actively prevent Daniel's death, and his feelings of responsibility afterwards. Jonas was slowly integrated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> in a prolonged transition stage over {{the first half of}} season6. Nemec was open to continue playing Jonas Quinn after season6, but a new contract was reached with Michael Shanks for Daniel to return in season7. The role of Jonas was reduced to recurring status in season7.|$|E
50|$|In the mid-1960s, Pedler {{became the}} {{unofficial}} scientific {{adviser to the}} Doctor Who production team. Hired by Innes Lloyd to inject more hard science <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> Pedler formed a particular writing partnership with Gerry Davis, <b>the</b> programme's <b>story</b> editor. Their interest in the problems of science changing and endangering human life led them to create the Cybermen.|$|R

5|$|Shelley {{uses the}} {{historical}} novel {{to comment on}} gender relations; for example, Valperga is a feminist version of Scott's masculinist genre. Introducing women <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> who {{are not part of}} the historical record, Shelley uses their narratives to question established theological and political institutions. Shelley sets the male protagonist's compulsive greed for conquest in opposition to a female alternative: reason and sensibility. In Perkin Warbeck, Shelley's other historical novel, Lady Gordon stands for the values of friendship, domesticity, and equality. Through her, Shelley offers a feminine alternative to the masculine power politics that destroy the male characters. The novel provides a more inclusive historical narrative to challenge the one which usually relates only masculine events.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen any sense of awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally able to get <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> {{in part due to}} the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E
5|$|The {{sport was}} first {{developed}} at a bridge located in Ashdown Forest, {{close to the}} village of Upper Hartfield, East Sussex, England. Built in 1907 and originally called Posingford Bridge, it is considered to be the bridge on which Milne and his son first played the game. However, it is uncertain whether the sport was first played at the bridge then written <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> or vice versa. The bridge maintained the public's interest and a campaign to rebuild it in the late seventies was considered important enough to feature on the BBC NineO'Clock News. The bridge was subsequently reopened by Christopher Robin Milne and officially renamed as Poohsticks Bridge.|$|E
40|$|Maori wahi tapu are {{cultural}} {{sites of}} spiritual value {{which can be}} loosely classed as 'sacred' sites. However, the word 'sacred' does not fully convey the spiritual value of wahi tapu - 'windows to the past' - which provide genealogical links for Maori and often merge recent history <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of creation...|$|R
50|$|The {{origins of}} Japanese horror {{can be traced}} to horror and ghost <b>story</b> {{classics}} of <b>the</b> Edo period and the Meiji period, which were known as kaidan. Elements of several of these popular folktales have been worked <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of modern films, especially in the traditional nature of the Japanese ghost.|$|R
50|$|Star Wraith and Star Wraith II do {{not easily}} seem to flow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> of Star Wraith III and Star Wraith IV. This {{seems to suggest}} that Star Wraith and Star Wraith II are no longer canon. The most {{important}} factor is that time scales don't seem to match between games.|$|R
5|$|Carrie {{had told}} me in an earlier writing {{appointment}} that she was expecting this album to have darker tones than any of her earlier records. So I remember sitting at the piano while writing the song thinking that if Carrie really wanted something dark, this was what she was after. Carrie really got <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and making sure we didn't give away how the two women {{got rid of the}} man the song is about. This kind of song is really tricky because you need enough detail to tell the story and keep it interesting without it becoming so graphic that it's unpleasant to listen to more than once. I think we managed to pull that off. Either way, it was certainly fun choosing which elements of the story to put in and which ones to leave out.|$|E
5|$|Character {{designer}} Tetsuya Nomura {{has explained}} that Vincent's character shifted {{from that of}} horror researcher, to detective, to chemist, and finally to {{the figure of a}} former Turk with a tragic past. Director Yoshinori Kitase {{was in charge of the}} cutscene in which Vincent joins the party, while scenario writer Kazushige Nojima wrote his backstory. Nojima had a great deal of trouble with Vincent's dialogue, as he very rarely speaks. In the original script of the game, Vincent was introduced in a similar fashion, but was a handsome, sarcastic personality. He would join Cloud's group after learning they were in pursuit of Hojo, but he had no knowledge of the results of the experimentation to which he was subjected. Additionally, he would be also privy to more information regarding Shinra's involvement with the creation of Sephiroth, and it is he who would explain to Cloud the story of Sephiroth's origins. When the game was still in development, Nomura and his staff considering removing Vincent and Yuffie Kisaragi altogether, as they did not have enough time to work them <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> properly. As a result, Vincent and Yuffie ultimately appeared as optional characters in the game.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the story, the two sides face off in a major battle that sees the deaths of many soldiers, {{including}} their leaders Larg and Goltana. Ramza manages to stop the bloodshed from continuing and rescues the general Cidolfas Orlandu, though the Church succeeds in eliminating the two Lions to secure its power over Ivalice. Deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> Ramza discovers that the Shrine Knights are in reality Lucavi, and the real conspirators behind the Church's plot. The Lucavi are seeking to resurrect their leader Altima, who in the past was Saint Ajora, and they need much bloodshed and a suitable body to complete the resurrection. Alma is to serve as the host for Altima's incarnation. While racing off to find her, Ramza encounters Dycedarg - now a Lucavi demon - and witnesses Zalbag's death. Zalbag is then risen and converted into an undead servant, and frequently begs for death during the encounter.|$|E
50|$|The novella {{was first}} {{published}} in March 1888 by Severny Vestnik. With minor changes it was included <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stories</b> (Рассказы, 1888) to be reproduced unchanged in all its 13 editions (1889-1899). In a revised version it was included by Chekhov into Volume 4 of his Collected Works published in 1899-1901 by Adolf Marks.|$|R
