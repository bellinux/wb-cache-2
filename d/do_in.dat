5|$|Although {{not usually}} {{identified}} as a genre writer, William S. Burroughs produced works with a surreal narrative that estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> 1959 he published Naked Lunch, {{the first of many}} works such as The Nova Trilogy and The Wild Boys in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Anders as Linda Katherine Zwordling: Linda is {{a tester}} {{in one of}} Veridian's departments. She finds herself very {{attracted}} to Ted, but maintains other relationships and reminds Ted repeatedly that he has rejected {{the idea of a}} workplace romance with her. She seems to be a bit of an outsider to the corporate culture. Often she demands that Ted consider the horrible ramifications of the company policies or activities. Her relationship with the scientists is strained by her rejection of the weird things they <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the name of science. Despite this, she finds herself increasingly looking at Veronica as a mentor as the series progresses.|$|E

I know you're tearing it up out there.|$|E

5|$|Consonant {{clusters}} across syllable boundaries do not assimilate {{for place}} in Wagiman as they <b>do</b> <b>in</b> many other languages. This {{means that a}} nasal in a syllable coda will not move {{to the position of}} the following syllable onset for ease of enunciation. In English and most other Indo-European languages, this movement occurs regularly, such that the prefix -in, for example, changes to -im when it precedes either a p, a b or an m.|$|E
5|$|Eccles is the ninth-most densely {{populated}} ward in Salford, {{and has the}} highest number and proportion of people aged 75and over of all wards in Salford. Levels of crime are below the average for the city.

Unemployment is below average, with people tending to work longer hours. More residents live in purpose-built and converted flats than <b>do</b> <b>in</b> the city as a whole, with a minority occupying detached houses or bungalows. Between 1994and2004, 367homes were added to the ward, above the average for Salford.|$|E

For example, he would hold town halls and let constituents vote on motions to decide what he would <b>do</b> <b>in</b> Congress on their behalf and these meetings helped Bedell understand the problems of his constituents; as a result, he backed issues that were important to his farming constituency, such as waterway usage fees and production constraints.|$|E

5|$|IQ classifications from IQ testing are not {{the last}} word on how a test-taker will <b>do</b> <b>in</b> life, nor are they the only {{information}} to be considered for placement in school or job-training programs. There is still a dearth of information about how behavior differs between persons with differing IQ scores.

5|$|In February 1972, Nixon and {{his wife}} {{traveled}} to China. Kissinger briefed Nixon for over 40hours in preparation.

Over 100television journalists accompanied the president. On Nixon's orders, television was strongly favored over printed publications, as Nixon felt that the medium would capture the visit much better than print. It also gave him the opportunity to snub the print journalists he despised.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to granting local governments wide latitude over liquor sales, New Jersey law has some other unusual features. Corporations {{are limited to}} two retail distribution licenses, making it impractical for chain stores to sell alcoholic beverages; this restriction, in conjunction with municipal ordinances, severely limits supermarket and convenience store chains from selling beer as they <b>do</b> <b>in</b> many other states. State law treats drunk driving as a traffic offense rather than a crime, and permits individual municipalities to define the scope of underage drinking laws.|$|E

5|$|Participants {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the crew may help the GMs {{to set up and}} maintain the environment of the LARP during play by acting as stagehands or playing non-player characters (NPCs) who fill out the setting. Crew typically receive more information about the setting and more direction from the GMs than players <b>do.</b> <b>In</b> a tabletop role-playing game, a GM usually plays all the NPCs, whereas in a LARP, each NPC is typically played by a separate crew member. Sometimes players are asked to play NPCs for periods of an event.|$|E

Despite the success, however, Simeon I {{realized that there was}} still a lot to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> order to prevail over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans by imposing his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E
