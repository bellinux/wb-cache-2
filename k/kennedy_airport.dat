From 20:33 EDT (00:33 UTC) until 20:47 EDT (00:47 UTC), the {{aircraft}} experienced a 14-minute radio blackout, which was later determined {{to be due to}} communication radios tuning errors.|$|E
5|$|When the US ban on JFK Concorde {{operations}} {{was lifted}} in February 1977, New York banned Concorde locally. The ban {{came to an}} end on 17 October 1977 when the Supreme Court of the United States declined to overturn a lower court's ruling rejecting efforts by the Port Authority and a grass-roots campaign led by Carol Berman to continue the ban. In spite of complaints about noise, the noise report noted that Air Force One, at the time a Boeing VC-137, was louder than Concorde at subsonic speeds and during take-off and landing. Scheduled service from Paris and London to New York's John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport</b> began on 22 November 1977.|$|E

5|$|New York City {{was struck}} {{particularly}} {{hard by the}} storm. It is estimated that 42 people perished, and several hundred more people were injured. The storm disrupted the city for days, and forced schools to close. Streets throughout Queens became impassable; mail service, buses, taxis, delivery vehicles, and trash collection were all disrupted. Thousands of motorists became trapped on the New York State Thruway. A snow emergency was issued in the city, and the Long Island Rail Road suspended all service at the time. The snowstorm left approximately 6,000 travelers stranded at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport.</b> They slept on chairs and floors. Over 1,000 vehicles were stalled or abandoned on the Tappan Zee Bridge; most of these were removed within a day.|$|E

25|$|The airline {{also built}} Worldport, a {{terminal}} building at John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport</b> in New York. It was distinguished by its elliptical, four-acre (16,000m²) roof, suspended {{far from the}} outside columns of the terminal below by 32 sets of steel posts and cables. The terminal was designed to allow passengers to board and disembark via stairs without getting wet by parking {{the nose of the}} aircraft under the overhang. The introduction of the jetbridge made this feature obsolete. Pan Am built a gilded training building in the style of Edward Durell Stone designed by Steward-Skinner Architects in Miami.|$|E

In December 2006, he walked 26 miles from his home in South London to Heathrow Airport. Upon arriving at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport</b> he walked 20 miles from there to Manhattan. In August 2013, Self wrote of his anger following an incident in which he was stopped and questioned by police in Yorkshire while out walking with one of his sons, on suspicion of being a paedophile. The police were alerted by a security guard at Bishop Burton College. He had asked the security guard for permission to cross the school grounds.|$|E
25|$|On December 31, 13 JDL {{members were}} arrested {{after a series}} of coordinated actions against Soviet {{property}} in Manhattan and at <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport</b> intended to protest the treatment of Jews in the Soviet Union. Several youths painted slogans on a Soviet airliner, two of them handcuffed themselves to the airliner, while others daubed the words “Am Yisroel Chai” (the Nation of Israel Lives) on the plane’s doors. A similar slogan was painted {{on the walls of the}} office of Tass, the Soviet news agency, in Rockefeller Plaza, which was invaded by Rabbi Kahane and four other JDL members.

I-278 was routed north on the Sheridan, while its present route was taken by I-878. At that time, the northwest piece of present NY878 was to be part of I-78, which would have continued from the Holland Tunnel along the Lower Manhattan Expressway, Williamsburg Bridge and Bushwick Expressway to reach the Nassau Expressway at Cross Bay Boulevard. Northeast of <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport,</b> I-78 was to turn north onto the Clearview Expressway, using the Throgs Neck Bridge and Cross Bronx Expressway to end at the Bruckner Interchange.|$|E
25|$|Pan Am was {{the launch}} {{customer}} of the Boeing 747, placing a $525million order for 25 in April 1966. On January 15, 1970 First Lady Pat Nixon christened a Pan Am Boeing 747 Clipper Young America at Washington Dulles {{in the presence}} of Pan Am president Najeeb Halaby. During the next few days, Pan Am flew several 747s to major airports in the United States as a public relations effort, allowing the public to tour the airplanes. Pan Am began its final preparations for the first 747 service on the evening of January 21, 1970, when Clipper Young America was scheduled to fly from New York John F. Kennedy to London Heathrow. An engine failure delayed the inaugural flight's departure by several hours, necessitating the substitution of another 747 which eventually flew to London Heathrow. Passengers cheered and drank champagne as the jet finally lifted off from the runway at John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport.</b>|$|E

Lexington Avenue–63rd Street was the third-to-last stop before 21st Street–Queensbridge, the line's northern terminus; the 21st Street station was not connected to any other subway station or line in Queens.|$|E

500|$|Before Concorde's flight trials, {{developments}} in the civil aviation industry were largely accepted by governments and their respective electorates. Opposition to Concorde's noise, particularly {{on the east coast}} of the United States, forged a new political agenda {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, with scientists and technology experts across a multitude of industries beginning to take the environmental and social impact more seriously. Although Concorde led directly to the introduction of a general noise abatement programme for aircraft flying out of John F. <b>Kennedy</b> <b>Airport,</b> many found that Concorde was quieter than expected, partly due to the pilots temporarily throttling back their engines to reduce noise during overflight of residential areas. Even before commercial flights started, it had been claimed that Concorde was quieter than many other aircraft. In 1971, BAC's technical director was quoted as saying, [...] "It is certain on present evidence and calculations that in the airport context, production Concordes will be no worse than aircraft now in service and will in fact be better than many of them." ...|$|E
