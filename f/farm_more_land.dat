50|$|The {{influx of}} New World grain caused a slump in grain prices, forcing the peasants to <b>farm</b> <b>more</b> <b>land.</b> At the same time, despite their efficiency, large peasant {{households}} split up (from 9.5 to 6.8 persons per household in central Russia, 1861-1884). The resulting land hunger increased prices 7-fold {{and made it}} easier for nobles to sell or rent land rather than farm it themselves. From 1861 to 1900 40% of noble land was sold to peasants (70% of this went to the Commune and by 1900 two thirds of the nobles' arable land was rented to the peasantry. 1900-1914, over 20% of remaining noble land was sold but only 3% of the 155 estates over 50,000 desiatiny. According to the 1897 census, 71% of the top 4 ranks of the civil service were nobles. But in the civil service as a whole, noble membership declined from 49.8% in 1755 to 43.7% in the 1850s and to 30.7% in 1897. There were 1.2 million nobles, about 1% of the population (8% in Poland; compare with 4% in Hungary and 1 to 1.5% in France). Their military influence waned: in the Crimean War 90% of officers were noble, by 1913 the proportion had sunk to 50%.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of farm productivity as well as farm size on deforestation in Brazil. A two step econometric approach is adopted. A bootstrapped translog stochastic frontier that is a posteriori checked for functional consistency is used in order to estimate technical efficiency of which estimates are introduced in a land use model to assess {{the impact of}} productivity and farm size on deforestation. Analysis of agricultural census tract data suggests that technical efficiency has a nonlinear (convex) effect: less and <b>more</b> efficient <b>farms</b> use <b>more</b> <b>land</b> for agricultural activities and so they have a positive effect on deforestation. However, the majority of farms are on the ascendant slope so that efficiency implies more deforestation in Brazilian Legal Amazon. Moreover, farm size has a robust negative effect on deforestation. Contrary to many studies, this result suggests that small <b>farms</b> convert <b>more</b> natural (forested) <b>land</b> into agricultural land than large ones.

40|$|Climate {{change is}} set to be {{particularly}} disruptive in poor agricultural communities. We assess the factors influencing farmers’ choice of climate change adaptation practices and associated impacts on household food security and poverty in Pakistan using comprehensive data from 950 farmers from its major provinces. A probit model was used to investigate the factors influencing the use of climate-change adaptation practices; the censored least absolute deviation (CLAD) was {{used to analyze the}} determinants of the number of adaptation practices used; and a propensity score matching (PSM) approach was employed to evaluate the impact of adaptation practices on food security and poverty levels. Adjustment in sowing time (22 % households), use of drought tolerant varieties (15 %) and shifting to new crops (25 %) were the three major adaptation practices used by farmers in the study area. Results show that younger farmers and farmers with higher levels of education are more likely to use these adaptation practices, as do farmers that are wealthier, <b>farm</b> <b>more</b> <b>land</b> and have joint families. The number of adaptation practices used was found to be positively associated with education, male household heads, land size, household size, extension services, access to credit and wealth. Farmers adopting more adaptation practices had higher food security levels (8 – 13 %) than those who did not, and experienced lower levels of poverty (3 – 6 %). Climate change adaptation practices at farm level can thereby have significant development outcomes in addition to reducing exposure to weather risks...|$|E

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in 74 family farms from the region of Podkarpacie. Information for the work was collected directly on farms using a prepared questionnaire. The results show that with the increasing surface, households increased their economic and organisational prosperity expressed by a higher gross margin and higher stocking rates (LU). In smaller farms, the animal-plant production profile typical of Subcarpathian (group II-IV), the growth potential is high. These <b>farms</b> have <b>more</b> <b>land</b> resources and animals that are used for food production. Their further development will be determined primarily by macroeconomic factors, as well as decisions about the way of management made by farmers. It should be emphasized, however, that failure to livestock or reduction (the abandonment of grazing pasture, lower stocking density) will contribute to the growth of uncultivated land surface, mostly on grassland difficult to be utilized in a different manner. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} agricultural technical efficiency on the propensity of farmers to convert natural land into agricultural plots, i. e., to deforest, in the Brazilian Legal Amazon (BLA). A two-step econometric approach is adopted. A bootstrapped translog stochastic frontier that is a posteriori checked for functional consistency is used to assess technical efficiency and these estimates are put into a land-use model {{to assess the impact}} of productivity on deforestation. Analysis of agricultural census tract data suggests that technical efficiency has a U-shaped effect: both less and <b>more</b> efficient <b>farms</b> use <b>more</b> <b>land</b> for their agricultural activities and so have a positive effect on deforestation. However, the majority of farms in the BLA are on the ascendant slope, so that efficiency implies more deforestation in the BLA.

40|$|Work and its {{contribution}} to the adaptation strategies of smallholder family farms within mixed crop/livestock systems. Work and its management represent an adaptation opportunity for farms characterized by scarce land and capital resources. To verify this assumption, the "Work Balance" method was used in 30 family farms of different sizes and capital uses, located in the Saïss region (Centre East of Morocco). The study showed that small-scale farms (less than 1 ha) are generally specializing in cattle rearing, with an important share of endogenous work being dedicated to this activity. By contrast, <b>farms</b> with <b>more</b> <b>land</b> and capital tend to diversify their crops, resulting in an increased use of off farm staff, {{while at the same}} time maintaining livestock activity. The technical and economic performance of both groups (almost 1 ton of milk per cow per year supplied to collection centers by each group, but with a daily gross income per family member varying from 4. 1 to 14. 6 Euros) reveal that work is a key parameter within farming strategies. This suggests that additional studies need to be dedicated to farm work and its annual organization in order to gain a better understanding of the ongoing dynamics within farming systems...|$|R

50|$|The European {{settlement}} at Sydney Cove, {{established in}} 1788 after {{the arrival of}} the First Fleet, grew rapidly. By the early 19th century, the Blue Mountains had become a barrier to the expansion of the colony, which required <b>more</b> <b>farming</b> <b>land</b> to meet its needs, particularly after the droughts of 1812 and 1813. The local Indigenous people knew at least two routes by which to cross the mountains. The first was along Bilpin Ridge, later followed by Archibald Bell {{with the assistance of the}} local Darug people (now the location of Bells Line of Road), and the second was along Coxs River. Until 1813 however, the settlers remained unaware of how to cross the mountains despite several attempts, including two by Blaxland himself. Early in 1813 Blaxland, who wanted <b>more</b> grazing <b>land,</b> obtained the approval of Governor Lachlan Macquarie and approached Lawson and Wentworth to secure their participation in a new exploratory expedition following the mountain ridges.|$|R

By the early 19th century, many farmers switched from growing grain to raising dairy cattle and hay. In 1848 a dairy and cheese factory opened in the village.

50|$|In {{the general}} {{reparcelling}} out of land, begun in 1757 when Finland {{was a part}} of Sweden, the medieval model of all fields consisting of numerous strips, each belonging to a farm, was replaced by a model of fields and forest areas each belonging to a single farm. In the further reparcellings, which started in 1848 when Finland was part of Russia, the idea of concentrating all the land in a farm to a single piece of real estate was reinforced. In these reparcelling processes, the land is redistributed in direct proportion to earlier prescription. Both the general reparcelling and the further reparcelling processes are still active {{in some parts of the}} country, and a new reparcelling can be initiated when the local need for such reparcelling arises. After the Finnish Civil War, when Finland had become independent, a series of land reforms followed. These included the compensated transfer of lease-holdings (torppa) to the leasers and prohibition of forestry companies to acquire land. After the Second World War, Karelians evacuated from areas ceded to Russia were given land in remaining Finnish areas, taken from public and private holdings with less than full compensation to the previous owners. Also the war veterans, and their widows benefited from these allotments. As a result of post-WWII land reform, 30,000 new farms were established, 33,000 small <b>farms</b> received <b>more</b> <b>land</b> and 67,000 families received either a plot for a single-family home or a homestead with some arable land.|$|R
