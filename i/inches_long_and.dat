5|$|From this work, he {{concluded}} that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). As a proof of the concept, he constructed a telescope using reflective mirrors instead of lenses as the objective to bypass that problem. Building the design, the first known functional reflecting telescope, today known as a Newtonian telescope, involved solving the problem of a suitable mirror material and shaping technique. Newton ground his own mirrors out of a custom composition of highly reflective speculum metal, using Newton's rings to judge {{the quality of the}} optics for his telescopes. In late 1668 he was able to produce this first reflecting telescope. It was about eight <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> it gave a clearer and larger image. In 1671, the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes, Of Colours, which he later expanded into the work Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. Newton and Hooke had brief exchanges in 1679–80, when Hooke, appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, opened up a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions, which had the effect of stimulating Newton to work out a proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation– History and De motu corporum in gyrum). But the two men remained generally on poor terms until Hooke's death.|$|E

The adult size is estimated to have been about two metres (6.5feet). Scipionyx was a bipedal predator, its horizontal rump balanced by a long tail. Its body was probably covered by primitive feathers but these have not been found in the fossil, that is without any skin remains.|$|E
25|$|The {{weight of}} an arrow shaft can be {{expressed}} in GPI (Grains Per Inch). The length of a shaft in inches multiplied by its GPI rating gives {{the weight of the}} shaft in grains. For example, a shaft that is 30 <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> has a GPI of 9.5 weighs 285 grains, or about 18 grams. This does not include the other elements of a finished arrow, so a complete arrow will be heavier than the shaft alone.|$|E
25|$|Typically, {{leaves are}} {{five to ten}} centimeters (2-4 <b>inches)</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> are roundly and deeply lobed. The leaf width is {{approximately}} one half its length. Each leaf is matte green with an underneath pale green appearance; moreover, the leaf is covered with abundant soft fuzz, yielding an almost velvety feeling. When a fresh leaf is rubbed or broken, an aromatic scent is exuded, evoking a forest odor. The wood is a dull brown approaching yellow, {{and it has not}} been used extensively for milling.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} this device {{is shown in the}} figure on the right; it had a 0.125-inch {{diameter}} hole, was 1.9 <b>inches</b> <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> 0.8 inches in diameter. The quarter wave resonance was calculated to be 1780Hz, while the measured fundamental was 1625Hz with detectable second and third harmonics. End corrections for radiation from the openings is needed to bring the two frequencies in consonance. To determine the end corrections, two additional dimensions are needed: the diameter of the orifice d1 and the diameter of the tube d2.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the evidence about the waitoreke is from sightings. However some alleged physical evidence does exist. Several unidentified tracks have been found. They were described as being a few <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> showing webbing. Otter footprints show a little webbing but beaver footprints show full webbing. In 1868 Julius von Haast obtained an alleged waitoreke pelt. It was in very bad condition and was not conclusively identified. Described as being brown and having white spots, {{it seems to have}} approximately that of quolls which are not present in New Zealand (and apparently were never: Antoni & Wodzicki 1984).|$|E
25|$|After Houdini's death, {{his friend}} Martin Beck {{was quoted in}} Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key {{required}} to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 <b>inches</b> <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> {{could not have been}} smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.|$|E

2500|$|The {{abundance}} of nerve endings in the anal region and rectum can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women. The {{internal and external}} sphincter muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex. The Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia states that [...] "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" [...] and that [...] "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".|$|E

They come out of the bud recurved by the bending down of the petiole near the middle bringing the apex of the folded leaf to the base of the bud, light green, when full grown are bright green, smooth and shining above, paler green beneath, with downy veins.

The suggestion was taken up by Parker who produced his first sculpture, a fired clay bighorn sheep.

One 17th-century Seneca wampum belt featured beads almost 2.5 <b>inches</b> (65 mm) <b>long.</b> Women artisans traditionally made wampum beads by rounding small pieces of the shells of whelks, then piercing them with a hole before stringing them.|$|R
2500|$|The rod-puppet {{approach}} {{was chosen for}} the production rather than stop-motion animation which did not provide the required smoothness to appear realistic. As a result, the rod-puppet allowed for a fast alien that could move across surfaces of any orientation and be shot from any angle. [...] This was particularly effective as {{it was able to}} accomplish movements not feasible by an actor in a suit. The 1/3 scale puppet was 40 <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> cast in foam rubber over a bicycle chain armature for flexibility. For moving camera shots, the on-set cameras were equipped with digital recorders to track, pan, tilt, and dolly values. The data output was then taken back to the studio and fed into the motion control cameras with the linear dimensions scaled down to match the puppet.|$|E

Western gorillas frequently stand upright, but walk in a hunched, quadrupedal fashion, with hands curled and knuckles touching the ground. This style of movement requires long arms, which works for western gorillas because the arm span of gorillas is larger than their standing height. The average size of the male western lowland gorilla's reproductive organ is typically between [...] <b>inches</b> <b>long,</b> <b>and</b> it stops growing after a few years of agecitation needed.|$|E
2500|$|The stripes {{are about}} four inches wide. The tent itself is {{about four feet}} wide by three feet deep, and inside {{headroom}} is well over six feet. A long white zipper runs up {{the middle of the}} front, while the back is open and contoured to fit the bus. The frame consists of four metal poles which fit into pockets inside the top of the tent and lock together to form a square. Legs on two of the poles fit into brackets which were bolted to the camper's roof. Two additional poles dogleg into the top frame and have small chain-hooks to hold the doors open. The lower ends of these poles fit into holes in the jack supports. Rubber grommets help protect the paint on the doors and the jack points. The lower edge of the tent is secured to the ground with about a dozen metal stakes. Each stake is about six <b>inches</b> <b>long</b> <b>and</b> is formed from hardened 1/4" [...] rods with a loop at one end. Two storage bags made of (usually matching) canvas with leather straps are supplied for the tent and poles.|$|E
