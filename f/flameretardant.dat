For these properties, corrugated cardboards are used as packing materials. In this research We tried to study about the flameretardancy (FR) of a corrugated cardboards using for Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). The coating PVA on the cardboard is possible to be recyclable, because PVA has water solubility. Also the reason using PVA is to protect from the toxicity of <b>flameretardant,</b> {{which is used to}} the cardboards. We studied the FR-PVA for different with decomposition point of FR agent. We measured TGA and combustion test of the PVA. In the result, we could get the flameretardancy of PVA...|$|E
30|$|The thermal {{properties}} and structures of deoxyhalocelluloses were studied using thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetric analyses and an X-ray diffraction method. The X-ray diffraction curves of the cellulose derivatives were obtained after subjecting {{them to a}} specific treatment {{that was supposed to}} render a specific cellulose allomorph from the amorphous state cellulose; all of the cellulose derivatives examined without such treatment exhibited no crystalline features. Only deoxyfluorocellulose was found to give a diffraction pattern {{similar to that of the}} corresponding cellulose allomorph, which was cellulose IV in this case. On the basis of the thermal analyses, it was confirmed that chlorodeoxycellulose has a <b>flameretardant</b> property, whereas deoxyfluorocellulose was found not to be flame-retardant. The difference is supposedly due to the difference in the bonding energy between C-Cl and C-F.|$|E
40|$|Functional {{textiles}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} important fields in textile industry and textile materials science. They include breathable, heat and cold-resistant materials, ultra-strong fabrics (e. g. as reinforcement for composites), new <b>flameretardant</b> fabrics (e. g. intumescent materials), optimisation of textile fabrics for acoustic properties, etc. Functional textiles became more and more important materials for various applications and interest in them grew year by year; and more and more conferences are focused on functional textiles, as well as the events which are not only textile conferences but encompass various fields of Material Science. This paper presents a short overview about the European Materials Research Society 2014 Fall meeting conference Symposium M “Functional textiles - from research and development to innovations and industrial uptake” and the projects which participated as symposium co-organisers: the European Coordination Action 2 BFUNTEX funded by the EC 7 th Framework Programme NMP, the COST Action MP 1105 on “Sustainable flame retardancy for textiles and related materials based on nanoparticles substituting conventional chemicals (FLARETEX) ” and the COST Action MP 1206 on “Electrospun Nano-fibres for bio inspired composite materials and innovative industrial applications”. © AUTEX...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of varied {{nanoparticles}} (silicate nanoclays and double-walled carbon nanotubes) and micro-sized <b>flameretardants</b> (FRs) on the post heat/fireflexuralperformance of glassfibre-reinforced (GFR) epoxy compositess. The fire reaction properties of GFR epoxycompositescontaining different combinations of nano- and micro-sized FRs were studied at varied incident heat fluxes (35 to 75 kW/m 2). The flexural stiffness and modulus values of radiant heat-damaged GFR composites decreased rapidly with increasing incident heat flux. On another hand, the post-fireflexural properties of these specimens exposed for 30 to 90 s post-ignition at 50 kW/m 2 retained only 20 % of their room temperature flexural properties. Despite significant improvements in the fire reaction properties, their post-fireflexuralperformance was least affected. This suggests that, while these <b>flameretardants</b> are effective in promoting char formation, the formed char networks are not consolidated enough to effectively constrain the fibre reinforcements...|$|R
40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs), {{widely used}} as <b>flameretardants,</b> are now recognized as globally distributed pollutants, and are detected in most environmental and biological samples, including human blood, adipose tissue, and breast milk. Due to their wide use in commercial products and their persistent nature, long-term exposure to PBDEs may pose a human health risk, especially to children. Our previous reports {{showed that the}} commercial PBDE mixture, DE- 71, affected protein kinase C (PKC) and calcium homeostasis {{in a similar way}} to those of a structurally-related polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture. These intracellular signaling events are associated with neuronal development and learning and memory function.

This study focused on the occurrence and spatial distribution of 11 OPE congeners and one synthetic intermediate triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO) in 40 major rivers entering into the Bohai Sea. Total OPEs ranged from 9. 6 to 1549 ng L- 1, {{with an average of}} 300 ng L- 1. Tris(1 -chloro- 2 -propyl) phosphate (TCPP) (4. 6 - 921 ng mean: 186 ng L- 1) and tris(2 -choroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) (1. 3 - 268 ng L- 1, mean: 80. 2 ng L- 1) were the most abundant OPEs and their distribution patterns are similar, indicating the same source (r = 0. 61, P < 0. 05) and the influence of large production and consumption of chlorinated OPEs in the region. Priority should be given to TCPP, PCEP and TPPO due to their high concentrations in the rivers and potential threat to aquatic organisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thes is in textile conservaHon deal s {{with issues}} cancerning flame-relardant finishes on textiles, and whether flame-praofing chemicals may develop inlo {{a problem for}} the preservation and conservation of treated textiles. The fundamental questions deal! with concern which textiles are being treated with flame-proofing agents, as weil as degradation, health and environmental aspects. To address these quesHons mainly wrilten sources have been studied. Previous research on the effect of flame-proofing agents on textiles in museum collections is scarce, which might be why there has been minimal aUention given this subject in the field of textile conservation. Furnishings in public places need to meet the requirements for local and national fire regula lions and are therefore often subjected to fire-proofing treatments. Objects thaI might have a fire-proofing treatment are theatre curlains, drapes, upholstered furniture and textile art and hangings. Textiles made of wool have good thermal properties and usually do not require any added chemicals to be fire-proof. Cellulose-based textiles, on the other hand, are easily ignited and burn readily. They are therefore more often given a flame-prooHng finish. Flame-retardants have the ability to delay ignition but cannot prevent it completely. The most common flame-retardanls can be divided into four groups: inorganic-, organophosphoros-, halogenated- and nitrogen-based flame retardants. Som e of the commonly used flame-retardants have appeared lo cause damage to both the environment and human health. Three subslances (tris (2, 3 -d ibromopropyl) phosphate, tris (1 -aziridinyl) phosphine oxid e and polybrominated biphenyls) have subsequently been banned in Sweden for use with textiles that are worn in contacl wilh Ihe skin. Problems concerning flame-retardants' degrading properties on textiles were reported as earlyas the 1960 s, but there has been little further research into the subject. A chemical which has been frequently used is ammonium phosphate, Unfortunately, it has been shown lo degrade textile fibres and cause a colour change. Textile conservators may sometimes need lo test the presence of <b>flameretardants</b> in textiles to be able to choose the best conservation treaiment. The best way is to do an elemental analys is. One of the conclusions of this work is that flame-retardanl finishes {{have a negative effect on}} textiles, and that conservators and museum persannei who handle textile collections need lo be aware of this. ThaI is one way to help prevent further unnecessary treatments, especially on works of art. By discussing the matter with the local emergency services il may be possible lo find other solutions.

40|$|Estrogens, alkylphenols and bisphenol-A, {{enter the}} {{environment}} through waste water systems and waste disposal of manufactured products e. g. detergents, paints, polycarbonates and <b>flameretardants.</b> These analytes disrupt the endocrine function of living organisms affecting their reproductive health {{and those of}} future generations. Gas phase low molecular- mass aldehydes and amines are typically eye, nose, and throat irritants. Formaldehyde is classified as a probable human carcinogen. Given their negative impact on human health it is urgent to monitor pollutants at extremely low levels in both air and water. The aqueous pollutants are often concentrated using solid phase extraction cartridges or liquid-liquid extraction followed by derivatization. Methods that can most effectively and selectively pre-concentrate aldehydes and amines involve in situ derivatization. Unfortunately, the derivatizing reagents {{as well as their}} associated solvents or adsorbents, are responsible for problems encountered with these methods. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has emerged as the ideal concentration and reaction medium for trace analysis. However the expensive commercial devices such as SPME and SBSE both require the samples to be returned to the laboratory for concentration. Due to the open tubular nature of the PDMS multichannel trap (MCT), developed in our laboratory, it is ideally suited for on-site and online sampling. The MCTs have a high analyte capacity owing to the large volume of PDMS available for concentration. The derivatization reaction can be performed in situ providing a “onepot concentration and reaction device”. This allows for reduced risk of contamination of / or losses of the sample and a sampling method that can cater for both air and water samples. To demonstrate the versatility of the PDMS MCT, two approaches for concentration in PDMS were investigated in this study, namely, 1) the on-line concentration and in situ derivatization of volatile polar analytes from air followed by REMPI-TOFMS detection, and 2) the concentration of phenolic lipophilic analytes from water requiring derivatization prior to analysis by GC/MS. 1) Analyte and derivatizing reagent were simultaneously introduced into the PDMS trap using a ypress- fit connector. The reaction occurs in situ followed by thermal desorption using a thermal modulator array alone or in conjunction with a thermal desorption unit. The aldehydes and amine derivatives were successfully detected by the REMPI-TOFMS. Reaction efficiencies were determined at room temperature without catalysts. Formaldehyde yielded a low reaction/concentration efficiency of 41 % with phenylhydrazine in PDMS, while acetaldehyde, acrolein and crotonal displayed much improved values of 92, 61 and 74 % respectively. Both propylamine and butylamine yielded 28 % reaction/concentration efficiency with benzaldehyde in the PDMS matrix. Detection limits obtained with this technique were significantly lower than the permissible exposure limits set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It {{should be noted that the}} detection limits were not determined by actual measurement but by extrapolation from a larger signal. 2) Aqueous analytes were concentrated in the PDMS MCT using a gravity flow rate of ~ 50 ìl/min. The trap was dried and 5 ìl derivatizing reagent added. At room temperature and without the presence of a catalyst, the reaction of alkylphenols with trifluoroacetic acid anhydride in the PDMS matrix was 100 % complete after 5 minutes. Bisphenol-A reacted less than 50 % to completion during this period, but the amount of derivative formed remained constant. This study revealed that extraction efficiencies of the alkylphenols and bisphenol-A off the PDMS trap have poor batch-tobatch repeatability indicating that the PDMS matrix was not homogenous. For two different PDMS batches: tert-octylphenol displayed an extraction efficiency of 70 and 79 %, nonylphenol displayed 84 and 43 % while Bisphenol-A displayed 10 and 26 % respectively. The thermally desorbed derivatives were analysed by GC/MS. Despite background contamination in the desorption unit, detection limits were at the ppt level. Detection limits were not determined by actual measurement but by extrapolation from a larger signal. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Chemistryunrestricte...|$|R
