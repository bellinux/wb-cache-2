5|$|Several {{journalists and}} conservationists have {{challenged}} {{the logic of}} the strategy, arguing that destroying the ivory makes it scarcer, which should drive up black market prices and lead to an increase in poaching, rather than a decrease. Karl Mathiesen disputes this claim from a basic economics perspective, pointing out that it is the seizure of the ivory, not destroying it, which takes it off the market and affects its scarcity, so the price should not be significantly affected based on whether that seized ivory is kept stockpiled in a warehouse or destroyed. Although destroying seized ivory should not affect a perfectly rational market, Daniel Stiles suggests that what these events effectively communicate to poachers and illegal traders <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of scarcity, if not actual scarcity, which he argues could also lead to an increase in poaching.|$|E

These hallucinations, which are typically strange or unpleasant, are relatively common among {{individuals who have}} certain types of focal epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy.

It is also a field of study concerned with understanding of the environment critical to decision-makers in complex, dynamic areas from aviation, air traffic control, ship navigation, power plant operations, military command and control, and emergency services such as fire fighting and policing; to more ordinary but nevertheless complex tasks such as driving an automobile or riding a bicycle.|$|E

25|$|Auditory {{hallucinations}} (also {{known as}} paracusia) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of sound without outside stimulus. Auditory hallucinations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> {{most common type}} of hallucination. Auditory hallucinations can be divided into two categories: elementary and complex. Elementary hallucinations <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of sounds such as hissing, whistling, an extended tone, and more. In many cases, tinnitus is an elementary auditory hallucination. However, some people who experience certain types of tinnitus, especially pulsatile tinnitus, <b>are</b> actually hearing <b>the</b> blood rushing through vessels near the ear. Because <b>the</b> auditory stimulus <b>is</b> present in this situation, it does not qualify as a hallucination.|$|R

Through a variety of non-violent strategies, they have begun launching protests against the perceived bad conditions at Polunsky, in particular, and capital punishment, in general. They actively seek to consistently voice complaints to the administration, to organize grievance filing to address problems. They occupy day rooms, non-violently refuse to evacuate their cells or initiate sit-ins in visiting rooms, hallways, pod runs and recreation yards when there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> of an act of abuse of authority by guards (verbal abuse; physical abuse; meals/recreations or showers being wrongly denied; unsanitary day rooms and showers being allowed to persist; medical being denied; paper work being denied; refusing to contact higher rank {{to address the problems}} and complaints) and when alleged retaliation (thefts, denials, destruction of property; food restrictions; wrongful denials of visits; abuse of inmates) is carried out in response to their grievances.|$|E

To what extent do first-year teachers perceive their preparation programmes as having assisted them to develop attributes which appear to be necessary for competent teaching? 3.

What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of first-year teachers concerning specific ares of strength or weakness in their preparation programmes? 5.

Instead of seeing just one point, a person with keratoconus sees many images of the point, spread out in a chaotic pattern. This pattern does not typically change from day to day, but over time, it often takes on new forms. People also commonly notice streaking and flaring distortion around light sources. Some even notice the images moving relative to one another in time with their heart beat.|$|E

40|$|While {{educational}} testing {{has been in}} place since the one room school house, it <b>was</b> not until <b>the</b> 1990 s that accountability began to accompany assessment programs. With the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) in 2001, virtually every public school district in the United States of America that desired to continue to receive Title 1 funding found themselves tied to rigorous assessment and accountability systems. This focus on accountability has impacted every school, district, and state as they have sought to implement and deal with the consequences it has wrought. As the 50 states have sought to deal with federal mandates, other countries are seeking better alternatives for national testing systems as well. Countless data have been collected and articles written over the past decade concerning the impact and subsequent ramifications of NCLB. This study sought to bring to the discussion a missing factor, that being the voice of practitioners. Amidst the volumes of information, there is a void of hard evidence from the field. The research sought to answer five questions: (1) What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of Kentucky educators concerning the results of the Kentucky Core Content for Assessment (KCCT) as an accurate reflection of student learning of Mathematics and Reading in specific areas (e. g., student learning, content taught, and instructional guidance) ?; (2) What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of Kentucky educators concerning the difficulty of the KCCT for students of different academic ability levels?; (3) What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of Kentucky educators concerning the accuracy of student performance classification for the results of the KCCT?; (4) What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of Kentucky educators in regard to the KCCT results being an accurate reflection in relation to student ability for the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) sub-groups of Special Education, Free/Reduced Lunch, and English as a Second Language (ESL) ?; and (5) What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of Kentucky educators concerning the accuracy of the KCCT, as opposed to other national measures? Results indicate reservations exist concerning the accuracy of results of the Kentucky assessment system. Further study is warranted to determine the underlying causation of perceptions of Kentucky educators...|$|R

Parents perception of gender stereotyping will further influence how children act according to gender, which is why it is of importance to explore how parents perceive gender stereotyped advertising towards their children and how this is linked to socially responsible marketing. Research questions: RQ: What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of Swedish parents on gender stereotypes in advertisements targeted at children, and how can this be linked to socially responsible marketing? SQ 1 : What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents on advertisements towards children where stereotyped gender roles are being reinforced? SQ 2 : What <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> of parents on advertisements towards children where stereotyped gender roles are being challenged? Purpose: The purpose of this research <b>is</b> to link <b>the</b> idea of socially responsible marketing with gender stereotyping and advertising targeting children. Methodology: Using visual materials as stimuli in semi-structured focused interviews. Conclusion: The empirical investigation revealed that parents perceived gender stereotypes in advertising as harmful to society, particularly to children. Socially responsible marketing should therefore reflect more on this subject and portray both girls and boys sharing colors, attributes and toys...|$|R
