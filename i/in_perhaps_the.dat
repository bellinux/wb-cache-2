5|$|Lessons for Children is {{a series}} of four age-adapted reading primers written by the {{prominent}} 18th-century British poet and essayist Anna Laetitia Barbauld. Published in 1778 and 1779, the books initiated a revolution in children's literature in the Anglo-American world. For the first time, the needs of the child reader were seriously considered: the typographically simple texts progress in difficulty as the child learns. <b>In</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> first demonstration of experiential pedagogy in Anglo-American children's literature, Barbauld's books use a conversational style, which depicts a mother and her son discussing the natural world. Based on the educational theories of John Locke, Barbauld's books emphasise learning through the senses.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Seven participated <b>in</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> {{most famous}} Stanley Cup {{challenge}} of all, that of Dawson City of the Yukon Territory in 1905. Organized by Joe Boyle, a Toronto-born prospector, who had struck it {{rich in the}} Yukon gold rush of 1898, The Dawson City Nuggets had Lorne Hanna, who had played for Brandon against Ottawa in a 1904 challenge and two former elite hockey players: Weldy Young, who had played for Ottawa in the 1890s, and D. R. McLennan, who had played for Queen's College against the Montreal Victorias in an 1895 challenge. The remaining players were selected from other Dawson City clubs. Dawson City's challenge was accepted {{in the summer of}} 1904 by the Stanley Cup trustees and scheduled to start on Friday, January 13, 1905. The date of the challenge meant that Young had to travel separately to Ottawa, as he had to work in a federal election that December and would meet the club in Ottawa.|$|E

25|$|The Cowboys fairytale year {{continued}} {{when they}} upset the 2nd place Bulldogs {{away from home}} {{in the first week}} of the finals, 30–22, thanks largely to hat-trick hero Matt Sing. The following week the Cowboys defeated their state rivals the Brisbane Broncos at home, 10–0, <b>in</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> club's most famous victory.|$|E
25|$|McGhee heavily {{invested}} in the squad in the post-season, and Rovers were considered among the favourites for promotion to League One. However, the club made a dire start, and were {{near the bottom of}} the table from the earliest weeks of the season. By December 2012 it was clear that Rovers were <b>in</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> biggest danger of dropping out of the Football League they had ever been, which resulted in McGhee being sacked and former manager John Ward returning to the club. The club's form greatly improved in the weeks that followed, and another safe finish was achieved, this time 14th.|$|E
25|$|Feeling {{confident}} in his army after defeating the Union at Second Bull Run, Lee {{embarked on an}} invasion of the north that was stopped by McClellan at the bloody Battle of Antietam. Despite this, McClellan was relieved from command for refusing to pursue Lee's crippled army. The next commander, General Ambrose Burnside, suffered a humiliating defeat by Lee's smaller army at the Battle of Fredericksburg late in 1862, causing yet another change in commanders. Lee won again at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, while losing his top aide, Stonewall Jackson. But Lee pushed too hard and ignored the Union threat in the west. Lee invaded Pennsylvania in search of supplies and to cause war-weariness in the North. <b>In</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> turning point of the war, Lee's army was badly beaten at the Battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863, and barely {{made it back to}} Virginia.|$|E

25|$|The San Diego Chargers {{got out to}} a fast {{start from}} Darren Sproles' 89-yard opening kickoff return for a {{touchdown}}. After a later field goal, Sproles would follow up with a 45-yard punt return for a touchdown in the first quarter. He became only the second player in NFL history, and first since 1958, to return a kickoff and a punt for touchdowns in the opening quarter. San Diego failed on the subsequent two-point conversion to lead 16–0. With 8:47 left in the second quarter, LaDainian Tomlinson rushed for a four-yard touchdown to give the Chargers a 23–0 advantage. Peyton Manning would lead the Colts down the field and capped the drive with an 8-yard TD pass to receiver Reggie Wayne. Later, in the fourth quarter, Manning threw a 7-yard score to running back Kenton Keith. Twenty-five seconds later, linebacker Gary Brackett recovered a fumble in the endzone for a touchdown. The Colts attempted a rush for the two-point conversion {{to tie the game}} 23–23, but were held short. With a 23–21 lead, the Colts got the ball back with only a few minutes left in the game. They marched down the field into San Diego territory. On fourth down with 1:31 remaining, Adam Vinatieri was put in for a 29-yard field goal try. Vinatieri, despite being known for his clutch kicks and having over a 95% success rate in field goals under 30yards, missed wide to the right. Vinatieri missed an earlier 42yard try {{at the end of the}} half, going 0–2 in the game. It was the first time since 2001 Vinatieri was 0–2 kicking field goals. The Colts would get the ball back, but Manning would seal a Chargers win by throwing an interception with no time remaining. Manning struggled in the game, throwing a career-high 6 interceptions. The mark is also a Colts franchise record. Chargers cornerback Antonio Cromartie had three interceptions in the game, becoming one of only 11 Chargers to have three picks in a single game. The Colts were heavily injured on both sides of the ball. Receivers Marvin Harrison and Anthony Gonzalez, left tackle Tony Ugoh, and tight end Dallas Clark missed the game. <b>In</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> biggest blow to the Colts, Dwight Freeney injured his left foot and was carted off the field. Three days later, it was confirmed that Freeney had suffered a season-ending Lisfranc fracture. By the end of the game, a total of nine Colts on their 53-man roster either did not play due to injury or were injured in the game. The Colts dropped to 7–2, remaining in first place in the AFC South division. Meanwhile, the Chargers moved to 5–4 and clear first in the AFC West.|$|E
500|$|A {{movie version}} of Hair, with a {{screenplay}} by Michael Weller, was directed by Miloš Forman and released in 1979. [...] Filmed primarily in New York City's Central Park and Washington Square Park, the cast includes Treat Williams, Beverly D'Angelo, John Savage, Foley and Golden. [...] Several of the songs were deleted, and the film's storyline departs significantly from the musical. [...] The character of Claude is rewritten as an innocent draftee from Oklahoma, newly arrived in New York to join the military, and Sheila is a high-society debutante who catches his eye. [...] <b>In</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> greatest diversion from the stage version, a mistake leads Berger to go to Vietnam in Claude's place, where he is killed.|$|E
500|$|At {{roughly the}} same time, <b>in</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most {{carefully}} crafted portion of the entire offensive, the Canadian Corps launched an assault on Vimy Ridge. Advancing behind a creeping barrage and making heavy use of machine guns – eighty to each brigade, including one Lewis gun in each platoon – the corps was able to advance through about [...] of German defences and captured {{the crest of the}} ridge at about 13:00. Military historians have attributed the success of this attack to careful planning by Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng and his subordinate General Arthur Currie, constant training and the assignment of specific objectives to each platoon. By giving units specific goals, troops could continue the attack even if their officers were killed or communication broke down, thus bypassing two major problems of combat on the Western Front. [...] The Canadian troops could see the Germans in retreat across the Douai Plain away from the ridge.There was nevertheless an inflexibility to the plan which prevented the leading troops from continuing the advance and on 10 April the Germans began to stop the gaps with reserves.|$|E

500|$|Jacques {{began her}} {{association}} with the Carry On series in March 1958 with the first film in the series, Carry On Sergeant. She played the small role of Captain Clark, a [...] "battleaxe medical officer" [...] who fails to believe the fabricated ailments of the hypochondriac Private Horace Strong, played by Kenneth Connor. The following year she played [...] "Matron" [...] {{for the first time}} in Carry On Nurse, a film which broke that year's box office records, selling more than 10 million tickets in British cinemas. Although Jacques's role was still relatively small, she appeared <b>in</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> best known scene of the film, in which she retrieves a daffodil from Wilfrid Hyde-White's buttocks, put there by a mischievous nurse as revenge for his constant harassment of the staff. So popular was Jacques's scene, that the producers imported two million plastic daffodils from Japan which were then used to promote the comedy. Other characterisations followed, including the formidable maths mistress Grace Short in Carry On Teacher (1959) and the friendly Police Sergeant Laura Moon in Carry On Constable (1960). Of the former film, Derek Prouse of The Sunday Times thought that Jacques [...] "triumph over material so remorselessly juvenile that one is battered into a kind of fascinated admiration".|$|E

2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> {{most famous}} and most well known NASCAR race, the 1979 Daytona 500, held February 18, 1979, a race that Richard Petty won, Waltrip was a pre-race {{favorite}} to win the race. As the first NASCAR race covered [...] "flag to flag" [...] on national television, [...] Cale Yarborough, and Donnie Allison, while battling for the lead on the last lap, came together and crashed hard, taking each other out, in the third turn. While the Allison and Yarborough cars were spinning and coming {{to rest in the}} grassy infield, attention turned quickly to the new leaders, Richard Petty running third, and Waltrip, running closely behind in fourth, as a fist fight ensued between Yarborough, Donnie Allison, and his brother and racer, Bobby Allison, in the turn three grass. Earlier in the race, Waltrip's DiGard Gatorade Oldsmobile, dropped a cylinder and while able to hang onto the slipstream of the Petty car on the final lap, was not able to draft past the Petty car in the fourth turn on the final lap due to the reduction in horsepower. Still, Waltrip finished runner-up <b>in</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>the</b> most famous race in NASCAR history, and was an early turning point in Waltrip's career.|$|E
