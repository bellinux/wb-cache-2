5|$|Aware {{that the}} public {{appreciated}} instrumental music with context, Liszt provided written prefaces for nine of his symphonic poems. However, Liszt's view of the symphonic poem tended to be evocative, using music to create a general mood or atmosphere rather than to illustrate a narrative or describe something literally. In this regard, Liszt authority Humphrey Searle suggests that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> closer to his contemporary Hector Berlioz than to many who would follow him in writing symphonic poems.|$|E
5|$|Burnell was a {{dominant}} figure {{during the first}} part of Edward's reign, and he controlled most aspects of royal administration. He was involved not only in domestic issues but also in foreign relations, a responsibility he retained for two decades after Edward's return to England in 1274. Huscroft argues that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> the most important royal administrator of the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|His origins are unknown, {{but he was}} {{probably}} not a native Englishman. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> German or Norman. The historian Katharine Keats-Rohan suggests that he was possibly the nephew of Peter, who was the Bishop of Chester and a Norman. His name was a German or French name, which suggests that Regenbald {{was one of the}} foreigners that gained favour with King Edward the Confessor.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{disagree}} on the year of Ajtony's defeat; it may have occurred in 1002, 1008 or between 1027 and 1030. His ethnicity is also a subject of historical debate; <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Hungarian, Kabar, Pecheneg or Romanian. In Romanian historiography Ajtony is viewed as the last member of a Romanian ruling family founded by Glad, lord of Banat around 900 according to the Gesta Hungarorum.|$|E
5|$|However records {{indicate}} that Lochner's talent was recognised {{from an early}} age. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> of Netherlandish origin or worked there for a master, possibly Robert Campin.

The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926, when Heuveldorp directed the colony's first feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng.

5|$|Militarily, the {{location}} makes sense {{as a place}} where refugees and the southwestern Brythons of Dumnonia could have defended themselves against attacks from the east.

5|$|Nigel died on 30 May 1169. In either 1164 or in 1166, or {{possibly}} both, {{he had been}} struck by paralysis, and after this {{he seems to have}} withdrawn from active affairs. He took little part in the disputes between the king and Thomas Becket, although he did agree with his fellow bishops who opposed the king's attempt to reduce clerical benefits. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> buried at Ely, where a 12th-century marble slab possibly marks his tomb.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> still <b>been</b> a {{child when}} he became king {{following}} his father's death on 14 July 664, because his mother Seaxburh <b>was</b> recorded as <b>having</b> <b>been</b> regent.|$|R

5|$|After {{the seizure}} of the 377 hostages, NATO did not carry out further air strikes, but it did {{continue}} regular air patrol operations {{in support of the}} no-fly zone. On 2 June 1995, Captain Scott O'Grady of the United States Air Force was sent on a routine no-fly zone patrol in his F-16. While on patrol, O'Grady's F-16 was shot down by a Serb SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near Mrkonjić Grad. O'Grady ejected safely, but found himself trapped in Serb-controlled territory. According to many US officials, <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> deliberately targeted so that the Serbs could take an American hostage.|$|E
5|$|Ceawlin (also spelled Ceaulin and Caelin, died ca. 593) was a King of Wessex. <b>He</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{the son of}} Cynric of Wessex and the {{grandson}} of Cerdic of Wessex, whom the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle represents {{as the leader of}} the first group of Saxons to come to the land which later became Wessex. Ceawlin was active during the last years of the Anglo-Saxon expansion, with little of southern England remaining in the control of the native Britons by the time of his death.|$|E

5|$|Day's {{origins and}} the events of his early life remain obscure.

5|$|Despite Mitică's {{association}} with Bucharest and his usual most common {{career as a}} state employee, several commentators have recounted that <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> based on Gheorghe Matheescu, an entrepreneur {{from the town of}} Sinaia (located on the Prahova Valley, in northern Muntenia). Matheescu took pride in this supposed connection, and, around 1939, argued in its favor in front of literary historian Şerban Cioculescu. Cioculescu recorded the rumor, and indicated that it was backed by information received from Caragiale's daughter, Ecaterina Logadi. Her father reportedly enjoyed Matheescu's company, and, in 1901, even authored short advertisements for his store.|$|E
5|$|Domnall's rise {{to power}} in the Kingdom of Dublin took place in 1075, after the {{expulsion}} of the reigning Gofraid mac Amlaíb meic Ragnaill, King of Dublin by the latter's overlord, Toirdelbach Ua Briain, King of Munster. The circumstances surrounding Domnall's accession are uncertain. He may have collaborated with Gofraid to wrench the kingdom from {{the grip of the}} Uí Briain, or <b>he</b> <b>may</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> installed in the kingship by Toirdelbach himself, and ruled under the latter's overlordship.
