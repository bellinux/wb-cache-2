40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{document}} is to define the quality assurance (QA) methods for scanners using the ice-water phantom and the corresponding software developed within the IMI QuIC-ConCePT project, for the upcoming ‘BOS 2 ’ trials. The outlined methods are what we consider to constitute {{the best use of}} currently available data following our recent papers [1] [2] in which we studied ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) measurements corresponding to five phantom tubes obtained from four scanners located at four different sites. Scanners are required to gain approval based on their phantom data quality in order to proceed to the clinical trial. The idea is to obtain one phantom data-set from each site before site activation and one week prior to clinical scans. Scanners used in our recent study resulted in about 6 % average measurement variability in healthy liver data. These results and those from phantom studies, have been used here to set criteria for QA pass/fail. To approve the quality of each new scanner, several metrics of image quality will be automatically extracted from phantom data-sets. A simple statistical analysis then provides a three step procedure for the pass or <b>fail</b> <b>decision.</b> The full process is described below with example data. For the current QA we concentrate on signal to noise and absolute quantitation, ignoring issues of fat suppression and inhomogeneity which will need to be addressed separately (where possible) ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} the best determinants of fitness-to-drive after stroke, following a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Twenty databases were searched, from inception until May 1, 2010. Potentially relevant studies were reviewed by two authors for eligibility. Methodological quality {{was assessed by}} Newcastle-Ottawa scores. The fitness-to-drive outcome was a pass – <b>fail</b> <b>decision</b> following an on-road evaluation. Differences in off-road performance between the pass and fail groups were calculated using weighted mean effect sizes (dw). Statistical heterogeneity was determined with the I² statistic. Random-effects models were performed when the assumption of homogeneity was not met. Cut-off scores of accurate determinants were estimated via receiver operating characteristic analyses. Results: Thirty studies {{were included in the}} systematic review and 27 in the meta-analysis. Out of 1728 participants, 938 (54 %) passed the on-road evaluation. The best determinants were Road Sign Recognition (dw, 1. 22; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI], 1. 01 − 1. 44; I², 58 %), Compass (dw, 1. 06; 95 % CI, 0. 74 − 1. 39; I², 36 %), and Trail Making Test B (TMT B; dw, 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 48 − 1. 15; I², 49 %). Cut-off values of 8. 5 points for Road Sign Recognition, 25 points for Compass, and 90 seconds for TMT B were identified to classify unsafe drivers with accuracies of 84 %, 85 % and 80 %, respectively. Three out of four studies found no increased risk of accident involvement in persons cleared to resume driving after stroke. Conclusions: The Road Sign Recognition, Compass and TMT B are clinically administrable office-based tests {{that can be used to}} identify persons with stroke at-risk of failing an on-road assessment. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} measurement of a stimulus generator suitable for on-chip RF test aimed at gain, 1 -dB compression point (CP), and the blocking profile measurement. Implemented in a 90 -nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS), the generator consists of two low-noise voltage-controlled ring oscillators (VCOs) and an adder. It can generate a single-or two-tone signal {{in a range of}} 0. 9 - 5. 6 GHz with a tone spacing of 3 MHz to 4. 5 GHz and adjustable output power. The VCOs are based on symmetrically loaded double-differential delay line architecture. The measured phase noise is - 80 dBc/Hz at an offset frequency of 1 MHz for the oscillation frequency of 2. 4 GHz. A single VCO consumes 26 mW at 1 GHz while providing - 10 -dBm power into a 50 -Omega load. The silicon area of the complete test circuit including coupling capacitors is only 0. 03 mm(2), while a single VCO occupies 0. 012 mm(2). The measured gain, 1 -dB CP, and blocking profile of the wideband receiver using the on-chip stimulus generator are within +/- 8 %, +/- 10 %, and +/- 18 % of their actual values, respectively. These error values are acceptable for making a pass or <b>fail</b> <b>decision</b> during production testing. © 2010 IEEE. Personal use of this material is permitted.

40|$|Introduction. The {{goal of this}} {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis was to identify the best screening tools for fitness-to-drive after stroke. Methods. Eleven electronic databases, 5 abstract databases and 4 current trials registries were searched, from inception of database until May 1, 2010. The search identified 3264 citations. Original studies were scanned in duplicate for eligibility. The fitness-to-drive outcome was a pass – <b>fail</b> <b>decision</b> on an on-road test. Methodological quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa scores. Weighted mean effect sizes (Dw) of determinants were calculated using fixed-effects models. Statistical heterogeneity was estimated with the I² statistic. Random-effects models were performed when the assumption of homogeneity was not met. Cut-off scores of valid determinants were determined via receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Results. Thirty studies {{were included in the}} {{systematic review}} and 27 in the meta-analysis. Out of 1728 stroke patients, 938 (54 %) passed the on-road evaluation. The most valid determinants were road sign recognition test (Dw, 1. 22; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI], 1. 01 - 1. 44; I², 72 %), compass test (Dw, 1. 06; 95 % CI, 0. 74 - 1. 39; I², 82 %), and Trail Making Test, part B (TMT B; Dw, 0. 81; 95 % CI, 0. 48 - 1. 15; I², 0 %). Cut-off values of 8. 5 points for road sign recognition, 25 points for compass, and 90 seconds for TMT B were identified to correctly classify unsafe drivers with an accuracy of 84 %, 85 % and 80 %, respectively. Conclusion. The road sign recognition, compass and TMT B are clinically administrable office-based tests {{that could be used to}} determine at-risk stroke survivors to be referred for further on-road assessment. status: accepte...|$|E

To determine the most credible and feasible standard setting method for clinical examinations (OSCEs), the outcomes {{from three different}} methods were compared. Summary of work: Modified Angoff (MAM), Borderline Group (BGM), and Borderline Regression (BRM) standard setting methods were applied to nine OSCE stations for 103 first year and 106 second year student. The same set of five examiners standard set each OSCE station using {{each of the three}} methods.

An earlier study found little or no effect of using multiple SPs on the intercase reliability of checklist scores, written scores, and total scores. The present study was conducted to assess the effect of multiple SPs on the intercase reliability of SP ratings of interpersonal and communication skills. Although the ratings were not used to determine total scores or to make pass - <b>fail</b> <b>decisions,</b> it seems reasonable to expeJt that multiple SPs might have a greater impact on ratings on non-cognitive dimensions than on ostensibly more objective checklist and written scores. In general, the results showed that generalizability coefficients free of measurement error due to multiple SPs were larger than those reflecting measurement error due to multiple SPs by an average of about 5 percentage points, suggesting that the use of multiple SP raters on the same case reduced reliability by about 5 percentage points.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is twofold: i) to focus {{attention}} descriptively on some important aspects of decision making in teams - namely; the sense making process, the nature of multiple perspectives and interpretations, the interdependency of problems {{that make up a}} difficult and messy situation, the nature of purposeful behaviour - goals systems, and perspectives on psychological and social negotiation; and ii) to explore ways of translating these descriptions into prescriptions that might reduce the probability of decision failures. The description of decision making and problem solving processes presented in the chapter links directly with some of the aspects of decision making that might decrease the probability of failures. Theories from psychology, social psychology, group processes, the nature of problems and psychological and social negotiation are used as a basis for description. The chapter introduces cognitive and causal mapping as a method for describing and managing decision situations including: sense making, multiple perspectives, and goals systems. The chapter also considers the use of causal mapping as a tool for facilitating negotiation in teams and so aiding the reaching of agreements about how to act. In addition the chapter discusses the role of group support systems (GSS) and operational research in addressing aspects of decision failure. In particular the use of a GSS is argued to address delivering a balance between the potential benefits and potential dangers accrued from drawing multiple stakeholders into decision making situations. The chapter draws particularly upon the research of Nutt that led to his analysis of <b>failed</b> <b>decisions</b> (Nutt, 2002) ...|$|R
