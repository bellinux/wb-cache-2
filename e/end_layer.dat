50|$|No callus is formed. This {{is often}} due to {{impaired}} bony healing, for example due to vascular causes (e.g. impaired blood {{supply to the}} bone fragments) or metabolic causes (e.g. diabetes or smoking). Failure of initial union, for example when bone fragments are separated by soft tissue may also lead to atrophic non-union. Atrophic non-union can be treated by improving fixation, removing the <b>end</b> <b>layer</b> of bone to provide raw ends for healing, {{and the use of}} bone grafts.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>end</b> <b>Layer</b> was {{betrayed by}} two female friends and placed under arrest; {{he managed to}} escape, but was retaken after a chase the same evening and closely {{confined}} in the Tower of London. His clerks were placed under the surveillance of messengers, and his wife, Elizabeth Elwin of Aylesham, was brought to town from Dover in custody. The case was carried {{to the court of}} king's bench on 31 October 1722. Layer stumbled to the bar heavily fettered, and was compelled to stand, although ill.|$|E
50|$|Reference to {{the story}} is also made by Carl Sagan in his book Contact. The tale and the Tanabata festival are also {{the basis of the}} Sailor Moon side story {{entitled}} Chibiusa's Picture Diary-Beware the Tanabata!, where both Vega and Altair make an appearance. The Post-Hardcore band La Dispute named and partially based their first album, Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair, after the tale. The JRPG Bravely Second: <b>End</b> <b>Layer</b> also uses the names Vega and Altair for a pair of story-important characters who shared a love interest in each other years before the game's story began.|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to assess vermiculite, a {{phyllosilicate}} mineral group with high cation exchange capacity, as an alternative for activated carbon. In this investigation, the adsorption potential of raw vermiculite grade 2 was evaluated using vermiculite clay mineral barrier system for reducing pollutant loads in specially designed treatment system, where the important parameters like flow rate, effluent loading rate required were optimized. The VCMB treatment system has reduced the Cr in the outlet <b>end</b> soil <b>layer</b> by 66. 1 % than the inlet <b>end</b> soil <b>layer.</b> The build up of Cr in the middle vermiculite was 6. 1 times more than the inlet end soil which could be attributed to its adsorption and retention properties. With reference to Na, the vermiculite treatment layer retained 12. 7 times more than the top surface soil and 4. 29 times as that of the inlet <b>end</b> soil <b>layer.</b> These results confirm that for the removal of Cr, salts and Na from chrome tannery effluent, the VCMB treatment system could be viable option. But in case of sulphate, it was found that its accumulation was the highest in the inlet <b>end</b> soil <b>layer</b> and was 4. 24 times lower in the middle vermiculite layer which could be due to the lower anion exchange capacity of vermiculite compared with soil layer...|$|R
40|$|Direct {{evidence}} of the nonuniformly canted state of the spin-flop phase induced by a magnetic field applied to Fe/Cr(100) superlattices is obtained by polarized neutron reflectometry. It is unambiguously demonstrated that the magnetization of the alternating Fe layers is twisted through the multilayer stack proving a stable noncollinear configuration. The maximal tilt at the <b>end</b> <b>layers</b> progressively reduces towards {{the center of the}} multilayer. The set of tilt angles is deduced from a model-free data evaluation employing the supermatrix routine. Spin-flip off-specular scattering is determined by the in-plane magnetization fluctuations and is fitted by a theoretical model of domains...|$|R

50|$|The {{game was}} the third best-selling game during its release week in Japan, selling around 85,000 copies. During its second week and third week, it sold over 11,000 and 2,000 copies respectively. In {{addition}} to its physical copies, the game garnered nearly 23,000 digital copies during May 2015. It was the most downloaded title in Japan {{for the month of}} May, largely surpassing other titles such as Minecraft, Bravely Second: <b>End</b> <b>Layer,</b> and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. As of June 2015, 110,000 physical copies had been sold. By the end of the year, a total of 114,665 were sold in Japan.|$|E
50|$|Bravely Default {{was first}} {{announced}} in September 2011 {{as part of}} Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the platform. In the run-up to release, multiple demos were developed, and the team adjusted the game using feedback from players. For the Sequel was the version chosen for overseas release, being localized without any subtitle. In both Japan and overseas, Bravely Default met with strong sales and critical acclaim. Common praise went to the gameplay's mixture of traditional mechanics and new elements, along with its storyline, graphics and music. Main points of criticism were its repetitive late-game stages and elements of its social gameplay and audio. Bravely Default spawned multiple media tie-ins and spin-off games. A direct sequel, Bravely Second: <b>End</b> <b>Layer,</b> was released in 2015 in Japan and 2016 overseas.|$|E
50|$|A browser game {{spin-off}} titled Bravely Default: Praying Brage, {{began an}} open beta on November 11, 2012. Developed by NHN Hangame, Praying Brage takes place 200 {{years after the}} original game, and includes a new cast of characters aligned to four forces themed after Luxendarc's elemental crystals. Another spin-off, Bravely Archive: D's Report, was released for mobile devices on January 22, 2015. Like Praying Brage, it was set far in the future, followed an alternate scenario stemming from the events of Bravely Default, and featured characters from Praying Brage. By August of that year, D's Report had reached over four million downloads. A sequel was confirmed as being in development as early as 2013. The new game, Bravely Second: <b>End</b> <b>Layer,</b> was officially announced in December 2013. It released in Japan in 2015 and overseas in 2016. In an interview with Japanese magazine Dengeki, Asano {{said that he would}} ideally like to release a new Bravely game every year.|$|E
40|$|Complex {{barriers}} at the brain’s surface, {{particularly in}} development, are poorly defined. In the adult, arachnoid blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier separates the fenestrated dural vessels from the CSF {{by means of}} a cell layer joined by tight junctions. Outer CSF-brain barrier provides diffusion restriction between brain and subarachnoid CSF through an initial radial glial <b>end</b> feet <b>layer</b> covered with a pial surface layer. To further characterize these interfaces we examined embryonic rat brains from E 10 to P 0 and forebrains from human embryos and fetuses (6 th- 21 st weeks post conception) and adults using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. Antibodies against claudin- 11, BLBP, collagen 1, SSEA- 4, MAP 2, YKL- 40, and its receptor IL- 13 Rα 2 and EAAT 1 were used to describe morphological characteristics and functional aspects of the outer brain barriers. Claudin- 11 was a reliable marker of the arachnoid blood-CSF barrier. Collagen 1 delineated the subarachnoid space and stained pial surface layer. BLBP defined radial glial <b>end</b> feet <b>layer</b> and SSEA- 4 and YKL- 40 were present in both leptomeningeal cells and <b>end</b> feet <b>layer,</b> which transformed into glial limitans. IL- 13 Rα 2 and EAAT 1 were present in the <b>end</b> feet <b>layer</b> illustrating transporter/receptor presence in the outer CSF-brain barrier. MAP 2 immunostaining in adult brain outlined the lower border of glia limitans; remnants of end feet were YKL- 40 positive in some areas. We propose that outer brain barriers are composed of at least 3 interfaces: blood-CSF barrier across arachnoid barrier cell layer, blood-CSF barrier across pial microvessels and outer CSF-brain barrier comprising glial end feet layer/pial surface layer...|$|R

This work presents a Legacy to Grid framework (LGF) which enables semi-automatic virtualization of legacy codes as grid services. In contrast to existing work, LGF goes beyond a simple adapter-pattern approach; it follows a two-tier design in which the adaptation service layer is loosely coupled with the legacy back <b>end</b> <b>layer.</b> We present the architecture of our framework, its basic operation, and its capabilities: support for different interaction patterns with a legacy code and for computation migration to enable fault-tolerance and dynamic load balancing of legacy codes.

40|$|In {{the upgrade}} project of Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPC) II, a novel Detector Control System (DCS) for Beijing Spectrometer (BES) III is under developing. The {{principal}} {{task of the}} DCS is to supervise and control {{the status of the}} BESIII detector and to guarantee a safe operation to the detector. The DCS must provide a uniform and coherent interface to the detector operators even though there are a large number of distributed I/O channels from large variety of equipments. For this reason, the DCS is hierarchically organized and divided into three layers: Front <b>End</b> <b>Layer</b> (FEL), Local Control Layer (LCL) and Global Control Layer (GCL). In the FEL, ranges from simple sensors up to complex computer-based devices like embedded systems and Programmable Logical Controllers (PLC) are utilized. A LabVIEW based software framework has been developed for the LCL. Network communication and web server technologies have been used for the GCL. This paper will give a detailed introduction to the design and implementation of the DCS. Its performance and reliability will also be discussed in the last...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Computing and Information SciencesDaniel A. AndresenThe {{objective}} of this project is to build an e-commerce website using ASP.

Hence, {{it is used to}} build the presentation layer. The business logic layer is developed in ASP. NET 2. 0 and J 2 EE, exposing the functions as web services. Two similar clients have been developed in ASP. NET. These two clients invoke the. NET and J 2 EE web services. The two similar websites are subjected to testing for correctness and performance. Stress and load testing is performed thoroughly on the website. A detailed analysis of the results is done using the response times and throughputs from various tests. This report proves that we can build a website using a presentation tier developed in ASP. NET consuming any of the two technologies’ (ASP. NET & J 2 EE) web services. This proves to be very useful in scenarios where we need the best overall user experience regardless of the technology, to replace or extend an existing business tier by using a different technology...|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of specular reflection and off-specular scattering with polarized neutrons gives a unique {{detailed information on}} the lateral and transverse spin-configuration of a magnetic multilayer stack. We present the first direct experimental observation of a phenomenon predicted theoretically for antiferromagnetically coupled multilayers: the twisted ground-state configuration in an external magnetic field. This twisted configuration arises due to the reduced symmetry of magnetic moments of the <b>end</b> <b>layers</b> having only one neighbor. This fact can be established directly via the qualitative analysis of the line shape of the superstructure peaks on the specular line and the related off-specular Bragg sheet. Additional quantitative evaluation of both specular reflection and off-specular scattering allows one to deduce the layer-by-layer spin configuration through the multilayer stack, as well as within {{the plane of the}} layer. The presence of spin-flip off-specular scattering means that the layer magnetization is laterally not homogeneous but is decomposed into a set of domains. The distribution of magnetic moments within each domain, the domains size and their distributions are obtained. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Flow {{of fluid}} through a porous media {{is a very}} {{important}} phenomenon that occurs largely in many physical situations such as flow in an aquifer, flow through filters for water purification in sewage treatment plant, flow in packed bed chemical reactor, etc. Permeability is a characteristic parameter for a porous media and it tells about the ease with which water flows through the interconnected voids. Since it directly influences the rate of flow of water in a soil, it has a decisive effect on problems involving excavations of open cuts in sand below water table, seepage through embankment dams, sub-grade drainage, rate of consolidation of compressible soil, etc. In a soil profile, each layer may have its own properties {{which may or may not}} be same as compared to the layer below or above it. The relative position and the thickness of a soil layer of a stratified soil system are some of the important parameters which affect the permeability of the composite soil layer. In the present study the experiments have, therefore, been conducted to investigate the influence of position and thickness of the individual layer on the permeability of the composite soil.
