On the sixth day, during fairer weather, their ship came upon a group of islands in the Yellow Sea where Chinese pirates were moored. The pirates robbed their ship of spare goods and rations, threw away the Koreans' oars and anchor, and left them to drift aimlessly into the sea.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the best-known}} peninsulas in Ireland are in County Kerry; the Dingle peninsula, the {{aforementioned}} Iveragh peninsula and the Beara peninsula. The Ards peninsula {{is one of the}} larger peninsulas outside Kerry. The Inishowen peninsula in County Donegal includes Ireland's most northerly point, Malin Head and several important towns including Buncrana on Lough Swilly, Carndonagh and Moville on Lough Foyle. Ireland's most northerly land feature is Inishtrahull island, off Malin Head. Rockall Island may <b>deserve</b> <b>this</b> honour but its status is disputed, being claimed by the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Denmark (for the Faroe Islands) and Iceland. The most southerly point is the Fastnet Rock.|$|E
25|$|In Calvinist (Reformed) theology, {{unconditional}} {{election is}} considered to be one aspect of predestination in which God chooses certain individuals to be saved. Those elected receive mercy, while those not elected, the reprobates, receive justice without condition. This unconditional election is essentially related {{to the rest of the}} TULIP doctrinal outline and hinges upon the supreme belief in the absolute sovereignty of God over the affairs of man. God unconditionally elects certain people even though they are sinful as an act of his saving grace apart from the shortcomings or will of man. Those chosen have done nothing to <b>deserve</b> <b>this</b> grace.|$|E

He would have deserved it even if he had not made this discovery. But everyone recognized that the splitting of the atomic nucleus merited a Nobel Prize."

2500|$|In {{deciding}} whether Marbury had a remedy, Marshall stated: [...] "The Government of the United States has been emphatically termed {{a government of}} laws, and not of men. It will certainly cease to <b>deserve</b> <b>this</b> high appellation if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right." [...] One of the key legal principles on which Marbury relies {{is the notion that}} for every violation of a vested legal right, there must be a legal remedy. Marshall next described two distinct types of Executive actions: political actions, where the official can exercise discretion, and purely ministerial functions, where the official is legally required to do something. Marshall found that delivering the appointment to Marbury was a purely ministerial function required by law, and therefore the law provided him a remedy.|$|E

2500|$|Reading in [...] that [...] "every living {{substance}} {{was destroyed}} that was upon {{the face of}} the ground" [...] — people and animals alike — the Gemara asked how the beasts had sinned (to <b>deserve</b> <b>this</b> punishment). A Baraita on the authority of Rabbi Joshua ben Karha compared this to a father who set up a bridal canopy for his son, and prepared a banquet with every sort of food. But then his son died. So the father broke up the canopy, saying that he had prepared it only for his son. Now that the son was dead, the father had no need for a banquet. Thus God created the animals only for the benefit of people. Now that people had sinned, God had no need for the animals.|$|E

He became a secular priest without a parish or a steady income, so the multiple offices he sought during his lifetime were to support himself and his extended family, all of whom, including his father, were dependent on him to the end of his life. He was ordained a secular priest in 1673.|$|E
