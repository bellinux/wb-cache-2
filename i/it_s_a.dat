50|$|After {{five years}} chasing {{echidnas}} and platypuses in Australia, Neil Humphreys returns to Singapore in 2012 {{to see if}} the rumours are true. Like an old girlfriend getting a lusty makeover, the island transformed while Humphreys was away. Singapore is not just a sexier island, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>a</b> different world. So Humphreys embarked upon a nationwide tour to test that theory. He went in search of new Singapore, visiting only locations that either did not exist five years ago or had been extensively rebuilt, renovated or revamped in his absence. From the cloud-topped heights of Marina Bay Sands and Pinnacle@Duxton to making ill-advised bomb jokes at the subterranean tunnels of Labrador Park, Humphreys walks, cycles, kayaks and swims across a rapidly evolving country, meeting Guinness-swigging aunties in Resorts World Sentosa, eccentric toy museum owners in Bugis, political activists in Aljunied and a security guard at Marina Barrage ready to 'tekan' anyone who crosses his path. In new Singapore, Humphreys discovers a country still grappling between the economic rewards of progress at Biopolis and Fusionopolis and the historical cost at Bukit Brown Cemetery. With Humphreys' characteristic honesty and wit, Return to a Sexy Island provides an insightful account of new Singapore; its best bits, it ugly bits and, most importantly of all, what it's really like to pee in the world s best toilet. Every Singapore resident and visitor should read this book.In 2013, Return to a Sexy Island was also turned into a popular TV series on Channel NewsAsia, which Humphreys wrote and hosted.|$|E

40|$|For {{the first}} time, a plant pest genome, the {{bacterium}} Xyella fastidiosa {{has been completely}} sequenced. <b>It</b> <b>s</b> <b>a</b> pest of orange trees, which prevents sap from flowing in the host plant, so that the fruits fail to grow and are dry inside. The bacterium is spread by a leafhopper, which farmers try to control with insecticides. The disease it causes is called citrus variegated chlorosis. Around São Paulo in Brazil, 80 % of the trees are affected. The genome was sequenced by scientists in Brazil, who now will try to use this information to develop better control methodologies. This could involve breeding varieties with a modified iron metabolism, since the Brazilian work has revealed that the bacterium is dependent on iron for its survival.

The existing commercial calendars, such as Outlook calendar, iCal and MeetingMaker, have a common weakness: unique calendar software should be installed in the user s computer. They are all not web based calendars. Some existing web calendars, like Yahoo calendar, have very limited functions. In this proposal, a web server based calendar is proposed to overcome this weakness, i. e., no unique software is needed and with lots of very useful functions like creating an appointment, proposing a meeting, viewing the attendee s availability and the responses, accessing and even changing the calendars of other users based on the given permission.

As part of this effort, a nonlinear quasi 1 -dimensional model of an axisymmetric external compression supersonic inlet is being developed. The model utilizes compressible flow computational fluid dynamics to model the internal inlet segment {{as well as the}} external inlet portion between the cowl lip and normal shock, and compressible flow relations with flow propagation delay to model the oblique shocks upstream of the normal shock. The external compression portion between the cowl-lip and the normal shock is also modeled with leaking fluxes crossing the sonic boundary, with a moving CFD domain at the normal shock boundary.

Now you no longer have to {{struggle}} to teach concepts you really don t grasp yourself. Sound takes an intentionally light touch to help out all those adults science teachers, parents wanting to help with homework, home-schoolers seeking necessary scientific background to teach middle school physics with confidence. The book introduces sound waves and uses that model to explain sound-related occurrences. Starting with the basics of what causes sound and how it travels, you'll learn how musical instruments work, how sound waves add and subtract, how the human ear works, and even why you can sound like a Munchkin when you inhale helium. Sound is the fourth book in the award-winning Stop Faking It! Series, published by NSTA Press.

They reduce the last group to an anonymous mass of either criminals or suffering victims and stimulate {{thinking in terms of}} exclusion, enlarging the gap between us and them. 	Having spent one month in camp Basroch (the Jungle of Grande-Synthe) and two months in camp La Linière (the first official refugee camp of Europe), I will draw on my own ethnographic experiences and daily conversations as a volunteer in the camp to illustrate the complex and nuanced ways in which both refugees and volunteers question the concepts of statelessness and national belonging and in negotiation (re) construct citizenship and care in relation to each other. <b>It</b> <b>s</b> <b>a</b> story about the numerous challenges that limit their hospitality and their powerful attempts to cross the borders that hold them apart. ...|$|E
