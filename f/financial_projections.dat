Upon release, Capcom announced that it had shipped 4.5 million copies worldwide, setting a new record for the company. In October 2012, the game sold 806,000 copies in the United States. According to Capcom, sales weakened following the strong start, with the company admitting that the game would not meet their goals, and consequently lowered their <b>financial</b> <b>projections</b> for the fiscal year as a result. The game had sold 4.9 million copies by April 2013, and, by October the same year, had sold 5.2 million copies worldwide, becoming one of Capcom's best-selling video games.|$|E

Team Ultimate was put to task on their marketing plan since they estimated {{that they were going to}} sell 200 tickets yet they were given 100 tickets to sell. There were some light moments when David said the figure was imaginary and no facts was used to support this. Paul was grilled for presenting a <b>financial</b> <b>projection</b> with wrong addition figures. On the other hand, Team Synergy didn't include the sales <b>Projections</b> in their <b>financial</b> analysis. There was a heated argument between the board members and David, the team leader of team Ultimate for not having any solid basis to rank his fellow team members as well as using [...] "Imaginary" [...] "I have no idea" [...] and [...] "I just thought". When the final scores were tallied out of 100 points, Team Synergy had 45.7 points while Team Ultimate had 59 points. This automatically made Team Ultimate the winners. Team Synergy remained in the boardroom for the eviction. The team leader, William blamed Idah for poor financial presentation and analysis yet the board had identified the team lost due to poor presentation.
