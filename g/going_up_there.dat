But the spirit of adventure is not there any more. It is lost. There are people <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> who {{have no idea how}} to put on crampons.

"Now," [...] {{continued}} his father, [...] "there {{is always a}} stream of air <b>going</b> <b>up,</b> wherever <b>there</b> is a lamp, or a fire, or heat, which heats the air in any way.

Then they ran up the stairs, and there lay the hammer on the bed, and on the bed's-head there were near a thousand prints of the hammer.
