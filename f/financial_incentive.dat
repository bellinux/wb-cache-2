5|$|As {{with last}} season's event, the final was {{scheduled}} {{before the end}} of the domestic season. This was partly because the Premier League chose to end its campaign a week later, but with the World Cup starting on 31 May, the FA wanted to give players considerable time to prepare for the finals. This season's staging of the competition offered a greater <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> to clubs, given the BBC and Sky Sports signed a joint-deal with the FA, worth £400 million to broadcast matches. Finalists stood to receive £1 million in prize money; the winners would pocket an extra million with additional TV revenues. The BBC spent a million promoting the FA Cup, and as part of their pre-match coverage included a sketch featuring Ricky Gervais. Seat prices for the final exceeded £70, with some ticket touts charging as much as £600 outside the stadium.|$|E

5|$|University College was the {{founding}} nondenominational college, created in 1853 after {{the university was}} secularized. Knox College, a Presbyterian institution, and Wycliffe College, a low church seminary, both encouraged their students to study for non-divinity degrees at University College. In 1885, they entered a formal affiliation with the University of Toronto, and became federated schools in 1890. The idea of federation initially met strong opposition at Victoria University, a Methodist school in Cobourg, but a <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> in 1890 convinced the school to join.

Among the institutions that had considered federation but ultimately remained independent were McMaster University, a Baptist school that later moved to Hamilton, and Queen's College, a Presbyterian school in Kingston that later became Queen's University.|$|E

40|$|This paper extends {{existing}} {{evidence on}} the interaction between <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> and cognitive capital. I focus {{on the impact of}} task-specific cognitive capital, the role of which is central to the capital-labor-production framework of Camerer and Hogarth (1999) and has long been studied in cognitive science and behavioral decision research. Using a task situated in an accounting setting, I show that both <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> and task-specific cognitive capital, and especially their interaction, matter for performance. In particular, the effect of task-specific cognitive capital on performance is stronger under performance-based <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> as compared to flat-rate incentives. The interaction effect arises because performance-based <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> lead to better performance only for individuals with more task-specific cognitive capital.

The sample used in this study to recover 61 employees who are at the vulnerable age of productive and non-productive. The question is given by using a questionnaire distributed through random sampling techniques and analytical method used is a validity test, reliability test, the classical assumption, multiple regression and analysis path. In accordance with the above objectives in this study was formulated five hypotheses, including <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> positive effect on work motivation, non-financial incentives significant effect on work motivation, <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> significant effect on work performance, <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> significant effect on job performance, non-financial incentives significant effect on job performance and work motivation significant effect on job performance.

40|$|Abstract. State governments {{increasingly}} use <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> {{to target}} and attract firms. The li-terature on state supported development reports mixed results at best {{as to whether}} there are net economic benefits to the state economy. Little has been done, however, to investigate the benefits that politicians may receive by offering incentives. We hypothesize that state govern-ments benefit from offering <b>financial</b> <b>incentives.</b> Specifically, we use pooled cross sectional da-ta from 1981 and 1989 to develop a model to test whether a state government offering <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> increases state corporate tax revenue.

40|$|The Impact of <b>Financial</b> <b>Incentives</b> on Task Performance: The Role of Cognitive Abilities and Intrinsic Motivation Ondrej Rydval Abstrakt v českém jazyce - dokument nenalezenDISSERTATION ABSTRACT Economists widely believe that, absent {{strategic}} considerations such as agency problems, <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> {{represent the}} dominant and effective stimulator of human productive activities. In production settings that are cognitively demanding, however, {{the effectiveness of}} <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> may be moderated by individual heterogeneity in cognitive abilities, intrinsic motivation and other personality characteristics. Even if strong <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> induce high effort, both financial and cognitive resources may be wasted for individuals with insufficient cognitive abilities. This prediction, if warranted, calls for attention to cognitive abilities in designing efficient incentive schemes in firms, experimental settings and elsewhere. My dissertation examines how <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> interact with intrinsic motivation and especially cognitive abilities in determining cognitive performance. In Rydval (2003), I present an initial literature review, particularly noting lack of empirical evidence on the interaction between <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> and cognitive abilities. Building on the review, Chapter 1 of the dissertation illustrates that general cognitive abilities appear {{at least as important}} for performance in a psychometric test as does a sizeable variation in piece-rate financial [...] .
