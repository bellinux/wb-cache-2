5|$|The {{case was}} brought after Jeffrey Heffernan, a detective with the Paterson, New Jersey police force, {{went to a}} {{distribution}} center {{and picked up a}} lawn sign for the candidate challenging the city's incumbent mayor in the 2005 election (Heffernan's mother had wanted a sign, so he was <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> for her). While Heffernan did not support the challenger, after other officers saw him with the sign they told senior officers, including the police chief, who strongly supported the mayor. For his apparent public support of the other candidate, they demoted Heffernan to beat patrol work as a uniformed officer.|$|E
5|$|On 21 January 2004, Bolton hosted Aston Villa in {{the first}} leg of an all-Premier League semi-final. Okocha gave them the lead with a second-minute free kick, and further strikes from Kevin Nolan and Stelios gave them a 3–0 lead after 17 minutes, with Juan Pablo Ángel <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> back for the {{visitors}} soon after. Ángel got another goal in the second half, before N'Gotty's header and a second Okocha free kick gave Bolton a 5–2 victory. Six days later in the second leg at Villa Park, Bolton lost 2–0 to a Villa team who had Gavin McCann sent off {{in the first}} half, but advanced to the final 5–4 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{joined the}} Bruins for the 1966–67 season, his {{first as a}} professional. The Bruins were not {{convinced}} Orr belonged on defence, trying him out at centre first. Through the pre-season, Orr was given jersey number 27. At the season's start, the Bruins offered him jersey number 5, that of past Bruins star Dit Clapper, but Orr chose jersey number 4. Orr made his NHL regular-season debut on October 19, 1966, against the Detroit Red Wings, <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> assist. On October 22, he scored his first NHL goal against the Montreal Canadiens. It was a slap shot past Gump Worsley and the Boston Garden crowd gave Orr a standing ovation.|$|E
50|$|Comparing {{the three}} states {{in terms of}} population, California <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> {{delegate}} for every 221,171 residents, Texas <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> for every 168,124, and Wyoming <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> for every 19,876.|$|R
50|$|The {{surviving}} spouse <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> {{half of the}} estate {{when there are no}} other heirs, and in certain cases, when the marriage is in articulo mortis, he or she <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> third. The {{surviving spouse}} also <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> third of the estate when concurring with illegitimate children, who also get the same share. However, the surviving spouse <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> fourth when concurring with illegitimate parents, who also <b>get</b> <b>one</b> fourth of the estate.|$|R
50|$|Thus, {{legitimate}} children always <b>get</b> <b>one</b> {{half of the}} estate, divided equally between them. The surviving spouse gets a share {{equal to that of}} a legitimate child, except when there is only one legitimate child, in which case he or she <b>gets</b> <b>one</b> fourth of the estate. Il{{legitimate children}} <b>get</b> <b>one</b> half of the share given to legitimate children.|$|R
5|$|After <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> {{out in the}} top of the 7th, Steve Trachsel {{allowed a}} single and a walk to pinch hitters Brent Mayne and Armando Ríos respectively. The Cubs double switched, {{bringing}} in Matt Karchner to relieve Trachsel and Orlando Merced to play left field. Karchner induced another out before loading the bases on a single by Shawon Dunston. Félix Heredia entered in relief of Karchner and got Barry Bonds to ground out to first base to end the inning. The Cubs further extended their lead in the bottom of the 8th inning. After Alvin Morman got Morandini to strike out to open the inning the Giants double switched to bring in José Mesa to pitch and Bill Mueller at third base. Mesa allowed a single to Sammy Sosa and a double to Mark Grace which advanced Sosa to third. Following a ground out Mesa threw a wild pitch while facing Gaetti and Sosa scored to make the game 5–0.|$|E
5|$|Other awards {{included}} the Combativity classification, {{which was a}} compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Original general classification winner Alberto Contador won this award at the race's conclusion; upon his disqualification it passed to mountains category winner Stefano Garzelli. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was originally won, like the closely associated points classification, by Contador, and passed to José Rujano when the Spaniard's results were stripped. Additionally, the Trofeo Fuga Pinarello rewarded riders {{who took part in}} a breakaway {{at the head of the}} field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. 's Yaroslav Popovych was first in this competition. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. Six different teams– , , , , , and – avoided incurring penalties over the course of the race, and so shared in winning the Fair Play classification.|$|E

25|$|Foster {{complained that}} his {{demotion}} was racially motivated, with Los Angeles Times writer Mike Downey criticizing him for making that statement considering that Mitchell, who replaced Foster, was black (like Foster). He made just fourteen plate appearances after that point, walking once, <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> single, and striking out six times. On August 7, the Mets released Foster and replaced him on their major league roster with Lee Mazzilli.|$|E
25|$|The Jets gave Revis {{permission}} {{to visit the}} Buccaneers on Sunday morning after reaching an agreement with Tampa Bay on the transaction.

25|$|The {{founding}} {{convention of}} the Building Trades Department was held in Washington, D.C., on February 10, 1908. Representatives from 19 building trades attended. Breaking with SBTA policy, the delegates agreed to include specialty unions (such as the Slate Roofers, the Composite Roofers, the Soft Stone Cutters and Granite Cutters). The delegates also agreed to a proportional representation scheme, with each union <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> delegate for every 4,000 members. Delegates also agreed to formally push {{for the creation of}} state and local building trades councils, although they refused to give these bodies a vote at department conventions. Finally, delegates approved a governance structure composed of a president, secretary-treasurer and six directors. Kirby was elected president, and Spencer secretary-treasurer.|$|E
50|$|Buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free {{promotions}} {{received some}} negative publicity in the UK, in 2014, and many retailers {{were told to}} scrap their ‘Buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free’ promotions. The rationale: {{it has been reported}} that every year 15 million tonnes of food are wasted in the UK alone, and supermarkets and retailers are being blamed for this because they are convincing customers to purchase buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free products. They lure customers in by offering them something they don't necessarily need, and as a result of this food is wasted. Because many buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free foods have short shelf lives, customers do not get around to consuming the products before their ‘consume by date’.|$|R

25|$|Kenta's {{first major}} rivalry in singles {{competition}} began in March 2005 following {{a dispute with}} SUWA, {{which led to a}} series of confrontations between the two, including a violent match that ended in his opponent getting disqualified for assaulting the referee. This led to Kenta <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> more chance to challenge for the Junior Heavyweight title against Yoshinobu Kanemaru on July 18, which saw him win the title. He made his first defense two months later against Suwa, then against Kotaro Suzuki as his alter ego, Mushiking Terry. Simultaneously, Kenta began teaming with Katsuyori Shibata as The Takeover, challenging for the GHC Tag Team Championship, the heavyweight version of the company's tag team title.|$|E
25|$|According to Derkx, freethought {{does not}} {{necessarily}} lead to atheism, but it does strive towards a pluriform society. In Derkx' view, this includes a {{separation of church and}} state in the sense that the government does not give preference to any (supporters and organisations of a) particular life stance. This means the state may either not support any religious or life stance organisation (financially) or support them all equally by, for example, giving airtime to churches as well as humanists and freethinkers within the Dutch public broadcasting system or subsidising both religious education and humanist education. Another important issue for the association is safeguarding education and teaching from indoctrination; it wants to prevent children from <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> single belief system imposed on them before they have developed the intellectual capacities to critically consider them for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Of the faithless votes, Colin Powell and Elizabeth Warren {{were the}} only two to receive more than one; Powell {{received}} three electoral votes for President and Warren received two for Vice President. Receiving one valid electoral vote each were Sanders, John Kasich, Ron Paul and Faith Spotted Eagle for President, and Carly Fiorina, Susan Collins, Winona LaDuke and Maria Cantwell for Vice President. Sanders is the first Jewish American to receive an electoral vote for President. LaDuke is the first Green Party member to receive an electoral vote, and Paul is the third member of the Libertarian Party to do so, following the party's presidential and vice-presidential nominees each <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> vote in 1972. It is the first election with faithless electors from more than one political party. The seven people to receive electoral votes for president were the most in a single election since 1796, and more than any other election since the enactment of the Twelfth Amendment in 1804.|$|E

25|$|Middlesex Crusaders' middle-order batsman Jamie Dalrymple {{took the}} Lancashire Lightning bowlers on to hit 63 from 33 {{balls in the}} late overs of the match at Old Trafford, as the Lightning were sent into the relegation zone in Division One. Middlesex batted first, with Paul Weekes and Ed Smith adding 90 for the first wicket, before Murali Kartik broke through thrice - ending with three for 43. Owais Shah and Dalrymple added 76 for the fourth wicket, however, hitting 21 {{boundaries}} {{on their way to}} half-centuries, and Middlesex posted a total of 263 for 4. Mal Loye swatted two sixes and a four before being caught by Dalrymple for 19, who took four catches in the Lancashire innings - including one off his own bowling. The Lightning fell to 94 for 5, with four Middlesex bowlers <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> wicket each, and despite all-rounder Glen Chapple recording his first one-day half-century of the season with 71, and they were bowled out for 219 an over before the end.|$|E
25|$|The Wuxi Classic was Fu's first ranking {{event of}} the 2013/2014 season, with him losing 4–5 to Mark King in the second round. He then played in the Australian Goldfields Open and enjoyed {{comfortable}} victories over Ken Doherty (5–2), Shaun Murphy (5–2) and Dominic Dale (5–1). In the semi-finals he built a 4–1 lead over Robert Milkins and held his nerve when the Englishman levelled at 4–4 to triumph 6–4. Fu faced home favourite and world number one Neil Robertson in the final, defeating him 9–6 to take the second ranking event title of his career and regain {{his place in the}} top 16 of the world rankings. Another final followed at the minor-ranking Bluebell Wood Open, with Fu fighting back from 1–3 down against Ricky Walden to square the match at 3–3 and was unfortunate in the decider when Walden fluked a red, before making a match winning clearance. Fu then lost {{in the second round of}} both the Shanghai Masters and the Indian Open 5–3 to Kyren Wilson and 4–3 to Gary Wilson respectively. He advanced to the quarter-finals of the International Championship in Chengdu, China, where he played Mark Selby. Fu came back from 5–3 down to take the match 6–5 with consecutive breaks of 84 and 112 in the final frame. His semi-final match against Joe Perry was very tight with many frames lasting 40 minutes, but it was Fu who won 9–8 on the colours to reach his third ranking event final of 2013. In a third successive final featuring two Asian players Fu won an hour long frame to hold a 9–8 advantage over his opponent Ding Junhui but went on to lose 10–9 without <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> clear chance to take the title.
