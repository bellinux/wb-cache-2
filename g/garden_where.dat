5|$|As {{the three}} travel through several worlds, Terra attracts the {{attention}} of several villains who offer him the whereabouts of Xehanort in exchange for assistance in their own agendas.

Shortly afterward, the three friends reunite at Radiant <b>Garden,</b> <b>where</b> Aqua and Ventus confront Terra about his actions, but he dismisses them.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} survey of 1998, only nine plants were {{identified}} in one single Radyr <b>garden,</b> <b>where</b> it traditionally grew on grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found at the original locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At Bridgend, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.|$|E
5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an absence of any paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled <b>garden</b> <b>where</b> visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E

5|$|For most of {{his career}} Harrison was obliged to earn a living by {{conducting}} and other musical work, to the detriment of his composing. In early 1913 he was engaged as a répétiteur at Covent <b>Garden,</b> <b>where</b> he had the opportunity of observing Arthur Nikisch prepare Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. Later that year Harrison was appointed to the conducting staff for the season. In 1914 he was assistant conductor to Nikisch and Felix Weingartner in Paris, rehearsing Parsifal for the former and Tristan und Isolde for the latter.|$|E
5|$|Kalākaua {{arrived in}} Glasgow on September 7.

Visiting Edinburgh on September 9, he toured Dreghorn Castle and the Royal Botanic <b>Garden,</b> <b>where</b> he planted two maple trees. Kalākaua appeared at Freemason Hall to loud cheers. The Grand Conclave of Scotland of the Order of the Red Cross of Constantine made him an honorary member.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus felt Uppsala was {{too noisy}} and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, {{he bought a}} {{neighbouring}} farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added. In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a <b>garden</b> <b>where</b> he could grow plants {{that could not be}} grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move.|$|E

5|$|Catherine's {{earliest}} {{building project}} was the château of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, {{three years before}} his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the <b>garden</b> <b>where</b> Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base {{made to look like}} natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived. The château ceased {{to be used as a}} royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.|$|E
5|$|The spa {{that was}} {{featured}} in the House since season nine was removed and replaced with exercise bikes that when operated would power a light bulb. The former spa room featured recycled products like wood, plastic and aluminum turned into wallpaper. There was also a shipping container-based bathroom, an open kitchen that paid respects to the Pacific Rim and a portable <b>garden</b> <b>where</b> the HouseGuests would collect compost and grow their own herb garden {{was added to the}} backyard. The House included four bedrooms each varying in design and comfort. The Head of Household bedroom featured a penthouse design with a waterfall and a faux ocean front view while the first bedroom featured a VIP club lounge design, while the second bedroom resembled the bottom of a public pool and featured a slide and beds that were designed to look like flotation devices. The third room initially used by the HouseGuests was later turned into the Have-Not room, which was a simplistic gray bedroom with metal slabs used as beds.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934 Plaa and Cochet {{went on to}} {{showcase}} in Rio de Janeiro where they were challenged by the Pilo Facondi and Perico Facondi brothers, Chile's leading professionals, who both lost their matches against Cochet but managed to win at least one set. Plaa and Cochet returned in February to the Madison Square <b>Garden</b> <b>where</b> Vines and Tilden were already practising and waiting for them. In a three-day round robin indoors tournament Vines and Tilden outclassed Cochet in a four and five-set match respectively and the Americans were victorious in the doubles over the French pair as well. They then {{set out on a}} ten-city tour across the United States and Canada where the Tilden-Cochet match was always the main fixture. Tilden finished the tour as winner by an eight to two head-to-head margin against Cochet. In April in Providence Cochet was drawn to play Vincent Richards in singles and with Plaa played Barnes and Richards, both matches resulted in a French two straight sets victory. The first official knock-out tournament was held in May at the Park Avenue Tennis Club, New York and was called the Eastern Pro Championships. Cochet was eliminated in the semifinals.|$|E
