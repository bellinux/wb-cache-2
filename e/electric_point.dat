30|$|For {{measuring}} the absolute elevations at the Sendai Plain using GPS instruments, {{it is noteworthy}} that the adjacent <b>electric</b> reference <b>points</b> (GPS base station) were also moved by crustal deformation of the earthquake on March 11, 2011. In fact, the <b>electric</b> measurement <b>point</b> at Yamoto, 30 km northeast from Sendai, was displaced horizontally approx. 4 m eastward and subsided approx. 50 cm. Moreover, they were shut down until April 8, 2011. Therefore, it was necessary to refer the <b>electric</b> reference <b>points</b> that were distant from the affected area, where crustal displacement was minimal. To do so, we set a Proflex 500 as the base site, which can refer to <b>electric</b> <b>points</b> within 500 km, at the roof of the highest building at Tohoku University (approx. 160 m higher than T.P.) and referenced the <b>electric</b> reference <b>points</b> at Matsumae in Hokkaido prefecture and Gotenba in Shizuoka prefecture (approx. 350 km from Sendai) (Fig. 1). At these <b>electric</b> reference <b>points,</b> no significant vertical crustal movement was recorded. Therefore, run-up heights can be measured accurately.|$|R

50|$|Another of {{the subtle}} {{technical}} {{benefits of the}} design was {{that all of the}} pointwork was concentrated on one folding baseboard, the other merely being the platform lengths. This simplified their operation, especially in the early days when <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motors were rare and remote operation of points would be done by the mechanical wire-in-tube method, which could not cross the baseboard hinge.|$|E
50|$|Liénard-Wiechert {{potentials}} {{describe the}} classical electromagnetic {{effect of a}} moving <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> charge {{in terms of a}} vector potential and a scalar potential in the Lorenz gauge. Built directly from Maxwell's equations, these potentials describe the complete, relativistically correct, time-varying electromagnetic field for a point charge in arbitrary motion, but are not corrected for quantum-mechanical effects. Electromagnetic radiation in the form of waves can be obtained from these potentials. These expressions were developed in part by Alfred-Marie Liénard in 1898 and independently by Emil Wiechert in 1900.|$|E

50|$|Although {{there are}} no known {{magnetic}} monopoles in nature, there are magnetic dipoles {{in the form of}} the quantum-mechanical spin associated with particles such as electrons (although the accurate description of such effects falls outside of classical electromagnetism). A theoretical magnetic point dipole has a magnetic field of exactly the same form as the electric field of an <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> dipole. A very small current-carrying loop is approximately a magnetic point dipole; the magnetic dipole moment of such a loop is the product of the current flowing in the loop and the (vector) area of the loop.|$|E

5000|$|For {{more than}} two years only two of the loops (Llandrindod and Llanwrtyd) were {{operational}} as Network Rail were unable to source spare parts for the points mechanisms used at all five: the design used is now obsolete. Parts had to be taken from the three decommissioned loops to keep the other two operational. [...] In 2009 NR stated their intention to install new conventional <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> machines at all five loops and restore the three out-of-service ones to full working order (after being heavily criticised by the chairman of the South Wales branch of Railfuture at the organisation's recent Annual General Meeting) but were unable to give a timescale for this to be carried out as design work on the new equipment was still ongoing. NR began the replacement works for the points after first installing the system on the line to Pembroke Dock, at the Tenby loop, on 7 December 2009 and then making minor alterations in Feb 2010.

5000|$|Power signalling, however, was {{installed}} in two signal boxes, one at {{the north and the}} other at the south of Doncaster station. The work was planned and some equipment was on site before the Second World War but the installation was not commissioned until 1949. Searchlight colour light signals and <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> machines were controlled from switch panels. The interlocking equipment was unique being a sequence switch interlocking system manufactured by Standard Telephone Company using telephone switching techniques to the technical specification of the signal engineer of the then Southern Area of the London and North Eastern Railway. The sequence switches consisted of a rotary contact shaft which was rotated to a route position and proved a circuit through contact wipers. Each switch had a [...] "home" [...] position and eleven route positions. When a route was initiated, a clutch was engaged on the appropriate switch to rotate it into its correct position thus setting up the appropriate interlocking circuits through other switches and relays. The installations proved to be remarkably reliable, serving a very useful purpose but were eventually life expired.|$|E
5000|$|Consider the {{interaction}} between two <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> charges at position and [...] ByCoulomb's law {{the interaction}} potentialdepends only on the distance [...] betweenthe particles. For molecules this is different. If we see a molecule asa rigid 3-D body, it has {{6 degrees of freedom}} (3 degrees for itsorientation and 3 degrees for its position in R3). Theinteraction energy of two molecules (a dimer) in isotropic andhomogeneous space is in general a function of 2×6−6=6 degrees of freedom(by the homogeneity of space the interaction does not depend on theposition of the center of mass of the dimer, and by the isotropy ofspace the interaction does not depend on the orientation of the dimer).The analytic description of the interaction of two arbitrarily shaped rigidmolecules requires therefore 6 parameters. (One often uses two Euler angles per molecule, plus a dihedral angle, plus the distance.) Thefact that the intermolecular interaction depends on the orientation of the moleculesis expressed by stating that the potential is anisotropic. Since point charges areby definition spherical symmetric, their interaction is isotropic. Especially in theolder literature, intermolecular interactions are regularly assumed to beisotropic (e.g., the potential is described inLennard-Jones form, which depends only ondistance).|$|E

40|$|Purpose. The {{paper is}} aimed to {{establish}} the dependence {{of changes in the}} time domain and spectral components of the current in the circuit of the AC <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motor on its technical condition, to identify the common features for the same type of damage. It is necessary using the analysis of the received signals to carry out the remote diagnosis and determination of faults and defects of <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motors. In addition it suggested to accelerate the process of the failure, malfunction and damage search. Authors propose the automated approach to the service of remote floor automation equipment, which is located in the envelope of trains.

The paper studies the structure, parameters and characteristics, the operation and maintenance characteristics of the AC <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motors. Determination of the main types of possible faults in the process depending on the operating conditions. Presentation of the electric motor as an object of diagnosis. Findings. The time dependences of the current in the circuit of <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motor for its various states was obtained. The connection between the technical condition of <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motor and the performance of current curve in time and spectral domains was established. The revealed deviations from the reference signal were justified. According to the obtained results it was made the conclusion. Originality. A method for diagnosing the state of the AC <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motor by the time dependence and the spectral composition of the current in its circuit was proposed. The connection diagram to the motor windings based on non-infringement of electric parameters of connection circuit in the actual operating conditions was applied. Practical value. The obtained results suggest the possibility and feasibility of further development of the principles of remote diagnosis based on the analysis of temporal and spectral domains of the current curve in the circuit of the AC <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> motor. The implementation and practical application in operation as a separate system for the collection, analysis, processing and data communication is also real and rational. The given system makes possible tracking the changes in key parameters and forming the proposals on impact measures on the existing situation, as well as the ability to predict the state of the objects {{on the basis of the}} dependency determination of the previous changes...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the Brans-Dicke Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime in isotropic coordinates and the electrostatic field of an <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> charge placed outside its surface of inversion. We treat the static <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> charge as a linear perturbation on the Brans-Dicke Reissner-Nordstrom background. We develop a method {{based upon the}} Copson method to convert the governing Maxwell equation on the electrostatic potential generated by the static <b>electric</b> <b>point</b> charge into a solvable linear second order ordinary differential equation. We obtain a closed form fundamental solution of the curved space Laplace equation arising from the background metric, which is shown to be regular everywhere except at the point charge and its image point inside the surface of inversion. We also develop a method that demonstrates that the solution does not contain any other charge that may creep into the region that lies beyond the surface of inversion and which is {{not covered by the}} isotropic coordinates. The Brans-Dicke Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime therefore is linearly stable under electrostatic perturbations. This stability result includes the three degenerate cases of the fundamental solution that correspond to the Brans Type 1, the Reissner-Nordstrom and the Schwarzschild background spacetimes...|$|E
