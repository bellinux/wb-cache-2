25|$|Desert National Park: Located in Rajasthan, this {{national}} reserve features extensive sand dunes and dry salt lakes. Wildlife {{unique to the}} region includes the desert fox and the great <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} birds are found {{throughout}} the basin, such as myna, Psittacula parakeets, crows, kites, partridges, and fowls. Ducks and snipes migrate across the Himalayas during the winter, attracted in large numbers to wetland areas. There are no endemic birds in the upper Gangetic Plain. The great <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Ardeotis nigriceps) and lesser florican (Sypheotides indicus) are considered globally threatened.|$|E
25|$|Destruction {{of forest}} land for {{agriculture}} and other purposes: {{large tracts of}} forest land have been cleaned up for monoculture plantations like teak, coffee and rubber. This {{has led to the}} destruction of species that were dependent on the forest. An example of this is loss of special habitats in Karnataka such as Myristica swamps and high altitude grasslands. In the dry zone, they have adversely affected several species dependent on large tracts of scrub such as the wolf and the great <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E

25|$|Introduction of {{new species}} into a habitat has caused serious {{consequences}} {{to the existing}} species of flora and fauna. A typical example is {{the introduction of the}} African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) in the lakes and rivers of Karnataka. This is a carnivorous fish and has caused serious damage to the indigenous fauna living in those lakes and rivers. Weeds like Eupatorium, Lantana and Parthenium have invaded large tracts of land causing destruction. An increase in Eupatorium is attributed as one of the causes for the spread of the deadly Kyasanur forest disease (which has a morbidity rate of 10%) among humans since it harbors tick populations that are vectors for this disease. Eucalyptus plantations in the Ranibennur blackbuck sanctuary has seriously harmed the extremely rare great <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b>|$|E

6000|$|The curious love {{gestures}} of some birds {{have already been}} incidentally noticed; so that little need here be added. In Northern America large numbers of a grouse, the Tetrao phasianellus, meet every morning during the breeding-season on a selected level spot, and here they run round and round in a circle of about fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so that the ground is worn quite bare, like a fairy-ring. In these Partridge-dances, {{as they are called}} by the hunters, the birds assume the strangest attitudes, and run round, some to the left and some to the right. Audubon describes the males of a heron (Ardea herodias) as walking about on their long legs with great dignity before the females, bidding defiance to their rivals. With one of the disgusting carrion-vultures (Cathartes jota) the same naturalist states that [...] "the gesticulations and parade of the males {{at the beginning of the}} love-season are extremely ludicrous." [...] Certain birds perform their love-antics on the wing, as we have seen with the black African weaver, instead of on the ground. During the spring our little white-throat (Sylvia cinerea) often rises a few feet or yards in the air above some bush, and [...] "flutters with a fitful and fantastic motion, singing all the while, and then drops to its perch." [...] The great English bustard throws himself into indescribably odd attitudes whilst courting the female, as has been figured by Wolf. An allied <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Otis bengalensis) at such times [...] "rises perpendicularly into the air with a hurried flapping of his wings, raising his crest and puffing out the feathers of his neck and breast, and then drops to the ground;" [...] he repeats this manoeuvre several times, at the same time humming in a peculiar tone. Such females as happen to be near [...] "obey this saltatory summons," [...] and when they approach he trails his wings and spreads his tail like a turkey-cock. (59. For Tetrao phasianellus, see Richardson, 'Fauna, Bor. America,' p. 361, and for further particulars Capt. Blakiston, 'Ibis,' 1863, p. 125.

60|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that the {{feathers}} of species belonging to very distinct groups have been modified in {{almost exactly the same}} peculiar manner. Thus the wing-feathers in one of the above-mentioned night-jars are bare along the shaft, and terminate in a disc; or are, as they are sometimes called, spoon or racket-shaped. Feathers of this kind occur in the tail of a motmot (Eumomota superciliaris), of a king-fisher, finch, humming-bird, parrot, several Indian drongos (Dicrurus and Edolius, in one of which the disc stands vertically), and in the tail of certain birds of paradise. In these latter birds, similar feathers, beautifully ocellated, ornament the head, as is likewise the case with some gallinaceous birds. In an <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Sypheotides auritus) the feathers forming the ear- tufts, which are about four inches in length, also terminate in discs. (69. Jerdon, 'Birds of India,' vol. iii. p. 620.) It is a most singular fact that the motmots, as Mr. Salvin has clearly shewn (70. 'Proceedings, Zoological Society,' 1873, p. 429.), give to their tail feathers the racket-shape by biting off the barbs, and, further, that this continued mutilation has produced a certain amount of inherited effect.|$|E

6000|$|Love-Antics and Dances.—The curious love-gestures {{of various}} birds, {{especially}} of the Gallinaceæ, have already been incidentally noticed; so that little need here be added. In Northern America, large numbers of a grouse, the Tetrao phasianellus, meet every morning during the breeding-season on a selected level spot, and here they run round and round in a circle of about fifteen or twenty feet in diameter, so that the ground is worn quite bare, like a fairy-ring.

6000|$|It is {{a curious}} fact that the {{feathers}} of birds belonging to distinct groups have been modified in {{almost exactly the same}} peculiar manner. Thus the wing-feathers in one of the above-mentioned nightjars are bare along the shaft and terminate in a disc; or are, as they are sometimes called, spoon or racket-shaped. Feathers of this kind occur in the tail of a motmot (Eumomota superciliaris), of a kingfisher, finch, humming-bird, parrot, several Indian drongos (Dicrurus and Edolius, in one of which the disc stands vertically), and in the tail of certain Birds of Paradise. In these latter birds, similar feathers, beautifully ocellated, ornament the head, as is likewise the case with some gallinaceous birds. In an <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard</b> (Sypheotides auritus) the feathers forming the ear-tufts, which are about four inches in length, also terminate in discs.[123] The barbs of the feathers in various widely-distinct birds are filamentous or plumose, as with some Herons, Ibises, Birds of Paradise and Gallinaceæ. In other cases the barbs disappear, leaving the shafts bare; and these in the tail of the Paradisea apoda attain a length of thirty-four inches.[124] Smaller feathers when thus denuded appear like bristles, as on the breast of the turkey-cock. As any fleeting fashion in dress comes to be admired by man, so with birds a change of almost any kind in the structure or colouring of the feathers in the male appears to have been admired by the female. The fact of the feathers in widely distinct groups, having been modified in an analogous manner, no doubt depends primarily on all the feathers having nearly the same structure and manner of development, and consequently tending to vary in the same manner. We often see a tendency to analogous variability in the plumage of our domestic breeds belonging to distinct species. Thus top-knots have appeared in several species. In an extinct variety of the turkey, the top-knot consisted of bare quills surmounted with plumes of down, so that they resembled, to a certain extent, the racket-shaped feathers above described. In certain breeds of the pigeon and fowl the feathers are plumose, with some tendency in the shafts to be naked. In the Sebastopol goose the scapular feathers are greatly elongated, curled, or even spirally twisted, with the margins plumose.[125] ...|$|E
50|$|Ghatigaon Sanctuary (also {{known as}} the Great <b>Indian</b> <b>Bustard</b> Sanctuary) is a {{wildlife}} sanctuary situated near Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh, India. The sanctuary has a significant population of the great <b>Indian</b> <b>bustard.</b> The park was established in 1981.|$|E
5000|$|Within its delimited area, Kutch Bustard Sanctuary {{reportedly}} has three {{species of the}} bustards namely, the great <b>Indian</b> <b>bustards</b> (endangered) (local name: ghorad), the lesser floricans (endangered) (Sypheotides indica) and the houbara bustards (vulnerable).

60|$|In {{the male}} of the Chamæpetes unicolor (a large gallinaceous bird of America) the first primary wing-feather is arched towards the tip and {{is much more}} {{attenuated}} than in the female. In an allied bird, the Penelope nigra, Mr. Salvin observed a male, which, whilst it flew downwards “with outstretched wings, gave forth a kind of crashing, rushing noise,” like the falling of a tree.[111] The male alone {{of one of the}} <b>Indian</b> <b>bustards</b> (Sypheotides auritus) has its primary wing-feathers greatly acuminated; and the male of an allied species is known to make a humming noise whilst courting the female.[112] In a widely different group of birds, namely the Humming-birds, the males alone of certain kinds have either the shafts of their primary wing-feathers broadly dilated, or the webs abruptly excised towards the extremity. The male, for instance, of Selasphorus platycercus, when adult, has the first primary wing-feather (fig. 44), excised in this manner. Whilst flying from flower to flower he makes “a shrill, almost whistling, noise;”[113] but it did not appear to Mr. Salvin that the noise was intentionally made.|$|R
