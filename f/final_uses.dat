Horace Walpole wrote in 1781 that [...] "I am too, though a Goth, so modern a Goth that I hate the black letter, and I love Chaucer better in Dryden and Baskerville than in his own language and dress". The <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> of blackletter in the 17th century were for printing ballads, chivalric romances, and jokebooks.|$|E
50|$|The naginata was {{considered}} one of the weapons most suitable for women, since it allows a woman to keep opponents at a distance, where any advantages in height, weight, and upper body strength would be lessened. An excellent example of {{the role of women in}} Japanese martial culture is Itagaki, who, famous for her naginata skills, led the garrison of 3,000 warriors stationed at Toeizakayama castle. Ten thousand Hōjō clan warriors were dispatched to take the castle, and Itagaki led her troops out of the castle, killing a significant number of the attackers before being overpowered. The naginata saw its <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> in combat in 1868, at Aizu, and in 1876, in Satsuma.|$|E
5000|$|Crerar lived a {{relatively}} short life. Soon after reaching his 62nd year, his health began to decline. His doctor, Dr. Frank Billings, accompanied him to Atlantic City, New Jersey, the climate of which was {{thought to have been}} good for his health, but on 9 September he suffered a partial stroke of paralysis on his right side. After a limited recovery, he returned to the home of his closest friend, Norman Williams, where he died on 19 October 1889. On 22 December 1889, a great memorial service was held in the Central Music Hall, from which throngs of mourners had to be turned away. Orators included the Hon. Thomas B. Bryan, Franklin MacVeagh, the Rev. Frank M. Bristol, and Bishop Fallows. Franklin MacVeagh stated that “He has set us an example of the right use of wealth, the great uses of wealth, the permanent uses of wealth, and the <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> of wealth.” J.

40|$|One of the {{key factors}} in curbing energy {{consumption}} in the household sector, together with energy efficiency and renewable energies, is widely recognized to be the amendment of occupant erroneous behaviour and systems malfunctioning, mainly explained {{by the lack of}} awareness of the final user. The aim of this work is to propose a diagnostic system in the household sector which can improve the users’ awareness with respect to the energy consumption in <b>final</b> <b>uses.</b> In particular, this paper presents an energy, environmental and economic analysis of different diagnostics systems, corresponding to different degrees of complexity and cost. Given a reference occupancy and thermal user profile, for each diagnostic system the relevant energy consumption is assessed by simulation and the subsequent economic savings are calculated and compared to the diagnostic system cost in order to evaluate the payback period of the architecture proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{prediction}} {{of the service}} life of buildings and engineered structures is complex. Such predictions are usually carried out on a component-by-component basis, but must incorporate variations in component design, material type, usage and environment. Extensive databases of life prediction are required to cover the vast number of components/environments/usage combinations that exist in buildings or engineered structures. This study investigated the diverse methods used to model the life of components in structures, including data mining of maintenance and service records, expert opinion surveys (Delphi surveys), multiscale process modelling, and sensing. These methods were analysed {{in terms of the}} issues identified above and their applicability to meet the differing uses of life prediction data. Detailed case studies are presented and {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the methods are analysed with respect to the <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> of life prediction. Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|Present work {{deals with}} the topic of {{building}} integration of solar thermal collector (BIST) as a refurbishment measure. Such equipment, more than its main function as heating generator, plays a specific role as a building component (envelope finishes, thermal insulation layer, roof cover etc). Consequently, from a heat transfer point of view, an integrated component affects twice the global building balance: supporting the thermal plant (i. e. providing heat for <b>final</b> <b>uses)</b> and modifying the wall heat-transfer pattern (i. e. reducing thermal losses). In turn, the collector performance itself {{is influenced by the}} wall structure (back losses reduction). Present work proposes a method for evaluating the yearly performance of a low cost BIST by means of a Trnsys model on a reference building. This model arises from previous studies based on experimental validation of a FEM model that was implemented in order to describe the collector-wall system efficiency...|$|E

In this research a comparison was developed between the traditional electric equipments (which use vapour compression) and the absorption equipments (powered by solar thermal energy). This comparison was implemented considering the energetic, economic and environmental aspects. This research explores the technical - economic potentialities of solar HVAC systems, with particular reference to those based on the absorption cycles, verifying the possible applications in regions of the Mediterranean area (in particular Madrid, Palermo and Athens).

40|$|The {{increasing}} energy cost (driven up by oil and naturale gas price) and {{the growing}} interest toward renewable energy sources are fostering the use of wood biomass as an energy source. In thisi work, {{a case study of}} the Primiero Valley (Dolomites - Italy) is presented. The current energy request for building heating is assessed, factoring the various kinds of <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> (houses, hotels, coomercial estabilishmenst, etc.). This request is compared against the actual availability of wood wastes both from local industrial operations (sawmills) and from forest management activities. In addition, the interactions (especially on the supply side) with nearby, biomass based, district heating systems already in operation is taken in account. Based on the aforementioned analysis, an integrated proposal is presented for a district heating system, tightly knit with the organization of the local community in such a way to optimize environmental as well as economics and management aspects...|$|E
40|$|We {{would expect}} the levels of carbon dioxide {{emissions}} per unit of production in non-European Union (EU) countries to be much greater than those in EU countries. Accordingly, {{a reduction in the}} import shares of intermediate inputs and/or final demand of the European economy should lead to more domestic intermediate and <b>final</b> <b>uses</b> and, therefore, to a reduction in the carbon footprint of the European economy when compared with the initial situation. However, we will prove that only when different emission coefficients are considered for non-EU and EU countries, then the European import shares reduction that occurred during the period 2000 – 2006 will be fully captured by carbon footprint analysis. Otherwise, the derived carbon footprint will be distorted {{by the fact that the}} evolution of the import shares will not affect those estimations. Moreover, the results of our analysis are independent of the assumption of common production technologies in the rest of the world. JRC. J. 5 -Sustainable Production and Consumptio...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a proposed framework for estimating an Industry-based R&D Satellite Account (IRDSA). The IRDSA {{builds on the}} preliminary Research and Development Satellite Account (R&DSA) released in September 2006, and provides industry and commodity detail. It adapts the U. S. input-output (I-O) accounts to present a consistent and systematic framework to assess the role of R&D in the economy at both an industry and commodity level. Inclusion of R&D in the industry accounts provides the framework for examining differences among industries ’ investments in R&D {{and the impact of}} these investments on GDP by industry. It shows the sources of R&D output, R&D industry value added (gross output minus intermediate inputs), and R&D <b>final</b> <b>uses.</b> It allows a detailed look at the composition of R&D funding and performance across industries and the development of improved R&D deflators.
