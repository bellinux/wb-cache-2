5|$|Lacking the {{available}} naval forces {{to launch a}} sizeable campaign in the Gulf, the British authorities attempted to use diplomacy to end the threat. In February 1806, the young Sultan of Oman, Sa'id II ibn Sultan, signed a treaty at Bandar Abbas promising {{to bring an end}} to attacks originating from his territory, but by 1807 the French had installed consulates <b>in</b> <b>Tehran</b> and Muscat and attacks continued unabated with their encouragement. In 1807, Lord Minto, Governor General of India, determined to send ambassadors to the Sikh Empire, Afghanistan and Persia in an effort to secure their support and prevent the French from gaining allies on India's western borders. As part of this diplomatic campaign, the ambassador to Persia was instructed to discuss the problem with the Persian government, but due to French influence <b>in</b> <b>Tehran,</b> he was unable to obtain any guarantees.|$|E

40|$|Background: Car {{accidents}} are currently a social issue globally because they {{result in the}} deaths of many people. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine traffic accidents <b>in</b> suburban <b>Tehran</b> and forecast the number of future accidents using a time-series model. Methods: The sample population of this cross-sectional study was all traffic accidents that caused death and physical injuries <b>in</b> suburban <b>Tehran</b> <b>in</b> 2010 and 2011, as registered by the <b>Tehran</b> Emergency Section. <b>In</b> the present study, Minitab 15 software was used to provide a description of traffic accidents <b>in</b> suburban <b>Tehran</b> for the specified time period as well as those that occurred during April 2012. Results: The results indicated that the average number of traffic accidents <b>in</b> suburban <b>Tehran</b> per day <b>in</b> 2010 was 7. 91 with a standard deviation of 7. 70. This figure for 2011 was 6 daily traffic accidents with a standard deviation of 5. 30. A one-way analysis of variance indicated that the average of traffic accidents <b>in</b> suburban <b>Tehran</b> was different for different months of the year (P = 0. 000).

5|$|German {{operations}} in the Atlantic also suffered. By May 1943, as Allied counter-measures became increasingly effective, the resulting sizeable German submarine losses forced a temporary halt of the German Atlantic naval campaign. In November 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met with Chiang Kai-shek in Cairo and then with Joseph Stalin <b>in</b> <b>Tehran.</b> The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma Campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat.|$|E
5|$|Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{followers}} of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852-53 after a few individuals made a failed attempt to assassinate the Shah. Although they acted alone, the government responded with collective punishment, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the Síyáh-Chál <b>in</b> <b>Tehran,</b> he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the Maid of Heaven.|$|E

5|$|The embassy {{building}} was severely damaged by fire. It {{was more than}} a decade before the British and Iranian governments came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the British embassy <b>in</b> <b>Tehran,</b> which had been damaged during the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.|$|E
5|$|The hostage-takers {{and their}} cause were largely {{forgotten}} after the Iran–Iraq War broke {{out later that}} year and the hostage crisis <b>in</b> <b>Tehran</b> continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye {{for the first time}} and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{became a}} {{follower}} of the Báb in Persia in 1845. Three years after the Báb was executed, he was exiled to Baghdad (then {{a part of the}} Ottoman Empire), where in 1863 he proclaimed the Bahá'í Faith when he declared himself He whom God shall make manifest, a messianic figure in Babi theology. Bahá'u'lláh based this announcement on a vision of the Maid of Heaven he claimed to have had while imprisoned in the Síyáh-Chál <b>in</b> <b>Tehran,</b> Persia. He would be further exiled to Edirne and ultimately to the prison city of Acre, Palestine (present-day Israel), where he died. He wrote , most notably the Kitáb-i-Aqdas, the Kitáb-i-Íqán, and the Hidden Words.|$|E
5|$|Implementation of {{the plan}} will reduce waste and consumerism. In fact, {{according}} to official data, the higher income strata {{of the population has}} enjoyed the same subsidies as the poor until now. On the other side, subsidies reduction will reduce air pollution by reducing car traffic <b>in</b> <b>Tehran.</b> Finally, the subsidy plan will increase social justice through targeted social assistance. According to official data, the richest decile of households benefits 12 times more from gasoline subsidies than the poorest decile. Overall, implementation {{of the plan}} will increase productivity, efficiency, competitiveness of Iran's economy, economic growth, oil exports and per capita income (all other things being equal).|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Kinkaid became Assistant Chief of Staff to the Commander U.S. Naval Detachment in Turkish Waters, Rear Admiral Mark L. Bristol. This tour saw {{the end of}} the Greek {{occupation}} of Smyrna. The ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne by Turkey resulted in a draw-down of U.S. naval forces in the region, reducing Bristol's post to a primarily diplomatic one. In 1924, Kinkaid, whose father had died in August 1920, requested a posting back to the United States owing to his mother's ill-health. The ship taking him back, the light cruiser , had to sail by way of Iran in order to collect the body of Vice Consul Robert Imbrie, who had been killed by an angry mob <b>in</b> <b>Tehran.</b>|$|E

Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the Bering Sea, and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} in {{development}} for four years, and {{was created to}} combine elements from video games and documentaries with an engaging narrative.

The development team conducted extensive research for the game, interviewing historical scholars and Iranians who lived <b>in</b> <b>Tehran</b> during the Revolution, as well as gathering numerous archival photos and historical speeches. The game's performances were recorded using motion capture, and each of the characters was developed with ambiguous attitudes and morals.|$|E
