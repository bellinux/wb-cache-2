25|$|Cases are calendared {{for trial}} {{as soon as}} {{practicable}} (on a first in/first out basis) after the case becomes at issue. When a case is calendared, the parties are notified by the Court of the <b>date,</b> <b>time,</b> and place of trial. Trials are conducted before one judge, without a jury, and taxpayers are permitted to represent themselves if they desire. However, the vast majority of cases are settled by mutual agreement without the necessity of a trial. However, if a trial is conducted, in due course a report is ordinarily issued by the presiding judge setting forth findings of fact and an opinion. The case is then closed in accordance with the judge's opinion by entry of a decision.|$|E

Wandsworth, Chief Justice William Erle {{went so far as to}} state that the lack of notice and hearing afforded to Cooper could be said to be a form of abuse, as he had been treated as if he did not matter. As Lord Mustill famously held in R. v.

5000|$|The word epoch {{was often}} used in a {{different}} way in older astronomical literature, e.g. during the 18th century, in connection with astronomical tables. At that time, it was customary to denote as [...] "epochs", not the standard <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> of origin for time-varying astronomical quantities, but rather the values at that <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> of those time-varying quantities themselves. [...] In accordance with that alternative historical usage, an expression such as 'correcting the epochs' would refer to the adjustment, usually by a small amount, of the values of the tabulated astronomical quantities applicable to a fixed standard <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> of reference (and not, as might be expected from current usage, to a change from one <b>date</b> and <b>time</b> of reference to a different <b>date</b> and <b>time).</b>|$|R
