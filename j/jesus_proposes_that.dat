The term [...] "Jah" [...] also appears throughout the Psalms in other Bible translations, for instance the Darby translation or Young's Literal translation. William David Spencer, in his 1999 Dread <b>Jesus,</b> <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> Archibald Dunkley and Joseph Nathaniel Hibbert were among the preachers that inspired the Rastafari movement, and that both were members of the [...] "Ancient Mystic Order of Ethiopia", a fraternal order derived from Prince Hall Freemasonry. Spencer believes that several features of the Rastafari movement derive from this lodge, including the name [...] "Jah", from the word Jah-Bul-On.|$|E

2500|$|A {{very early}} image which is {{believed}} to be an early anti-Christian graffito is the Alexamenos graffito, a unique piece of wall graffiti near the Palatine hill in Rome. The inscription has been ascribed dates ranging from the 1st to the 3rd centuries AD. It was apparently drawn by a Roman soldier to mock another soldier who was a Christian. The caption reads, in Greek, [...] "Alexamenos worships [...] God", while the image shows a man raising his hand toward a crucified figure with a donkey's head. This seems to refer to a Roman misconception that the Jews worshipped a god with the form of a donkey, so that the image would be at once antisemitic and anti-Christian. A small minority of scholars dispute whether this image depicts <b>Jesus,</b> <b>proposing</b> <b>that</b> this image may be a reference to another deity.|$|R
50|$|Ratón was lightly worked {{compared}} to other fighting bulls; whereas his counterparts were usually on tour all year, Ratón's appearances were limited to ten a year and only in regions where bullfighting regulations do not require the animal to be killed after the fight.

He was due to retire in 2010, but due to demand from fans and municipalities organising fiestas, his owner, Gregorio de Jesús, decided to prolong the bull's career. De Jesús felt that he could not refuse because of the economic plight of Spain's farmers. In 2010, de <b>Jésus</b> <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> Ratón be cloned and asked for financial assistance from the Generalitat Valenciana, but although he was told that the government would consider the request, no decision was made.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ideas of}} the two earlier books were {{developed}} and related to the Turin Shroud in Das Jesus-Komplott: die Wahrheit über das Turiner Grabtuch and Jesus starb nicht am Kreuz — Die Botschaft des Turiner Grabtuchs (1998) The Jesus Conspiracy: The Turin Shroud and the Truth About the Resurrection. The <b>Jesus</b> Conspiracy <b>proposes</b> <b>that</b> the Vatican interfered with the 1988 Radiocarbon 14 dating of the Shroud of Turin to show a medieval date for its origin. The authors <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> the shroud is authentic as the burial cloth of Jesus, but that evidence including blood tracks shows that Jesus was alive following his crucifixion. They argue that the Mandylion or Image of Edessa, known from the sixth century, was the Shroud, but folded to only show the face of Jesus. Because Jesus surviving the cross would contradict {{the teaching of the}} Resurrection, the central belief in Christianity, the authors allege that the Vatican used a piece from a 13th-century cloth with a similar herringbone weave to the Shroud of Turin as a substitute in the carbon dating. In part three, Elmar R. Gruber attempts to explain many details concerning what happened in [...] "that dramatic hour of Good Friday". The book' repeats the author's earlier arguments that after the crucifixion Jesus moved to India. In a later book, they argued that he had become a Buddhist monk.|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} role of Christian scripture {{as a basis for}} {{understanding}} the experiences of people with intellectual disabilities in Ireland. Historically, Irish services for people with intellectual disabilities were provided by Roman Catholic religious orders and congregations and it is posited that scriptural perspectives provided a context for, not just the service response but also, the societal response in a largely Christian State. By examining the Old and New Testaments and, in particular, the suffering, death and wounding of <b>Jesus,</b> it is <b>proposed</b> <b>that</b> there was, from the origins of Christianity, a fundamental misunderstanding of Christian community and that this facilitated t he development of a faith based approach, akin to eugenics, which was unwittingly grounded in injustice and dehumanisation.

500|$|In {{their book}} Health, Wealth and Happiness, theologians David Jones and Russell Woodbridge {{characterize}} the doctrine as poor theology. They suggest that righteousness cannot be earned {{and that the}} Bible does not promise an easy life. They {{argue that it is}} inconsistent with the gospel of <b>Jesus</b> and <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> the central message of the gospel should be Jesus' life, death, and resurrection. Jones and Woodbridge see Jesus' importance as vital, criticizing the prosperity gospel for marginalizing him in favor of a focus on human need. In another article, Jones criticizes the prosperity theology interpretation of the Abrahamic covenant, God's promise to bless Abraham's descendants, arguing that this blessing is spiritual and should already apply to all Christians. He also argues that the proponents of the doctrine misconstrue the atonement, criticizing their teaching that Jesus' death took away poverty as well as sin. He believes that this teaching is drawn from a misunderstanding of Jesus' life and criticizes John Avanzini's teaching that Jesus was wealthy as a misrepresentation, noting that Paul often taught Christians to give up their material possessions. Although he accepts giving as [...] "praiseworthy", he questions the motives of prosperity theology and criticizes the [...] "Law of Compensation", which teaches that when Christians give generously, God will give back more in return. Rather, Jones cites Jesus' teaching to [...] "give, hoping for nothing in return." [...] Jones and Woodbridge also note that Jesus instructed followers to focus on spiritual rewards, citing his command in Matthew 6:19–20 [...] "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth... But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven" [...] (KJV). Jones criticizes the doctrine's view of faith: he does not believe that it should be used as a spiritual force for material gain but seen as selfless acceptance of God.|$|R
40|$|Today, {{scholars}} {{employ the}} label ‘narrative Christology’ with relative frequency, though they mean different things {{when they do}} so. In this article, I argue that to date, narrative Christology has not yet fully explored the parameters {{of what it means}} to attend closely to the narrative form of the Gospels’ presentations of <b>Jesus.</b> I <b>propose,</b> further, <b>that</b> recent developments in literary theory’s so-called ‘New Formalism’ offer useful tools and concepts for moving in that direction. The first part of the article briefly outlines previous scholarship, identifying similarities and differences between various approaches labelled ‘narrative Christology’. The second section introduces the major concepts of New Formalism and how they might extend narrative Christology’s capacity to take narrative form seriously as an object of analysis. The third section of the article offers a case study of a passage that appears in the triple tradition – the intercalated healing stories of Jairus’ daughter and the haemorrhaging woman in Mark 5. 21 – 43; Luke 8. 40 – 56; and Matthew 9. 18 – 26 – in order to explore narrative structure on the micro-level. My ultimate goal is to show how New Formalism can contribute to a more robust narrative Christology and, in so doing, advance our understanding of the distinctive ways in which the Synoptic Gospels construct the figure of Jesus. </span...|$|R

40|$|The ethical {{structure}} of the Albanian customary code, the Kanun, is deemed to represent the ethical value system of a society without state power. In spite of the appearance of civilizations and the resultant advent of an incipient state power, humans seemed to have known only the ethical value system of a society without state power until Gotama, Socrates, Plato and <b>Jesus</b> <b>proposed</b> new religious and philosophical doctrines. The basic trait of these religious and philosophical doctrines, which try to antagonize the ethical value system of a society without state power by eliminating the emotional aspect of humanity from the ethical value system, has been inherited by western philosophers such as Descartes, Kant and Hegel. The discourses by Descartes, Kant and Hegel were reviewed while paying attention to how they dealt with the sensuous and emotional aspects of humanity. The metaphysical implications of the ethical {{structure of}} the Kanun surfaced through the critical reviewing of their philosophy, and a hypothesis concerning its origin was presented...|$|R

Furthermore, human cognition reflects its social evolution and context, as well as contributions from a developmental process. After presenting these themes, we illustrate their application to the process of anticipation. Specifically, we <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipations occur extensively across domains (i. e., goal management, perception, action, reward, affect, and learning) in coordinated manners. We also <b>propose</b> <b>that</b> anticipation is central to situated action and to social interaction, and that many of its key features reflect the process of development...|$|R
