5|$|After a brief postwar increase, Troy's {{population}} began {{a continuing}} decline. The city began {{the first of}} several urban renewal plans shortly after adopting its 1962 master plan. Those plans called for the demolition of many buildings <b>downtown,</b> <b>to</b> be replaced by a new arterial road, large public housing projects and a shopping mall. After various delays, those projects were either scaled back or abandoned entirely. In the interim many businesses either closed or moved out of downtown.|$|E

5|$|I-96 {{has four}} related, {{auxiliary}} Interstate highways that connect the main freeway to downtowns and other cities. I-196 {{is a relatively}} long freeway spur, beginning at I-96 east of downtown Grand Rapids and heading west through <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> Holland, and then south to I-94 near Benton Harbor. The unsigned I-296 connects I-96 north of downtown Grand Rapids with I-196 in downtown, and is signed as US131. I-496 is a loop through downtown Lansing, which I-96 bypasses to the south, and I-696 is a northern bypass of Detroit, connecting I-96 in Novi with I-75 in Royal Oak and I-94 in St. Clair Shores.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, he {{returned}} to the legislature, representing Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat. While in the legislature, he worked to get a $30,000 government subsidy to purchase and operate a large steam tugboat {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland. In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.|$|E
5|$|In Manhattan, uptown means north (more {{precisely}} north-northeast, {{which is}} the direction the island and its street grid system are oriented) and downtown means south (south-southwest). This usage {{differs from that of}} most American cities, where downtown refers to the central business district. Manhattan has two central business districts, the Financial District at the southern tip of the island, and Midtown Manhattan. The term uptown also refers to the northern part of Manhattan above 72nd Street and <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> the southern portion below 14th Street, with Midtown covering the area in between, though definitions can be rather fluid depending on the situation.|$|E

The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{plans to build a}} shoulder running lane for peak period use on I-5, as well as a new interchange at State Route 529 south of <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> alleviate congestion on east–west railroad crossings. On April 22, 2014, Marysville voters approved the creation of a city transportation benefit district and a 0.2 percent sales tax to fund transportation improvements in the city, including road repairs, bicycle and pedestrian access, and new capital projects.|$|E
5|$|NY5 and NY92 remain {{concurrent}} up to Highbridge Road, where NY92 splits from NY5 {{and heads}} southeast to Manlius. The {{segment of the}} overlap with NY92 between I-481 and the eastern split is the busiest area of NY5 in the Syracuse area and in all of Onondaga County. Past the split, NY5 continues east through Onondaga and Madison counties, passing Fayetteville, Chittenango, and Canastota before entering the vicinity of Oneida. West of the city, NY5 intersects NY365A, a spur route of NY365 leading directly into <b>downtown.</b> <b>To</b> the east, NY5 (which forms the southern boundary of the city) meets NY46 before crossing over Oneida Creek and into Oneida County.|$|E
5|$|The 20th century brought {{improvements}} to energy and domestic systems: electrical service {{was introduced in}} 1915; and in 1941, just before World WarII, the town installed a water system. The construction of Interstate 81 (I-81) during the early 1960s depressed business development in the town. The wagon road, which had been made part of U.S. Route 11, had led traffic {{through the center of}} town, but the interstate passed less than a tenth of a mile to the east, drawing off development, retail trade and ultimately, businesses. This caused <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> decline. Developers constructed new residential subdivisions both within and outside the town boundaries to the east for access to I-81.|$|E

5|$|Business US Highway23 (Bus. US23) was a {{business}} route through downtown Fenton. At {{the time it was}} turned over to local control, it was signed as business spur from <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> the US23 freeway, but the state maintained a southern section that previously completed the route as a loop. At the southern end, this unsigned highway started at US23 at the Owen Road interchange (exit78) and continued eastward on Owen Road past Fenton High School and various businesses. At the intersection with Shiawassee Avenue, Bus. US23 followed Shiawassee through a residential area toward the southern end of downtown. At the intersection with LeRoy Street, the unsigned business loop turned northward and across the Shiawassee River. At the intersection with River Street, state maintenance ended. On the northern end of downtown at the intersection of LeRoy Street and Silver Lake Road, it resumed. Bus. US23 followed Silver Lake Road westward out of downtown through a residential area and northwesterly to an interchange with US23 at exit79.|$|E
5|$|East of South Ann Street, both {{directions}} of NY167 overlap with NY5, following the four-lane road {{along the southern}} edge of <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> a junction with East Main Street on the city's east side. NY167 reconnects with NY169 here, which leaves East Main Street to briefly follow NY5 and NY167 along the riverside arterial. The resulting overlap between NY167 and NY169 is a wrong-way concurrency, with NY169 southbound overlapping NY167 northbound and vice versa. NY169 splits from the highway after just one block to proceed south across the Mohawk River while NY5 and NY167 remain concurrent to {{the eastern edge of the}} city. Here, NY167 forks from NY5, running east as a two-lane street through the undeveloped eastern fringe of Little Falls. The highway rises in elevation as it heads out of the Mohawk River valley and passes into the adjacent town of Manheim.|$|E

5|$|Freeway {{construction}} had {{its impact}} on the city, with neighborhoods disrupted and housing stock lost. Between 1963 and 1975, Interstate 35W from the south border of the city to its northeastern corner, Interstate 94 from the St. Paul border into downtown, and the Crosstown (County Road 62, later to become Minnesota State Highway 62) on the southern boundary of Minneapolis were built. The remaining portion of Interstate 94, from U.S. Highway 12 to the northern boundary of the city, was completed in 1982. Highway 12 was later rebuilt to Interstate standards in 1992, at which point it was renumbered Interstate 394. Several proposed projects never were built, though. Minnesota State Highway 55, running southeast from <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> the Fort Snelling area and the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport, was slated to become a freeway, but the upgrade was canceled due to neighborhood opposition. Similarly, a proposed Interstate 335 was to run from Interstate 35W in northeast Minneapolis to a connection with Interstate 94 just north of downtown. This project was also canceled due to neighborhood opposition.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|NY394, {{initially}} {{known as}} Sixth Street {{within the city}} limits, splits into a one-way pair after crossing the Chadakoin River. At this point, eastbound NY394 shifts one block south to follow Fifth Street while westbound NY394 remains on Sixth. Between Washington Street and North Main Street, NY394 is concurrent with NY60, with NY60 south overlapping NY394 west on Sixth Street and NY60 north overlapping NY394 east on Fifth. The one-way pair remains intact through <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> Prendergast Avenue, where NY394 comes back together and shifts south onto Fourth Street. Two blocks later, NY394 veers onto Second Street and passes south of Jamestown Community College before exiting the city. The portion of NY394 within Jamestown from the western city line to Prendergast Avenue is maintained by the city {{and is the only}} section of the route not maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation.|$|E

5|$|On December 17, 1962, {{the freeway}} through {{downtown}} Grand Rapids was completed, including the section marked as I-296. The business loop {{was removed from}} the freeway when US131 took its place. East Beltline Avenue was renumbered as an extension of M-44, while 28th Street retains the M-11/M-21 designations it had in addition to US131. I-296/US131 runs alongside the Grand River between I-96 downtown and I-196 north of town. At the end of I-296, US131 followed I-196 east to the northern portion of the business loop at Plainfield Avenue and followed Plainfield Avenue back to the remainder of its routing north of Grand Rapids. The other end of the freeway was extended south to M-43 {{on the west side of}} Kalamazoo. Traffic there is directed along M-43 into <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> connect with the remainder of the highway.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was {{ten years}} old, his father and two closest male {{siblings}} (by age), Peter and Paul, died in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 while it was attempting to land in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut. Lorna Colbert relocated the family <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> the more urban environment of East Bay Street in Charleston. Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make new friends in his new neighborhood. Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building <b>downtown</b> <b>to</b> answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud going up {{the steps of the}} courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
