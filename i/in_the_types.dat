5|$|The PS3 {{client was}} {{developed}} in a collaborative effort between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of Life with PlayStation on its launch. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of calculations it can perform, {{at the time of}} its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made technical support easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.|$|E

25|$|Although localizationist {{approaches}} {{provide a}} useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, {{one problem is}} that a sizeable number of individuals do not fit neatly into one category or another.

25|$|About this time, story {{artists at}} Disney were finding it {{increasingly}} difficult to write material for Mickey. As he had developed into a role model for children, they were limited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of gags they could make. This led to Mickey taking more of a secondary role in some of his next films allowing for more emphasis on other characters. In Orphan's Benefit (August 11, 1934) Mickey first appeared with Donald Duck who had been introduced earlier that year in the Silly Symphonies series. The tempestuous duck would provide Disney with seemingly endless story ideas and would remain a recurring character in Mickey's cartoons.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people with}} Stickler {{syndrome}} are very nearsighted (described as having high myopia) {{because of the}} shape of the eye. People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye (ocular hypertension) which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the light-sensitive retina of the eye (retinal detachment). Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with Stickler's Syndrome. The jelly-like substance within the eye (the vitreous humour) has a distinctive appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes. As a result, regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised. The type of Stickler syndrome associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye.|$|E
25|$|Early {{completely}} artificial canals, across fairly flat countryside, {{would get}} round {{a small hill}} or depression by simply detouring (contouring) around it. As engineers became more ambitious <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of country they felt they could overcome, locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time. Later still, as construction techniques improved, engineers became more willing to cut directly through and across obstacles by constructing long tunnels, cuttings, aqueducts or embankments, or to construct even more technical devices such as inclined planes or boat lifts. However, locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions, and are {{an essential part of}} even the most modern navigable waterways.|$|E

25|$|About 75% of paragangliomas are sporadic; the {{remaining}} 25% are hereditary (and {{have an increased}} likelihood of being multiple and of developing at an earlier age). Mutations of the genes for the succinate dehydrogenase, SDHD (previously known as PGL1), SDHA, SDHC (previously PGL3) and SDHB {{have been identified as}} causing familial head and neck paragangliomas. Mutations of SDHB {{play an important role in}} familial adrenal pheochromocytoma and extra-adrenal paraganglioma (of abdomen and thorax), although there is considerable overlap <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of tumors associated with SDHB and SDHD gene mutations. Paragangliomas may also occur in MEN type 2A and 2B. They are seen in at a higher incidence in people living at high altitude. Other genes related to familiar paraganglioma are SDHAF2, VHL, NF1, TMEM127 and MAX.|$|E
25|$|Reconciliation of {{gene and}} species trees entails mapping {{evolutionary}} events onto gene trees {{in a way}} that makes them concordant with the species tree. Different reconciliation models exist, differing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of event they consider to explain the incongruences between gene and species tree topologies. Early methods exclusively modelled horizontal transfers (T). More recent ones also account for duplication (D), loss (L), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) or homologous recombination (HR) events. The difficulty is that by allowing for multiple types of events, the number of possible reconciliations increases rapidly. For instance, a conflicting gene tree topologies might be explained in terms of a single HGT event or multiple duplication and loss events. Both alternatives can be considered plausible reconciliation depending on the frequency of these respective events along the species tree.|$|E
25|$|The canal served six mills, {{located along}} its banks, {{including}} the two bone mills at Antingham. There {{has been a}} mill at Bacton Wood {{since the time of}} the Domesday Book in 1086, and much of the present building dates from 1747.

Since the millpond at Ebridge has been cleared and rewatered by volunteers, there has been a significant increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of wildlife observed at the location. The area through which the canal flows is at risk of flooding, and this is mitigated by the actions of the Broads Internal Drainage Board, who manage drains and ditches in the upper regions, and have two pumping stations which pump water into the canal at its lower end.|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} based on data {{collected}} in 39 organic farms in 9 Polish regions. The mean share of grasslands was 47. 3 %, i. e. twice the country average (21 %).

Among 5 general agricultural types (of 9 <b>types</b> defined <b>in</b> EU), <b>the</b> best economic results of the stud-ied farms were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general <b>type</b> 4 (special-ized in breeding grazing cattle) and <b>the</b> lowest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> general <b>type</b> 1 (specialized <b>in</b> field crops). <b>The</b> highest economic results among the farms of <b>the</b> basic <b>types</b> (9 of 17 EU-defined <b>types)</b> were reached <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> 43 (cattle <b>in</b> total) and <b>the</b> lowest result, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> 14 (other field crops excluding cereals, oil and legume plants).

25|$|Throughout the 1990s and 2000s until today, Domingo has {{continued}} adding new roles to his growing repertoire, {{while at the}} same time dropping earlier parts. The 1990s were the start of rapid change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of roles the tenor performed. During this decade he sang his last Cavaradossi, Don Carlo, Don José, Gustavo/Riccardo, Hoffmann, and Alvaro, among others, and he began instead to expand the breadth of his roles more substantially beyond the standard Italian and French repertory. In particular, he increased his involvement in Wagnerian operas. Although he had already sung Lohengrin and recorded a few operas by the composer, he did not perform any of Wagner's works frequently onstage until he debuted as Parsifal in 1991 and Siegmund in 1992. He continued to sing these roles for almost two decades, including at the Bayreuth Festival.|$|E
25|$|Soil {{contamination}} {{can occur}} {{during the process}} of constructing the Olympic venues. In the case of the 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Torino, Italy, negative environmental impacts were observed, including impacts on soil. Before the Games, researchers studied four areas which the Games would likely affect: a floodplain, a highway, the motorway connecting the city to Lyon, France, and a landfill. They performed an extensive analysis <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of chemicals found in the soils in these areas {{both before and after the}} Games. Their findings revealed an increase in the number of metals in the topsoils post-Games, and indicated that soil was capable, as part of an ecosystem, of negating, or “buffering,” the effects of many heavy metals. However, their findings also revealed that this was not the case for all metals, and that mercury, lead, and arsenic may have been transferred into the food chain on a massive scale.|$|E
25|$|By 1869, the Shropshire Union had a {{thriving}} business carrying goods from a base at Chester Basin, Liverpool, across the River Mersey to Ellesmere Port and Birkenhead. The LNWR was {{also involved in}} cross-river trade, using private carriers, and this {{was transferred to the}} Shropshire Union in 1870, after they had suggested it. The company bought out the lighterage business of William Oulton in 1870, moved their base from Chester Basin to Manchester Basin, and bought the Mersey Carrying Co in 1883. Under the terms of the lease with the LNWR, the company was limited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>types</b> of goods they could carry, and although they made a healthy operating profit until the late 1860s, this did not cover the interest on debts or dividends. Between 1850 and 1870, receipts had risen from £104,638 to £145,976, but costs had risen much faster, and the average surplus had fallen from £45,885 to £11,717. Most of the income was generated by their carrying business, rather than by tolls for use of the canal network.|$|E
