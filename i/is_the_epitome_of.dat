500|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{regards the}} trio {{as the three}} eyes of Shiva. Devasena and Valli are representations of kriya shakti (the power of action) and Iccha-shakti (will-power) respectively; while their Lord Kartikeya is the third eye, {{the symbol of the}} transcendental jnana-shakti (the power of knowledge). In Tamil literature, two kinds of love are mentioned: karpu ("chastity"), love bound in the traditional marriage, represented by Devasena and kalavu, love before marriage, conveyed by Valli. Devasena represents [...] "the conventional, control, ritualized approach to worship" [...] God, while Valli is worship through [...] "ecstasy and self-abandonment". Devasena <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> chastity and purity. In trinity of gunas, she is the middle guna – Rajas, symbolizing [...] "rulership, fixity, and stability". Kartikeya is the most superior Sattva (pure), while Valli is the inferior tamas (dark).|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} the script, Arndt {{read in a}} {{newspaper}} about Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking {{to a group of}} high school students and saying [...] "If there's one thing in this world I hate, it's losers. I despise them." [...] As a result, Arndt developed his script lampooning the thought process: [...] "And I thought there's something so wrong with that attitude... I wanted to... attack that idea that in life you're going up or you're going down... So to a degree a child beauty pageant <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> the ultimate stupid meaningless competition people put themselves through." [...] Co-director Jonathan Dayton also commented on the importance of the pageant to the film: [...] "As far as the pageant goes, it was very important to us that the film not be about pageants.

500|$|Conceptual {{thinking}} about throffers is practically applied in considerations of conditional aid, such as {{is used in}} workfare systems. For philosopher and political theorist Gertrude Ezorsky, the denial of welfare when subjects refuse work <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>epitome</b> <b>of</b> a throffer. Conditional welfare is also labelled a throffer by political philosopher Robert Goodin. In the words of Daniel Shapiro, also a political philosopher, the offer aspect of workfare {{is seen in the}} [...] "benefits one receives if one learns new skills, gets a job, alters destructive behaviors and the like", while the threat aspect is executed with [...] "the elimination or reduction of aid, if the person does not, after a certain period of time, accept the offer". For Goodin, the moral questionability of the threat aspect of a throffer is generally mitigated by the attractiveness of the offer aspect. In this way, workfare can represent a [...] "genuine" [...] throffer, but only when a person receiving welfare payments does not need the payments to survive, and so possesses a genuine choice as to whether to accept the throffer. When, however, an individual would be unable to survive if he or she stopped receiving welfare payments, there is no genuine choice; the individual is, for Goodin, unable to refuse the throffer. This cancels out the morally mitigating factor usually possessed by a throffer. This is presented as an argument against workfare, and Goodin anticipates that advocates would respond paternalistically by claiming that, regardless of issues of freedom, the individual in question would benefit from taking part in the work or education offered.|$|E

50|$|A further key {{critique}} of cultural evolutionism {{is what is}} known as “armchair anthropology.” The name results from {{the fact that many of}} the anthropologists advancing theories had not seen first hand <b>the</b> cultures they <b>were</b> studying. <b>The</b> research and data collected was carried out by explorers and missionaries as opposed to the anthropologists themselves.
