5|$|After {{being held}} {{eighteen}} months without trial, Amir is released {{and returned to}} Batavia. He is unable to find Tati, leaving him to wander the streets. Omi spots him, and again she asks him to play with her troupe. Amir agrees, and soon newspapers are filled with advertisements touting his name. Spotting one, Tati and Abdul Sidik go to a performance, only to learn that Amir {{was the victim of}} a car accident. At the hospital, where Amir <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> by Pardi, Tati learns the truth behind Amir's absence. On his deathbed, Amir asks Pardi to take care of Tati; the two are later married.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing of}} Scully collapsing, Mulder {{arrives at the}} {{hospital}} where Scully <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b> Before {{he is able to}} make contact with her, he is detained by Skinner and two FBI agents. Mulder is then brought to Blevins and a senior agent who demands information on why Scully lied about Mulder's death. After the meeting, Mulder tells Skinner that a traitor in the FBI gave Scully her cancer. In the meantime, The Smoking Man has a meeting with the First Elder (Don S. Williams), trying to convince him that Mulder will join their side if he is given a good reason to do so.|$|E
5|$|While {{waiting at}} the {{hospital}} as Marcus <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated,</b> Grace breaks down and Mason becomes upset with her for refusing {{to talk to him}} about how she feels; instead, she tells him that she no longer wants to marry him and that she plans to have an abortion. Upset, she returns to Jayden's father's house and breaks in, intending to injure him while he sleeps, but she is interrupted by Jayden, who suggests that they smash his car instead. Grace opens up to Jayden about being sexually abused by her own father, and after Jayden shows Grace bruises from where her father hit her they return together to Short Term 12, where Jayden reports her father for physical abuse. Grace goes home to apologize to Mason, who tells her that Marcus will recover.|$|E

On July 11, 2012, Jackson's office said he <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for a mood {{disorder}} at a residential treatment facility. His office denied speculation that he <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for alcoholism. On August 13, 2012 it was confirmed by numerous news outlets that Jackson <b>was</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for bipolar disorder.|$|R

5|$|Shortly {{after his}} release, the Landlord {{is brought to}} the triad boss, who {{increases}} his offer to HK$30 million for the baby. He finds Thongs and Octopus at the hospital, where the baby <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for fever. The Landlord informs the two of the triads' latest offer, but Thongs and Octopus {{are more concerned about}} the baby's welfare than the cash. However, the two agree to bring the baby to the triad boss' mansion, where the Landlord will meet them {{with the rest of the}} money. They reach the triad boss' mansion and hand over the baby reluctantly. As the trio are about to leave, they hear the baby crying for them as a blood sample is taken from his arm. Thongs and Octopus experience a flashback of the days they spent with the baby. Overcome by their feelings, they fight their way into the triad boss' private amusement park to recover the baby while the Landlord leaves with the money. Thongs almost manages to escape with the baby, but is forced to surrender when the triads threaten to hurl Octopus to his death.|$|E
5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed the outlines of the stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E
5|$|While Rinoa <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> on Esthar's space station, Ultimecia {{uses her}} to free Sorceress Adel from her orbital prison. Ultimecia then orders Seifer to {{activate}} the Lunatic Pandora facility, inciting a rain of creatures from the moon that sends Adel's containment device to the planet. Having selected Adel as her next host, Ultimecia abandons Rinoa in outer space. Squall rescues her, and they return to the planet on a derelict starship. Upon their landing, delegates from Esthar isolate Rinoa for fear of her sorceress abilities, forcing Squall to rescue her. They are met by the President of Esthar who reveals himself to be Laguna and apologizes for the incident and announces Dr. Odine's plan to let Ultimecia possess Rinoa, have Ellone send Rinoa (and thus Ultimecia as well) {{to the past and}} then retrieve only Rinoa back to the present, enabling Ultimecia to achieve Time Compression, as it would allow Squall's group to confront Ultimecia in her time. To do this, Squall's team infiltrates Lunatic Pandora, defeats Seifer and Adel, and has Rinoa inherit Adel's sorceress powers. Time Compression is thus initiated; Squall and his allies travel to Ultimecia's era and defeat her.|$|E

25|$|Some prescribers further {{inform the}} patient and {{pharmacist}} by providing the indication for the medication; i.e. what <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b> This assists the pharmacist in checking for errors as many common medications {{can be used for}} multiple medical conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{developed}} countries centralised treatment of municipal wastewater is now quite widespread. In developing countries most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. For example, in Latin America only about 15% of collected sewage <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> (see {{water and sanitation}} in Latin America).|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the smaller}} {{wastewater}} treatment plants are waste stabilization ponds, a low-cost and low-energy treatment that eliminates pathogens while conserving nutrients. An example is the Arab village of Kafr Manda in the Western Galilee, whose wastewater <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> and reused for irrigation in the neighboring Jewish community of Yodfat.|$|E

25|$|Stem cell {{treatments}} {{may require}} immunosuppression {{because of a}} requirement for radiation before the transplant to remove the person's previous cells, or because the patient's immune system may target the stem cells. One approach to avoid the second possibility is to use stem cells from the same patient who <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b>|$|E
25|$|Water {{supply is}} {{continuous}} {{in almost all}} medium and large urban centers. In the city of Layoune, which is served by a seawater desalination plant that has insufficient capacity to supply the entire city, water supply was intermittent in 2010. Only about 21 percent of collected sewage <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> before being discharged into the environment.|$|E
25|$|Few {{reliable}} figures {{exist on}} {{the share of the}} wastewater collected in sewers that <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> in the world. A global estimate by UNDP and UN-Habitat is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated. In many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only.|$|E
50|$|Employees {{who feel}} they <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> fairly <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} loyal to their companies, have higher morale and {{increased}} helping behaviors. Employees {{who feel they}} <b>are</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> unfairly tend to have lower morale, higher turnover rates {{and are more likely to}} exhibit ORB and another forms of workplace deviance including theft and/or sabotage in attempts to get even with their wrongdoer.|$|R

25|$|The {{church was}} badly damaged by fire in July 2010. In the early {{afternoon}} of Sunday 4 July, fire spread from the ground floor through to parts of the roof. There were no casualties. Although there was no structural damage, the entire interior was gutted causing £500,000 worth of damage. The fire <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> as arson, with a £10,000 reward (funded by public donations) for the conviction of the arsonist.|$|E
25|$|In recent 3GPP and WiMAX standards, MU-MIMO <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated</b> {{as one of}} the {{candidate}} technologies adoptable in the specification by a number of companies, including Samsung, Intel, Qualcomm, Ericsson, TI, Huawei, Philips, Nokia, and Freescale. For these and other firms active in the mobile hardware market, MU-MIMO is more feasible for low-complexity cell phones with a small number of reception antennas, whereas single-user SU-MIMO's higher per-user throughput is better suited to more complex user devices with more antennas.|$|E
25|$|As Dum's wound <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated,</b> {{he thinks}} {{back to one}} year earlier, {{when he was a}} {{university}} student in Bangkok, where he became re-acquainted with Rumpoey. Dum pleads with her to leave him alone, reasoning that she is too beautiful and high born for a serious relationship with him. Later, Rumpoey is attacked by Koh and two toadies. Dum appears on the path and routs Rumpoey's attackers, for which he is expelled. Rumpoey finds Dum walking and insists on giving him a ride in her car. She orders her driver to take them to Bang Pu beach. Dum and Rumpoey confide their love for each other and are engaged, agreeing to meet a year later at Sala Awaiting the Maiden.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{substantial}} improvements in {{access to water}} supply, {{and to a lesser}} extent to sanitation, over the past fifteen years. Remaining challenges include a low level of wastewater treatment (only 13% of collected wastewater <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated),</b> lack of house connections in the poorest urban neighborhoods, and limited sustainability of rural systems (20 percent of rural systems are estimated not to function). In 2005 a National Sanitation Program was approved that aims at treating 60% of collected wastewater and connecting 80% of urban households to sewers by 2020. The issue of lack of water connections for some of the urban poor is being addressed as part of the National Human Development Initiative, under which residents of informal settlements have received land titles and have fees waived that are normally paid to utilities in order to connect to the water and sewer network.|$|E
25|$|Measures {{creating}} uniform wastewater loadings tend {{to reduce}} the probability of upsets. Fixed-film or attached growth secondary treatment bioreactors are similar to a plug flow reactor model circulating water over surfaces colonized by biofilm, while suspended-growth bioreactors resemble a continuous stirred-tank reactor keeping microorganisms suspended while water <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>treated.</b> Secondary treatment bioreactors may {{be followed by a}} physical phase separation to remove biological solids from the treated water. Upset duration of fixed film secondary treatment systems may be longer because of the time required to recolonize the treatment surfaces. Suspended growth ecosystems may be restored from a population reservoir. Activated sludge recycle systems provide an integrated reservoir if upset conditions are detected in time for corrective action. Sludge recycle may be temporarily turned off to prevent sludge washout during peak storm flows when dilution keeps BOD concentrations low. Suspended growth activated sludge systems can be operated in a smaller space than fixed-film trickling filter systems that treat the same amount of water; but fixed-film systems are better able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.|$|E
