40|$|It {{has long}} been the bane of {{analytical}} electron microscopy (AEM) that the use of <b>focused</b> <b>probes</b> during microanalysis of specimens increases the local rate of hydrocarbon contamination. This is most succinctly observed by the formation of contamination deposits during <b>focused</b> <b>probe</b> work typical of AEM studies. While serving to indicate the location of the electron probe, the contamination obliterates the area of the specimen being analyzed and adversely affects all quantitative microanalysis methodologies. A variety of methods including: UV, electron beam flooding, heating and/or cooling can decrease the rate of contamination, however, none of these methods directly attack the source of specimen borne contamination.

40|$|In {{electron}} microscopy, elemental {{information is}} usually acquired in real space by scanning a <b>focussed</b> <b>probe</b> over the specimen. We {{think there is}} a method to acquire elemental maps in Fourier space by sequentially sampling Fourier components. The method is based on the illumination of the specimen with a pattern of fringes, a standing electron wave, and collecting, for instance, the X-ray spectrum as a function of fringe position, spacing and orientation. Each fringe spacing and orientation gives information about one Fourier component of the atomic distribution function for all elements in the specimen. Image acquisition with this method has advantages over Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy in terms of current and resolution. There is reason to believe that there are also advantages in terms of measurement precision, especially if the information sought for is highly localized in Fourier space. Calculations show that the fringe scanning technique can lead to higher measurement precision, but only if the current in the standing wave illumination is higher than in the <b>focussed</b> <b>probe.</b> A resolution region is created where {{the answer to the question}} which of the two techniques gives a higher precision, depends on the number of Fourier components to be sampled and the required resolution.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of ultrasonic beams {{is a phenomenon}} of widespread interest {{to a variety of}} technologies including sonar, medical ultrasound, and nondestructive evaluation.

This type of source has the generally undesirable attributes of a complicated near field interference structure as well as far field side lobes. Sources which produce a Gaussian amplitude distribution have been studied since, for this case, the previous disadvantages are eliminated.
