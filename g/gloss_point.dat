Traditional data compression and quantization techniques, designed to recreate or approximate the data itself, <b>gloss</b> over this <b>point.</b> Are performance gains possible if source coding accounts for the user's function? How about when the encoders cannot themselves compute the function? We introduce the notion of functional quantization and use the tools of high-resolution analysis to get to the bottom of this question. Specifically, we consider real-valued raw data Xn/ 1 and scalar quantization of each component Xi of this data. First, under the constraints of fixed-rate quantization and variable-rate quantization, we obtain asymptotically optimal quantizer point densities and bit allocations. Introducing the notions of functional typicality and functional entropy, we then obtain asymptotically optimal block quantization schemes for each component. Next, we address the issue of non-monotonic functions by developing a model for high-resolution non-regular quantization. When these results are applied to several examples we observe striking improvements in performance. Finally, we answer three questions by means of the functional quantization framework: (1) Is there any benefit to allowing encoders to communicate with one another? (2) If transform coding is to be performed, how does a functional distortion measure influence the optimal transform? (3) What is the rate loss associated with a suboptimal quantizer design? In the process, we demonstrate how functional quantization can be a useful and intuitive alternative to more general information-theoretic techniques. by Vinith Misra. Thesis (M. Eng.)

This rhetorical study attempts to advance {{our understanding of the}} medium of PowerPoint presentations and offers practical guidance regarding deck design, rehearsal, and performance. A key premise underlying my approach to PowerPoint is that human beings understand and look for logical relationships when processing information and make significant use of text signals when doing so (Matlin 2004, Lorch and Lorch 1995). What follows from this is that slide titles, bullet points, and other components of a deck should comprise a logical superstructure of ideas. Audiences can certainly cope with an illogical presentation, but violations of hierarchical subordination constitute a kind of “noise ” and—depending on the genre and difficulty of the subject matter—may seriously impair understanding.

40|$|The goal of {{this course}} is to {{investigate}} an object which might be called X(p ∞), and which appears as the inverse limit of the classical modular curves X(pm).

Some motivation: local-global compatibility for GL 2. Let p be prime. The modular curve X(pm) is acted upon by the finite group GL 2 (Z/pmZ). Passing to the limit, the projective system lim X(p ← − m) is acted upon by the compact group GL 2 (Zp), but in fact this action can be promoted to an action of the locally compact group GL 2 (Qp).

U fokusu pažnje je bilješka ispisana na margini, s lijeve strane zastavice, koja u dosadašnjim istraživanjima nije uočena. U pitanju je abrevijatura koja se razrješava kao nomen sacrum, uobičajen u slavenskim jezicima. Autor analizira semantiku zaglavlja u kontekstu judeokršćanske simbolike i u sklopu rezultata novijih ispitivanja ornamenta u medievistici. S obzirom na analogije u građi, romboidna mreža s upisanim zlatnim ljiljanima, nadvišena trima križevima i označena s nomen sacrum, simbolično prikazuje Riječ, izvor Dekaloga. This {{article is}} {{dedicated}} to the interpretation of the header before the text of the Ten Commandments on fol. 150 of the Hval Codex. The author is drawing attention to a gloss in the margin {{to the left of the}} banner which has not been addressed in the earlier scholarly literature nor recorded in the facsimile transcription of 1986. The rectangular banner consists of a lozenge net filled with gold lilies while three gold interlace crosses of a complex shape are placed on top of the banner. The gloss next to it was written in blue ink as an abbreviated word under a line. It is a rather common abbreviation from the nomina sacra category (God). The significance of this hitherto-overlooked gloss is extraordinary. It was written in the same manner which was used for adding legends to miniatures or headers in order to clarify images in medieval illuminated manuscripts. Hval wrote similar notes in several margins of this manuscript. The location of the <b>gloss</b> itself <b>points</b> to its function as an explanation of the banner before the words which the Lord communicated to Moses on Mount Sinai. That the text of the Ten Commandments was significant in Bosnian illuminated manuscripts is also attested to by the header before the Ten Commandments in a Venetian miscellany codex, which depicts the narrative scene of the theophany on Sinai while, at the same time, containing a fairly long inscription which clarifies the image. Similar textual clues appear in the Dobrejšovo Evangelie, the most important of which is the one positioned next to the Synaxarion header where the inscription, “this is heaven which is also called paradise”, explains the scene. In the context of such examples, this article discusses analogous material from illuminated manuscripts and monumental painting alike by applying a new approach to the study of function of medieval ornament, while also highlighting the problem of the etymology of the notion of ornament in different languages. The findings resulting from this research show that the function of ornament in a religious context was not just decorative, but that it was used to mark the holiness of a space, that is, the presence of the divinity, which is a phenomenon witnessed in illuminated manuscripts, wall paintings, icons and reliquaries. H. Kessler’s research into Judeo-Christian symbol-paradigms confirms the essential importance of the depiction of the Old Testament tabernacle in the manuscripts of the Christian Topography as a source of ornamental motifs. They can be grouped into a relatively narrow set of symbols, always included in a structural system: star-shaped schemes, fields of flowers, interlace and lozenge nets as well as chequers. Their origin is found in the coffered vaults of classical tombs and temples where they represented the sky and Elysium. They were transported to medieval art through identical motifs which were painted in the catacombs and early Christian basilicas. It is these exampes that constitute a formal template for the header to the Ten Commandments in the Hval Codex the meaning of which is, therefore, a symbolic depiction of the Word, Logos, as the source of God’s Ten Commandments, which is why the banner was marked with a corresponding gloss. The article also pays attention to an unusual illumination in the Gospels of Jakov of Serres because it also witnesses that a grid with floral motifs possessed a special meaning to educated medieval men. The portion above the head of Metropolitan Jakov, formed by a band of a lozenge net with flowers, has been described in the scholarship only as decorative, that is, as forming a floral background, but, given that its position and shape both conform to signifiers of heavenly kingdom in Byzantine manuscripts of the Christian Topography, it is erroneous to interpret it only as a floral background and a mere ornament. In this case too, the lozenge field filled with flowers denotes the Empire of God to which Jakov directs his prayers. Therefore, when one studies ornament in a religious context, it is necessary to use a more precise language, one which is rooted in the manuscript material itself. A concrete evidence for such a practice can also be seen in the colophon of this manuscript because the scribe who wrote it compared all of the decoration in the codex to the starry sky of a theological rather than actual kind. Other notes in the Hval Codex margins are also mentioned in the article. Some of these record the name of the manuscript’s commissioner who was addressed out of respect as uram (Hungarian for “my sire and master”) : Hrvoje Vukčić Hrvatinić, Grand Duke of Bosnia and a Herzog of Split. The article emphasizes the need to study more closely the location of glosses and all other marginal notes within the codex, and highlights the fact that the two notes recording the name of the patron were placed next to the Gospel sections describing Christ’s healing miracles which, generally speaking, figure prominently in Christian art and exegesis. Furthermore, the article also analyzes the previously-unpublished illumination which depicts Moses in front of the Burning Bush, the branches of which were rendered as interlace ornament resembling a labyrinth. The rendition of the Burning Bush as interlace stemming from the floral frame of the header is a unique example which demonstrates that medieval art did not consider ornament as a meaningless arabesque but that it frequently functioned as a signifier...|$|R
40|$|My dissertation, Rejected Women in Film Noir, {{brings an}} {{innovative}} {{approach to a}} well-studied cycle of films in terms of character type and methodology by concentrating on a female character frequently pictured, but rarely discussed, which I am calling the "rejected woman. " Rejected women characters include: the faithful and taken-for-granted "girl Friday," the "B" girl (Noir code for fallen woman) fettered to a bar stool, who is used and discarded by the Noir hero, and the lonely spinster, who has a dull, unglamorous job like bookkeeper or telephone operator. She desires (positive) attention from the noir hero, yet only receives it in a negative form, culminating in either active or passive rejection through dismissal or indifference. This story line of rejection is mirrored in the physical and psychological pain she often endures. This narrative based "rejection" echoes the formal "rejection" of the character in the mise-en-scene [...] ;My methodology begins with close filmic readings and broadens to consider a number of ideological questions. I try to avoid a priori applications of ideological assumptions, and instead conduct detailed examinations of filmic textuality. I primarily utilize psychoanalytical film theory anchored in two of Jacques Lacan's texts: "The Mirror Stage" essay (1949), and The Four Fundamentals of Psychoanalysis (Seminar XI) (1964). A profound misunderstanding surrounding the term "the gaze" has caused confusion in derision in film theory discourse. I recommend that we consider Laura MulveyÂ 's application of Lacan's "Mirror Stage" essay be called "Look Theory," and Jacqueline Rose's, Joan CopjecÂ 's and Todd McGowanÂ 's application of Lacan's Seminar XI lectures be called "Gaze Theory. " After describing the reasons why this split is needed, as well as <b>glossing</b> the major <b>points</b> {{of each of these}} scholars' approaches to Lacan's work, I demonstrate how productive both "Look" theory and "Gaze" theory are in examining film generally and Rejected Women of Film Noir specifically.;By reading the rejected woman through MulveyÂ 's ground-breaking essay, "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema," I show how the rejected woman exists as a paradoxical locus of power. She is antinomic; simultaneously encompassing pain and pleasure, visibility and invisibility, movement and immobility, text and writing instrument. For example, Gaye Dawn in Key Largo appears metaphorically invisible to film's male characters (I bend MulveyÂ 's language, arguing that rejected women connote a "to-(not) -be-looked-at-ness"). Her invisibility grants her power unavailable to other characters, yet she uses this power solely {{for the benefit of the}} Noir hero. Because Key LargoÂ 's male character do not pay attention to her, like they do the home girl Nora, Gaye "becomes" invisible, and therefore, she can approach Rocco, steal his gun, and give it to Frank, which he will use to save his life. Despite risking her life, Gaye gains nothing from this act. She uses the power endowed by her invisibility solely to edify Frank.;Using Lacan's "Gaze" theory, I study the way the rejected woman both embodies the gaze and how objects in the film gaze at her. I argue that these gazes register as moments of escape, daydreaming and fantasy (Lacan's Imaginary register) as well as moments of pain, trauma and fascination (Lacan's Real register). Historically, she functions as the gaze because she reminds us collectively of traumas we may not wish to acknowledge consciously, such as racism and the invention and use of the atomic bomb. Objects in the diegesis gaze at her and tell the stories of her personal traumas (rape, prostitution, and death by horrible physical pain) as well as signify her attempts to create a world where fantasy and imagination provide a respite from her dull, dreary life and help her cope with the rejection she faces, most notably from the Noir hero.;Because my project involves close and detailed readings of specific filmic scenes, it focuses on a small selection of Film Noirs: The Maltese Falcon (John Huston 1941), Casablanca (Michael Curtiz 1942), Key Largo (John Huston 1948), Criss Cross (Robert Siodmak 1949), The Big Heat (Fritz Lang 1953) and The Blue Gardenia (Fritz Lang 1953), and Kiss Me Deadly (Robert Aldrich, 1955). I chose films using two criteria: 1) films that particularly are "rejection woman heavy," meaning they contained several examples of this figure, and 2) films that covered the fifteen-year time frame of the Film Noir cycle: 1941. 1955. I also include some outliers, focusing on them as precedents that prefigure the Rejected Woman character type, such as Pepe Le Moko (Julien Duvivier 1937) The Letter (William Wyler 1940), and Citizen Kane (Orson Welles 1941).

40|$|Abstract Nowadays {{plastics}} {{are widely}} spread in our society, {{as reflected in}} a yearly consumption of more than 300 million ton a year. The properties of these plastics such as the strength, stiffness, melting <b>point,</b> <b>gloss</b> [...] . are all strongly dependent on their morphological characteristics. Therefore it shouldn’t be a surprise that studying the solidification process and morphology of polymers has been {{of great interest to}} many research facilities around the globe for decades. Early work in this field by Keller coworkers during the forties and fifties of the previous century demonstrated that, for crystallizable polymers, the long polymeric chains fold into crystalline lamellae. In the beginning of the sixties Hoffman and Lauritzen presented a, by now widely accepted, theory accounting for the formation and growth of such crystals. During the process of crystallization, nucleation is the most critical step and depends on the crystallization conditions such as e. g. the temperature. Due to the emergence of new experimental techniques {{at the turn of the}} last century, the study of polymer crystallization regained interest as observations were made which could not be understood nor explained with the Hoffman & Lauritzen theory. Different authors proposed new crystallization pathways, which quite often involved the interference of a transient mesomorphic phase in the conversion from the liquid to the solid, crystalline state. Mesomorphic phases have characteristics in between the liquid and crystalline states. However, due to the presumed very low volume fraction and short life time of this transient phase it has never been observed directly. In this dissertation we tried to experimentally access this mesomorphic phase as it is assumed to exist for polyethylene. This was attempted by the synthesis and characterization of a special aliphatic polyamide with unusually long methylene sequences, hoping that an ordered melt would be created by hydrogen bonding from which the aliphatic segments could crystallize in a polyethylene like fashion. For these materials it was envisaged that the volume fraction and lifetime of the mesomorphic phase would be expanded. The polymer involved is polyamide 4. 34. Next to investigating PA 4. 34, lipid like model compounds were examined. These model compounds are saturated fatty acid adducts of 1, 4 ‑butanediol and 1, 4 -diaminobutane. The first set of products resembles regular fats for which polymorphism and polymorphic transitions are well documented. In the second set, the ester links of the first set are replaced by amide groups, leading to products that molecularly spoken, strongly resemble PA 4. 34. For these compounds the influence of varying the aliphatic chain length on their thermodynamic properties and crystallization pathways was examined. Chapter 2 reports on the synthesis, thermal behavior and morphology of the di-esters from 1, 4 -butanediol with palmitic (BD 16), stearic (BD 18) or behenic (BD 22) acid. These molecules display monotropic polymorphism. The metastable b’ form is built from outstretched molecules whereas the denser, stable b form is composed of molecules with a kinked conformation. BD 18 and BD 22 crystallize into the b’ form during cooling. Only BD 18 transforms into the b form during subsequent heating via a solid-solid transition. The resistance of BD 22 to convert into the b form is believed to originate from the lack of mobility associated with longer aliphatic chains. In contrast, the polymorphic conversion is thought to be very efficient and to take place during cooling for the shorter BD 16 molecules. The hypothesis is put forward that the original BD 16 b’ nuclei are rapidly overgrown by the b phase by which crystal growth is postponed to larger supercooling where the b phase can grow from the melt. Consequently, BD 16 only occurs in the b form. The melt crystallization of BD 18 and BD 22 into the b’ form hardly requires any supercooling. Adducts of 1, 4 -diaminobutane with palmitic (DA 16), stearic (DA 18) and behenic acid (DA 22) are discussed in chapter 3. All products crystallize into layers composed of hydrogen bonded molecular sheets. The high melting points of these materials as compared to the melting points of the ester based counterparts, are associated with a reduction of the melting entropy due to the preservation of hydrogen bonds in the melt state. Moreover, the low melt entropy is reflected in an observable nanoscale organization of the melt, which appears to facilitate crystal nucleation since crystallization happens during cooling without substantial supercooling for these materials. For all species, enantiotropic polymorphism was observed with the high temperature a phase reversibly converting into the a’ phase upon cooling, essentially by rearrangements of the aliphatic tails. In chapter 4, the synthesis and crystallization behavior of polyamide 4. 34 is presented. Unfortunately, rather than polyethylene like crystallization, still a crystallization into structures commonly seen for polyamides was found. The hydrogen bonds induce sheet formation and their stacking into lamellae. This persistent polyamide like crystallization behavior is most likely due to the long aliphatic moieties still being too short. Using 1, 4 -diaminobutane as central feature, however, seemed to have been a good choice as it induced the desired pre-ordering of the melt, which facilitates crystallization. Ultimately, if this melt ordering would be preserved for even longer aliphatic sequences, it cannot be excluded that polyethylene like crystallization would be triggered over the entire sample volume such that potential mesomorphic precursor phases could be detected.
