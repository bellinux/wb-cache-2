Since <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> often entail examination of thousands or {{tens of thousands of}} animals, strategies for optimizing genetics screens are important for minimizing effort while maximizing the number of mutagenized gametes examined. To date, such strategies have not been described for <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we review general principles of <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> in C. elegans, and use a modified binomial strategy to obtain a general expression for the number of mutagenized gametes examined in a <b>genetic</b> <b>screen.</b> We use this expression to calculate optimal screening parameters for a large range of <b>genetic</b> <b>screen</b> types.

50|$|Forward {{genetics}} (or {{a forward}} <b>genetic</b> <b>screen)</b> is an approach {{used to identify}} genes (or set of genes) responsible for a particular phenotype of an organism. Reverse genetics (or a reverse <b>genetic</b> <b>screen),</b> on the other hand, analyzes the phenotype of an organism following the disruption of a known gene. In short, forward genetics starts with a phenotype and moves towards identifying the gene(s) responsible, where as reverse genetics starts with a known gene and assays the effect of its disruption by analyzing the resultant phenotypes. Both forward and reverse <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> aim to determine gene function.|$|R
25|$|Nearly 300 cystic fibrosis-causing {{mutations}} {{have been}} described. The most common mutation, ΔF508 {{results from a}} deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides which results {{in a loss of}} the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at the 508th position on the protein. As a result, the protein does not fold normally and is more quickly degraded. The vast majority of mutations are infrequent.

25|$|Phenylketonuria.

HTS robots that can test up to 100,000 compounds per day currently exist.

40|$|SummaryWe {{combined}} reverse {{and chemical}} genetics to identify targets and compounds modulating blood vessel development. Through transcript profiling in mice, we identified 150 potentially druggable microvessel-enriched gene products.

In parallel, 1280 pharmacologically active compounds were screened in a human cell-based assay, identifying 28 compounds selectively inhibiting endothelial sprouting. Several links were revealed between {{the results of the}} reverse and chemical <b>genetic</b> <b>screens,</b> including the serine/threonine (S/T) phosphatases ppp 1 ca, ppp 1 cc, and ppp 4 c and an inhibitor of this gene family; Endothall.

40|$|ABSTRACT 4 -Nitroquinoline 1 -oxide (4 -NQO) is {{a highly}} {{carcinogenic}} chemical that induces mutations in bacteria, fungi, and animals through the formation of bulky purine adducts. 4 -NQO {{has been used as}} a mutagen for <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> and in both the study of DNA damage and DNA repair. In the model eukaryote Aspergillus nidulans, 4 -NQO 2 based <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> have been used to study diverse processes, including gene regulation, mitosis, metabolism, organelle transport, and septation. Early work during the 1970 s using bacterial and yeast mutation tester strains concluded that 4 -NQO was a guanine-specific mutagen. However, these strains were limited in their ability to determine full mutagenic potential, as they could not identify mutations at multiple sites, unlinked suppressor mutations, or G:C to C:G transversions. We have now used a whole genome resequencing approach with mutant strains generated from two independent <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> to determine the full mutagenic spectrum of 4 -NQO in A. nidulans. Analysis of 3994 mutations from 38 mutant strains reveals that 4 -NQO induces substitutions in both guanine and adenine residues, although with a 19 -fold preference for guanine. We found no association between mutation load and mutagen dose and observed no sequence bias in the residues flanking the mutated purine base. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout most of the genome. Our data provide new evidence that 4 -NQO can potentially target all base pairs. Furthermore, we predict that current practices for 4 -NQO 2 induced mutagenesis are sufficient to reach gene saturation for <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> with feasible identification of causative mutations via whole genome resequencing.

25|$|Preimplantation <b>genetic</b> <b>screening</b> (PGS) or {{preimplantation}} {{genetic diagnosis}} (PGD) has been suggested {{to be able to}} be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing randomised controlled trials came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by live birth rate. On the contrary, for women of advanced maternal age, PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of mosaicism are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, with no endemic malaria, the {{prevalence}} of sickle-cell anaemia among African Americans is lower (about 0.25%) than in West Africa (about 4.0%) and is falling. Without endemic malaria, the sickle-cell mutation is purely disadvantageous and tends to decline in the affected population by natural selection, and now artificially through prenatal <b>genetic</b> <b>screening.</b> However, the African American community descends from a significant admixture of several African and non-African ethnic groups and also represents the descendants of survivors of slavery and the slave trade. Thus, a lower degree of endogamy and, particularly, abnormally high health-selective pressure through slavery {{may be the most}} plausible explanations for the lower prevalence of sickle-cell anaemia (and, possibly, other genetic diseases) among African Americans compared to West Africans. Another factor that limits the spread of sickle-cell genes in North America is the absence of cultural proclivities to polygamy, which allows affected males to continue to seek unaffected children with multiple partners.|$|E
25|$|Glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency (G6PD deficiency), a form {{of which}} is known as favism (after the fava bean), is an X-linked recessive inborn error of metabolism that predisposes to hemolysis (spontaneous destruction of red blood cells) and resultant jaundice {{in response to a}} number of triggers, such as certain foods, illness, or medication. It is particularly common in people of Mediterranean and African origin. The condition is characterized by abnormally low levels of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme involved in the pentose phosphate pathway that is especially important in the red blood cell. G6PD deficiency is the most common human enzyme condition. There is no specific treatment, other than avoiding known triggers. In the United States, no <b>genetic</b> <b>screening</b> of prospective parents is recommended, as the symptoms only show in part of the carriers and when that is the case, they can be prevented or controlled, and as a result the condition generally has no impact on the lifespan of those affected.

40|$|International audienceTamoxifen is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used drug to treat breast cancer and acts by blocking estrogen receptor (ERα) signalling. Although highly effective, its usefulness is limited by the development of resistance. Given this, strategies that limit resistance by sensitising cells to tamoxifen may show utility in the clinic. To gain insight into how this might be achieved, we used chemical and <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> to identify targets and small molecule inhibitors that cause tamoxifen sensitisation. A high-throughput <b>genetic</b> <b>screen,</b> using an RNA interference library targeting 779 kinases and related proteins, identified the PDK 1 signalling pathway as a strong determinant of sensitivity to multiple ERα antagonists including tamoxifen. A chemical screen using existing drugs and known kinase inhibitors also identified inhibitors of the PDK 1 pathway, including triciribine and tetrandrine. Aside from identifying novel agents and targets for tamoxifen sensitisation, this approach also provides evidence that performing chemical and <b>genetic</b> <b>screens</b> in parallel may be useful...|$|R
