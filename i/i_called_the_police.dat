As I passed the corner which leads from Bentinck Street on to the Welbeck Street crossing a two-horse van furiously driven whizzed round and was on me like a flash. I sprang for the foot-path and saved myself by the fraction of a second. The van dashed round by Marylebone Lane and was gone in an instant. I kept to the pavement after that, Watson, but as I walked down Vere Street a brick came down from the roof of one of the houses, and was shattered to fragments at my feet. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> and had the place examined. There were slates and bricks piled up on the roof preparatory to some repairs, and they would have me believe that the wind had toppled over one of these. Of course I knew better, but I could prove nothing. I took a cab after that and reached my brother's rooms in Pall Mall, where I spent the day. Now I have come round to you, and on my way I was attacked by a rough with a bludgeon. I knocked him down, and the police have him in custody; but I can tell you with the most absolute confidence that no possible connection will ever be traced between the gentleman upon whose front teeth I have barked my knuckles and the retiring mathematical coach, who is, I dare say, working out problems upon a black-board ten miles away. You will not wonder, Watson, that my first act on entering your rooms was to close your shutters, and that I have been compelled to ask your permission to leave the house by some less conspicuous exit than the front door." ...|$|E

5000|$|The all-girls' {{aspect of}} Topstars is offset further by the namesake band renting rehearsal-space; the members are Ruben on keyboards, garage-owner's son Tom on drums, odd-job man Bas on guitar and policeman's son Daan on vocals and bass. However, Ruben starts {{skipping}} rehearsals and eventually finds himself replaces with Bas' cousin Lars. He swears revenge; he cancels the rent, sabotages {{a meeting with}} a record-executive and hooks up with Olivier, a shady character who's dating Daan's sister Marieke. Olivier locks up Bas for being competition (nobody believes the latter's version of events) and sells Ecstasy to Lars {{who works as a}} DJ in his spare-time. Lars turns out to be no angel himself; he skips rehearsals too and nicks Tom's girlfriend Anna. Tom is not happy when he finds out the true reason he's been dumped and after a well-deserved punch-up he announces his departure on a radio-show. [...] "Topstars are looking for a new drummer because him over there couldn't keep his dirty hands off my girlfriend". He also swears never to set foot again at the dance-school. The others manage to get Olivier banned from the place but Peggy tears a strip off everyone because they kept her in the dark all the time. [...] "Don't you trust me or something ? The next time, and I hope for you lot that there won't be a next time, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> Topstars is a drug-free place and it stays that way!". Tom is coaxed back into the band and at the showcase they earn a recording contract.|$|R

It is, as I have said, a {{labyrinth}} of an old house, especially the original wing, which is now practically uninhabited; but we ransacked every room and cellar without discovering the least sign of the missing man.

On October 26, the couple went to Noblesville to return the truck to owner Ronnie Herron. Hull then used Herron's home to burn several blood-stained items. [...] On the same day detectives, who had now identified the victims, searched Hull and Pender's home, in which they found traces of blood and observed that attempts had been made to conceal the murders. Hull was arrested in Noblesville on October 27, and confessed to both murders. On October 28, Pender gave <b>the</b> <b>police</b> a pair of blood-stained pants belonging to Hull.

60|$|But be it {{that this}} is virtue; be it that there is virtue in this well-selected rigor: yet all virtues are not equally {{becoming}} to all men and at all times. There are crimes, undoubtedly there are crimes, which in all seasons of our existence ought to put a generous antipathy in action,--crimes that provoke an indignant justice, and call forth a warm and animated pursuit. But all things that concern what <b>I</b> may <b>call</b> <b>the</b> preventive <b>police</b> of morality, all things merely rigid, harsh, and censorial, the antiquated moralists at whose feet I was brought up would not have thought these the fittest matter to form the favorite virtues of young men of rank. What might have been well enough, and have been received with a veneration mixed with awe and terror, from an old, severe, crabbed Cato, would have wanted something of propriety in the young Scipios, the ornament of the Roman nobility, in the flower of their life. But the times, the morals, the masters, the scholars, have all undergone a thorough revolution. It is a vile, illiberal school, this new French academy of the sans-culottes. There is nothing in it that is fit for a gentleman to learn.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, while Nickels {{worked as}} a {{freelance}} reporter for the The Philadelphia Inquirer, he came under fire for writing an article {{that was based on}} fabrication. The story, [...] "Painful silence makes the slaying of a gay man a double tragedy," [...] details the senseless murder of a gay man in Philadelphia's Washington Square. Furthermore, Nickels claimed that [...] "there was no news -- no mention -- of the killing in the daily press or on any of Philadelphia's TV stations," [...] suggesting the man's sexuality to be the reason for the silence. It soon came out that no such murder actually occurred. According to Nickels, his informant, [...] "Steve Lev," [...] had made up the story, but Nickels never verified any of the facts. The Inquirer published a five-paragraph retraction after the incident came to light, and Nickels was fired for negligence. Nickels later defended himself, saying:"It's pretty distressing to me. I feel kind of caught in the middle. I really saw an injustice here and the injustice outraged me... I guess I expected the paper to work with me if they saw glitches and holes. The Inquirer erred, too... Opinion and Editorial Editor Chris Satullo said he felt I had been victimized, but could not get past that dogmatic, technical point that <b>I</b> did not <b>call</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> This was an unforgivable sin and I should be excommunicated. A lifetime of excommunication seemed very unfair to me." ...|$|R
