The uncertainty reflected in the bounds, however, provides relatively high starting prices for these strategies. We here show how the effect of uncertainty to a substantial extent can be offset by interpolation, i. e., the hedging in auxiliary market traded securities. As before, the technology does not involve the specification of models for the term structure of volatilities and interest rates, and should therefore be particularly appropriate {{from the point of}} view of risk management...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{ability of}} mutual fund advisors {{to invest in}} {{derivatives}} is potentially costly for fund investors. Advisors could use derivatives to achieve a level of risk different from investor preferences (Brown, Harlow, and Starks, 1996, and Chevalier and Ellison, 1997). Absent any benefits, the costs of allowing investment in derivatives suggest that mutual funds should systematically prohibit their use. We find, however, that nearly two-thirds of funds allow investment {{in at least one}} type of derivative. Why do such a large number of funds <b>permit</b> <b>investment</b> in derivatives? We argue that derivatives offer transactioncost benefits, such as economies with respect to trading costs, the cost of liquidity-motivated trading, and the opportunity cost of holding cash. We predict that the choice to <b>permit</b> <b>investment</b> in derivatives is driven by the transaction-cost benefits weighed against the potential agency costs. Our empirical results support this prediction. We find that...|$|R

For example, a capital appreciation fund generally looks to earn most of its returns from increases in the prices of the securities it holds, rather than from dividend or interest income. The investment approach describes the criteria that the fund manager uses to select investments for the fund.|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we study anti-unification for unranked <b>hedges,</b> <b>permitting</b> context and <b>hedge</b> variables. Hedges are {{sequences}} of unranked terms. The anti-unification problem of two hedges ˜s and ˜q {{is concerned with}} finding their generalization, a hedge ˜g such that both ˜s and ˜q are substitution instances of ˜g. Second-order power is gained by using context variables to generalize vertical differences at the input hedges. Hedge variables are used to generalize horizontal differences. An anti-unification algorithm is presented, which computes a generalization of input hedges and records all the differences. The computed generalizations are least general among a certain class of generalizations. We can compute an lgg which contains, for instance, a constrained longest common subforest, or an agreement subhedge/subtree of the input hedges...|$|R

5000|$|The recent {{divestment}} {{of assets}} implicated in funding {{the government of}} Sudan, in acknowledgment of acts of terrorism and genocide perpetrated in the Darfur conflict. In the United States, this divestment has taken place {{at the state level}} (including Illinois, which led the way, followed by New Jersey, Oregon, and Maine). It has also taken place at many North American Universities, notably Cornell University, Harvard University, Case Western Reserve University, Queen's University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Amherst College, Yale University, Brown University, the University of California, the University of Pennsylvania, Brandeis University, the University of Colorado, American University, University of Delaware, Emory University, and the University of Vermont. The Sudan Divestment Task Force [...] has organized a nationwide group which advocates a targeted divestment policy, to minimize any negative effects on Sudanese civilians while still placing financial pressure on the government. The so-called 'targeted divestment approach' generally <b>permits</b> <b>investment</b> in Sudan, and is thus radically different from the comprehensive divestment that ended apartheid in South Africa. Because targeted divestment <b>permits</b> <b>investment</b> in hundreds of multinational corporate and private-equity firms that support, lend legitimacy to, and pay taxes and graft to the government of Sudan, policy experts suggest that this [...] "feel good" [...] approach will have little impact on the Sudanese government's sponsorship of terrorism and genocide. Because of the massive deficiencies in the so-called 'targeted divestment approach,' human rights advocates recommend the more comprehensive approach to divestment that has been taken by the State of Illinois. [...] Under this approach, sponsored by State Senator Jacqueline Collins, public pensions are prohibited from investing in any corporation or private equity firm that conducts business in Sudan, unless authorized to do so by the U.S. Government.|$|R

40|$|Social Security is a {{financial}} asset whose purchase is compulsory for most working individuals. This paper {{shows that the}} return on Social Security during the individual s working lifetime {{is related to the}} rate of change of aggregate labor income. If an individual s labor income is strongly related to aggregate labor income, then the Social Security asset is a particularly unattractive asset. In this situation, the individual would benefit from a reformed Social Security system that would <b>permit</b> <b>investment</b> of retirement funds in other financial assets. This paper investigates how this aspect of Social Security risk varies across groups of individuals who differ according to gender; education; race; and age. The main finding is that there are important differences across groups in this component of Social Security risk, as captured by the sensitivity of individual-level income growth to changes in the SSWI. This element of risk is most important for women, especially women who are young-to-middle aged and with more education. This analysis suggests that women would have more to gain, compared with men, from a reformed Social Security system. ...|$|R

50|$|The Tax Reform Act {{eliminated}} the double taxation of income earned at the corporate level by an issuer and dividends paid to securities holders, thereby allowing a REMIC to structure a mortgage-backed securities offering as a sale of assets, effectively removing the {{loans from the}} originating lender's balance sheet, rather than a debt financing in which the loans remain as balance sheet assets (as {{is the case for}} covered bonds). A REMIC itself is exempt from federal taxes, although income earned by investors is fully taxable.

Nonmortgage assets, such as credit card receivables, leases, and auto loans are ineligible investments.
