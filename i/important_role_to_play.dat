25|$|In {{the light}} of {{modernization}} and the resulting necessity for a more interventionist state, administrative law has an increasingly <b>important</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in Singapore {{to ensure that the}} vulnerable individual has protection and practical remedies against abuse of power by the state. This is particularly so in Singapore's hegemonic, Westminster-based form of parliamentary government where the executive dominates the legislative agenda, because the alternate means of political control – holding the executive accountable to the popularly elected legislature – is almost negligible. The judiciary thus exists as an independent check on executive power and it fulfils this function through judicial review of administrative action. This review jurisdiction of the High Court is to be contrasted with its appellate jurisdiction: the latter is derived from the statutory framework, while judicial review is a power inherent as part of the court's supervisory jurisdiction. Both are designed to address different types of wrongs that an administrative decision-maker may commit.|$|E

In the past, too, the ancestors had an <b>important</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play,</b> with the difference that, among the nobility, genealogical memory and patrilineal descent were much more emphasized. Thus, the Popol Vuh lists three genealogies of upper lords descending from three ancestors and their wives. These first male ancestors – ritually defined as 'bloodletters and sacrificers' – had received their private deities in a legendary land of origins called 'The Seven Caves and Seven Canyons' (Nahua Chicomoztoc), and on their disappearance, left a sacred bundle. Already during the Classic period, ancestral deities (the three 'patron deities' of Palenque) and ancestral bundles (Yaxchilan) are in evidence.

500|$|Santiago Fouz-Hernández {{wrote in}} his book, Madonna's Drowned Worlds, that the Black woman who catches Madonna when she is falling through heaven in her dream, is a symbol for the divinity, as she helps Madonna {{throughout}} the video {{to come to the}} correct decision. Fouz-Hernández explained how the physical similarity between Madonna and woman indicated that it was actually Madonna's inner divinity which was rescuing her. When the singer accidentally cuts her hand on the dagger, it was described as receiving stigmata by scholar Robert McQueen Grant, who believed that the scene marked Madonna as having an <b>important</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the narrative. This was evident when the crime scene is shown in detail, and an identification is established between Madonna and the victim. Freya Jarman-Ivens, coauthor with Fouz-Hernández, noted that the woman cries out for help when Madonna sings the line [...] "When you call my name, It's like a little prayer". However, Madonna could not do anything thus portraying failure of divinity to save. Jarman-Ivens also noted the look between the gang member and Madonna, which she thought was a complicity of [...] "White men rape/kill women, white men blame it on Black men; Women are raped/killed for being on the streets at night, Black men are nevertheless thrown in jail." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} organisational slack and innovation from a new perspective. Moving away from the traditional quantitative research approaches, semi-structured interviews and an activity theory framework are used to operationalize a qualitative view of how slack affects the innovation process.

In contrast with existing literature’s emphasis on money as the purest form of slack, the data presented here suggest that time and other kinds of informal slack have <b>important</b> <b>roles</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the innovation process...|$|R

This paper uses the 'task' approach alongside a Recentred Influence Function decomposition framework to explore the factors associated with this pattern of change.

Beyond describing the process by which NGCs are put in place, the authors provide an excellent discussion that contrasts CED and the NGC differences, tensions, and complementarities. While differences and tensions may exist, it is argued, they are seen as tools lodged within a larger CED strategy; both have <b>important</b> <b>roles</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in rural revitalization...|$|R
2500|$|In 1901, {{workers in}} Pennsylvania's silk mills went on strike. Many {{of them were}} young female workers {{demanding}} to be paid adult wages. The 1900 census had revealed that one sixth of American {{children under the age}} of sixteen were employed. John Mitchell, the president of the UMWA, brought Mother Jones to north-east Pennsylvania in the months of February and September to encourage unity among striking workers. To do so, she encouraged the wives of the workers to organize into a group that would wield brooms, beat on tin pans, and shout [...] "join the union!" [...] She felt that wives had an <b>important</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> as the nurturers and motivators of the striking men, but not as fellow workers.

2500|$|Most krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, form large swarms, {{sometimes}} reaching {{densities of}} 10,000–60,000 individual animals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators {{that would like}} to pick out single individuals. The largest swarms are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm was observed to cover an area of 450 square kilometers (175 square miles) of ocean, to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet) and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface. Until recently it has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. It has been found that the deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an <b>important</b> <b>role</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because it makes them extremely vulnerable to predators. Dense swarms may elicit a feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy. [...] In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented {{what appears to be a}} successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: [...] " [...] (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion." ...|$|E
