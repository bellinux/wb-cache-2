25|$|His last <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> {{show was}} {{presented}} in Paris at the Musée Rodin on 23 January 2008. It was, however, somewhat marred by his criticism of fellow Italian design duo Dolce & Gabbana, {{and the death of}} Australian actor Heath Ledger although few allowed these things to detract from his final show, which received a standing ovation from the entire audience that included hundreds of notable names from all areas of show business. Many models returned to attend Valentino's last <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> show; the audience included Eva Herzigová, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Nadja Auermann, Karolina Kurková and Karen Mulder.|$|E

25|$|The Englishman Charles Frederick Worth had {{established}} his first fashion house in Paris in 1858. He {{was the first}} couturier, a dressmaker considered an artist, {{and his ability to}} dictate design in the 1860s lead to the dominance of Parisian <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> for the next hundred years.|$|E
25|$|A fashion blog {{can cover}} many {{things such as}} {{specific}} items of clothing and accessories, beauty tips, trends in various apparel markets (<b>haute</b> <b>couture,</b> prêt-à-porter, etc.), celebrity fashion choices and street fashion trends. They cover fashion at all levels from the largest fashion design houses to the smallest independent designers.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Belle Époque, the industry of <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> (high fashion) was dominated by the House of Worth. Charles Worth had designed the clothes of the Empress Eugénie during the Second Empire and turned high fashion into an industry. His shop at 7 Rue de la Paix helped make that street the center of fashion in Paris. By 1900, there were more than twenty houses of <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> in Paris, led by designers including Jeanne Paquin, Paul Poiret, Georges Doeuillet, Margaine-Lacroix, Redfern, Raudnitz, Rouff, Callot Sœurs, Blanche Lebouvier, and others, including sons of Charles Worth. Most of these houses had fewer than fifty employees, but the top six or seven firms each had between four hundred and nine hundred employees. They were concentrated on Rue de la Paix and around the Place Vendôme, with a few on the nearby Grands Boulevards. At the Universal Exposition of 1900, an entire building was devoted to fashion designers. The first fashion show with models had taken place in London in 1908; the idea was quickly copied in Paris. Jeanne Lanvin {{became a member of the}} Chambre syndicale de la <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> (Syndicate of fashion designers) in 1909. Coco Chanel opened her first shop in Paris in 1910, but her fame as a designer came after the First World War.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there had}} been some {{experiments}} with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci's sleek designs caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them. Instead, he left the Air Force and set up an <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the Isle of Capri.|$|E
25|$|Beaton often {{photographed the}} Royal Family for {{official}} publication. Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother was his favourite royal sitter, and he once pocketed her scented hankie as a keepsake from {{a highly successful}} shoot. Beaton took the famous wedding pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor (wearing an <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> ensemble by the noted American fashion designer Mainbocher).|$|E
25|$|To {{regain the}} {{business}} {{primacy of the}} House of Chanel, in the fashion fields of <b>haute</b> <b>couture,</b> prêt-à-porter, costume jewelry, and parfumerie, would be expensive; so Chanel approached Pierre Wertheimer for business advice and capital. Having decided {{to do business with}} Coco Chanel, Wertheimer’s negotiations to fund the resurgence of the House of Chanel, granted him commercial rights to all Chanel-brand products.|$|E
25|$|The late 1980s also {{witnessed}} {{the beginnings of}} Indo Western fashion and the <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> fashion in India that would eventually gain global recognition in the 90s. Colors like red and white were popular, often with intricate embroidery. Although most women continued to wear the saree, Bollywood actresses also had access to Western designer outfits and locally designed garments like the Anarkali ballgown.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1980s, the corset has {{experienced}} periodic revivals, all which have usually originated in <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> and have occasionally trickled through to mainstream fashion. These revivals {{focus on the}} corset as an item of outerwear rather than underwear. The strongest of these revivals {{was seen in the}} Autumn 2001 fashion collections and coincided with the release of the film Moulin Rouge!; the costumes featured many corsets as characteristic of the era. Another fashion movement, which has renewed interest in the corset, is the Steampunk culture that utilizes late-Victorian fashion shapes in new ways.|$|E
25|$|The House of Schiaparelli {{was first}} {{opened in the}} 1930s at 21 Place Vendôme, but was shut down on 13 December 1954. In 2007, an Italian {{business}} man Diego Della Valle acquired the brand, but it wasn't until Marco Zanini was appointed in September 2013 that details of the brand's revival became public. The house has been nominated {{for a return to}} the Chambre Syndicale de la <b>Haute</b> <b>Couture</b> list of members, and presented its first show since nomination in January 2014. Schiaparelli, using a hyper-exclusive business strategy, is to sell its first collection exclusively at a by-appointment boutique in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Mills {{extended}} his musical interests in 1976 when he formed the a cappella vocal ensemble The Star-Scape Singers. He and his singers would eventually give concerts throughout Eastern and Western Europe and the United States. Mills also engaged in musical composition, creating both choral and orchestral works.

He was recognized for mentoring and sponsorship of artists in all these disciplines, and he continued his mentoring and spontaneous speaking until {{shortly before his death}} in October 2004.|$|E
25|$|The doll clothes {{designed}} by BillyBoy* which are worn by Mdvanii {{are made in}} the tradition of French <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> and were originally made in France but since 1997 are also made in Switzerland. They use the same fabrics, embroideries and details as French fashion-makers: Lesage embroideries, Gripoix jewellery details, as well as stocks of fabrics from the collection of BillyBoy*, as Raoul Dufy printed silk satin made for Paul Poiret given to him by his daughter Perrine de Wilde (née Poiret), vintage 1940s Schiaparelli satin given to BillyBoy* by the defunct House of Schiaparelli, and a swatch of Sonia Delaunay painted silk given to BillyBoy* by Delaunay when he was a teen.|$|E
25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man in shadows spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and getting dressed, continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, with sweat dripping heavily down his face and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta {{standing in front of a}} white background with the wind blowing, wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris <b>Haute</b> <b>Couture</b> creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E
25|$|The central {{standing}} 'foreground' {{figure is}} shown affectionately holding {{in both hands}} a blue bird (thus {{the title of the}} painting). The reclining figure wearing a necklace shown in the lower center of the canvas is placed next to a pedestal fruit bowl and another bird with the unmistakable coloration of the rare Scarlet ibis (L'Ibis rouge), a rich symbol for both exoticism and fashion. Costume designers for Parisian cabarets such as Le Lido, Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge and <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> houses in Paris during the 1910s used the feathers of the scarlet Ibis in their shows and collections. The Ibis is a bird to which the ancient Egyptians paid religious worship and attributed to it a 'virgin purity'. A mysterious pyramidal shape is seen as if through a porthole {{to the right of the}} reclining figure's head, though it remains a matter of speculation whether there exists any relation to the ibis or pyramids of ancient Egypt. In front of the pyramid appears a shape that resembles a sundial, perhaps meant as the element of time, or 'duration', as the clock placed in the upper right hand corner of his Nude of 1910.|$|E
500|$|She {{insisted on}} the scenes where she {{explains}} to Andy {{the connection between the}} blue sweater she's wearing and the <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> industry, and the scene where Miranda briefly opens up to Andy, without makeup, about her divorce.

500|$|Madonna {{had promised}} {{that there would}} be no {{wardrobe}} malfunction during the show, alluding to controversy surrounding Janet Jackson's performance in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Madonna's show's fashion theme was the Roman Empire, with gladiator influences combined with modern Roman elements. Costume designer B. Akerlund created the dresses, which took over three months. Akerlund called on other designers to contribute to the costumes, which included Givenchy <b>haute</b> <b>couture,</b> boots by Miu Miu and earrings by Bvlgari. She worked closely with Madonna, who was involved with details including costuming the show's gladiators. According to Akerlund: ...|$|E
500|$|Marcus was {{responsible}} {{for a number of}} innovations at the Dallas retailer. He created the annual Neiman-Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in Fashion, beginning in 1938, which led to the Neiman-Marcus Exposition, a fall fashion show held annually from 1938 to 1970, then periodically thereafter. His department store was the first American <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> boutique to introduce weekly fashion shows, and the first to host concurrent art exhibitions at the store itself.

500|$|Stefani made {{most of the}} {{clothing}} that she wore on stage with No Doubt, resulting in increasingly eclectic combinations. Stylist Andrea Lieberman introduced her to <b>haute</b> <b>couture</b> clothing, which led to Stefani launching a fashion line named L.A.M.B. in 2004. The line takes influence {{from a variety of}} fashions, including Guatemalan, Japanese, and Jamaican styles. The line achieved popularity among celebrities and is worn by stars such as Teri Hatcher, Nicole Kidman, and Stefani herself. In June 2005, she expanded her collection with the less expensive Harajuku Lovers line, which she referred to as [...] "a glorified merchandise line", with varied products including a camera, mobile phone charms, and undergarments. In late 2006, Stefani released a limited edition line of dolls called [...] "Love. Angel. Music. Baby. Fashion dolls". The dolls are inspired by the various fashion that Stefani and the Harajuku Girls wore while touring for the album.|$|E
