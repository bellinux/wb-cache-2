5|$|The Rosenstiel School's {{research}} {{includes the}} study of marine life, particularly Aplysia and coral; climate change; air-sea interactions; coastal ecology; and admiralty law. The school operates a marine research laboratory ship, and has a research site at an inland sinkhole. Research also includes the use of data from weather satellites and the school operates its own satellite <b>downlink</b> facility.|$|E
5|$|The antennas at TSS serve {{more than}} thirty {{missions}} and contain both a multi-frequency uplink and L, S and X band <b>downlink.</b> In addition there are customer-owned reception, telemetry, tracking and control systems. TSS acts as a local user terminal for the Cospas-Sarsat system used for search and rescue. By {{using a combination of}} SvalSat and TrollSat, customers can download data twice per orbit, twenty-six times per day, with only a forty-minute maximum delay. These are the only two ground stations able to communicate with all orbits of LEO satellites. Tromsø is connected to SvalSat via the Svalbard Undersea Cable System.|$|E
5|$|The Ka-band {{subsystem}} {{was used}} for demonstration purposes. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. During the cruise phase, spacecraft Ka-band telemetry was tracked 36 times by these antennas proving functionality at all antennas. Ka-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier. If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost. The Ka <b>downlink</b> is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the Ka-band capability {{of one of the}} SDST transponders has already failed, (and the other might have the same problem) JPL decided to halt all Ka-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.|$|E
50|$|Generally, <b>downlinks</b> {{were more}} {{successful}} in the day than in the night. <b>Downlinks</b> also suffered {{in the event of}} cloudy weather, although on some occasions it was able to reacquire the signal. Some difficulty was found with <b>downlinks</b> to high-latitude ground stations, like DLR.|$|R

25|$|In {{cellular}} networks, {{the channel}} from the users (or phones) {{to the base}} station(s) {{is known as the}} uplink channel. Conversely, the <b>downlink</b> channel is from he base station(s) to the users. The <b>downlink</b> channel is the most studied with stochastic geometry models while models for the uplink case, which is a more difficult problem, are starting to be developed.|$|E

25|$|Low rate {{telemetry}} is {{routed through}} the TMU {{such that it}} can only be <b>downlinked</b> as uncoded bits (in other words there is no error correction). At high rate, one of a set of rates between 10 bit/s and 115.2 kbit/s is <b>downlinked</b> as coded symbols.|$|R
25|$|Radio Science Subsystem (RSS): The RSS is a remote-sensing {{instrument}} that uses radio antennas on Earth {{to observe the}} way radio signals from the spacecraft change as they are sent through objects, such as Titan's atmosphere or Saturn's rings, or even behind the Sun. The RSS also studies the compositions, pressures and temperatures of atmospheres and ionospheres, radial structure and particle size distribution within rings, body and system masses and the gravitational field. The instrument uses the spacecraft X-band communication link as well as S-band <b>downlink</b> and Ka-band uplink and <b>downlink.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{broadcast}} {{frequency of the}} microwave <b>downlink</b> (if used) would require isolating the SBSP systems away from other satellites. GEO space is already well used and it is considered unlikely the ITU would allow an SPS to be launched.|$|E
25|$|The {{spacecraft}} operated {{successfully for}} over four times its design life. A component {{within the last}} remaining working chain of X-band <b>downlink</b> subsystem failed on January 15, 2008. The other chain in the X-band subsystem had previously failed in 2003.|$|E
40|$|Potential radio {{frequency}} interference problems related to the colocation of antennas for the Mark 4 -A Deep Space network are analyzed. Cases discussed include effects of S-band uplinks on X-band <b>downlinks</b> and S-band <b>downlinks,</b> planetary radar at Goldstone, future X-band uplink, radiometer measurements, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence instrument, and radio astronomy projects.

25|$|Even {{before the}} <b>downlink</b> signal was lost due to distance, the {{hydrazine}} attitude control {{fuel on board}} the spacecraft was considered likely to freeze, as the radioisotope thermal generators (RTGs) failed to generate enough power for the heaters to overcome radiative heat loss into space. Once the hydrazine froze, the spacecraft {{would no longer be}} able to maneuver to keep its high gain antenna pointing towards Earth, and the <b>downlink</b> signal would then be lost in a matter of days. The failure of the X-band communications subsystem hastened this, because the coldest part of the fuel pipework was routed over the X-band TWTAs, because when one of them was operating, this kept this part of the pipework warm enough.|$|E
25|$|They now operate another Eurocopter EC135 P2, G-POLA, {{acquired}} in July 2010. The EC135 offers {{a range of}} capabilities including high definition thermal video recording, a microwave <b>downlink</b> to send images to control rooms, a 30 million candlepower spot light and an enhanced navigation system.|$|E

The radio <b>downlinks</b> are vital in providing data on the health and status of the total experiments package, in real time, during the flight. The amateur radio operators, prepared to receive the <b>downlinks</b> and OSCAR- 10 relays, revealed that there was enormous interest throughout the world, to participate.

25|$|The uplink {{communications}} are executed via S-band microwave communications. The <b>downlink</b> communications {{are carried}} out by an X-band microwave transmitter on board the spacecraft, with an S-band transmitter as a back-up.

25|$|Arrays of feeds– In {{order to}} produce an {{arbitrary}} shaped beam, instead of one feed horn, an array of feed horns clustered around the focal point can be used. Array-fed antennas are often used on communication satellites, particularly direct broadcast satellites, to create a <b>downlink</b> radiation pattern to cover a particular continent or coverage area. They are often used with secondary reflector antennas such as the Cassegrain.|$|E
