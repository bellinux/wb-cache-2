In the first part, the separation of a mixture of three model compounds of bio-oil from a vapor and carrier gas stream was investigated {{with the help of a}} series of three condensers maintained at different temperatures. The practical performance of the <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation</b> train was improved by comparing the experimental results with the theoretical results predicted by the HYSYS modeling tool. It showed that good heat transfer and mixing was essential, and could be achieved by using condensers with a cyclonic entry. It also showed that a good demister was essential to achieve effective separation. The second and third parts of the investigation focused on the <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation</b> of actual bio-oil vapors produced from the pyrolysis of two different biomasses: birch bark and Kraft lignin, respectively. In both cases, the temperatures of the condensers were optimized in order to separate the water present in the bio-oil vapor stream and increase the quality and the stability of the remaining bio-oil. The condenser train consisted of a condenser-cum-electrostatic precipitator (C-ESP) installed between two cyclonic condensers. The water content of the fractionated bio-oil was found to be less than 1 wt% with both biomasses. In case of Kraft lignin, the phenolics recovered in different bio-oil fractions were also analyzed. The effect of pyrolysis temperature on the fractionated bio-oil yield and characteristics was investigated...|$|E

The atmospheric composition may be altered by <b>fractional</b> vaporization, cloud <b>condensation,</b> photoionization, and reaction with any residual volatile elements remaining in the atmosphere. Cloud condensation reduces the abundance of all elements in the atmosphere except Na and K.

40|$|Since {{typically}} {{the physics of}} many body quantum systems is solely described and determined by pairwise interactions, the concept of reduced particle information is fundamentally relevant, particularly for indistinguishable particles. Determining the compatibility of r-particle reduced density operators (r -RDOs) with some N -particle state {{is known as the}} N -representability problem. The Pauli exclusion principle provides a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for the N -representability of fermionic 1 -RDOs. However, pure N -representability requires a set of stricter conditions which are known as Generalised Pauli constraints (GPCs). In this thesis we investigate the influence and significance of the GPCs beyond the well-explored and established relevance of the Pauli exclusion principle. In particular, we analytically study the (quasi-) pinning effect which corresponds to a saturation of the GPCs and imposes structural simplifications on the N -fermion state. So far, nothing is known about its origin and mechanisms. We will close this gap by analytically examining the dependence of quasipinning on the particle number, the dimensionality and the spin polarisation in a representative physical model system. Our results suggest the notion of a microscopic Pauli pressure which is a consequence of the competition between energy minimisation and antisymmetry, and drives the system towards the boundary of the allowed region. Furthermore, the relevance of quasipinning beyond the wellknown Pauli exclusion principle is evaluted by the Q -measure. The outcomes provide first direct evidence for the need to incorporate GPCs into the physical description. To explore the role of the fermionic exchange symmetry beyond the Pauli exclusion principle from a more general perspective, we consider systems of hardcore bosons. Indeed, they exhibit a (lattice-based) exclusion principle, although their exchange symmetry is bosonic. Occupation numbers on oneparticle states other than the lattice basis can exceed one. We prove that the maximal occupation number is given by λ max = N/ d (d - N + 1) where N, d are the numbers of particles and lattice sites. In addition, we derive necessary conditions for the N -representability of hardcore boson 1 -RDOs and investigate the one-particle entropy boundaries. Finally, we present one-dimensional physical systems which macroscopically saturate λ max and exhibit (<b>fractional)</b> Bose-Einstein <b>condensation.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 This thesis {{examines}} various mechanisms {{controlling the}} amount and distribution of precipitation in mountainous terrain. In Chapter 2, linear theory and numerical simulations are used to investigate how the tropopause affects the vertical structure of mountain waves, and in turn orographic precipitation. In idealized numerical simulations, variations in {{the height of the}} tropopause are found to strongly modulate the depth and magnitude of windward ascent, resulting in a factor-of-two difference in total precipitation across a ridge. The implications of this result are then extended to realistic terrain using {{a modified version of the}} Smith-Barstad orographic precipitation model. Chapter 3 addresses the causes of rain-shadow variability in the Washington Cascades. Fluctuations in the large-scale circulation over the North Pacific is found to explain around 70 % of interannual variability in the wintertime rain shadow. Across individual storms, the strongest rain shadows are found to be associated with warm-sector events, while the weakest rain shadows occur during warm-frontal passages. Inter-storm variability in the Cascade rain shadow is further explored in Chapter 4, via numerical simulations involving both real and idealized terrain. Storms with weak rain shadows are shown to exhibit much less evaporation east of the crest than storms with strong rain shadows. The suppression of east-slope evaporation during weak-rain-shadow storms is found to be caused by the presence of stagnant, stable air at low levels, which in turn is shown to be a consequence of warm-frontal passage. In Chapter 5, a simple numerical model is used to evaluate the response of orographic precipitation to surface warming under idealized conditions representative of some of the strongest orographic storms. An upward shift is found in the pattern of condensation with warming, caused by larger <b>fractional</b> changes in <b>condensation</b> at low temperature and amplified warming aloft. As a result, the distribution of precipitation shifts downwind, causing larger fractional changes in precipitation on the lee slope than on the windward slope. In addition, total precipitation is found to increase by a smaller fraction than near-surface water vapor, in contrast to expected changes in other types of extreme precipitation...|$|R

40|$|When {{compared}} to conventional liquid fuels, bio-oil has several undesired properties {{such as high}} viscosity, high acidity, high molecular weight, instability, and phase separation upon aging. Therefore, bio-oil needs further stabilization and upgrading {{before it can be}} used as a fuel in engines.

40|$|The {{range of}} olivine {{compositions}} forming anomalous inclusions in chondrules suggests <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation,</b> {{as does the}} sequence of minerals in fine matrix particles. Chondrule bulk compositions vary in a random way as the precursors (condensates) were assembled heterogeneously. Chondrule heating and cooling were moderately rapid, and at high oxygen fugacities, suggesting processing in a localized particle-rich clump in the nebula. Rims deposited on chondrules show that condensation continued after chondrule formation. The hot particle-rich clump slows radiative cooling of chondrules, allows condensation, provides high oxygen fugacity {{as a result of}} evaporation and generates the collisions needed to fragment chondrules. The simultaneous evaporation/condensation and melting/crystallization are explained by pressure gradients in the clump. In the thickest parts of the clump, high vapor pressure allows melting, but at the outside evaporation and condensation would proceed. The observation that round chondrules are more magnesian and fragments are more ferroan is similarly consistent with formation in outer low-pressure reduced regions and the thick clump center, respectively. Turbulent migrations of condensates in and out of such clumps would explain the random nature of precursor compositions, while evaporation and gas dissipation would explain changes in oxygen fugacity which chondrules record plus their shape-redox relationship...|$|E

In the second step, unsulphided Ni-Mo/Al 2 O 3 catalyst was active enough to effectively crack pyrolytic lignin into smaller molecules. High molecular weight compounds including large aromatic ring structures were formed from the reactive sugar rich fraction in both first step stabilization and second step hydrotreatment.

These differences suggest that the chondrule precursors of Y- 691 were produced by intense <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation</b> in comparison with those of ordinary and carbonaceous chondrites. For Y- 691,the Ca/Al ratios of chondrules showing high Na/Al are {{lower than those of}} chondrules showing low Na/Al.

40|$|The {{fine-grained}} opaque matrix and chondrule rims in the Semarkona (LL 3) chondrite {{have been}} investigated in detail with the scanning electron microscope. The chemical analyses {{were made by the}} SEM-EDS technique. Although the rims have similarities in texture and composition to the matrix, they show wider variabilities in chemical composition in comparison with the matrix in Semarkona. Based on both mode of occurrence and Al/Si ratio, the fine-grained opaque rims in Semarkona are classified into three types : type I, type IIa and type IIb. Type-I rims commonly occur as chondrule-rimming materials, having high Al/Si ratios. Type-I rims are composed mostly of smectite, showing a wider variation of the FeO and Al_ 2 O_ 3 contents than that of the matrix. Type-IIa rims occur as magnetite-bearing chondrule rims, characterized by their low Al/Si ratios. They are composed of mixtures of smectite, fayalitic material and its alteration products. Metal-sulfide-magnetite aggregates have opaque rims (type IIb) with the lowest Al/Si ratios. The SiO_ 2,Al_ 2 O_ 3 and FeO contents of type-IIb rims suggest that they consist mainly of fayalitic material and its alteration products. In compositon, it is suggested that 2 ̆ 7 fayalitic 2 ̆ 7 material and its alteration products in types-IIa and IIb rims correspond to one of the non-refractory, SiO_ 2 -, FeO-rich components of precursor materials of the chondrules in Semarkona.

30|$|Titanium dioxide is {{the most}} widely used white pigment because of its {{brightness}} and very high refractive index, in which it is surpassed only by a few other materials. TiO 2 is unique because it efficiently scatters visible light, thereby imparting whiteness, brightness, and opacity when incorporated into a coating. Dry compacted TiO 2 samples are characterized by their brightness and whiteness and exhibit reflectance properties approaching that of the perfect reflecting diffuser. ‘Color’ is carefully controlled during the TiO 2 manufacturing process through the removal of the trace amounts of metal oxide contaminants. These light-absorbing contaminants will detract from the brightness and whiteness of the pigment and can affect the appearance of white and near-white paints containing that pigment. The opacity of white pigments mainly derives from the scattering, while the opacity of black pigments is a result of absorption ability[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was observed that if the TiO 2 is produced in a commercial production plant on particular days when there is oil leak in the larox filter, the color and brightness of the produced pigment failed when measured the same in acrylic lacquer paint (vehicle b). Also, this failure is not seen when the color and brightness are measured in dry mode (dry b). These observations were not a single case but were seen occasionally in the quality analysis. The failure in the vehicle color, once commenced, was seen continued consecutively with three to four final products. The sources of oil contamination during the manufacturing process can be as follows: In the chloride process of manufacturing TiO 2, rutile or high-grade ilmenite is converted to titanium tetrachloride (TiCl 4) gas. The conversion takes place in a chlorinator (i.e., fluidized bed reactor) in the presence of chlorine gas at 850 °C to 950 °C, with petroleum coke added as a reductant. The chief reaction products are volatile metal chlorides, including TiCl 4, which are collected. The nonvolatile chlorides and the unreacted solids that remain in the chlorinator are wasted, forming the special waste stream ‘chloride process waste solids’. The gaseous raw product stream is purified to separate the titanium tetrachloride from other chlorides. Separation is by <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation,</b> double distillation, and chemical treatment. Ferric chloride (FeCl 3) is removed as a major acidic liquid waste stream through <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation.</b> Additional trace metal chlorides are removed through double distillation. Finally, vanadium oxychloride (VOCl 3), which has a boiling point close to that of TiCl 4 (136 °C), is removed as a low-volume non-special waste by complexing with mineral oil and reduced with hydrogen sulfide to VOCl 2 or by complexing with copper. The purified TiCl 4 is then oxidized to TiO 2 at 985 °C, driving off chlorine gas, which is recycled to the chlorinator. Aluminum chloride is added in the oxidation step to promote formation of the rutile crystal which is the TiO 2 product. The next stage of TiO 2 manufacturing is surface treatment, where the TiO 2 from oxidizer is converted to slurry in water, which is then subjected to sand milling to the required particle size. The clarified slurry from the sand mill is treated with alumina or zirconia for coating the surface of bare titanium dioxide with amorphous aluminum or zirconium oxide. The surface-treated product is then filtered through larox by pressing and followed by organic treatment and spin flash drying. Finally, the dried product is subjected to micronization process to get the surface-treated product. The brightness and color of this product is important for its marketing.|$|E

We described silica-roedderite-bearing clasts in L/LL 3. 5 ALHA 77011 and LL 3. 7 ALHA 77278, a silica-roedderite-bearing chondrule in L 3 Mezo-Madaras, and a silica-merrihueite-bearing chondrule in L/LL 3. 5 ALHA 77115. The findings of merrihueite and roedderite in ALHA 77011, ALHA 77115, ALHA 77278 and Mezo-Madaras fill the compositional gap betweeen previously described roedderite in enstatite chondrites and silicate inclusions in IAB irons and merrihueite in Mezo-Madaras, suggesting {{that there is a}} complete solid solution of roedderite and merrihueite in meteorites.

40|$|Geochemical and isotopic {{data for}} large, igneous-textured {{inclusions}} in ordinary chondrites {{suggest that the}} inclusions formed by the melting of diverse precursors, and that various inclusions had different origins. Some inclusions were metasomatized (chemically altered) and metamorphosed, and many appear to have degassed argon in late shock events. The inclusions can be subdivided into two chemical groups, Na-rich (Na/Al> 0. 35 at.) and Na-poor (≤ 0. 35), which may have originated in different ways. The major-and trace-element abundances of Na-rich inclusions are best explained by these inclusions having formed by the shock-melting of ordinary chondrites, often accompanied by loss of FeNi-metal and sulfide and by preferential melting and accumulation of an albitic feldspar component. In contrast, {{there is no evidence}} that shock-melting was involved in the formation of Na-poor inclusions, which have compositions that were largely controlled by vapor-fractionation processes. It is suggested that the precursors to Na-poor inclusions consisted of mixtures of vapor-fractionated materials in a system of condensed phases that chemically resembled CI-chondrites, except for being depleted in volatile-lithophile elements and in metal and sulfide. Sodium-poor inclusions can be subdivided into two types, Trend A and Trend B, which differ in their trace-element characteristics, in the nature of their compositional variations, and in their inferred precursors. Trend A Na-poor inclusions are enriched in refractory elements, and could have formed by the melting of mixtures containing a chondritic (CI-like) component and a refractory (Al-rich, CAI-like) component. Trend B Na-poor inclusions are enriched in elements of intermediate volatility (Si) and appear to have formed from precursors that lost both a refractory (Mg-rich, olivine-rich) and a volatile component.

40|$|We {{report the}} petrology, trace element abundances and oxygen isotopic {{characteristics}} of a compound CAI-chondrule object, WI- 025, found in the Allende CV 3 chondrite. WI- 025 is an irregularly shaped inclusion consisting of three texturally and chemically distinct portions; the interior portion, the igneous rim and the intermediate zone between these two portions. The interior portion consists of anorthite, spinel, olivine and Al-bearing low-Ca pyroxene. Major element chemistry of the interior portion corresponds to that of Al-rich chondrules and is intermediate between fine-grained spinel-rich CAIs and ferromagnesian chondrules. The interior portion has abundant 16 O-rich spinel (Δ 17 O = - 14. 2 to - 24. 7) and shows a group II CAI-like REE composition. These observations indicate that the interior portion contains a CAI component formed by <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation.</b> Major and trace element chemistry of the interior portion indicate that the CAI had subsequently assimilated chondrule materials through partial melting. The maximum heating temperature of the partial melting {{is estimated to be}} about 1400 ℃, similar to the maximum heating temperature of Type-B CAIs. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the olivine and low-Ca pyroxene (Δ 17 O = - 6. 3) in the interior portion indicate that the partial melting and chondrule assimilation took place under moderately 16 O-poor nebular gas. The igneous rim is texturally and chemically similar to ferromagnesian chondrules and entirely surrounds the interior portion. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the olivine and low-Ca pyroxene in the igneous rim are indistinguishable from those of the interior olivine and Al-bearing low-Ca pyroxenes. These observations indicate that a chondrule material, which was melted in the same nebular gas as the interior portion, was accreted to the interior portion. The intermediate zone is a reaction zone accompanying the igneous rim formation. The formation history of WI- 025 can be summarized as 1) original CAI formation, 2) partial melting and chondrule assimilation, 3) igneous rim formation and 4) secondary alteration on the parent body...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we have {{investigated}} the possibilities to steer the composition and, thus, the quality of pyrolysis liquids by the reactor temperature and the pyrolysis vapor condenser temperature. Pine wood was pyrolyzed in a 1 kg/h fluidized-bed pyrolysis reactor operated at 330 or 480 °C. The pyrolysis vapors produced were condensed using a condenser train of two counter-current spray columns arranged in series. In this paper, {{the temperature of the}} first condenser was varied between 20 and 115 °C, while the second condenser temperature was kept at 20 °C. To describe the composition of the oils, we have integrated several analytical techniques into a novel characterization scheme that can account for 77 − 82 wt % of the oils. The effects of the condensation conditions on fractions of light compounds in the oils can be predicted with a simple equilibrium stage condensation model. It has been observed that pyrolysis at 330 °C gives a light oil with a low amount of mid-boilers [normal boiling point (nbp) of 150 − 300 °C] and heavy compounds (water insolubles and mono- and oligosugars). Sugars, mid-boilers, and water-insoluble lignin-derived oligomers are more present in the oil obtained at 480 °C, while the yields of light organics are approximately the same for 330 and 480 °C. It can be concluded that <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation</b> is a promising cheap downstream approach to concentrate compounds (classes) and, thus, to control the quality of pyrolysis oils. For instance, operating the first condenser around 70 − 90 °C gives an aqueous liquid in the second condenser containing 40 wt % light organics, which are interesting for extraction (e. g., 10 wt % acetic acid) and supercritical water gasification to produce hydrogen. Under these conditions, the oils from the first condenser have a high content of sugars (20 wt %) and lignin-derived oligomers (40 wt %), which are attractive fractions for fermentation/sugar chemistry and gasoline production via fluidized catalytic cracking (FCC) /hydrotreatment, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The Yamato- 691 {{enstatite}} chondrite includes abundant chondrules {{of various}} textural types. Among them radial-Px type {{is the most}} predominant and the largest. Barred-Ol-Px type and porphyritic to granular types are common. Cryptocrystalline chondrules are small and transparent-SiO_ 2 chondrules are rare. The constituents of these chondrules are forsterite, enstatite, bronzite, diopside, spinel, plagioclase, silica mineral and/or glass with small amounts of metals and sulfides. Generalized crystallization sequence of chondrules is olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, high-Ca pyroxene, spinel, plagioclase, silica minerals, and glass, in the order. MgO/(MgO+FeO) molar ratios of olivine in barred-Ol-Px, prophyritic to granular, and radial-Px chondrules are 0. 92 - 0. 99, 0. 98 - 0. 99,and 0. 96 - 0. 99,respectively. Ferroan olivines in barred-Ol-Px chondrules experienced various degrees of reduction after solidification, indicating that they were formed under oxidizing conditions and later they were reduced by reaction with a reducing gas. On the other hand, FeO-bearing olivine in radial-Px chondrules seems to be relict and reacted with the chondrule melts at high-temperatures to produce dusty olivine. MgO/(MgO+FeO) molar ratios of pyroxenes are 0. 81 - 0. 99 for barred-Ol-Px chondrules, 0. 96 - 1. 00 for porphyritic to granular chondrules, and 0. 74 - 1. 00 for radial-Px chondrules. Al_ 2 O_ 3 of high-Ca pyroxene ranges widely from 2 up to 18 wt% and is more than that of coexisting low-Ca pyroxene. The Al_ 2 O_ 3 content of pyroxene increases with decreasing temperature during crystallization. Low-Ca pyroxene in barred-Ol-Px chondrules is orthopyroxene and richer in Al_ 2 O_ 3 (1 - 14 wt%) than that in porphyritic to granular and radial-Px chondrules (less than 1 wt%), which crystallized originally as protoenstatite. Pure albite in peripheral portions of some chondrules may have been formed from aluminous diopside by introduction of alkalies from the ambient reducing gas. Magnesian nature of spinel in some chondrules is due to diffusional exchange of Mg and Fe in a reducing gas. Silica minerals which were precursors of transparent-SiO_ 2 chondrules might have been produced by oxidation of metallic silicon in Fe-metals and/or <b>fractional</b> <b>condensation</b> of a reducing nebular gas...|$|E
