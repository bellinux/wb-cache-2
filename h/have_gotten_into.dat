25|$|The Yamal baby mammoth Lyuba, {{found in}} 2007 in the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia, {{suggests}} that baby mammoths, as do modern baby elephants, ate the dung of adult animals. The {{evidence to show}} {{this is that the}} dentition (teeth) of the baby mammoth had not yet fully developed to chew grass. Furthermore, there was an abundance of ascospores of coprophilous fungi from the pollen spectrum of the baby's mother. Coprophilous fungi are fungi that grow on animal dung and disperse spores in nearby vegetation, which the baby mammoth would then consume. Spores might <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> its stomach while grazing for the first few times. Coprophagy may be an adaptation, serving to populate the infant's gut with the needed microbiome for digestion.|$|E

While Sepinwall called the [...] "green reality" [...] storyline [...] "boring", Handlen thought that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not [...] "matter"; according to Handlen, the episode should not <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> the details of the guest stars. Sepinwall and Handlen were disappointed that Rex did not appear in the episode; Handlen praised Rex, calling him a [...] "likable teenage boy" [...] who deserves more running time.|$|E

2500|$|Over the years, {{the series}} has {{developed}} {{into one of}} the most bitter and hateful rivalries in college sports. In the early football match ups, the sidelines would be occupied by Civil War Veterans from both sides. They once stood across from each other on the battlefield, now they looked across an athletic field. The emotions of an actual war once fought between the states became infused into the athletic contests between the 2 institutions. Overtime, even the coaches <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> the rivalry. Former Kansas football coach Don Fambrough, when referred to a physician across the state line in Kansas City, Missouri, for treatment, exclaimed [...] "I'll die first!" [...] Not to be outdone, Missouri's former basketball coach Norm Stewart would traditionally have his players stay in Kansas City, Missouri, before playing at Kansas, going so far as to require the team bus to buy its gasoline at a Missouri filling station and reprimanding players who ate in Kansas, as he did not want to put any money into Kansas' economy.|$|E
2500|$|Luke Duke (Tom Wopat) is the dark-haired, older Duke boy. More {{mature and}} {{rational}} than his cousin Bo, he is typically {{the one who}} thinks of the plan that will get the two out of whatever trouble they <b>have</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into.</b> Luke wears a checked blue shirt (a plain blue shirt in most, though not all, second-season episodes) and a denim jacket over it in first season and a few later second-season which means he wears Double Denim episodes and he also wears Dark Blue jeans with a belt with a fish belt buckle with black boots and later brown boots {{and a few other}} checker and plaid shirts in later episodes and seasons of the show. He is a veteran of the United States Marine Corps and a former boxer. Luke was the first Duke to perform the [...] "hood slide" [...] across The General Lee, which is seen in the opening credits of the show (a shot taken from the second episode, [...] "Daisy's Song") and later told by Tom Wopat to be an accident, because his foot got caught {{on the side of the}} General Lee when he attempted to jump across the hood; he also caught his thigh on the hood's radio antenna, cutting himself, resulting in such antennas being removed from later versions of the General Lee which those later versions looked similar to the ones in The Dukes of Hazzard film. However, the [...] "hood slide" [...] quickly proved popular and became a regular staple of episodes. The only episode to directly reference the age difference between Luke and Bo is in the seventh season opener, the [...] "flashback" [...] episode [...] "Happy Birthday, General Lee," [...] where it is stated that Luke had already been in the Marines while Bo was in his last year at high school. Though Bo and Luke share the CB call sign [...] "Lost Sheep," [...] in Season One episode [...] "Money to Burn," [...] Luke referred to himself (singularly) as [...] "Sittin' Duck." ...|$|E
