In the event, Savannahs departure was delayed for two days after one of her crew returned to the vessel in a highly inebriated state, fell off the gangplank and drowned.

500|$|The battle {{occurred}} during an extended commerce raiding operation by a French squadron led by Linois {{in the ship}} of the line Marengo. Linois had sailed to the Indian Ocean in 1803 before the declaration of war, under orders to install garrisons in the French and Dutch colonies {{in the region and}} to prey on lightly defended British merchant shipping. One of the richest and most significant targets was the [...] "China Fleet", an annual convoy of East Indiamen from China and other Far Eastern ports that carried millions of pounds worth of trade goods. Although these large vessels were accompanied by numerous smaller merchant ships, news of the outbreak of war had only just arrived in the Pacific and the only warship available to defend the fleet was the small HEIC armed brig Ganges. Dutch informants notified Linois of the fleet's destination and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> from Canton while he was anchored at Batavia on Java, and he sailed in search of the convoy on 28 December 1803, eventually discovering it in early February.|$|E
500|$|Understanding the {{importance}} of the Indian Ocean trade and seeking to threaten it {{from the start of the}} inevitable war, First Consul Napoleon Bonaparte ordered a squadron to sail for India in March 1803. This force was under the command of Contre-Admiral Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois and consisted of the ship of the line Marengo and three frigates. Linois operated from the island base of Île de France with orders to attack British shipping once war had begun. Sailing initially to Pondicherry in India, Linois had a close encounter with a British squadron under Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier during July, but was at Île de France in August when news arrived that the Napoleonic Wars had started on 16 May. Determined to fortify the French raiding bases in the region, Linois landed troops and supplies at Réunion and Batavia. During the operation he despatched the frigate [...] to Muscat, captured numerous individual country ships, and burned the British trading post of Bencoolen. On 10 December he anchored at Batavia for the winter. Shortly thereafter, informants passed to Batavia the composition and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> of the British [...] "China Fleet", leading Linois to set out to intercept it. On 28 December, Linois's squadron—consisting of Marengo, frigates [...] and , the corvette [...] and the Dutch brig —departed Batavia. The ships carried six months worth of provisions as Linois had anticipated an extended patrol in the approaches to the Strait of Malacca in the South China Sea.|$|E

500|$|The China Fleet {{was a large}} annual British {{merchant}} convoy that {{gathered at}} Canton in the Pearl River during the winter before sailing for Britain, via India. As the convoy passed through the East Indies, it was joined by vessels sailing from other European ports in the region on the route to India, until it often numbered dozens of ships. The 1804 fleet departed in late January, {{and by the time}} it reached the approaches to the Strait of Malacca it had swelled to include 16 East Indiamen, 11 country ships, a Portuguese merchant ship from Macau and a vessel from Botany Bay in New South Wales. Although the HEIC had provided the small, armed brig Ganges as an escort, this vessel could only dissuade pirates; it could not hope to compete with a French warship. There was no military escort: news of the outbreak of war had reached Canton before reinforcements had arrived from the squadron in India. Spies based in Canton had passed the composition and <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> of the China Fleet to Linois in Batavia, but the Dutch informants at Canton had also passed on false reports that Royal Navy warships were accompanying the convoy, reports that may have been deliberately placed by British authorities. The convoy was an immensely valuable prize, its cargo of tea, silk and porcelain valued at over £8 million in contemporary values (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ). Also on board were 80 Chinese plants ordered by Sir Joseph Banks for the royal gardens and carried in a specially designed plant room. The HEIC Select Committee in Canton had been very concerned {{for the safety of the}} unescorted convoy, and had debated delaying its departure. The various captains had been consulted, including Henry Meriton, who in his ship [...] had captured a frigate during the Action of 4 August 1800, a disastrous French attack on a convoy of East Indiamen off Brazil. Meriton advised that the convoy was powerful enough in both appearance and reality to dissuade any attack. He was opposed by John Farquharson of , who considered that the crews of East Indiamen were so badly trained that they would be unable to mutually defend one another if faced with a determined enemy. Eventually the Committee decided that it could delay the convoy no longer and awarded command to the most experienced captain, Commodore Nathaniel Dance–an officer with over 45 years service at sea–in the East Indiaman Earl Camden.|$|E

6000|$|... 77. Carbonari. All persons {{leaving a}} city {{had to have}} a {{passport}} officially signed giving the destination and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure.</b> Luigi had obtained such a passport for Vienna for that night. It was, however, suspected that this was a mere trick to give a wrong notion of his whereabouts. If the passport should prove to be a pretense, other suspicions against Luigi would be confirmed; it would be taken for granted that he belonged to the Carbonari, a secret society of Italian patriots; he would be arrested and sent to the prison at Spielberg. But if he should go to Vienna he is to be let alone. The officers are, of course, on the wrong track. If Luigi goes to Vienna it is to carry out his purpose of killing the tyrant. If he stays in Asolo it means that he has abandoned that purpose.|$|E
40|$|Limestone Island while departing to sea, using a {{standard}} trapping method carried on throughout the <b>departure</b> period. Numbers <b>of</b> chicks trapped declined during 1990 - 1995, {{probably due to}} raccoon predation, increased slightly from 1995 - 2000 and since then have declined again. Declines during 1992 - 2000 were greater than elsewhere at two funnels where disturbance from adult trapping and burrow inspections was highest. Declines after 2000 were similar at all but one funnel. The first chicks departed between 7 - 12 May, peak numbers were trapped between 16 - 26 May, median departure varied between 19 - 27 May and the last <b>date</b> <b>of</b> trapping between 1 - 22 June. The total duration <b>of</b> the <b>departure</b> period ranged from 23 - 42 days. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> last <b>departure</b> was significantly more variable than <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> first or median <b>departure.</b> The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> first <b>departures,</b> which has varied by only 6 d over the study period, has shown no trend. However, when the strong ENSO year of 1998 was excluded from the analyses, median <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> peak <b>departures</b> both show trends that suggest they are becoming earlier, although neither was significant. Last departures have been significantly earlier since 2002. Reproductive success was 30 % lower during 2000 - 2003 than in earlier years, mainly due {{to an increase in}} desertions. Information is lacking since 2003. The proportion of non-breeders in a sample of adult birds trapped at night after the beginning <b>of</b> chick <b>departures</b> declined from a mean of 76 % during 1992 - 2000 to a mean of 48 % in 2001 - 2003. Likewise, counts on the gathering grounds were more or less constant over the period <b>of</b> chick <b>departures</b> (8 May – 20 June) during 1990 - 1999, but showed a significant decrease over the departure period after 1999. The general population decline after 2000 may be related to diminished recruitment to the colony, as evidenced by the lower proportion of non-breeders in the trapped sample and the lower number of birds counted on the gathering grounds late in the season. 4...|$|R

5000|$|Second, was the {{relevance}} of Mitchell's reliance on a criminal statute in a civil proceeding seeking prior restraint.

In 1907 Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote the [...] "main purpose" [...] of the First Amendment" [...] was [...] "to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments". In 1931 the Court wrote that only the narrowest circumstances—such as publication <b>of</b> the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>departure</b> <b>of</b> ships during wartime—were permissibly restrained. In 1969 John Marshall Harlan II wrote the Supreme Court [...] "rejected all manner of prior restraint on publication".
