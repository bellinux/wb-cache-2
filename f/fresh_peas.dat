5000|$|<b>Fresh</b> <b>peas</b> {{are often}} eaten boiled and flavored with butter and/or {{spearmint}} {{as a side}} dish vegetable. Salt and pepper are also commonly added to peas when served. <b>Fresh</b> <b>peas</b> are also used in pot pies, salads and casseroles. Pod peas (particularly sweet cultivars called mange tout and [...] "sugar peas", or the flatter [...] "snow peas," [...] called hé lán dòu, [...] in Chinese) are used in stir-fried dishes, particularly those in American Chinese cuisine. Pea pods do not keep well once picked, and if not used quickly, are best preserved by drying, canning or freezing within a few hours of harvest.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} cyanide and ethylene, respectively, were studied on the {{respiration}} of a fully cyanide-sensitive tissue-the <b>fresh</b> <b>pea,</b> a slightly cyanide-sensitive tissue-the germinating pea seedling, and a cyanide-insensitive tissue-the cherimoya fruit. Cyanide inhibition of both <b>fresh</b> <b>pea</b> and pea seedling respiration {{was attended by}} a conventional Pasteur effect where fermentation was enhanced with an accumulation of lactate and ethanol and {{a change in the}} level of glycolytic intermediates indicative of the activation of phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase accompanied by a sharp decline in ATP level. In these tissues, ethylene had little or no effect on the respiration rate, or on the level of glycolytic intermediates or ATP. By contrast, ethylene as well as cyanide enhanced both respiration and aerobic glycolysis in cherimoya fruits with no buildup of lactate and ethanol and with an increase in the level of ATP. The data support the proposition that for ethylene to stimulate respiration the capacity for cyanide-resistant respiration must be present...|$|R

Ophiobolin, a toxin from Cochliobolus mtyabeanus, and ascochitine, a toxic metabolite from Ascochyta fabae, also induced pisatin.

These vegetables are cooked in a milk broth that contains butter, pepper and salt. Commonly, this dish is accompanied by corned beef either from a can or prepared separately from the dish. Hodge Podge is generally consumed during the months of July and August when these vegetables are in season.|$|E

Chickpea is eaten on form falafel. The cuisine of Iraq reflects this rich inheritance as well as strong influence from the culinary traditions of neighbouring Persia, Turkey and the Syria region area. Meals begin with appetizers and salads known as Mezza. Some popular dishes include kebab (often marinated with garlic, lemon and spices, then grilled). It can be challenging to help people adjust their diet to meet their nutrient needs and promote weight loss, {{while at the same time}} still keeping them satiated. Nutrient rich legumes can be a valuable part of such a diet. They contain soluble fibre and protein and are low glycemic index, all of which may help promote satiety. Legumes are one of the most sustainable sources of protein in the world. Legumes are also significant sources of resistant starch, which is fermented by colonic bacteria to short chain fatty acids...|$|R

Strong resistance to vegetative-stage drought is available and should be incorporated. The extreme ability of extra-early erect cowpea cultivars to escape terminal drought should be exploited in zones with very short rainfall seasons. In zones with the possibility of limited rainfall {{in the middle of the}} growing season, resistance to mid-season drought, and the delayed-leaf-senescence trait can be valuable. Breeding for water-use efficiency, deeper rooting, and heat tolerance are discussed. Diseases and pests that influence adaptation to drought are considered.

40|$|Abstract. Green pea is {{regarded}} as an important constituent of a human diet, especially for vegetarians. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the amino acids content in green pea {{and the quality of}} pea protein. The study covered raw seeds; fresh seeds cooked to consumption consistency; and two kinds of frozen products prepared for consumption: frozen seeds obtained using the traditional method and frozen seeds of the ready-to-eat type. Compared with the raw material, cooked <b>fresh</b> <b>pea</b> contained more isoleucine (15 %), valine (14 %) and arginine (24 %) but less tyrosine (17 %); cooked pea from the traditional frozen product contained less sulphur-containing amino acids (12 %) and alanine (13 %); while pea from the frozen product of the ready-to-eat type contained a similar or higher amount (from 12 % to 38 %) of amino acids, except for sulphur-containing amino acids (less 12 %). The protein of green pea was of very good quality, both in raw seeds and in those prepared for consumption. In comparison with the FAO/WHO/ 1991 standard, the CS indexes exceeded 100. It was only for sulphuric amino acids that the CS for the ready-to-eat product was 98.

Using an extension of the price-wedge method that takes into account imperfect substitution and factor endowment in monopolistic competition, this study provides ad valorem tariff equivalent of several international food safety standards. We apply this method to panel data of European imports of fruit, vegetables and fish from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.
