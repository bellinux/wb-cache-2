30|$|Despite the {{improvements}} in non-invasive screening techniques, negative results do not exclude {{the diagnosis of}} FMD. In case of high clinical suspicion, use of diagnostic arteriography [1, 9] or <b>endovascular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> can be discussed if therapeutically relevant. Indeed, catheter-based angiography remains the gold standard imaging modality for renovascular FMD because of its unsurpassed spatial resolution (< 0.1  mm) [1, 3].|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{compare and}} {{ascertain}} the suitability for endovascular aortic graft fixation of the Palmaz stent, the Strecker stent, the modified Gianturco-Z stent, the Wallstent {{and a new}} stent made of the shape memory alloy nitinol. Design, setting and materials:In vitro studies using a simple tensiometer to assess the forces required to distract each stent from porcine aorta; and using a high-pressure, pulsatile-flow pump to measure flow rates required to dislodge stents holding grafts within porcine aortas, with assessment using <b>endovascular</b> <b>ultrasound.</b> Results:The Palmaz, the modified Gianturco-Z and the nitinol stents resisted significantly greater distraction forces than the Wallstent, but <b>endovascular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> examination revealed that the modified Gianturco-Z stent was seen {{to move away from}} the aortic wall at high flow rates precluding adequate fixation. The Strecker stent could not be assessed using these techniques. Conclusions:A nitinol stent may be suitable for aortic graft fixation, has characteristics similar to the Palmaz stent and has shape memory effect which may overcome the difficulties of introduction of wider diameter stents through narrow arteries...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIntravascular {{ultrasound}} (IVUS) {{is known}} to be the reference tool for preoperative vessel lesion assessments and for endovascular therapy planning. Nevertheless, IVUS echograms only provide subjective information about vessel wall lesions. Since changes in the vascular tissue stiffness are characteristic of vessel pathologies, catheter-based <b>endovascular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> elastography (EVE) has been proposed in the literature as a method for outlining the elastic properties of vessel walls. In this paper, the Lagrangian Speckle Model Estimator (LSME) is formulated for investigations in EVE, i. e., using a polar coordinate system. The method was implemented through an adapted version of the Levenberg-Marquardt minimization algorithm, using the optical flow equations to compute the Jacobbian matrix. The theoretical framework was validated with simulated ultrasound rf data of mechanically complex vessel wall pathologies. The results, corroborated with Ansys finite element software, demonstrated the potential of EVE to provide useful information about the heterogeneous nature of atherosclerotic plaques...|$|E
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe studied {{enhancement}} of local gene delivery to the arterial wall {{by using an}} <b>endovascular</b> catheter <b>ultrasound</b> (US). BACKGROUNDUltrasound exposure is standard for {{enhancement of}} in vitro gene delivery. We postulate that in vivo endovascular applications can be safely developed. METHODSWe used a rabbit model of arterial mechanical overdilation injury. After arterial overdilation, US catheters were introduced in bilateral rabbit femoral arteries and perfused with plasmid- or adenovirus-expressing blue fluorescent protein (BFP) or phosphate buffered saline. One side received endovascular US (2 MHz, 50 W/cm 2, 16 min), and the contralateral artery did not. RESULTSRelative to controls, US exposure enhanced BFP expression measured via fluorescence 12 -fold for plasmid (1, 502. 1 ± 927. 3 vs. 18, 053. 9 ± 11, 612 μm 2, p < 0. 05) and 19 -fold for adenovirus (877. 1 ± 577. 7 vs. 17, 213. 15 ± 3, 892 μm 2, p < 0. 05) while increasing cell death for the adenovirus group only (26 ± 5. 78 % vs. 13 ± 2. 55 %, p < 0. 012). CONCLUSIONSEndovascular US enhanced vascular gene delivery and increased the efficiency of nonviral platforms to levels previously attained only by adenoviral strategies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Vessel lumen {{centerline}} extraction {{is important}} for intraoperative tracking of abdominal vessels and guidance of <b>endovascular</b> instruments. Three-dimensional <b>ultrasound</b> has gained increasing acceptance as a safe and convenient surgical image guidance modality. We aimed to optimize vascular centerline detection and tracking in 3 D ultrasound. Method: To overcome the intrinsic limitation of low ultrasound image quality, an active contour method (snake) was used to track changes in vessel geometry. We tested two variants of a classic snake using the image gradient and gradient vector field (GVF) as external forces. We validated these methods in liver ultrasound images of 10 healthy volunteers, acquired at three breath-holding instances during the exhalation phase. We calculated the distances between the vessel centerlines as detected by algorithms and a gold standard consisting of manual annotations performed by an expert. Results: Both methods (GVF and image gradient) can accurately estimate the actual centerlines with average Euclidean distances of 0. 77 and 1. 24 mm for GVF and gradient, respectively. Both methods can automatically follow vessel morphology and position changes. Conclusions: The proposed approach is feasible for liver vessel centerline extraction from 3 D ultrasound images. The algorithm can follow {{the movement of the}} vessels during respiration; further improvements of hardware components are needed for a real-time implementation. © 2013 CARS...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{conventional}} vascular {{surgical procedures}} are routinely monitored by <b>ultrasound</b> imaging, <b>endovascular</b> prostheses are usually monitored by radiographical imaging techniques. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the safety, patient acceptance and role of ultrasound echo-enhancers (SHU 508 A) in the evaluation of endovascular devices. Nine patients were studied: six had stents (four in the internal carotid artery and two in the renal artery) and three had endoluminal prostheses (one in the abdominal aorta, one in the subclavian and one in the iliac artery). Endovascular patency and correct placement were studied with contrast angiography and ultrasound examination with and without contrast enhancement. Patients underwent angiography at the end of the <b>endovascular</b> procedure, and <b>ultrasound</b> examinations on the first postoperative day. Ultrasound contrast media (SHU 508 A) was injected through an antecubital vein at a rate of 1 ml/s. A total of 13 injections were given in nine patients. Ultrasonograms were obtained with 7. 5 and 3. 5 MHz transducers (Acuson 128 XP) and recorded on videotape for off-line visual inspection. Baseline and echo-enhanced sequences were assessed by two independent observers. None of the patients reported side-effects during or after the injection of the ultrasound echo-enhancer. Postoperative angiography showed endovascular patency and correct placement in all patients. The baseline ultrasound examination confirmed endoprosthesis patency in seven of nine patients: none revealed endoprosthesis malplacement. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination confirmed endoprosthesis patency. In two cases, the echo-contrast examination revealed persisting flow within the aneurysmal sac: in another patient it showed the incomplete adhesion of the distal portion of the endoprosthesis to the arterial wall. The preliminary findings suggest that ultrasound echo-enhancers are safe to use and induce no side-effects. Echo-enhanced sequences often provide additional information on the technical success of endovascular procedures. They promise to be useful in follow-up studies for assessing the functioning of endoprostheses...|$|R
40|$|Coronary flow {{reserve is}} a useful {{physiologic}} parameter providing information on coronary stenoses severity. To date, the gold standard to evaluate coronary flow reserve consists of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement, assessed with a pressure-wire. The FFR has a high lesion specificity, due to insensitivity to patient hemodynamic status and to coronary microvascular resistance; it shows low inter- and intraindividual variability and a well-defined, bound cut-off range values (0. 75 - 0. 80). Several reports confirmed that FFR has high reproducibility and feasibility in patients with either single- or multi-vessel coronary artery disease, or with both stable and instable coronary artery disease and that is significantly associated with patient outcome. More recently, the FFR {{has been used as}} a sensitive marker of successful percutaneous coronary intervention, since postprocedural FFR value strongly predicts patients event-free survival rate after angioplasty. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that abnormal FFR ratios can be also associated with diffused atherosclerotic coronary artery disease in the absence of unique angiographically detectable stenoses requiring revascularization. There are strong evidences supporting that the FFR provides crucial functional information that could be related with morphological <b>endovascular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> findings, with the possibility to achieve same information in a cheaper, easier and more available manner. This review will focus on the current available literature regarding coronary flow reserve quantification and its clinical validation, suggesting and highlighting its current and future clinical applications...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hypertension already affects {{one billion}} people worldwide, leading to {{heart attacks and}} strokes. It is {{estimated}} {{there are more than}} 100 million drug-resistant hypertension patients world over. So the new ultrasound renal denervation (RDN) therapy may offer a massive new market for cath labs to tap into. In view of this, new methods of ultrasonics in measuring blood pressure (BP) as well as lowering BP in patients with resistant hypertension is reviewed including the author’s results. In measuring BP ultrasound is shown to be a better technique as it measures BP continuously and can reveal the variations of several parameters viz., blood flow, vascular resistance and BP, which helps physicians for taking preventive steps to monitor cardiovascular diseases. Interestingly, ultrasound of high frequency (1 MHz) and high power levels of (50 to 1500 mWcm- 2) without medication as well as low intensity (2 mWcm- 2) and low frequency (800 kHz) in presence of medication were applied to forearm have been investigated. Results revealed that in both cases BP decreased modestly by same magnitude in subjects having hypertension. Typical clinical trials on the first-in-man study of <b>endovascular</b> <b>ultrasound</b> renal denervation (both noninvasive and invasive) carried out by two groups (companies) for the treatment of resistant hypertension is evaluated. Overall results indicated that reduction in office BP was 32 mmHg systolic and 17 mmHg in diastolic is possible by ultrasound application. The study is aimed at not necessary to get rid of medication completely but to make the BP medication – controlled by surround sound technology. Probable mechanism for reducing BP by the application of ultrasound is interpreted by the present author based on the antibiotic studies conducted earlier. Ultrasound is a noninvasive breakthrough techniqu...|$|E
