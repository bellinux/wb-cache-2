5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Beyoncé {{preparing}} herself for her wedding ceremony. She {{is in her}} boudoir wearing a lacy corset and a lingerie combo with garters. As the song begins, Beyoncé looks towards the camera, addressing the viewer while affirming {{the subject of the}} song that she was the best he ever had. The video moves from Beyoncé playing with a tiara, a veil and tulle netting on a bed, to various stages of <b>getting</b> <b>dressed.</b> Between scenes, flash back scenes of Beyoncé in high school are shown. Beyoncé is seen with a high school boyfriend at their senior-prom night on May 16, 1998. As Beyoncé and her boyfriend dance, he becomes interested in another girl, leaving Beyoncé alone on the dance floor. The video then returns to the present, with Beyoncé in her final preparations before her marriage. She is shown wearing a white gown and singing at sunset atop a grassy hill, followed by a scene of her walking down the aisle and exchanging vows. Her former lover is shown at the prom, deep in thought, with his prom king crown askew on his head. Beyoncé and her new husband are seen celebrating at a happy and well-attended reception. The groom removes the bride's garter with his teeth and they start dancing with their younger family members. The final scene features Beyoncé looking into the camera looking happy and satisfied. She walks off confidently to rejoin her wedding party and new husband, and then the screen fades to black.|$|E

25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man in shadows spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and <b>getting</b> <b>dressed,</b> continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, with sweat dripping heavily down his face and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta {{standing in front of a}} white background with the wind blowing, wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris Haute Couture creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E
500|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is a type}} of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term breathing problems and poor airflow.

The term [...] "chronic bronchitis" [...] is still used to define a productive cough that is present for at least three months each year for two years.|$|E

As she leaves, her {{colleague}} Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) lies in his bed, half of his body covered by bedsheets. The narrative flashes back to a few days earlier: Scully arrives at a hospital and, after a series of coincidences, meets her former professor, Daniel Waterston (Nicolas Surovy), with whom she had an affair while attending medical school. [...] He is ill and suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition. She questions whether she made the right decision to leave him and abandon her medical career to pursue a career in the FBI. She meets Waterston's daughter, Maggie (Stacy Haiduk), who is extremely resentful of Scully for the effect she had on Waterston's family.|$|E

She stated, [...] "But it was always sort of built in that the peak of 'Diwali' would be this incredibly romantic overture [...]" [...] Kaling was pleased that much of [...] "Diwali" [...] took place at Stamford, especially as she was able to explore the contrasts between the two offices. She also liked that the episode contained [...] "romance, people <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> up in costumes, lots of food, smooching and making out ... and little girls making fun of B.J.

We've cut people into pieces and hacked them up and shot people point blank in the head. Never got any notes on that. So pushing the envelope for us {{will be in the}} sexual nature". This is evidenced by the episode's opening, a [...] "sexy" [...] look at the character Quake <b>getting</b> <b>dressed.</b> Executive producer Jeph Loeb added, [...] "what it does is give us the chance to tell different stories. The idea is some of the material might be more mature, there may be more grit, what we're doing might be darker. It certainly made a lot more sense when we wanted to introduce a character like Ghost Rider into this world." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{visual effects}} {{were created by}} Sony Pictures Imageworks, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on Superman Returns. The VFX company's two key goals were to {{accurately}} portray von Stauffenberg's injuries {{and to create a}} 1943 period look to Berlin. With many explosions and stunts seen in the film performed practically, the majority of the 800 computer-generated effects shots were used to portray von Stauffenberg's injuries. A digital version of Cruise's hand was designed, and VFX employees rotoscoped the hand in every movement it could make so the missing fingers were erased in the process. With many close-ups of von Stauffenberg's hand with missing fingers, the injuries were textured to look like actual scars, particularly based on surgical procedures from 1943. Cruise asked for advice on how to best move his hands so visual effects would be easier to apply, but some challenges, such as von Stauffenberg <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> on his own, were inescapable. According to VFX supervisor Richard R. Hoover, [...] "We know from historical accounts that von Stauffenberg didn't stick {{his hands in his pockets}} to try and hide his injuries." ...|$|E

[...] She also wrote that [...] "Sager {{also noted that the}} singer [...] "wants to depart from Loose as well, but she doesn’t have anything to say beyond <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> and having a guy ignore her" [...] and concluded that [...] "the song is more irritating than catchy, and the beat isn’t strong enough to make many people dance." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix deemed the song [...] "It’s a meaningless little ditty that is all about the military beat and bragging rights. It doesn’t have enough of a hook to work its way up the radio charts, but will likely do very well in the clubs.|$|E

As of November 2017, {{it has received}} over 570 million views on YouTube. Its release also made Lipa debut on Billboard Social 50 chart at number 26.

Usher continued singing to the fan, performing [...] "Can U Handle It?", closing the song by kissing the fan who then left the stage.

500|$|This tiara, {{which can}} also be worn as a necklace, was made for Queen Mary in 1919. It is not, as has {{sometimes}} been claimed, made with diamonds that once belonged to George III, but reuses diamonds taken from a necklace/tiara purchased by Queen Victoria from Collingwood & Co. as a wedding present for Princess Mary in 1893. In August 1936, Mary gave the tiara to her daughter-in-law, Queen Elizabeth, later the Queen Mother. When the Queen Mother, consort of George VI, first wore the tiara, Sir Henry Channon called it [...] "an ugly spiked tiara". Later, she lent the piece to her daughter, Elizabeth, as [...] "something borrowed" [...] for her wedding to Prince Philip in 1947. As Elizabeth was <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> at Buckingham Palace before leaving for Westminster Abbey, the tiara snapped. Luckily, the court jeweller was standing by in case of any emergency, and was rushed to his work room by a police escort. The Queen Mother reassured her daughter {{that it would be}} fixed in time, and it was. She also lent it to her granddaughter, Princess Anne, for her marriage to Captain Mark Phillips in 1973. It was put on show at an exhibition with a number of other royal tiaras in 2001.|$|E

500|$|The {{main idea}} behind the video is the rise, fall, and revival of Spears herself. The video begins when a {{meteoroid}} heads for Earth, and lights up a city when it finally lands, symbolizing Spears' entrance to fame and her skyrocketing career in the late 1990s as she became a household name. After this, black-and-white interspersed scenes of Spears getting ready in a soundstage are shown, while the words [...] "Britney Spears" [...] and [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] appear in Def Leppard-inspired multicolored letters. Spears is then seen wearing shorts and showing her midriff in the soundstage, while her dancers in white are <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> around her. They are surrounded by cameras and lights, symbolizing her constantly being under the microscope and hounded by the media. As the first chorus begins, Spears appears wearing a white wedding dress inside a cylinder-shaped metal room with wires. The futuristic set and flowing dress are reminiscent of Madonna's music video for [...] "Bedtime Story" [...] (1995). She is seen rising up the cylinder-shaped metal room and her past music videos surround her, symbolizing her ever growing career {{in the music industry}} (and possibly referring to the carousel of Logan's Run). When the second verse begins, Spears sings, wearing sparkly red skull-shaped shoulder pads, with microphones around her.|$|E
500|$|Matt Fowler of IGN {{wrote in}} his review for the episode [...] "The stories in the North and Meereen stayed a bit quiet as all their action got taken care of last week, leaving Cersei's big plot to destroy the Sept and {{everyone}} in it as this finale's big suspenseful and explosive set piece. Elsewhere, there were big reveals and revenge kills that helped everything {{add up to a}} very surprising and satisfying season finale." [...] He continued by praising how the trial sequence played out on screen, writing [...] "The actual staging and pacing of the trial and violent reckoning was really cool, with everyone <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> and little puzzle pieces falling into place, little birds leading men to their deaths, and Ramin Djawadi's excellent score." [...] He gave the episode a 9.5 out of 10. Michael Calia of The Wall Street Journal similarly gave praise to the episode, writing [...] "It's a good thing... that the season finale was full of massive developments, tying up several plot threads while leaving some others dangling in the most tantalizing way. This was the most complete episode of Game of Thrones yet, and possibly the best." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Dany and her fleet are finally sailing to Westeros, her great dragons casting shadows over the waves. It's on." ...|$|E
500|$|Mr. Bean's car, a Green 1977 British Leyland Mini 1000 Mark 4 with a {{matte black}} bonnet, {{was central to}} several antics, such as Mr. Bean's <b>getting</b> <b>dressed</b> in it, driving while sitting in an {{armchair}} strapped to the roof, or attempting to avoid a car park fee by driving out through the entrance. In the pilot, the car used was an orange 1969 BMC Morris Mini 1000 Mark 2 hardtop (registration RNT 996H), but this was destroyed in an off-screen crash {{at the end of}} the episode. From then on, the car was a 1976 model (registration SLW 287R), Green in colour with a matte black bonnet. Throughout the sitcom, Bean keeps it locked with a bolt-latch and padlock, rather than the lock fitted to the car, which formed a running joke in several episodes; in two episode, he demonstrated an additional, innovative security measure, in that he removes the steering wheel instead of the key, which in one episode deterred a car thief. In [...] "Back to School Mr. Bean", Bean's Mini is crushed by a tank as part of a demonstration, after he replaced an identical Mini (registration ACW 497V), meant for the demonstration, with his own to secure a parking space. Despite losing it, he later removes his padlock and bolt-latch from it, and finds another to use sometime after the episode.|$|E
