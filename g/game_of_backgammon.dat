5|$|While {{trying to}} escape from East to West Berlin, British agent 009 is fatally wounded and dies after {{reaching}} the residence of the British Ambassador, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake Fabergé egg. MI6 immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out {{the identity of the}} seller. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his palace in Rajasthan, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>backgammon.</b> Bond escapes with his contact Vijay, foiling the attempts of Khan's bodyguard Gobinda to kill the pair. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a blue-ringed octopus tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg fitted with listening and tracking devices by Q, while Gobinda captures and takes Bond to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his room he listens in on the bug in the Fabergé egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe.|$|E

40|$|In the 40 {{years since}} Arthur Samuel's 1960 Advances in Computers chapter, {{enormous}} {{progress has been}} made in developing programs to play <b>games</b> <b>of</b> skill at a level comparable to, and in some cases beyond, what the best humans can achieve. In Samuel's time, it would have seemed unlikely that only a scant 40 years would be needed to develop programs that play world-class backgammon, checkers, chess, Othello, and Scrabble. These remarkable achievements are the result of a better understanding of the problems being solved, major algorithmic insights, and tremendous advances in hardware technology. Computer games research is one of the major success stories of articial intelligence. This chapter can be viewed as a successor to Samuel's work.

Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon <b>games</b> <b>of</b> <b>backgammon.</b> Returning home to change into evening dress, the earl typically spent {{the remainder of the}} day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have [...] "£2m in the bank", claiming that [...] "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays and security for the future would give myself {{and a lot of other}} people a lot of pleasure". He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, [...] "luxuriant guardsman's moustache" [...] and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin drophead coupé, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing powerboats. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully screen tested for a part in Woman Times Seven, prompting him to automatically decline a later offer from film producer Cubby Broccoli, to screen test him for the role of James Bond.|$|R
60|$|One {{night after}} a supper-party in college, at which Pen and Macheath had been present, and {{at which a}} little quiet vingt-et-un had been played (an {{amusement}} much pleasanter to men in their second and third year than the boisterous custom of singing songs, which bring the proctors about the rooms, and which have grown quite stale by this time, every man having expended his budget)--as the men had taken their caps and were going away, after no great losses or winnings on any side, Mr. Bloundell playfully took up a green wine-glass from the supper-table, which had been destined to contain iced cup, but into which he inserted something still more pernicious, namely a pair of dice, which the gentleman took out of his waistcoat-pocket, and put into the glass. Then giving the glass a graceful wave which showed that his hand was quite experienced in the throwing of dice, he called sevens the main, and whisking the ivory cubes gently on the table, swept them up lightly again from the cloth, and repeated this process two or three times. The other men looked on, Pen, of course, among the number, who had never used the dice as yet, except to play a humdrum <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>backgammon</b> at home.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was this}} savage prince who invented {{much of the}} Alcazar in the soft Moorish taste; but in those hideous {{galleries}} he let his terrible nature loose, though as for that some say he was no crueler than certain other Spanish kings of that period. This {{is the notion of}} my unadvertised Encyclopaedia Britannica, and perhaps we ought to think of him leniently as Peter the Ferocious. He was kind to some people and was popularly known as the Justiciary; he especially liked the Moors and Jews, who were gratefully glad, poor things, of being liked by any one under the new Christian rule. But he certainly killed several of his half-brothers, and notably he killed his half-brother Don Fadrique in the Alcazar. That is, if he had no hand in the butchery himself he had him killed after luring him to Seville for the tournaments and forgiving him for all their mutual injuries with every caressing circumstance. One reads that after the king has kissed him he sits down again to his <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>backgammon</b> and Don Fadrique goes into the next room to Maria do Padilla, the lovely and gentle lady whom Don Pedro has married as much as he can with a wedded wife shut up in Toledo. She sits there in terror with her damsels and tries with looks and signs to make Don Fadrique aware of his danger. But he imagines no harm till the king and his companions, with their daggers drawn, come to the curtains, which the king parts, commanding, [...] "Seize the Master of Santiago!" [...] Don Fadrique tries to draw his sword, and then he turns and flies through the halls of the Alcazar, where he finds every door bolted and barred. The king's men are at his heels, and at last one of them fells him with a blow of his mace. The king goes back with a face of sympathy to Maria, who has fallen to the floor.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} a technique for model-free relational reinforcement learning in indefinite horizon undiscounted domains with bounded reward. Previous work has represented the value {{function as a}} ground relational naive Bayes net and has leveraged Bayes net parameter and structure learning techniques to refine successive approximations of the value function. Unfortunately, while value function evaluation and parameter inference are very efficient under this framework, even greedy optimal learning of highly restricted naive Bayes net structure can be computationally prohibitive in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel learning algorithm that focuses Bayes net structure learning on the frequently visited portions of state space. Inspired by the Apriori frequent-itemset data mining algorithm, this structure learning algorithm has the dual benefits of efficiency and low-variance parameter estimates. To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, we present encouraging initial results in the <b>game</b> domains <b>of</b> Tic-Tac-Toe, <b>Backgammon,</b> and Othello. 1...|$|R

The text assigns its invention to the Persian sage Wuzurgmihr (Persian) Buzarjumihr/Bozorgmehr, who was the minister of King Khosrow I. According to the historical legend, the Indian king Dewisarm sends his minister Taxritos to Persia with the game of chess, and a letter challenging Sasanian King Khosrow I to solve the riddle or rationale for the game. Khosrow asks for three days to decipher the game, but initially no-one in the court is able to make any progress. On the third day, Khosrow's minister, Wuzurgmihr, successfully rises and explains the logic of the game.
