5|$|The Hearst {{basketball}} coach, Tom Barry, berates his team, including Wallace (Percy Daggs III), after a game, and the coach's son quits as a result. One of Logan's teachers tells Dick that Logan {{must start}} attending classes. Dick sneaks into Logan's apartment for the hotel staff and finds it a mess. Veronica works at Mars Investigations {{for the day}} and walks in to find the Coach's family in the office, as the Coach has died. The son who quit, Josh, is the prime suspect, but the family suspects Mel Stolz (Jeremy Roberts) or one of the PCH bikers. Dick tries to set up Logan on a double date before realizing that one of the “twins” is actually eleven years old. Dick and the older sister leave, leading Logan to babysit the other sister, Heather (Juliette Goglia) although Logan <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> bed. Keith talks to Mel Stolz, who says that he was on a plane at the time. Dick calls Logan and says he is in Las Vegas, leaving Logan to babysit Heather for another day.|$|E
25|$|Following a {{first round}} series win as the Calgary Flames {{eliminated}} the Vancouver Canucks in game 6 {{of the series}} at the Scotiabank Saddledome, fans flocked to the Red Mile once again. There was between 10,000 and 12,000 fans on the stretch of 17th Avenue in Calgary. Police in Calgary had limited reports of open alcohol and minor property damage, but overall it {{was said to have}} been a peaceful celebration. Staff Sgt. Steve Ellefson of the Calgary Police Service said fans behaved well: “When you have 10 to 12,000 fans out, it <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show the class of the Flames fans enjoying a win”.|$|E
500|$|Stanley was a {{powerful}} orator who used dramatic flourishes to emphasize his points. He would often loosen his tie before he ever started speaking, {{and by the end}} of his speech have thrown off his vest and coat. In one instance, the candidates debated a tax on dog owners of one dollar per dog. Stanley favored the tax, while Morrow contended that everyone should be allowed one dog tax-free. Stanley ridiculed the idea as [...] "Free Old Dog Ring," [...] and sometimes howled like a dog in speeches deriding the proposal. On another occasion Stanley, who had too much to drink, vomited in front of the audience as Morrow spoke. When Stanley took the podium, he remarked, [...] "That <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show you what I have been saying all over Kentucky. Ed Morrow plain makes me sick to my stomach." ...|$|E

500|$|Hail to the Thief's artwork {{was created}} by Stanley Donwood, who has created the artwork for every Radiohead release since The Bends. The cover art, titled [...] "Pacific Coast", is a road map of Hollywood with words and phrases taken from Los Angeles's {{roadside}} advertising, such as [...] "God", [...] "TV" [...] and [...] "oil", in place of buildings. Donwood said: [...] "Advertising {{is designed to be}} seductive and attractive and, in a lot of ways, it's very beautiful. But there's something unsettling about being continually sold something. I liked taking the elements of roadside advertising out of context because it removes the imperative and <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> the essence of it – the pure heart of advertising." [...] Other words in the artwork were provided by Yorke, taken from political discussion surrounding the War on Terror. Among them is the phrase [...] "burn the witch", the title of song Radiohead worked on during the Hail to the Thief sessions but did not complete until their ninth album, A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).|$|E
500|$|British {{composer}} Charlie Mole {{wrote the}} score to Northanger Abbey, while the Pemberley Players provided other authentic pieces of music. Sue Mythen choreographed the ballroom scenes. Speaking to Benji Wilson of the Radio Times, Jones revealed the dance sessions {{were the most}} taxing part of the shoot. She explained that the cast had to learn all of the ballroom dances from scratch and they spent a week going over them {{to make sure they}} were right. She explained, [...] "But what happens is as soon as you put the dialogue in, the dancing <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> pot! So it's all about putting the movement and the dialogue together and remembering what your character is supposed to be thinking at the same time – that's quite tricky!" [...] Jones praised Mythen and said the teacher often reminded the actors to relax into the dance and remember that their character would have been doing it for years, as they would have learnt at an early age. Jones added [...] "the novelty for us with three weeks of dancing is not quite the same!" ...|$|E
500|$|Since its broadcast, [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] {{garnered}} {{little to}} no scrutiny from viewers. Vitti has never gotten any questions about the episode, except from his sister-in-law who wanted him to explain the episode for his nephews. [...] " [...] My sister-in-law called me up saying that I {{needed to talk to}} my nephews about how this was wrong that Homer did", Vitti said. [...] "They watched it and had lots of questions for her. And she referred them all to me. So {{there are some people who}} are still bothered by it." [...] The little amount of scrutiny that the episode attracted took The Simpsons staff by surprise, as they anticipated that the episode would generate a lot of controversy. Instead, [...] "Blame It on Lisa", an episode which aired the previous week, caused an uproar in Brazil because of its depiction of the country. It became one of the biggest controversies the series has ever faced. [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show that you never know what's going to be a problem", Jean said in the DVD commentary for [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's".|$|E

500|$|Stewart, {{who earned}} $270,136 for the victory, {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} first win of the season, and his first at Talladega Superspeedway, {{in front of a}} crowd of 145,000. He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be pretty fast here on the superspeedway track, so that <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
500|$|Davidson {{described}} the event as [...] "strange" [...] {{and stated that}} he had the pace to take the victory and had luck to his advantage while other competitors had problems: [...] "I had everything crossed but it wasn’t meant to be today. That’s racing I suppose but it sure does hurt sometimes.” After finishing in 26th, Webber said it had been an tough event for his team and revealed that they were confident that they could have battled for the victory had his car not sustained two punctured tyres: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show how hard endurance racing can be. We’re all right on the limit and as we’ve seen here that’s causing quite a high rate of attrition. Third time lucky at Le Mans is the plan." [...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle. The {{chief executive officer of the}} World Endurance Championship Gerard Neveu {{described the}} event as [...] "a great day for motorsport" [...] but felt that it was slightly strange. He revealed that after the race, he had organised a meeting with several people and raised the question of why [...] "there was so much aggression and action in Spa. It's quite simple: the cars are all so close together, the competition is so hard as never before. It can happen at any time - that is exciting...".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times also was {{impressed}} with the cast's singing abilities, and praised the writers' risk-taking: [...] "that <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show how well thought out, creative, and just plain fun tonight’s “Fringe” really was. A lot of people would have pegged a 1940s film noir musical episode as a big risk, but the bigger the risk, the bigger the pay out". Rhee Dee of Pinkraygun.com commented [...] "After the revelation in the last episode, and Peter running away, this episode was a great way to express Walter’s grief and guilt about this whole situation without actually watching Walter talk about how sad and guilty he feels about everything. Walter’s story serves as a powerful metaphor for how he actually feels". Tim Grierson of New York Magazine thought the episode turned out to be simply mediocre because [...] "its noir elements weren’t incorporated in a really interesting way, and as for the musical numbers, they tended to be throwaway bits, save for “fictional” Dunham crooning “For Once in My Life” to the seemingly dying “fictional” Peter near the episode’s end". Grierson continued that [...] "If a show is going to completely throw away its usual rulebook for a fun onetime-only episode, {{it would be great if}} the writers could come up with a story as audacious as their premise. But aside from some Chinatown references, fancy threads, and mildly clever mirroring of the show’s mythology — Massive Dynamic is up to no good in this story-land world as well — 'Brown Betty' wasn’t all that enjoyable because it didn’t do a great job of capturing what generally makes Fringe enjoyable".|$|E

500|$|USA Todays Robert Bianco credits Monica and Chandler's {{relationship}} and their wedding in the episode [...] "The One With Monica and Chandler's Wedding" [...] with saving Friends. Prior to the episode, the show had [...] "appeared {{to be in}} serious danger of out-staying its welcome." [...] Although admitting that the overall episode [...] "is not one of Friends best", Bianco explained that [...] "The wedding changed all that, and in remarkable fashion." [...] While BuzzFeed ranked Monica and Chandler the 23rd best television couple, E! placed the couple second on its ranking of the greatest Friends couples, with author Sydney Bucksbaum writing, [...] "It's {{hard to imagine a}} time when Monica and Chandler weren't together, but it took them four seasons to actually get together. From then on, it was clear that they were meant to be." [...] Tim Gerstenberger of TV Overmind echoed this sentiment by ranking Chandler Monica's best boyfriend, awarding him an 'A' grade. Gerstenberger penned, [...] "I {{would not be able to}} face myself every day if I did not rank Chandler the best of Monica’s boyfriends from Friends. The two ended up getting married, which <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show that some one night stands are meant to last." [...] Monica and Ross' relationship was also influential. According to Kriti Tulsiani of IBNLive, the characters [...] "provide a perfect exception to the myth that one cannot find a best friend in their sibling particularly when they are of opposite sex ... they have broken all the conventional boundaries of a brother-sister relationship."

500|$|Following the song's {{release on}} January 23, 1985, {{as the second}} single from Like a Virgin, [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{received}} mixed reviews from music critics. Author Rikky Rooksby, in his book The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, compared the song with those of Cyndi Lauper because of Madonna's shrill voice in the song. He added that the song was a [...] "pungent satire on the Reagan/Thatcher young-guns-go-for-it era. Which <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show that pop music and irony don't mix." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic said that [...] "Material Girl" [...] {{was one of the}} songs that made Madonna an icon, the other being [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] from the same album, both remaining as a definitive statement. He added that both tunes overshadow the rest of the record, [...] "because they are a perfect match of theme and sound." [...] Debby Miller from Rolling Stone, felt that the song portrayed Madonna as a more practical girl than previous female singers. Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly, while reviewing the album in 1995, felt that the song came off a bit repetitious and immature when compared to the present context. Jim Farber from Entertainment Weekly felt that the song provided then critics a way to criticize Madonna's work. Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine commented that Madonna had [...] "defined a generation with hits like 'Material Girl'." [...] Alfred Soto from Stylus Magazine compared the song with [...] "Everything She Wants" [...] by Wham!. Michael Paoletta from Billboard commented that the song sustained a [...] "fevered dance-rock momentum." [...] Nancy Erlick from Billboard said that [...] "singer and team conquer once more with their irresistible assembly of new and used pop hooks." [...] In 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all time for a special issue of Q magazine dedicated to Madonna.

[...] Jenna Gregory of Marie Claire wrote that Beyoncé shows an [...] "amazing bod in parely-there clothes which you definitely wouldn't find in the maternity section." [...] Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound found a 1980s vibe similar to the song's sound, adding that the only thing the [...] "family affair is missing is Jay-Z wearing sunscreen on his nose and a shirt from Tommy Bahama." [...] Ted Maider of the same publication, noted that Beyoncé [...] "adds some luster to the rusty surroundings, shining through as the beautiful pop icon that she has become. It <b>just</b> <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> show it doesn't matter where Beyonce is, or where her music is playing, she can turn any spot into a rager." [...] A writer of OK! said that Beyoncé [...] "don an unbelievable amount of cool oufits, all of which we need in our lives." [...] Rap-Up commented [...] "Summer may be over, but Beyoncé gives us another reason to celebrate with the vibrant video" [...] adding [...] "This is one party you won't want to miss."
