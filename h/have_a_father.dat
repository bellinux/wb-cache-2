5|$|Stay-at-home dads {{make up a}} {{very small}} portion of the Australian {{population}} although this appears to be rapidly changing. In 2003, 91% of fathers with children aged under 15 years were employed with 85% employed full-time. Because of this, there are few role models or resources that can help Australian fathers with the stay-at-home dad role. The Australian Bureau of Statistics show that approximately 7% of two parents families with {{children under the age of}} 14 <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> who is unemployed and a mother who works full-time. Stay at home dads in Australia have almost doubled over the past decade from 57,900 to 106,000, and expected to increase in the future. Recent sociological studies have shown that men are dedicating more time and support to their children in comparison to the 19th century. The idea of a stay at home dad were far from mainstream, however the rising demand for female work has influenced this statistic to rise.|$|E

His mother explains that she met his father, a Native American named Chief Running Water, at the 12th annual [...] "Drunken Barn Dance". However, Chief Running Water informs {{him that his}} mother is a slut and that he saw her with Chef later {{that night at the}} dance. Chef tells Cartman that his mother preferred Mr. Garrison over him. At a bar, Mr. Garrison admits to Cartman that he had sex with Mrs. Cartman, but then argues [...] "But who here didn't!?", to which Mayor McDaniels, Principal Victoria, Jesus and Father Maxi share guilty glances with each other. Dr. Mephisto is willing to perform DNA testing to resolve the issue, but requires $3,000 for the test. Cartman gets depressed, as he does not have the money.|$|E

Jones wrote a booklet titled [...] "The Letter Killeth", criticizing the King James Bible. Jones also began preaching {{that he was the}} reincarnation of Gandhi, Father Divine, Jesus, Gautama Buddha and Vladimir Lenin. Former Temple member Hue Fortson, Jr. quoted Jones as saying, [...] "What you need to believe in is what you can see... If you see me as your friend, I'll be your friend. As you see me as your father, I'll be your father, for those of you that don't <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>father...</b> If you see me as your savior, I'll be your savior.

UPI quoted one of Dean's friends in his youth as saying, [...] "By Hamptons standards, the Deans were not rich. No safaris in Africa or chalets in Switzerland. Howard's father went to work every day. He didn't own a company, or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>father</b> or grandfather who founded one, as mine did." [...] Peggy Noonan wrote in the Wall Street Journal that [...] "he doesn't seem like a WASP. I know it's not nice to deal in stereotypes, but there seems very little Thurston Howell, III, or George Bush, the elder, for that matter, in Mr. Dean.... He seems unpolished, doesn't hide his aggression, is proudly pugnacious. He doesn't look or act the part of the WASP...It will be harder for Republicans to tag Mr. Dean as Son of the Maidstone Club than it was for Democrats to tag Bush One as Heir to Greenwich Country Day. He just doesn't act the part." ...|$|E
