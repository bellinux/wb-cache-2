There {{is first}} the <b>hot</b> <b>fermentation</b> and unwholesome secrecy of the {{population}} crowded into large cities, each mote in the misery lighter, as an individual soul, than a dead leaf, but becoming oppressive and infectious each to his neighbor, in the smoking mass of decay. The resulting modes of mental ruin and distress are continually new; and in a certain sense, worth study in their monstrosity: they have accordingly developed a corresponding science of fiction, concerned mainly with the description of such forms of disease, like the botany of leaf-lichens.|$|R

25|$|Grenache {{is often}} used as a {{blending}} component, adding body and sweet fruitiness to a wine. The grape can be troublesome for the winemaker due to tendency to oxidize easily and lose color. To compensate for the grape's naturally low tannins and phenolic compounds, some producers will use excessively harsh pressing and <b>hot</b> <b>fermentation</b> with stems to extract the maximal amount of color and phenols from the skins. This can backfire to produce green, herbaceous flavors and coarse, astringent wine lacking the grape's characteristic vibrant fruitiness. To maintain those character traits, Grenache responds best to a long, slow fermentation at cooler temperatures followed by a maceration period. To curb against oxidation, the wine should be racked as little as possible. The use of new oak barrels can help with retaining color and preventing oxidation but too much oak influence can cover up the fruitiness of Grenache.|$|R

The {{details of the}} method as performed in Fiji are discussed {{as well as the}} nutritional and chemical changes undergone by breadfruit during this <b>fermentation.</b> The <b>taste</b> acceptibility of the product was tested as well as ways to adapt the procedure to modern conditions. The process is a lactic acid fermentation and the nutritional quality of the preserved food is similar to the fresh one. The fermentation can be effected using less labour and materials than was used in the traditional method...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND The aim of {{the work}} was to study the effect of {{traditional}} processing methods on the β-carotene, ascorbic acid and trypsin inhibitor contents of orange-fleshed sweet potato amala. The most common sweet potato in Nigeria is white or yellow fleshed, which is very low in provitamin A. However, efforts are underway to promote orange-fleshed sweet potato to improve provitamin A intake. This paper describes how orange-fleshed sweet potato slices were traditionally processed into amala, which is increasingly consumed in Nigeria. RESULTS The study revealed that both the cold and <b>hot</b> <b>fermentation</b> methods resulted in increased vitamin A levels and lower vitamin C levels in orange-fleshed sweet potato. Further processing to make amala resulted in a fall in both vitamin A and C content. The study found an increase in trypsin inhibitor activity following the cold-water fermentation and a decrease following the hot-water fermentation compared to raw orange-fleshed sweet potato. Trypsin inhibitor activity in amala produced using both the cold and hot methods was below detectable levels. CONCLUSION The results indicate that amala produced from traditionally fermented orange-fleshed sweet potato {{could be a good}} source of vitamins A and C for the rural poor and that the processing removes any potential negative effects of trypsin inhibitors...|$|R
40|$|Three {{species of}} molds, i. e. Aspergillus sojae. A. oryzae and Rhizopus oligosporus {{were used to}} hydrolyze soybean proteins. Whole {{soybeans}} were soaked overnight and cooked in boiling water for an hour, drained, sterilized at 121 °C for 15 minutes, then cooled and inoculated with A. oryzae. A. sojae, and R. oligosporus. As a control treatment another batch of soybeans was prepared for spontaneous <b>fermentation.</b> <b>Fermentation</b> <b>tasted</b> for five days. Based on the colony forming units (CFU), A. sojae, A. oryzae R. orgosporus and the control reached the stationary phase {{on the third day}} of fermentation. The CFU of A. sojae and A. oryzae were higher than that of the others, with 107 - 108 CFU/g dry weight for A. sojae and A oryzae and 106 - 107 CFU/g dry weight for the others. The proteolytic activity of A. sojae. oryzae, R. oboosporus and the control was maximum on the third day. The proteolytic activity of A: sojae and A. oryzae using soybean as substrate was higher (180 - 200 units tyrosine/g dry weight) than the other two groups (100 - 120 UT/g dry weight). Based on the efficiency of hydrolysis, A. sojae and A. oryzae had a higher hydrolysis percentage, giving 32 - 33 % and total soluble nitrogen of 2. 1 - 2. 2 percent/g dry weight. The hydrolysis efficiency of R. ologosporus and the control was 21 - 22 %. with the total soluble nitrogen 1. 4 - 1. 5 percent/g dry weight. The difference in initial pH i. e. pH 5. 0 : pH 6. 0 and pH 6. 7 did not affect the soluble nitrogen production significantly...|$|R
50|$|Shiromiso (白味噌) {{or white}} miso {{is the most}} widely {{produced}} miso, made in many regions of the country. Its main ingredients are rice, barley, and a small quantity of soybeans. If a greater quantity of soybeans were added, the miso would be red or brown. Compared with red miso, white miso has a very short <b>fermentation</b> time. The <b>taste</b> is sweet, and the umami is soft or light (compared to red miso).|$|R

30|$|Wine {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{fermented}} foods in history and is produced as a result of complicated interplay between the metabolic reactions of various microorganisms such as yeast and lactic acid bacteria (Zagorc et al. 2001). Wine yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been used to make wine with high stability because of its high ethanol tolerance and ability to inhibit bacteria and other undesirable microorganisms during the fermentation process (Casey and Ingledew 1986; Philliskirk and Young 1975). On the other hand, non-Saccharomyces yeasts, which grow during the initial stages of <b>fermentation,</b> affect the <b>taste</b> and aroma of wine, suggesting that suitable co-fermentation using Saccharomyces yeasts mixed with non-Saccharomyces yeast is an important factor in making wine of high quality (Ciani and Maccarelli 1998; Rojas et al. 2001; Jolly et al. 2006; Esteve-Zarzoso et al. 1998).|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic mirocalorimetry {{has been}} {{successfully}} employed in the reliable determination of the L-malic acid concentration in some foods and cosmetic products. The L-malic acid concentration during the wine-making process is particularly useful {{in order to control}} the progress of the malo-lactic <b>fermentation.</b> Total acidity, <b>taste</b> and flavour characteristics of wine depend on the L-malic acid quantity still present. To point out the analytical methodology the dehydration process Of L-malic acid, in the presence of Fumarase enzyme, has been used. The new method has been compared with a common spectrophotometric one. By the proposed calorimetric method the L-malic acid concentration in different types of food (white and red wines, fruits and soft beverages) has been determined. In some cosmetic products too the L-malic acid was quantified. The method outlined resulted simple, direct and reliable (good accuracy and precision), in particular it does not require any pre-treatment or clean up of the samples, save the dilution in buffer.

40|$|The {{fermentation}} {{stage is}} considered {{to be one of the}} critical steps in coffee processing due to its impact on the final quality of the product. The objective of this work is to characterise the temperature gradients in a fermentation tank by multi-distributed, low-cost and autonomous wireless sensors (23 semi-passive TurboTag® radio-frequency identifier (RFID) temperature loggers). Spatial interpolation in polar coordinates and an innovative methodology based on phase space diagrams are used. A real coffee fermentation process was supervised in the Cauca region (Colombia) with sensors submerged directly in the fermenting mass, leading to a 4. 6 °C temperature range within the fermentation process. Spatial interpolation shows a maximum instant radial temperature gradient of 0. 1 °C/cm from the centre to the perimeter of the tank and a vertical temperature gradient of 0. 25 °C/cm for sensors with equal polar coordinates. The combination of spatial interpolation and phase space graphs consistently enables the identification of five local behaviours during <b>fermentation</b> (<b>hot</b> and cold spots) ...|$|R
40|$|Soy sauce {{as one of}} the soy {{fermented}} product {{could be}} produced through fermentation by molds and then fermentation by bacteria and yeasts, in salt solution (moromi). The aims of this research were to evaluate and to compare the value of carbohydrate), lipid, and protein in soy sauce which were produced from tempe by mixing Rhizopus oligosporus and R. oryzae with and without moromi fermentation; to compare the taste, aroma and color of soy sauce have been produced and commercial soy sauce, i. e. Bango and Lombok Gandaria. The value of carbohydrate (reducing sugar and starch), lipid, and protein in soy sauce which were produced by mixing of R. oligosporus and R. oryzae with difference treatment by moromi and without moromi fermentations, were analyzed. The satisfaction test was conducted to compare the taste; aroma and color between soy sauce have been seasoning, and the commercial soy sauce Bango and Lombok Gandaria. Soy sauce could be made from tempe without moromi fermentation. Protein and lipid value of soy sauce from tempe without moromi fermentation were higher than soy sauce from tempe with moromi fermentation; such as lipid, but not significantly. Carbohydrate value of soy sauce from tempe without moromi fermentation was lower than soy sauce from tempe with moromi fermentation. Soy sauce from tempe without moromi <b>fermentation</b> had the <b>taste</b> and aroma which more preferable than soy sauce from tempe with moromi fermentation...|$|R
60|$|Such was not {{the phase}} of {{character}} which I had expected to find among {{the people of the}} West. Of all virtues patience would have been the last which I should have thought of attributing to them. I should have expected to see them angry when robbed of their time, and irritable under the stress of such grievances as railway delays; but they are never irritable under such circumstances as I have attempted to describe, nor, indeed, are they a people prone to irritation under any grievances. Even in political matters they are long-enduring, and do not form themselves into mobs for the expression of hot opinion. We in England thought that masses of the people would rise in anger if Mr. Lincoln's government should consent to give up Slidell and Mason; but the people bore it without any rising. The habeas corpus has been suspended, the liberty of the press has been destroyed for a time, the telegraph wires have been taken up by the government into their own hands, but nevertheless the people have said nothing. There has been no rising of a mob, and not even an expression of an adverse opinion. The people require to be allowed to vote periodically, and, having acquired that privilege, permit other matters to go by the board. In this respect we have, I think, in some degree misunderstood their character. They have all been taught to reverence the nature of that form of government under which they live, but they are not specially addicted to <b>hot</b> political <b>fermentation.</b> They have learned to understand that democratic institutions have given them liberty, and on that subject they entertain a strong conviction which is universal. But they have not habitually interested themselves deeply in the doings of their legislators or of their government. On the subject of slavery there have been and are different opinions, held with great tenacity and maintained occasionally with violence; but on other subjects of daily policy the American people have not, I think, been eager politicians. Leading men in public life have been much less trammeled by popular will than among us. Indeed with us the most conspicuous of our statesmen and legislators do not lead, but are led. In the States the noted politicians of the day have been the leaders, and not unfrequently the coercers of opinion. Seeing this, I claim for England a broader freedom in political matters than the States have as yet achieved. In speaking of the American form of government, I will endeavor to explain more clearly the ideas which I have come to hold on this matter.|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} for locally produced food is increasing due to consumer {{concern about the}} environment, distrust of industrial foods and a demand for high quality products. Apple is the predominant fruit crop in Sweden, and by processing apples into cider and vinegar, these products could significantly {{contribute to the development}} of the market of local foods. In this study different yeast types and different bacterial cultures were evaluated for their suitability in cider and vinegar production from cloudy apple juice. Ten apple cultivars (Aroma, Baldwin, Belle de Boskoop, Bramley, Cortland, Gravensteiner, Ingrid-Marie, Jonathan, Rubinola and Spartan) were also evaluated for their suitability for production of juice, cider and vinegar. Chemical analyses including total soluble solids, titratable acidity and total phenols were performed on the products along with sensorial evaluation by taste panels. The yeast strains were shown to have an effect on fermentation rate and the resulting content of total phenols in ciders fermented from cloudy apple juice. Dry commercial starter strains gave a higher appreciated cider compared to cider that was spontaneously fermented, and the ale yeast Safale S- 04 was concluded to be the most suited for fermentation of cloudy apple juice. For vinegar production, the bacterial culture had an effect on TSS, but not on any other chemical or taste characteristics. Clear differences in acceptability were found between the cultures; the culture from Alles um den Essig, intended for the submerged method, seemed to better be suited to the used production system compared to cultures developed for the surface method. The cloudy apple juice from the different cultivars varied significantly in chemical composition, with TSS in the range of 9. 6 – 15. 1 %, TA 0. 41 – 1. 24 % and total phenols 123. 9 – 850. 0 mg GAE/L. The comparatively sweet juices of Jonathan and Spartan obtained the highest acceptance whereas juices with lower TSS/TS ratios were less acceptable by the <b>taste</b> panel. During <b>fermentation</b> into cider, the TSS decreased differentially in the cultivars, whereas the differences in TA and total phenols were unaffected. Ciders that were perceived to be comparatively sweet were accepted to a higher degree. The <b>fermentation</b> enhanced the <b>taste</b> differences between the cultivars, and Jonathan and Spartan, were also most accepted as ciders. For vinegar, the differences in traits decreased, and of all the chemical parameters only content of total phenols separated the cultivars. There was however a tendency of lower acceptance of vinegar from Belle de Boskoop, Gravensteiner and Jonathan. It was concluded that several aspects influence the quality of cloudy apple juice, cider and vinegar, including cultivar, ripeness and choice of microorganisms for fermentation. For juices and ciders, sweeter products were preferred to a large extent, and the TSS/TA ratio appears to be a good predictor of consumer acceptance. In this study, an apple cultivar with a juice of good taste generally also produced a good cider, whereas the cultivar was of less importance for vinegar production...|$|R
