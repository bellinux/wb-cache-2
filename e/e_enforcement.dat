The study identified {{gaps in the}} existing practice and research, and established a practical framework that includes the development of asset families; establishment of realistic types and timings of reconstruction, rehabilitation, and maintenance, traffic volumes and growth projections; and damage cost estimation for each asset family and age group. The sensitivity of asset damage cost with respect to key policy and analysis variables was explored. Finally, the study examined the cost and operational issues associated with the enforcement of overweight truck policies. For pavement assets, the damage cost estimates were found to range from $ 0. 006 per ESAL-mile on Interstates to $ 0. 218 per ESAL-mile on non-national highways. The results also suggested that the pavement damage cost estimates are highly sensitive to the pavement life-cycle length, interest rate, rest period, and the costs and service lives of rehabilitation treatments. For bridges, an incremental-design methodology was used to assign damage cost to vehicle classes based on axle configurations and vehicle-miles of travel. Each FHWA vehicle weight group was classified into an equivalent AASHTO loading using the modified equivalent vehicle model {{which is based on}} gross vehicle weight, axle loading and axle spacing. Adopting a permit structure on the basis of gross vehicle weight only, will result in some vehicles underpaying by as much as 92 % of their actual contribution to bridge damage.

Cabe ressaltar que o objetivo {{principal}} deste trabalho é tratar de fatores ainda não abordados na literatura (nacional e internacional) produzida por essa linha de pesquisa, fornecendo evidências acerca da influência da estrutura de propriedade sobre o conservadorismo no mercado brasileiro, que possui conflito de agência entre acionistas majoritários (controlador) e minoritários. A amostra do trabalho perfaz 617 observações composta por empresas não financeiras negociadas na Bovespa durante o período de 2000 a 2008. Alternativamente, foi selecionada outra amostra desconsiderando as observações do ano de 2008, de forma a expurgar os efeitos da crise financeira registrada nesse ano. As evidências indicam que a concentração de votos contribui para diminuir o grau de conservadorismo, enquanto, por outro lado, o acordo de acionistas contribui para aumentar. Alternativamente, os resultados considerando o ano da crise global distorcem o funcionamento do modelo de Basu (1997). Espera-se que este estudo contribua para investidores, reguladores, pesquisadores e analistas no entendimento da função da informação contábil no processo de governança das firmas. This study investigates how two {{features of}} the ownership structure of Brazilian companies, the voting rights concentration and the shareholders agreement, {{are associated with the}} conditional conservatism proposed by Basu (1997). This association was founded on the effects of entrenchment and enforcement. Considering that the degree of conservatism of a firm is tied to the incentives arising from mechanisms that reduce the informational risk to stakeholders, this study was developed on the following research question: What is the influence of both the voting rights concentration and shareholders agreement on the degree of conservatism in the companies listed on Bovespa? The main goal of this work is to deal with factors not yet considered in the (national and international) literature produced in this line of research, and provides evidence about the influence of ownership structure on conservatism in the Brazilian market, which is marked by a, agency conflict between controlling shareholders (controller) and minority shareholders.

Alternatively, another sample was selected, disregarding the observations for 2008, as a means to remove the effects of the financial crisis registered that year. The evidences indicate that the voting rights concentration contributes to decrease the degree of conservatism, while, on the other hand, the stockholders agreement contributes to an increase. Alternatively, the results considered in the global crisis year distort the Basu model (1997).

The first part of the thesis includes three essays covering various aspects of the political economy of globalization and economic reforms, which are linked in several ways. The second part of the thesis includes two essays on the political economy of development in India. The aim of this introductory section is to give a brief and non-technical overview of the essays, as well as to explain the links between them. The discussion of the contribution of the research to the existing literature will be carried out separately in each essay. Globalization and economic reforms are two important concepts in the international political economy field. Explaining the social effects of both has {{been at the center of}} the international political economy literature for an extensive period of time. Much has been written about the effects of globalization on social outcomes (Dreher, Gaston, and Martens 2008, Schneider, Barbieri, and Gleditsch 2003) and there are at least two distinct trains of thought in academia and the public discourse. One view is that the structural changes towards more liberal economic policy can positively transform the economy and polity, increasing economic growth and welfare, as well as bringing much required modernization (Bhagwati 2004, Wolf 2004, Friedman 1999). On the other hand, more pessimistic voices, which include mainstream economists such as Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz, and Marxist critical theorists, believe that globalization can simultaneously promote a ‘race to the bottom’ in social standards that degrades communitarian bases of social stability and welfare (Rodrik 1997, Stiglitz and Charlton 2006). In fact, the global financial crisis of 2008, where people took to the streets in both developing and developed countries, has made the issue of whether or not globalization and economic reforms create socially undesirable consequences, ever more crucial. The first part of the thesis sheds new light on various aspects of the social effects of globalization and economic reforms, reviewing findings in the literature to date and extending existing theories. A major contribution of the thesis is the rigorous and thorough empirical evaluation of the human rights effects of economic reforms, and to what extent globalization has induced a race to the bottom in labour standards, while also contributing new empirical findings to extend the research surrounding the side effects of participating in IMF programs. The thesis is structured as follows. In chapter 1, we focus on the impact of economic reforms and economic freedom on human rights. It is argued that economic policy reforms will benefit most people in terms of better access to goods, lower inflation, and better economic opportunities (Murphy et al. 1991). However, critics of market reforms see the majority as losers from such reforms, expecting resistance that would lead to political repression (Przeworski 1991). Using the change in the Index of Economic Freedom as a measure of market liberalization reforms, employing data from a panel of 117 countries for the 1981 – 2006 period, the results show a strong positive association between reforms towards more free markets and governments’ respect for human rights, controlling for a host of relevant factors, including the possibility of endogeneity. These results lend support to those who argue that freer markets generate better economic conditions and higher levels of social harmony. In fact, halfhearted measures at implementing reforms could be dangerous to human rights. After exploring the impact of economic reforms on human rights, we continue by linking economic liberalization policies prescribed by international organizations such as the IMF to the outbreak of civil war in chapter 2. As the global economic downturn has heightened concerns over intervention by international financial institutions, as well as political stability, a prominently published work by Hartzell, Hoddie and Bauer (2010) purports to show that signing on to an IMF Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) increased the risk of civil war during the 1970 – 1999 period. They claim that the IMF’s SAPs push economic liberalization to the point where some people are so negatively affected as to foment civil war. We advance this debate by critically examining their theoretical and empirical evidence, particularly questioning their crucial assumptions about the impact of IMF programs on the economic environment in terms of the actual winners and losers from economic liberalization, and who might be in a position to rebel. Separating the effects of crises from IMF interventions is crucial since crises also generate losers in their own right. With only minor adjustments to their study, we find the exact opposite of what they conclude. We show that their measure of signing on to an IMF program remains consistently insignificant in explaining the outbreak of civil war, using the threshold of 25 battle deaths when defining the onset of a civil war. These results suggest that their operationalization of the IMF variable, as well as the utilization of large-scale civil wars (1000 deaths and above), captures the effect of ongoing war rather than the effects of liberalization. After extending the time period under study from 1970 – 1999 to 1970 – 2008, as well as making some minor changes to operationalization, again we find that IMF involvement is at worst a poor predictor of conflict, and at best, an alleviator of the risk. The next chapter turns to a topic which is currently the focus of both politicians and the labour unions in general. We analyze whether inter-country competition for investment has adverse effects on labour standards. Among the many concerns over globalization is that as nations compete for international firms, they will relax labour standards as a method of lowering costs and attracting investment. Using spatial econometric estimation on panel data for 148 developing countries over 18 years, we find that the labour standards in one country are indeed positively correlated with labour standards elsewhere (i. e., a reduction in the labour standards of other countries reduces the labour standards of the country in question). This interdependence is more evident in labour practices (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>enforcement)</b> than in labour laws. Furthermore, competition is most fierce in those countries which already have low standards. Since there has been a decline in the labour practices and laws across all three groups, this is possible evidence of a race to the bottom as nations compete for investment. The second part of the thesis focuses on essays on the political economy of development in India. India is often hailed as one of the success stories of globalization (Basu 2008). Indeed, after the inception of market economic reforms in 1991, economic growth has been both sustained and impressively robust in terms of national economic indicators (Basu 2008). However, despite rapid economic growth during the post- 1990 period, the benefits of economic growth are unevenly distributed, and some areas and groups of people have seen their living standards decline (Banerjee 2010). One could argue that this is somewhat surprising given the rapid surge in economic growth in recent years (Bardhan 2010). In connection with this, two critical issues have attracted a lot of attention, both within and outside India. First is the issue of corruption which is seen as a hindrance to prosperity and development, and the second is the emergence of India as one of the major donors of development aid. In chapter 4, we focus particularly on the influence of the timing of elections on controlling corruption. Firstly, we develop a conceptual framework that extends theories of political budget cycles to corruption, where an incumbent government considers controlling corruption based purely on political considerations. More specifically, we investigate whether the timing of elections affects the responsiveness of the incumbent government to control corruption. Secondly, we empirically test the predictions of the conceptual framework using 30 Indian states during the 1988 – 2009 period. Consistent with the conceptual framework developed, i. e., an incumbent politician might exert greater effort in an election year to control corruption, the findings show that scheduled elections (and not unscheduled elections) are associated with an increase in the number of corruption cases registered. In addition, we find that corruption cases registered tend to increase as a scheduled election year draws closer. Furthermore, the effects are found to be stronger in ‘swing states’ (where the margin of victory of the incumbent in the previous election was 5 % or less), and in state scheduled election years which coincide with national elections. On the other hand, there is no effect of scheduled elections on corruption cases being investigated by anti-corruption agencies. The following chapter examines a puzzling question about India. Here, we analyze what determines Indian development aid. It is indeed puzzling to note that India, which has a large domestic population suffering from underdevelopment, chronic poverty and mal-governance, is emerging as an important aid donor. With the intension of learning why poor countries provide foreign aid, this is the first work to econometrically analyze India’s aid allocation decisions. We utilize cross-sectional data on aid commitments to 128 developing countries by the Ministry of External Affairs and the Export-Import Bank of India, obtained in US dollars from AidData for the 2008 - 2009 period. We then compare India’s bilateral aid allocation with that of other donors to examine if India is any different regarding the motivation behind its allocation decisions. The findings show that India’s aid allocation decisions are largely driven by commercial and political self-interest. While recipient need does not seem to be a key determinant, neighboring countries receive considerable attention...|$|E

In particular with automated <b>enforcement</b> (<b>e.</b> g. speed and red light cameras) this chain concept is crucial: if one link is not effective or efficient, enforcement is compromised and road safety is negatively affected. The automated enforcement chain consists of a dozen links from detection and measurement to fine collection and/or court proceedings. It also includes basic issues such as vehicle registration and readability of license plates. Many counties struggle to get the wide range of multi-disciplinary aspects of the enforcement chain right and are thus not able to optimise their enforcement and improve road safety. Key bottlenecks in the automated enforcement chain can be found e. g. when the legal and operational framework and its capacity are not in place for dealing with automated traffic enforcement and the resulting huge volumes of traffic violations the license plate/vehicle owner and/or driving license administration are not in order inadequate requirements for the legal integrity of evidence and equipment homologation ticket processing, issuance and fine collection are ineffective and inefficient authorities argue over ticket revenue and funding of road safety investments <b>e.</b> g. <b>enforcement</b> equipment political and administrative support for automated traffic enforcement are wavering public support suffers because the background, results and road safety benefits of enforcement are not properly communicated through various media...|$|R

Secondly, the scope of legislation concerning labour inspection was examined to establish whether the Labour Inspection Authorities in the Nordic countries are expected to enforce only legislation concerning occupational safety and health, working conditions in general, or whether the Authorities have been additionally entrusted other duties, <b>e.</b> g. <b>enforcement</b> with the terms and conditions of employment of workers. Furthermore, it was also examined to whom the legislation applies and the content of the provisions of the legislation. Finally, the follow-up systems of the labour inspection legislation were examined...|$|R
40|$|The {{lack of a}} {{supranational}} {{legal authority}} that can enforce private contracts across borders makes debt repayment in an international setting contingent on borrowers willingness to pay rather than ability to pay. This market failure (i. <b>e.,</b> inadequate <b>enforcement)</b> causes investment to fall short of its unconstrained level. This paper examines how foreign aid affects a country s willingness to honor private investment agreements. We consider two types of aid: technical assistance and loan subsidies. We show that when enforcement is inadequate, aid has the following effects: (i) it reduces default risk, promotes capital flows, and can, in principle, restore investment to its unconstrained level; (ii) when default risk is high, aid can increase the welfare of both the recipient and the donor country. Thus, foreign aid serves as an enforcement mechanism in an international setting. This provides a nonaltruistic rationale for foreign aid. Finally, we discuss the implications of providing bilateral versus multilateral aid (e. g., by individual countries versus multilateral organizations). ...|$|R
40|$|Great Britain has an envied {{record of}} {{improving}} road safety. For the first 50 {{years of the}} 20 th century, the inexorable rise in motor vehicle numbers and use {{was accompanied by a}} rising toll of death and injury. The three <b>Es</b> of engineering, <b>enforcement</b> and education, working together, have been the key factors in bringing about casualty reduction. The Government-led publicity campaign has played a consistent and demonstrable role in helping to deliver that improvement. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to illustrate some of lessons from the success of the road safety campaign that may be translated to other social issue campaigns, such as promoting responsibility in gambling...|$|R
40|$|Using World Business Environment Survey {{results for}} firms in 61 countries, {{together}} with country dummies {{that allow us}} to deal with observed and unobserved country-specific components, as well as with partial endogeneity, we explore the roles played by creditor protection (<b>e.</b> g. the <b>enforcement</b> of credit contracts) and by the development of credit information mechanisms, such as credit registries, in determining the availability of bank credit for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). We find that better creditor protection and the development of information-sharing mechanisms narrow the financing gap between small and large firms. Countries with poor creditor protection can offset this shortcoming by implementing credit information mechanisms...|$|R

As a separate legal category, fiduciary law provides for fiduciary duties and liabilities for entities and individuals in {{both private and public}} power sectors and imposes proper penalties on those fiduciaries for their failure in fiduciary duties through a set of consistent legal systems and rules. Legislation in fiduciary law should be based on the Securities Law, clarify the fiduciary duties and liabilities of fiduciaries and focus on the arrangement of legislation and enforcement as a whole. Key words: Fiduciary construction; Fiduciary law; Fiduciary duties; Legal liabilities</p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} multilateral organizations in directing private capital flows when enforcement is inadequate. We analyze the investment decision {{of a country that}} faces a repayment incentive constraint. It is well known that “under investment ” occurs when this constraint binds. As a consequence of the market failure (i. <b>e.,</b> inadequate contractual <b>enforcement),</b> there is scope for policy intervention designed to promote private investment. We consider two policies that are frequently used by multilateral organizations: technical assistance and loan subsidies. We show that these policies improve private investment flows and welfare, and hence provide a rationale for the operation of organizations such as the World Bank in conjunction with private markets...|$|R
