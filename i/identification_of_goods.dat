They both provide supply chain players with goods tracking and monitoring functions along the chain. Whereas RFIDs are rather focusing on <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> (e. g., identification, classification), WSNs are meant to monitor and control the supply chain environment. Nevertheless, despite the interest for the supply chain management systems, their integration is often deterred {{due to the lack}} of interoperability.

40|$|Statistical {{analysis}} of networks plays {{a critical role}} in the context of economics and the social sciences. Here we construct a bidding network to represent the behavior of users of the eBay marketplace. We study the eBay markets for digital cameras and liquid crystal display screens, and employ network analysis to identify aggregate structure in bidder preferences. The network that we construct associates auctions with nodes, and weighted edges between nodes capture the number of bidders competing in a pair of auctions, where said bidders ultimately win in only a single auction. We show that current community detection methods applied to this network allow for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> that are considered substitutes and complements, and thus the identification of aggregate preference information. In closing we suggest additional opportunities as well as challenges for the {{analysis of}} structured data in electronic markets...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Current {{systems for}} {{automatic}} <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> presume a single administrative domain. However, in {{supply chain management}} systems temporary cooperations of multiple companies exist, and the usage of one identification device, such as a radio-frequency identification (RFID) tag, per company is infeasible for reasons of costs, space requirements, traceability, and higher collision rate. This article analyzes the security requirements resulting from the usage of a single tag for multiple companies and proposes a novel system architecture and accompanying cryptographic protocols that address the security objectives entity authentication, controlled access, data confidentiality and integrity, as well as untraceability of RFID tags. The architecture {{is designed to provide}} high availability and graceful degradation in case of compromise of system parts. The results of an implementation and simulation study give insights on appropriate data structures for realizing key functionality, and demonstrate that the approach can be deployed with commercial off-the-shelf hardware...|$|E

40|$|The Acceptance of the Stoic Thesis on Affections (Pathē) In this paper, I {{argue that}} the Stoic claim that one should strive towards having no {{affections}} (pathē) is a plausible and, moreover, true claim given {{the context of the}} Stoic thesis on affections (pathē) in relationship to their philosophy of the ultimate goal (telos) of life. Given the conception of affections (pathē) that the Stoics intended, the irrefutability that one should strive towards having no affections (pathē) is found in the Stoic conception of impulse (hormē) and of value (namely how affections (pathē) lack value). Further, in the Stoic philosophy, there is <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> bads and indifferents, which is an important contributing factor to the plausibility of the thesis. Taken together, these lead to the coherent acceptance of the Stoic thesis on affections (pathē), specifically that the allowance of affections (pathē) should be avoided...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA fixed-period delay {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{to increase the}} detection range and detection stability of a ternary barcode detection system. The system combines an envelope differential detection technique containing nonlinear filtering and a fixed-period delay to detect the barcode over a longer range and at higher scanning speeds while being simple and capable of handling {{a large amount of}} information. The system was demonstrated with its miniaturized circuit and it was established that the detection range of the system for a minimum bar width W= 0. 25 mm was 1. 8 times that of the conventional count-latch envelope differential technique because of the stable delay achieved by a shift register and the noise suppression by a nonlinear filter. In addition, the system operated at a maximum scanning speed of 8. 3 times that of conventional charge-coupled device (CCD) cameras under the practical detection range for W= 0. 3 mm. This system is expected to enable the real-time <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> on production lines and in automated warehouses...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{warehouse}} management mainly {{consists of the}} processes of warehouse entry, warehouse delivery, storage moving and inventory verification. In traditional {{warehouse management}}, bar-code technology is widely used while the RFID {{becomes more and more}} popular in the modern warehouse management. By contrast, the RFID is more advantageous than the bar-code for its massive <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> in every aspect of a process in the modern warehouse management. Based on the requirements of the process of in-out stock, we have made an analysis on the principle of RFID and designed the device of RFID gantry which meets a standard of ISO/IEC 18000 - 6. The practical running of this device involves the working of both hardware and software. The testing result shows it can be used in practical logistical warehouse management and bring about better ends. The application of the RFID technology can promote the speed of in-out stock, consequently reducing spare stocks, improving efficiency in space utilization and keeping the cost of work force down. In the management of modern logistical warehouse, the RFID technology is more and more applied in the intelligent management of the storage goods. The typical process of warehous...|$|E
