6000|$|... "Right here," [...] replied {{another voice}} and Weechi the Magnolia Warbler dropped {{down on the}} ground <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> right in front of Peter.|$|E
6000|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Peter was startled, then he {{recognized}} the voice of Mrs. Grouse, one of his very best friends. [...] "Yowler the Bob-cat," [...] said he as fiercely as before.|$|E
60|$|Charlot looked up, and <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{his glance}} {{was not without}} uneasiness. Then he laughed. He unbuckled his sword and tossed it into a corner, {{throwing}} his hat after it.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> Myles's friends stood cowed, and {{in those}} few seconds the fight {{came to an end}} with a suddenness {{unexpected}} to all.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A {{thermal image}} of an optical flat after {{handling}} <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds.</b> The warmer areas increase {{the thickness of the}} flat over cooler areas, distorting the surface accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|One popular {{feature of}} Peterson's program {{was known as}} [...] "Flush The Lines." [...] He would tell {{listeners}} to call en masse and would put everyone who called on the air <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> to make <b>a</b> (usually comedic) remark.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Happy Jack didn't {{know what}} he meant. Then he saw Farmer Brown's boy {{watching}} Tommy Tit as if he didn't {{know what to make}} of the little fellow's excitement.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Tommy {{drew back}} her head <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{as if she}} were going to crush him in the dust, and then she just all kind of {{crumpled}} up and her face went down on his shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] replied another voice, and Mrs. Yellow-throat flitted across {{right in}} front of Peter. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> she sat still, long enough for him to have one good look at her. She was dressed very like Mummer save that she did not wear the black mask.|$|E
60|$|<b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> {{she only}} saw these inanimate things, then she became {{conscious}} of Percy's presence.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for the {{automatic}} identification of inertial sensors on human body segments during walking. This method allows {{the user to}} place (wireless) inertial sensors on arbitrary body segments. Next, the user walks <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> and the segment to which each sensor is attached is identified automatically...|$|R
50|$|The Swiss Federal Railways clock {{designed}} by Hans Hilfiker {{has become a}} national icon. It is special in that it stops <b>for</b> <b>just</b> over <b>a</b> <b>second</b> {{at the end of}} each minute, to wait for a signal from the master clock which sets it going again — thus keeping all station clocks synchronized.|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> the hunchback {{seemed to}} hesitate. He stood in awesome fear of Gian Maria, of whose cruelties some ghastly tales were told. But in greater fear he stood {{of the eternal}} damnation he might earn did he break the oath he had plighted not to divulge that knight's identity.|$|E
60|$|Down, down, down he sailed {{and landed}} on his feet. Of course, he hit the ground pretty hard, and <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> he quite lost his breath. But it was only for a second, {{and then he was}} scurrying off as fast as a frightened Squirrel could. Buster Bear watched him and grinned.|$|E
6000|$|Blacky {{closed his}} eyes <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> {{and when he did}} that he seemed to see himself eating one of those eggs. [...] "What are you afraid of?" [...] he muttered to himself as he opened his eyes. Then with a hurried look in all directions, he flew up {{to the edge of the}} box. There lay the two eggs! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A month. Is that long? Please! It's {{not easy}} for me." [...] She smiled faintly, lifted her eyes to him <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> [...] "Please not any more now." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds</b> she didn't move. She couldn't. She was {{too frightened}} to move. Then {{she knew what she}} saw was real and not a dream at all. There wasn't the least bit of doubt about it. That was Farmer Brown's boy, and that was his dreadful gun! All in a flash she knew that Farmer Brown's boy must have been hiding behind those pine boughs.|$|R
60|$|There was <b>for</b> <b>just</b> one <b>second</b> <b>a</b> shade, {{though not}} by any means a dark one, on the landlady's open brow. But it passed off instantly, in a laugh that came from her very heart.|$|R
60|$|Now Johnny Chuck was {{round and}} fat and rolly-poly, {{and when one}} is round and fat and rolly-poly, one's breath is apt to be short. So it was with Johnny Chuck. He had fought so hard that his breath was nearly gone. Finally he loosed his hold on Reddy Fox <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> to draw in a good breath. Reddy Fox saw his chance, and, with a quick pull and spring, he broke away.|$|E
60|$|So was it now. His pause was but momentary. Yet in that moment, from {{calm and}} {{freezing}} {{that he had}} been, he became ruffled and hot. The change was visible in his heightened colour, in his flashing eyes, and in his twitching mustachios. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> he sought to smother his wrath; he had a glimmer of remembrance {{of the need for}} caution and diplomacy in the darkness of anger that was descending over him. Then, without further warning, he exploded.|$|E
60|$|Alice Deringham {{held her}} breath as, while a third beat of hoofs grew louder behind, Alton {{gathered}} up the bridle and drove his heels home. The horse, frightened by the clamour, reared almost upright and then backed across the trail, while the girl wondered with a tense anxiety whether the man would look up. Then <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> he turned his head, and saw her standing on the verandah with a blaze in her cheeks and a dimness in her eyes.|$|E
50|$|Often called Oliver Momm Jahresmix, {{these were}} the year end megamixes, {{crossing}} over all styles, beginning with slow R'n'B and hip hop tunes, ending in techno, trance and progressive house tunes. These megamixes extended on average over 70 to 80 tunes, many <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> partially <b>a</b> cappella. Momm said that these Gigamixes took more time than a usual Partymix; four to five weeks was the time range to present a brilliant year end mix.|$|R
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, {{up to and including}} blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the past}} plastic gobos had been {{generally}} custom made—for when a pattern {{is needed in}} color and glass does not suffice. However, in a [...] "traditional" [...] (tungston/halogen) light fixture, the focus point where a gobo must be placed is usually extremely hot, so these thin plastic films generally need {{to be used with}} special cooling elements to prevent melting them. A lapse in the cooling apparatus, even <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> can cause plastic gobos in a traditional lighting instrument to be ruined.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} that he remembered the Big River. He turned towards it. It was his only chance and he knew it. Straight through the Green Forest, out across the Green Meadows to {{the bank of the}} Big River, Lightfoot ran. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> he paused to look behind. The hounds were almost at his heels. Lightfoot hesitated no longer but plunged into the Big River and began to swim. On the banks the hounds stopped and bayed their disappointment, for they did not dare follow Lightfoot out into the Big River.|$|E
6000|$|It {{would have}} been {{manifest}} to a meaner capacity than any present that evening that Mr. Magnet regarded Marjorie with a distinguished significance. He had two eyes, but he had that mysterious quality so frequently associated with a bluish-grey iris which gives the effect of looking hard with one large orb, a sort of grey searchlight effect, and he used this eye ray now to convey a respectful but firm admiration in the most unequivocal manner. He saluted Daffy courteously, and then allowed himself to retain Marjorie's hand <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> longer than was necessary as he said--very simply--"I am very pleased indeed to meet you again--very." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{accident}} {{had occurred}} at a point about one hundred yards from where Pat and Sparrer were about to emerge from a thicket of bushes lining the drive and {{at the sound of}} the crash they sprang out. An instant later a big roadster tore past and they caught a fleeting glimpse of a strained white face behind the big steering wheel and beyond, partly raised and half turned to look back, a fur-coated figure, evidently that of a young man. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> his face turned toward them, then hastily turned away. But that brief glimpse was enough to show them that it bore the stamp of guilty fear.|$|E
60|$|Old Mr. Toad went hopping up the Crooked Little Path {{as fast as}} he could, which wasn't very fast, {{because he}} never can hop very fast. And all the time he kept looking behind for Mr. Blacksnake. Presently he came to a turn in the Crooked Little Path, and as he hurried around it, he almost ran into Mr. Blacksnake himself. It was a {{question}} which was more surprised. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> wee <b>second</b> they stared at each other. Then Mr. Blacksnake's eyes began to sparkle.|$|R
50|$|To {{make matters}} worse, some phones {{make it easier}} to call the {{emergency}} services when the keypad is locked than it would be otherwise. An example of this is a soft key programmed to make an emergency call when the keylock is set. On touch-screen phones, passcode screens often include a single button that, when touched <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> will dial emergency services. The result is that it is often preferable to disable the passcode since, while doing so increases the likelihood of pocket dialing family and friends, it is considered a lesser evil than pocket dialing the emergency services.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw {{a pair of}} hands--just hands--no arms--nothing but hands--come out of the darkness! They gripped me by the throat. I {{suppose it}} was <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> I think--I lost {{consciousness}} for a moment, although I was still standing up. The next thing I remember is that I found myself shrieking and running here--and the jewels had gone!" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{just one}} instant Ramiro {{looked down at}} the {{sprawling}} lad, his eyes glowing like a madman's. Then suddenly he rose, stooped, and set one hand to the boy's belt, the other to the collar of his jerkin. Feeling himself lifted, and knowing whose were the dread hands that held him, poor Beppo uttered a single scream of terror. Then Ramiro swung him round with an ease that displayed the man's prodigious strength. <b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> he seemed to hesitate how to dispose of the human bundle that he held. Then, as if suddenly taking his resolve, that devil hurled the lad across the little intervening space, straight {{into the heart of the}} blazing fire.|$|E
60|$|<b>For</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> Bowser {{stared in}} utter surprise. Then {{with a little}} yelp of pure joy he leaped up and {{did his best to}} lick his master's face. Could you have seen Bowser, you might have thought that he was just a foolish young puppy, he cut up such wild antics to express his joy. He yelped and whined and barked. He nearly knocked Farmer Brown's boy down by leaping up on him. He raced around in circles. When at last he was still long enough, Farmer Brown's boy just threw his arms around him and hugged him. He hugged him so hard he made Bowser squeal. Then two of the happiest folks in all the Great World started back across the snow-covered fields to the sleigh.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby {{was close}} beside him, {{and for a}} moment the two men looked into each other's eyes. In less than another minute the object they had seen would swing out with the outflow at the tail of the pool, and the long white rapid would whirl it beyond their reach into the gloom again. Night was close at hand, and, if they let him pass, Trooper Probyn would by morning have {{travelled}} far into the heart of a wilderness where it was scarcely likely that any of them would ever overtake him. The rivers of the North run fast, and that is a country wherein the strongest man must travel slowly. It seemed to Ingleby that it might be better to let him go. Then he was ashamed of the doubt that this implied, and Sewell, who knew what he was thinking, glanced <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> in Tomlinson's direction.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} sauces {{can be used}} to dip meats and {{vegetables}} when eating shabu-shabu. Normally, the raw meat is dipped into the hot stock <b>for</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>seconds,</b> as the pieces are sliced paper thin. Putting all meat into the pot in one go may result in overcooking the meat. There are a variety of sauces that {{can be used to}} dip the meat and vegetables, including ponzu sauce and sesame sauce. Restaurants usually provide soy sauce, sesame paste, ponzu sauce and several other condiment options such as spring onions and Japanese pickled carrots so that customers can make the sauce according to their own preferences.|$|R
5000|$|His {{most recent}} series, called Double Duty, are {{photographs}} using the 12" [...] dolls to make social commentary," [...] the text says. [...] "Trobaugh's photographs uncannily portray human likeness and gesture." [...] True. In fact, for <b>a</b> <b>second,</b> we thought someone had found and posted photos we {{took in the}} '70s. <b>Just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b> -Stephen Saban of The WOW Report ...|$|R
5000|$|Level 0: Confusion. At {{this level}} the {{individual}} has a degree of zero self-awareness. This person is unaware of any mirror reflection or the mirror itself. They perceive the mirror {{as an extension of}} their environment. Level 0 can also be displayed when an adult frightens himself in a mirror mistaking his own reflection as another person <b>just</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>second.</b>|$|R
