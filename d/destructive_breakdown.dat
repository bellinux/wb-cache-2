40|$|Abstract. The shout-circuit {{ruggedness}} of prototype 1. 2 kV SiC MOSFETs {{has been}} investigated. The short-circuit measurements {{were carried out}} at 25 °C and 125 °C with a dc bus voltage of 800 V and an on/off state gate voltage of + 20 /- 10 V. The small difference in tfail between 25 °C and 125 °C indicates that the <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown</b> occurs at temperatures much higher than 125 °C. The temperature at <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown</b> estimated from the Wunsch-Bell formula is about 1400 °C. At such high temperatures, intrinsic carriers are increased markedly and generated heat leads to the <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown.</b> tfail of all the SiC-MOSFETs studied is longer than 10 µs, meaning that the short-circuit ruggedness satisfies system requirements. These {{results show that the}} SiC-MOSFETs are promising for power electronics applications...|$|E

Inhomogeneities or bright spots in the emission have proven to indicate the presence of defects in the gate/drain spacing or surface contaminants, such as re-deposited gate material. Processing abnormalities of 0. 5 mym diameter are easily seen.

40|$|<b>Destructive</b> {{over-voltage}} <b>breakdown</b> {{of cellular}} phone power transistors is prevented {{by using a}} new voltage-limiting concept. The output voltage is detected by an avalanche-based detector, and limited by decreasing the output power when needed. The voltage detector contains a low voltage bipolar NPN transistor with a well-defined lower breakdown voltage than the high voltage power transistor. Avalanche current in this detector is used to adapt the output power. In this manner the maximum collector voltage {{is limited to the}} breakdown voltage of the detector. Measurements show actuation current of the detector for extreme mismatch conditions. The maximum collector voltage is reduced from 15. 1 V to 11. 5 V once the protection loop is closed.

40|$|By <b>destructive</b> <b>{{breakdown}}</b> we mean {{a breakdown}} event {{that results in}} surface melting over large areas on the iris tip region of an accelerator structure. The melting {{is the result of}} the formation of macroscopic areas of plasma in contact with the surface. The plasma bombards the surface with an intense ion current ({approx} 10 {sup 8 } A/cm{sup 2 }), which is equivalent to a pressure on the order of a thousand Atmospheres. A radial gradient in the pressure produces a ponderomotive force that causes molten copper to migrate away from the iris tip, resulting in a measurable change in the iris shape. This distortion in the iris shape in turn produces an error in the cell-to-cell phase shift of the accelerating wave with a consequent loss in synchronism with the electron beam and a reduction in the effective accelerating gradient. Assuming a long lifetime is desired for the structure, such breakdowns must be avoided or at least limited in number. The accelerating gradient at which these breakdowns begin to occur imposes, therefore, an absolute limit on an operationally attainable gradient. The <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown</b> limit (DBL) on the accelerating gradient depends on a number of factors, such as the geometry of the irises and coupler, the accuracy of the cell-to-cell tuning (''field flatness''), and the properties of the metal used in the high E-field regions of the structure. In this note we consider only the question of the dependence of the DBL on the metal used in the high surface field areas of the structure. There are also various types of non-destructive breakdowns (NDB's) that occur during the ''processing'' period that, after the initial application of high power, is necessary to bring the gradient up to the desired operating level. During this period, as the input power and gradient are gradually increased, thousands of such NDB's occur. These breakdowns produce a collapse in the fields in the structure as energy stored in the fields is absorbed at the breakdown site. They are often marked by vacuum bursts and an increase in power reflected from the structure. The usual cause for NDB's during processing is the ''explosion'' of field emitters at sharp geometrical features on the metal surface. Exposed impurities in the metal surface can also produce NDB's as they are ''burned'' off by H-field heating or explosive field emission. The breakdown process can be roughly divided into four stages: (1) the formation of ''plasma spots'' at field emission sites, each spot leaving a crater-like footprint; (2) crater clustering, and the formation of areas with hundreds of overlapping craters; (3) surface melting in the region of a crater cluster; (4) the process after surface melting that leads to <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{microelectronics}} industry {{owes its}} considerable success {{largely to the}} existence of the thermal oxide of silicon. How-ever, recently there is concern that the reliability of ultra-thin di-electrics will limit further scaling to slightly thinner than 2 nm. This paper will review the physics and statistics of dielectric wearout and breakdown in ultrathin SiO 2 -based gate dielectrics. Electrons or holes tunneling through the gate oxide generate defects until a critical density is reached and the oxide breaks down. The critical defect density is explained by the formation of a percolation path of defects across the oxide. Only 1 % of these paths ultimately lead to <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown,</b> and the microscopic nature of these defects is not known. The rate of defect generation decreases approximately exponentially with supply voltage, below a threshold voltage of about 5 V for ho...|$|E
40|$|High {{electron}} mobility transistors (HEMTs) with different gate recess depth were fabricated on an Al 0. 33 Ga 0. 67 N/GaN heterostructure, utilizing low power Cl- 2 reactive ion etching. An increase in extrinsic transconductance {{and a positive}} threshold shift were observed with an increase of etching time. The etch depth was measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and determined to be nonlinear with etching time. The two terminal gate-drain leakage increased from about 0. 005 mA/mm to 0. 05 mA/mm. The <b>destructive</b> three-terminal <b>breakdown</b> voltage was about 120 V for all devices, etched and un-etched. Power measurements were performed in class A/B at a frequency of 8 GHz. The output power varied between 2. 5 and 4. 5 W/mm {{with the increase of}} bias voltage from 25 to 50 V. Independently of etch depth, {{there was no evidence of}} device failure even for the highest bias. The low increase in leakage, and no change in breakdown voltage support that low power RIE etching is a viable solution for low damage gate recess etch...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The recent {{publication}} of the 5 th revision of TIA 942 standard represents a benchmark framework to design resilient power systems. This standard provides a classification for electric infrastructures {{in terms of their}} capacity to tolerate failures and to allow safely maintenance operations. This ranking is not based upon technical specifications, but on system resilience level, that is the capacity to resist to an unexpected <b>destructive</b> event, <b>breakdown</b> or malfunctioning which afflicts the end user. However, this standard is provided only for design purposes. Aim {{of this paper is to}} propose an approach by which the current resilience status of a system can be evaluated, in accordance to this standard classification. The proposed technique should allow to easily analyze the gap – in terms of infrastructure topology, components and distribution lines – between an existing system and a generic configuration with a desired resilience level, and thus to suggest the steps to reach the proper availability for the system specific mission. A preliminary version of the technique – which however still leaves some open issues – has been validated with the power system infrastructure that supports one of the largest datacenters in Italy, inside a primary IT Company which has to guarantee a 24 / 7 continuous operation of its software application, mission critical in the interests of its customers...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a method for {{refractive}} laser surgery based on low-energy femtosecond laser pulses provided by ultracompact turn-key non-amplified laser systems. An additional excimer laser is not required for ablation of the stroma. The novel method {{has the potential to}} be used for (i) optical flap creation as well as stroma ablation and (ii) for non-invasive flap-free intrastromal ablation. In addition, 3 D multiphoton imaging of the cornea can be performed. In particular, we used sub-nanojoule near infrared 80 MHz femtosecond laser pulses for multiphoton imaging of corneal structures with ultrahigh resolution (< 1 µm) as well as for highly precise intraocular refractive surgery. Imaging based on two- photon excited cellular autofluorescence and SHG formation in collagen structures was performed at GW/cm(sup 2) intensities, whereas <b>destructive</b> optical <b>breakdown</b> for nanoprocessing occurred at TW/cm(sup 2) light intensities. These high intensities were realized with sub-nJ pulses within a subfemtoliter intrastromal volume by diffraction-limited focussing with high NA objectives and beam scanning 50 to 140 µm below the epithelial surface. Multiphoton tomography of the cornea was used to determine the target of interest and to visualize intraocular post-laser effects. Histological examination with light- and electron microscopes of laser-exposed porcine and rabbit eyes reveal a minimum intratissue cut size below 1 µm without destructive effects to surrounding collagen structures. LASIK flaps and intracorneal cavities could be realized with high precision using 200 fs, 80 MHz, sub-nanojoule pulses at 800 nm. First studies on 80 MHz femtosecond laser surgery on living rabbits have been performed...|$|R
40|$|By <b>destructive</b> <b>{{breakdown}}</b> we mean {{a breakdown}} event {{that results in}} surface melting over a macroscopic area in a high E-field region of an accelerator structure. A plasma forms over the molten area, bombarding the surface with an intense ion current ({approx} 10 {sup 8 } A/cm{sup 2 }), equivalent to a pressure of about a thousand Atmospheres. This pressure in turn causes molten copper to migrate away from the iris tip, resulting in measurable changes in the iris shape. The breakdown process can be roughly divided into four stages: (1) the formation of ''plasma spots'' at field emission sites, each spot leaving a crater-like footprint; (2) crater clustering, {{and the formation of}} areas with hundreds of overlapping craters; (3) surface melting in the region of a crater cluster; (4) the process after surface melting that leads to <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown.</b> The physics underlying each of these stages is developed, and a comparison is made between the theory and experimental evidence whenever possible. The key to preventing breakdown lies in stage (3). A single plasma spot emits a current of several amperes, a portion of which returns to impact the surrounding area with a power density on the order 10 {sup 7 } Watt/cm{sup 2 }. This power density is not quite adequate to melt the surrounding surface on a time scale short compared to the rf pulse length. In a crater field, however, the impact areas from multiple plasma spots overlap to provide sufficient power density for surface melting over an area on the order of 0. 1 mm{sup 2 } or more. The key to preventing breakdown is to choose an iris tip material that requires the highest power density (proportional to the square of the rf surface field) for surface melting, taking into account the penetration depth of the impacting electrons. The rf surface field required for surface melting (relative to copper) has been calculated for a large number elementary metals, plus stainless-steel and carbon...|$|E

The nitrided surface region is 3 to 4 nm wide with a rapidly decreasing nitrogen concentration versus depth. The experimental data suggest that amine NHX (0 < X < 3) species are essential in the nitridation process of SiO 2 using NH 3 gas. Al-gat/nitrided SiO 2 /Si(100) p capacitors have been prepared in situ or not. Electrical measurements show that a low interface-state density (1010 to 1011 eV-l cm- 2), a good stability during electron injection due to a balance between trapping and detrapping in the nitrided region of SiO 2 and a <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown</b> field as high as 10 MV cm- 1 {{can be achieved by}} optimizing nitridation conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cellular phone power {{amplifiers}} (PAs) operate in strongly varying environments {{and have to}} withstand extreme conditions. To avoid <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown</b> a generic protection concept is proposed {{that is based on}} adaptive control of the output power. It provides over-voltage, over-temperature, and/or over-current protection by detection of the collector peak voltage, die temperature, and/or collector current to reduce the effective power control voltage once a threshold level is crossed. By applying protections, PAs can be implemented in low-cost silicon technology competitively to GaAs HBT implementations. In addition, requirements on package thermal resistance are relaxed. In this paper a theoretical analysis is given on the behavior of a class-AB amplifier under mismatch conditions. Measurement results on a silicon bipolar power transistor with integrated protection circuits are presented, proving the concept of adaptive protection. For a supply voltage of 5 V and nominal output power of 2 W no breakdown is observed for a VSWR of 10 over all phases when output power is adaptively reduced by 2. 7 dB at most...|$|E
40|$|Lightning strikes {{can cause}} {{structural}} damage, ignite flammable materials, and produce circuit malfunctions in missiles, aircraft, and ground systems. Lightning arrestor connectors (LACs) {{are used to}} divert harmful lightning energy away from these systems by providing less <b>destructive</b> <b>breakdown</b> paths. Ceramic granules in the size range of 150 [...] 200 {micro}m are used in LACs to provide physical and electrical separation of contacts (pins) from the surrounding metal web, and to control the voltage breakdown level. Pressure compaction (P-C) tests were used to characterize the strength of ceramic granules. When compaction data are plotted as relative density of the compact versus the compaction pressure two linear regions are generally observed. The intersection of these regions, which {{is known as the}} ``breakpoint,`` {{has been used as a}} semi-quantitative measure of granule strength. Comparisons were made between the P-C breakpoint and strengths of 150 [...] 200 {micro}m diameter ZnO, TiO{sub 2 } (rutile), and lead magnesium niobate-lead titanate (PMN-PT) granules, where the strengths were determined by diametral compression (D-C) tests. At high compaction pressures the compliance of the die itself is significant and was accounted for in the analyses. Tests were conducted at different compaction rates, and with different aspect ratio compacts. High aspect ratios and loading rates decrease the slope of the second linear portion of the compaction curve and produce higher apparent P-C breakpoints. Comparison of the P-C breakpoint to the average D-C strength indicates that the D-C strength is approximately fifty percent higher for PMN-PT granules. To eliminate the uncertainty in results due to irregular granules sizes and shapes, comparisons were made for uniform size (210 {micro}m) glass spheres. In this case the average D-C strength coincided with a second breakpoint in the P-C data, which occurred after compaction by a mechanism of bridge formation and collapse had ceased...|$|E
