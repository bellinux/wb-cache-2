The CNH bend-stretch (amide-II band) {{was found to be}} the most useful tool for examining the <b>imidization</b> mechanism in the precursor film Examination of the behavior of this band showed that the precursor undergoes a two-step imidazation process: (i) decomplexation of the amide linkage from residual solvent molecules and other intra- and intermolecular amic acid groups, and (ii) subsequent imide-ring formation. In addition, it was found that, among the vibrational peaks in the precursor and resultant polyimide, the imide CN stretch is the most accurate tool for determining the degree of <b>imidization.</b> Experiments in which the precursor was heated at 2. 0 degreesC; min(- 1) showed that it begins to imidize at 124 degreesC, and has completed <b>imidization</b> by 310 degreesC.

The precursor film displays only short-range order, but its polyimide film shows a crystalline structure based on an orthorhombic crystal lattice unit. When the precursor is heated at 2. 0 degreesC/min, it undergoes <b>imidization</b> over the temperature range 124 - 310 degreesC through a two-step process: (i) decomplexation of the amide linkage from residual solvent molecules and other intra- and intermolecular amic acid groups and (ii) imide-ring closure.

The hybrid material studied here consists of polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes that are covalently bridged by amic acid groups. During heat treatment, shrinkage of the materials occurs due to the removal of physically bound water, <b>imidization</b> of the amic acid groups, and silanol condensation. For five different bridging groups with different lengths and flexibilities, comparable mass reductions are observed. For the shorter bridging groups, the dimensional changes are hindered by the limited network mobility. Longer, more flexible bridging groups allow for much greater shrinkage.

In a first step, the intercalation of ammonolyzed SMA by guest displacement of intercalated dimethylsulfoxide has been proven. In a second step, the <b>imidization</b> of ammonolyzed SMA at 160 °C results in exfoliation of the kaolinite layers and deposition of poly(styrene-co-maleimide) or SMI nanoparticles onto the kaolinite surfaces.

Carbon dioxide {{is a major}} contaminant reducing the heating value of the gas and causing pipeline corrosion, so CO₂ level should be lowered to below 2 % to meet the United States pipeline specifications. Membrane separation technology can be advantageous over cryogenic distillation and amine adsorption in terms of cost and efficiency. The key hurdle to overcome in polymeric membrane separation technology is improvement in selectivity, productivity, and durability without introducing significant additional cost. The ultimate goal {{of this study is}} to analyze effects due to polymerization conditions and <b>imidization</b> methods on properties of 1, 3 -propanediol monoesterified crosslinkable polyimide (PDMC). Hillock, Omole, Ward, and Ma did work on PDMC synthesis; however, variability of polymer properties remains a challenge that must be overcome for industrial implementation of PDMC material. First, reaction temperature and reaction time of polymerization prior to <b>imidization</b> were considered as key conditions to affect molecular weight, crosslinkability and transport properties of polymer. Batches with controlled reaction temperature and time were prepared, and properties of each dense film were measured and optimized in terms of permeability, selectivity, and plasticization suppression. Second, <b>imidization</b> methods for PDMC were also studied. There are mainly two kinds of Imidization: chemical <b>Imidization</b> and thermal <b>Imidization.</b> Surprisingly, thermally imidized PDMC showed 70 % higher permeability than chemically imidized samples with minimal acrifice in selectivity. At high reaction temperature during the thermal <b>imidization,</b> transamidation can occur. It is believed that the transamidation led to more randomized sequence distribution in the thermally imidized samples. We thus hypothesize that the higher permeability of the thermally imidized PDMC results from greater uniformity of the sequence distribution, as compared to the chemically imidized sample that does not experience high temperature during <b>imidization.</b> XRD, DSC, DMA, and permeation instruments checked and supported this hypothesis. FTIR, TGA, and NMR ruled out the possibility of an alternate hypothesis related to side reaction. Finally, effects of aggressive feed conditions on both chemically imidized PDMC and thermally imidized PDMC dense film were examined. The aggressive feed conditions include high CO₂ partial pressure, operating temperatures, and exposure to high feed pressure. Testing aggressive feed conditions for dense film should be pursued before pursuing hollow fiber applications, to decouple effects on the basic material from those on the more complex asymmetric morphology. This study enables understanding of the disparity between various previous researchers’ selectivity and permeability values. The work shows clearly that polymerization conditions and <b>imidization</b> methods must be specified and controlled to achieve consistently desirable polymer properties. In addition, for batch scale-up and development to a hollow fiber, this fundamental study should enable production of high molecular weight PDMC with good fiber spinnability and defect-free structure.

In addition, the variations of the film refractive index and thickness with temperature and time were determined in detail from the time-resolved IR spectra and are fully interpreted in this paper by considering the <b>imidization</b> kinetics of the precursorclose 303...|$|E
40|$|In this work, two {{series of}} PDMS-modified poly(styrene-alt-maleic anhydride) s (PSMA) were {{prepared}} by the partial <b>imidization</b> of their anhydride groups with mono-functional, amine-terminated polydimethyl siloxanes (PDMS-NH 2) with two different molecular weights. Subsequently, surfactant-free artificial latexes were prepared and characterized and applied onto cotton fabric. The water contact angle values of the coated cotton fabric indicate the formation of hydrophobic surfaces, with static contact angles varying from 119 ° to 142 ° depending on the PDMS loading and PDMS molecular weight. Coatings of the prepared copolymers on cotton fabric are highly durable, as shown by washing studies with a standard soap solution. The properties of these water-based surfactant-free latexes can be tuned easily by changing {{the composition of the}} polymers, i. e. mol% of <b>imidization,</b> ammonolysis and cross-linking. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|The {{incorporation}} of specific metal ions into polyimides is described. Detailed studies have included various compounds of copper, lithium, and palladium as dopants. Addition {{of the metal}} during polymerization or after formation of the polyamic acid precedes the thermal <b>imidization</b> step. With many dianhydride-diamine-dopant combinations high quality variously colored films are produced. Many metal doped films exhibit (1) improved high temperature adhesive properties, (2) increased electrical conductivity, (3) excellent thermal stability, (4) improved acid/base resistance, (5) increased modulus in flexible films and (6) excellent high temperature tensile strength. X-ray photo-electron spectroscopic study of these films suggests {{that many of the}} additives undergo chemical modification during thermal <b>imidization.</b> Palladium dopants appear to be partially reduced to the metallic state, while lithium and copper dopants are probably converted to their oxides. Ion etching experiments with Auger electron spectroscopy monitoring are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Hybrid organic/inorganic hyper-cross-linked {{membranes}} {{based on}} imides covalently bonded with polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS) {{have recently been}} developed for gas-separation applications under high pressure and/or temperature conditions. Their molecular sieving capabilities {{have been shown to}} depend {{on the nature of the}} organic dianhydride precursor. In the present work, realistic molecular models of such polyPOSS-imide films based on the flexible 6 FDA dianhydride are compared to those based on the shorter and more rigid PMDA dianhydride. The models creation procedure closely mimicks the mixing, polycondensation and <b>imidization</b> steps of the experimental scheme. The resulting networks are found to be highly heterogeneous in terms of both the number of links (from zero to the maximum possible of eight per POSS cage with an average of four) and their structure (interPOSS, intraPOSS, single-links, double-links) because of the eight-equivalent-arms nature of the POSS precursor. For both dianhydride precursors, crosslinking with POSS and the subsequent <b>imidization</b> step decrease the density, create additional void-space and increase the solubility of the resulting membranes. However, when compared to PMDA, the added flexibility of the central 6 FDA bridge leads to a larger thermally-induced dilation of the networks and a larger volume loss per H 2 O over the <b>imidization</b> step. With their better ability to redensify and to adapt to the added constraints, the cage⋯cage distances and cage⋯(organic bridge) ⋯cage angles in the 6 FDA polyPOSS-imides span a larger range than in their PMDA counterparts. In addition, the stiffness of the PMDA moiety results in more unrelaxed free volume remaining trapped in the PMDA polyPOSS-imides upon <b>imidization,</b> and as such, to significantly more open structures with less favourable interactions. As expected from their enhanced flexibility, the thermomechanical properties of the 6 FDA networks are slightly lower than those based on PMDA. However, the better mechanical resistance of PMDA over 6 FDA does not really become significant before very large volume dilations...|$|E

The peak at 1637  cm− 1 due to νstr(–CONH) of PAA disappeared after <b>imidization</b> {{and some new}} peaks appeared in the polyimide which are as follows: (i) at 1782  cm− 1 for νasym(C=O), (ii) a very sharp and strong band at 1719  cm− 1 for νsym(C=O), overlapping with strong carboxylic acid band of νsym(C=O) at 1690  cm− 1 of PAA, (iii) peak at 3485  cm− 1 due to the (C=O imide) overtone band [25], (iv) peaks at 1382  cm− 1 and 3560  cm− 1 due to νstr(C–N) [26] etc. A broad peak appeared around 3640  cm− 1 {{may be attributed to}} the νstr(O–H) probably due to trapped moisture because polyimides have a tendency to absorb at least 2  % water of its weight [27]. Appearance of a weak peak at 492  cm− 1 was assigned to the vibrations of In–O bonds and characteristic of cubic In 2 O 3 phase [28].|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} paper, we {{describe}} the synthesis and characterization of a novel negative-type soluble photosensitive polyimide (PSPI). A group of new photosensitive polyimides has been prepared by condensation of dianhydrides bearing photoreactive ester groups and aromatic diamines in N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), followed by chemical <b>imidization</b> using acetic anhydride without acid acceptors such as pyridine or triethylamine. Thus, the starting monomer used in the synthesis of a commercial aromatic polyimide has been chemically modified with four different photosensitive groups (chlorine-free synthesis). All the intermediates {{as well as the}} resulting polymers have been characterized. The PSPI esters were found to be soluble in N-alkyl-substituted amides. Their irradiation with UV light induces cross-linking of the photoreactive ester groups. These systems change from being weakly to being heavily cross-linked during irradiation and do not swell during development. The remaining PSPI esters do not require thermal <b>imidization</b> because they are already imidized, and shrinkage is about 20 % due to volatilization of photoreactive group...|$|E

The effects of annealing on the membranes performance were investigated. Increasing temperature and duration during the thermal treatment accelerated the <b>imidization</b> of the poly(amic acid) membranes and converted their amorphous structures to semi-crystalline structures, deteriorating their performance. The addition of a cross-linking agent, trimesoyl chloride (TMC), during the interfacial polymerization improved the membrane's performance. The polyimide thin film composite, reverse osmosis membranes prepared from MPD, BTC and TMC showed significantly enhanced chlorine resistance due to the elimination of chlorine-sensitive sites by the replacement of amide linkage with imide linkage. close 3...|$|E
