40|$|Effects of <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> {{and frozen}} fuel cell startup on the {{membrane}} electrode assembly (MEA) were investigated for a proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). A single cell was started from a subzero temperature by applying <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage.</b> The voltages {{applied to the}} cell were 0. 8 and 1. 2 V. The fuel cell performance was measured with a polarization curve and by cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS), linear scan voltammetry (LSV) after each experiment. From the results, {{it was concluded that}} the catalyst activity, electrochemical active surface area (ECA) and the membrane were not damaged by the <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> if the voltage was below 0. 85 V. In contrast, a <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> improved cell performance slightly. If the <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage</b> was larger than 0. 85 V, the cell performance degraded. Another single cell with an active area of 128 cm(2) was started up at - 15 degrees C by applying <b>reverse</b> <b>voltage.</b> The cell performance and MEA physical characteristic were tested before and after the freeze startup. From the results, the cell performance decayed MEA delamination was observed and the pore size distribution of the MEA changed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
