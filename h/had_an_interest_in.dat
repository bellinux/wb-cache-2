5|$|According to Prime Minister Einar Gerhardsen, it took long {{to persuade}} Meisdalshagen to even take the post as Minister of Finance, {{and he was}} more {{interested}} in agro-economical questions than traditional planning of the economy. It was even said that Gerhardsen's Cabinet <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> luring Meisdalshagen away from the Parliament, where he had driven through significant increases in farmer's income, threatening the overall balance and planning of the state finances. In fact the income from farming, measured in the amount of money earned per decare, was doubled between the war's end in 1945 and 1950, when the Main Agreement for Agriculture, , was introduced. It regulated future price negotiations, and institutionalized the negotiating partners: the state {{on one side of the}} table, the Norwegian Agrarian Association and the Norwegian Farmers and Smallholders Union on the other.|$|E

He was introduced to audio engineer Charles Brungardt through production and songwriting team Jake and the Phatman, who had worked on Ray Ray. Brungardt interned at Blakeslee Recording Company, Saadiq's North Hollywood recording studio, and eventually became his principal sonic partner on projects. The two shared a fascination with historic recording techniques and equipment. They also studied the 2006 book Recording The Beatles together and <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the knowledge of recording gear by engineers and technicians for English rock band The Beatles.

At age 24, she decided to pursue a career in acting. In 2011, she moved to New York City and studied acting at the Susan Batson Studios where she met her manager Josh Taylor.

5|$|In 1075, three earls rebelled, {{for reasons}} unknown, and sought {{aid from the}} King of Denmark, Sweyn II Estridsson, who had a distant claim to the English throne.

Along with Bishop Wulfstan of Worcester, Abbot Æthelwig of Evesham, and Walter de Lacy, Urse {{prevented}} de Breteuil from crossing the River Severn. Urse's actions kept the rebels from seizing control of the Severn Valley and joining up with the other English rebels, Waltheof, the Earl of Northumbria, and Ralph de Gael, the Earl of Norfolk. Urse and the magnates fighting alongside him, {{in addition to their}} obvious desire to suppress rebellion, <b>had</b> <b>an</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> defeating de Breteuil, as he was the most powerful lord in the area. De Breteuil was caught, tried, and imprisoned for life, increasing the power of his rivals.|$|E
