In open sclerophyll forest, it grows alongside such trees as <b>white</b> <b>mahogany</b> (E. acmenoides), grey box (E. moluccana), forest red gum (E. tereticornis), and rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), while in swampy areas it is found with swamp mahogany (E. robusta) and paperbark species such as snow-in-summer (Melaleuca linariifolia), prickly paperbark (M. styphelioides) and swamp paperbark (M. ericifolia).|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{comparison}} of fatty acid profile between wild and farmed <b>Indian</b> <b>white</b> shrimps. According to the score-plot produced by the principle component analysis the wild <b>Indian</b> <b>white</b> shrimp showed a fatty acid composition clearly different from the farmed <b>Indian</b> <b>white</b> shrimp. In both groups, palmitic acid (16 : 0) and oleic acid (18 : 1 n- 9) were the main SFA and MUFA, respectively. Based on results, the wild shrimp contained a higher level (P < 0. 05) of n- 3 poly unsaturated fatty acids, whereas farmed shrimp contained a high level of n- 6 poly unsaturated fatty (P < 0. 05). Arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n- 6), eicosapentaenoic acid (20 : 5 n- 3) and docosahexaenoic acid (22 : 6 n- 3) were significantly higher in wild shrimps. The n- 3 /n- 6 fatty acids ratio was significantly higher in wild shrimps (P < 0. 05). The comparison demonstrated that the nutritional value of wild shrimps is better than farmed shrimp and fatty acid profile of commercial diets should be reformed in order to maintenance of farmed shrimps nutritional value...|$|R
