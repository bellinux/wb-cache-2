50|$|In 2010, Daimler {{introduced}} the Smart eBike, a power-electric hybrid bicycle featuring Gates Carbon <b>drive-belt</b> system. The eBike is emission-free {{and is designed}} for a clean, grease-free ride. Other notable eBike brands include Grace and Pi-Mobility.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} upright vacuum {{cleaners}} use a <b>drive-belt</b> {{powered by the}} suction motor to rotate the brush-roll. However, a more common design of dual motor upright is available. In these cleaners, the suction is provided via a large motor, while the brushroll {{is powered by a}} separate, smaller motor, which does not create any suction. The brush-roll motor can sometimes be switched off, so hard floors can be cleaned without the brush-roll scattering the dirt. It may also have an automatic cut-off feature which shuts the motor off if the brush-roll becomes jammed, protecting it from damage.|$|E
50|$|The DAF 46 was carpeted {{throughout}} {{and equipped}} with cloth covered reclining seats. It {{also had a}} redesigned gear lever and additional dash mounted warning lights. Out {{of sight of the}} driver was a de Dion rear axle, which DAF had fitted two years earlier to their more powerful model when replacing the 55 with the DAF 66: the car retained its defining variomatic transmission, but this was now coupled with a conventional differential which was said to improve noise levels and extend <b>drive-belt</b> life. Reports suggest that the DAF 46 had safer handling than its predecessor, but acceleration was nonetheless considerably slower, {{at a time when most}} European manufacturers were improving top speed and acceleration when they introduced model upgrades.|$|E
5000|$|The {{twin-cylinder}} {{class and}} overall race was initially led by Rem Fowler riding a Norton. On lap 1, Fowler completed {{the course in}} 23 minutes and 19 seconds, in second place was Billy Wells {{in a time of}} 23 minutes and 21 seconds and Charlie Collier in the single-cylinder class with a time of 23 minutes and 45 seconds. The overall lead fell away as Fowler suffered a number of problems with <b>drive-belts</b> and spark-plugs, and on lap 7 crashed at nearly 60 mph due to a burst tyre at the [...] "Devils Elbow" [...] on the Kirk Michael to Peel section of the course. Fowler nearly gave up, but was told by a spectator that he led the twin-cylinder class by 30 minutes from Wells and went on to win at an average race speed of 36.22 mph and set the fastest lap of the race at 42.91 mph.|$|R
50|$|The Maytag Toy Racer {{was a small}} 1-passenger {{automobile}} {{built by}} the Maytag Company between October 11, 1934 and December 1, 1941 and powered by Maytag Model 92 one-cylinder or, later, two-cylinder air-cooled Multi-Motor engines. Previously in 1932 the Winston Corporation of Joliet Illinois made a toy racer powered by the Maytag Multi-Motor. Many of these were sold to Maytag dealers who raced in small groups to advertise their brand. These Winston racers were sometimes also called Maytag Toy RacersEarly versions of the Maytag Toy Racer used a Model 92 Maytag Multi-motor for power and a cone clutch for power transmission, and later models used a double-purpose hand lever to adjust <b>drive-belt</b> friction and to apply braking action. Maytag Toy racers manufactured beginning in October 1937 used the Model 72, twin cylinder, Maytag Multi-motor.|$|E
