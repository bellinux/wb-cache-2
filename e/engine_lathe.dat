50|$|During 1946, {{the company}} was located at 105 South Townsend Street and they were hiring machine workers to operate their Brown and Turret Lathes, Bar and Chuck, <b>Engine</b> <b>Lathes,</b> Sharpe millers and Cincinnati millers.|$|R
50|$|Turrets can {{be added}} to non-turret <b>lathes</b> (bench <b>lathes,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>lathes,</b> toolroom lathes, etc.) by {{mounting}} them on the toolpost, tailstock, or both. Often these turrets are not as large as a turret lathe's, and they usually do not offer the sliding and stopping that a turret lathe's turret does; but they do offer the ability to index through successive tool settings.|$|R
50|$|A lathe is {{a machine}} tool used principally for shaping pieces of metal, wood, or other {{materials}} by causing the workpiece {{to be held}} and rotated by the lathe while a tool bit is advanced into the work causing the cutting action. Lathes {{can be divided into}} three types for easy identification: <b>engine</b> <b>lathe,</b> turret lathe, and special purpose lathes. Some smaller ones are bench mounted and semi-portable. The larger lathes are floor mounted and may require special transportation if they must be moved.Field and maintenance shops generally use a lathe that can be adapted to many operations and that is not too large to be moved from one work site to another. The <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> is ideally suited for this purpose. A trained operator can accomplish more machining jobs with the <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> than with any other machine tool. Turret lathes and special purpose lathes are usually used in production or job shops for mass production or specialized parts, while basic engine lathes are usually used for any type of lathe work.|$|E
50|$|In the {{hierarchy}} of manufacturing machines, the screw machine sits at the top when large product volumes are needed. An <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> sits at the bottom, taking {{the least amount of}} time to set up but the most amount of skilled labor and time to actually produce a part. A turret lathe has traditionally been one step above an <b>engine</b> <b>lathe,</b> needing greater set-up time but being able to produce a higher volume of product and usually requiring a lower-skilled operator once the set-up process is complete. Screw machines may require an extensive set-up, but once they are running, a single operator can monitor the operation of several machines.|$|E

5000|$|The {{earliest}} mechanically automated lathes were geometric lathes. These included Rose <b>engine</b> <b>lathes</b> and others. In industrial contexts {{during the}} Machine Age, the term [...] "automatic lathe" [...] referred to mechanical screw machines and chuckers (discussed below), {{of which a}} large variety of types, brands, and models were built.|$|R

2500|$|Today <b>engine</b> <b>lathes</b> and CNC lathes are the {{commonly}} used machines for single-point threading. On CNC machines, {{the process is}} quick and easy (relative to manual control) due to the machine's ability to constantly track {{the relationship of the}} tool position and spindle position (called [...] "spindle synchronization"). CNC software includes [...] "canned cycles", that is, preprogrammed subroutines, that obviate the manual programming of a single-point threading cycle. Parameters are entered (e.g., thread size, tool offset, length of thread), and the machine does the rest.|$|R

50|$|The South Bend Lathe Works was {{established}} in 1906 in South Bend, Indiana by identical twin brothers John J. O'Brien and Miles W. O'Brien. By 1930, the company was building 47% of the <b>engine</b> <b>lathes</b> sold {{each year in the}} United States. In a quarter century, South Bend Lathe Works had become the largest exclusive manufacturer of metalworking precision lathes in the world. In the 1920s through 1960s, South Bend lathes were found in countless machine shops and factories, and they were {{also one of the most}} commonly used brands in vocational schools.|$|R
5000|$|Work on the {{standardization}} of T-slots started in 1924 and a tentative standard {{was published in}} 1927. The first official American Standard for T-slots came in 1941. [...] B5 Technical Committee No. 11 was organized in New York on December 4, 1928, and B5 Technical Committee No. 4 on Spindle Noses was organized on December 5, 1928. These two committees worked in close cooperation {{with each other and}} with manufacturers and users of <b>engine</b> <b>lathes,</b> turret lathes and automatic lathes in developing standards for spindle noses and chucks.|$|R
50|$|The Kirloskar {{group of}} {{companies}} {{was one of the}} earliest industrial groups in the engineering industry in India. The group produces pumps, <b>engines,</b> compressors, <b>lathes</b> and electrical equipment like motors, transformers and generators (it is the worlds largest genset manufacturer). Laxmanrao Kirloskar established the group, after which his son S. L. Kirloskar became its head.|$|R
50|$|Mini-lathes and micro-lathes are {{miniature}} {{versions of}} a general-purpose center lathe (<b>engine</b> <b>lathe).</b> They typically have swings {{in the range of}} 3 to 7 in diameter (in other words, 1.5 to 3.5 in radius). They are small and affordable lathes for the home workshop or MRO shop. The same advantages and disadvantages apply to these machines as explained earlier regarding 3-in-1 machines.|$|E
5000|$|A rose <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> is a {{specialized}} kind of geometric lathe. The headstock rocks {{back and forth}} with a rocking motion or along the spindle axis in a pumping motion, controlled by a rubber moving against a rosette or cam-like pattern mounted on the spindle, while the lathe spindle rotates. Rose engine work can make flower patterns, as well as convoluted, symmetrical, multi-lobed geometric patterns. The patterns it produces are similar to that of a Spirograph, in metal. No other ornamental lathe can produce these [...] "rose" [...] patterns. The decoration produced by a rose <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> is called guilloche. It sometimes confused with [...] "jewel finishes" [...] or engine turning, a much cheaper process of making swirly marks in metal by a rotating abrasive peg or pad, which is repeatedly applied to the surface to make a pattern of overlapping circles. Jewel finishes used to be common on stereo faceplates and automobile interiors.|$|E
50|$|In horology, damaskeening is {{decorative}} patterning on a watch movement. The term damaskeening {{is used in}} America, {{while in}} Europe the terms used are Fausses Côtes, Côtes de Genève or Geneva Stripes. Such patterns are made from very fine scratches made by rose <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> using small disks, polishing wheels or ivory laps. These patterns look similar {{to the results of}} a spirograph or Guilloché engraving.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of the turret lathe around {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century was a key aspect of the advancement of manufacturing technology. Unlike bench <b>lathes,</b> <b>engine</b> <b>lathes,</b> and toolroom lathes, on which each tool change involved some amount of setup, and toolpath had to be carefully controlled by the operator, turret lathes allowed the multiple tool changes and toolpaths of one part-cutting cycle to be repeated with little time or effort. By taking the tool-changing and the toolpath control out of the hands of the operator and building it into the machine tool, it accomplished several feats: it made interchangeable parts easier, faster, and thus cheaper to produce; and it made their production possible by workers with little skill. As long as a few skilled engineers, toolmakers, and setup technicians made and equipped the machine correctly, just about any operator could be hired (inexpensively) to run it.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Bristol {{group of}} {{companies}} was {{the largest of the}} overseas subsidiaries. The group undertook aircraft handling and servicing at Dorval Airport, Montreal. Vancouver Airport was the base for Bristol Aero Engines (Western), Ltd., one of the Canadian company's four operating subsidiaries. Work at Vancouver included the overhaul of Pratt and Whitney and Wright engines for the R.C.A.F. and commercial operators. Bristol Aircraft (Western), Ltd (Stevenson Field, Winnipeg) was formerly MacDonald Brothers Aircraft, and was the largest of the subsidiaries and the group's only airframe plant. Bristol de Mexico, S.A. de CV. (Central Airport, Mexico City), overhauled piston engines for South American operators. Bristol de Mexico S.A. obtained a license to manufacture Alfred Herbert Ltd machine tools in 1963 and commenced assembling their centre lathes in 1963. They also commenced building their own design of small <b>engine</b> <b>lathes</b> for the Mexican Government to be installed in training schools throughout Mexico. Malcolm Roebuck was hired from Alfred Herbert Ltd to supervise this project.|$|R

5000|$|Guilloché (...) ,(or guilloche) is a {{decorative}} technique {{in which a}} very precise, intricate and repetitive pattern is mechanically engraved into an underlying material via engine turning, which uses a machine of the same name, also called a rose <b>engine</b> <b>lathe.</b> This mechanical technique improved on more time-consuming designs achieved by hand and allowed for greater delicacy, precision, and closeness of line, as well as greater speed.|$|E
50|$|For the {{machining}} of complex shapes, {{it is common}} to use form tools. This contrasts with the cutting that is performed on an <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> where the cutting tool is usually a single-point tool. A form tool has the form or contour of the final part but in reverse, so it cuts the material leaving the desired component shape. This contrasts to a single-point tool, which cuts on one point at a time and the shape of the component is dictated by the motion of the tool rather than its shape.|$|E
50|$|The terms center lathe, <b>engine</b> <b>lathe,</b> and {{bench lathe}} all {{refer to a}} basic type of lathe that may be {{considered}} the archetypical class of metalworking lathe most often used by the general machinist or machining hobbyist. The name bench lathe implies {{a version of this}} class small enough to be mounted on a workbench (but still full-featured, and larger than mini-lathes or micro-lathes). The construction of a center lathe is detailed above, but depending on the year of manufacture, size, price range or desired features, even these lathes can vary widely between models.|$|E

2500|$|Tilmanstone coal {{was also}} taken to Shepherdswell for the {{locomotives}} {{and for the}} steam <b>engine</b> running the <b>lathes,</b> etc. in the workshops. [...] Kent coal was not very suitable for steaming, tending to break up and form dust, and this may account for anecdotal evidence that the engines sometimes had difficulty maintaining steam pressure while on service.|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} 20th century, {{the town was}} a heavy-manufacturing center for vaults and safes, machine tools, cans for vegetables, paper, paper making machinery, locomotives, frogs and {{switches}} for railroads, steam engines, diesel engines, foundry products, printing presses, and automobile parts. During the two world wars, its factories manufactured war materiel, Liberty ship <b>engines,</b> and gun <b>lathes.</b> Manufacturers used coke to feed furnaces. Its by-product, gas, fueled street lights. The Great Miami River valley, in which Hamilton was located, had become an industrial giant.|$|R
50|$|A {{special-purpose}} lathe, the Rose <b>engine</b> <b>lathe,</b> is {{also used}} for ornamental turning, in particular for engine turning, typically in precious metals, for example to decorate pocket-watch cases. As well as {{a wide range of}} accessories, these lathes usually have complex dividing arrangements to allow the exact rotation of the mandrel. Cutting is usually carried out by rotating cutters, rather than directly by the rotation of the work itself. Because of the difficulty of polishing such work, the materials turned, such as wood or ivory, are usually quite soft, and the cutter has to be exceptionally sharp. The finest ornamental lathes are generally considered to be those made by Holtzapffel {{around the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|E
50|$|It {{has better}} thermal stability, higher {{resistance}} to crazing (when {{a network of}} very small cracks form) when exposed to solvents, wider thermoforming range than extruded acrylic. Cast acrylic has better ability to be reworked hot and it {{is known for its}} superior surface finish and optical properties. Also cast acrylic is more scratch resistant than extruded acrylic.Cast acrylic is also preferred over extruded in applications that require machining, such as turning on <b>Engine</b> <b>Lathe</b> or milling/drilling. Extruded acrylic, with far less thermal stability, tends to melt and clog cutting tools. Even with slow speeds and lots of coolant, extruded acrylic does not produce the surface finish and tight tolerances achievable with cast acrylic.|$|E
5000|$|In 1937 Roe, {{writing for}} the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, framed the {{importance}} of the Fay automatic lathe to the capabilities of machine tools by saying that, [...] "This machine does for the <b>engine</b> <b>lathe</b> what Spencer did for the old hand-operated turret lathe." [...] These machines took an entire class of turned work formerly requiring an operator to execute the series of movements necessary to shape a piece of metal (manual control) and allowed the same work to be done automatically. This step forward in automation lowered a manufacturer's unit expense per part by reducing labor costs. Today, numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools such as turning centers, turn-mills, and rotary transfer machines have largely supplanted cam-operated automatics.|$|E
60|$|Having {{but little}} to do, Gregory {{went into the}} Khalifa's arsenal. This {{building}} was full of war material of all kinds; including a perfectly appointed battery of Krupp guns, numbers of old cannon, modern machine-guns, rifles and pistols; mixed up with musical instruments, suits of chain armour, steel helmets, hundreds of battle flags, and thousands of native spears, swords, and shields. Besides these the collection comprised ivory, percussion caps, lead, copper, and bronze, looms, pianos, sewing machines, boilers, steam engines, agricultural implements, ostrich feathers, wooden and iron bedsteads, paints, India rubber, leather water bottles, clothes, three state coaches, and an American buggy. There were also a modern smithy, where gunpowder, shell, bullets, and cartridge cases were made and stored; and a well-appointed engineers' shop and foundry, with several steam <b>engines,</b> turning <b>lathes,</b> and other tools. The machinery had been brought from Gordon's arsenal at Khartoum, where the foreman had been employed; and the workmen were, for the most part, Greeks.|$|R
50|$|Beyond the {{platforms}} {{stand the}} locomotive shed, machine shop, paint and carpenters' shops in two rubble stone buildings {{built in the}} 1890s.

The locomotive shed is capable of holding up to 12 locomotives in addition to which the single road workshop can store up to five locomotives at any one time. This facility features overhead lifting gear which is capable of lifting locomotive boilers from the frames to carry out maintenance; there is also a static beam <b>engine</b> and wheel <b>lathes</b> located in this shed, which also houses the blacksmith and plant room to the rear, the former being converted from a stores area in 2001.|$|R
5000|$|By 1829 Amos Williams {{combined}} [...] "Whites Contrivance", [...] "Brothers In Partnership", and [...] "Williams Discovery" [...] {{to expand}} the mill town to 980 acres. The parcel was named [...] "Conclusion", which was joined with Charles Alexander Warfield's [...] "Wincopin Neck" [...] upstream to form a dam on the Little Patuxent River, which runs adjacent to the mill property. Money was loaned to by additional land from Mrs. Dorsey. Amos managed the company at the time from an office in Baltimore on Calvert street just West of Lexington. In 1831, Mr. Hack, a machinist at the mill developed a machine for reeling and twisting silk that was taken to Washington for a patent The same year, a case of Small Pox struck at least 30 persons. In October 1832, Amos Williams moved to the mill site with a salary of $300 a year to entertain business clients. By this time the cotton mill site had a grist mill, saw mill, machine shop, foundry, blacksmith shop, wheelwright shop, brick-making facility, farm, rental houses and company store. That year, Joseph Bancroft used parts manufactured by the mill to establish a mill in Rockdale, Pennsylvania. In 1835 the post office moved from Waterloo to Savage Factory. [...] In 1837, a furnace purchased for $8,000 operated on the mill property but managed separately by Amos A Williams, Cumberland Dugan Williams and Thomas Landsdale. After a drought in June 1836, the company decided to operate a lower cost wagon path to connect to the new B&O railroad and {{a portion of the}} Thomas Snowden's property on the Hammond Branch was added to divert water. The same year the company provided slabbing <b>engines,</b> turning <b>lathes</b> and gear cutters to the Harpers Ferry Armory, location John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry. From 1836 to 1843, The Savage Manufacturing Company started its own currency with scrip amounts of 25 cents, 50 cents and one dollar. On June 6, 1839 Amos A. Williams resigned due to a sickness that would last until 1844, leaving control of the company to his brother Cumberland Dugan Williams. During his sickness, the company developed [...] "Baldwin's Cotton, Hay and Tobacco press which was manufactured onsite for sales in the Southern states and the Rechm planing machine. Additional land was purchased by the mill on November 28, 1843, for $4,755 that included property from Mr. Lambert and William Worthington for firewood and ore for the furnace operations. In 1846, The Savage Manufacturing Company sold existing or manufactured looms and steam power engines for the Powhatan Company in Baltimore. In 1848, Amos A. Williams entered ligation against the Savage Manufacturing Company and his brothers George, Cumberland and Nathanial claiming they tried to force him into poverty from indebtedness during his illness.|$|R
