25|$|Andrew Harding has {{posited that}} in Singapore it is Parliament, {{rather than the}} Constitution, which is supreme.

As Parliament only <b>got</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> properly enacting a constitution on 22 December 1965, there was a hiatus between 9 August 1965 and that date, such that the legitimacy of laws passed between those dates can be questioned. Thus, the Grundnorm or basic norm of Singapore's legal system is Parliament rather than the Constitution.|$|E

Following the Civil War, it looked like cricket might expand beyond its strongholds at Haverford College and the University of Pennsylvania. In 1881 delegates from several collegiate cricket clubs, including Harvard University, Columbia University, Princeton University, University of Pennsylvania and Trinity College, joined together to form the Intercollegiate Cricket Association. The group was plagued by troubles and withdrawals. Haverford College and Cornell University later joined the ICA, but Yale University and Johns Hopkins University never <b>got</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> fielding teams. The ICA lasted until 1924 when it crowned its last champion. These collegiate clubs generally drew their talent from pools at secondary schools which also fielded team and played in interscholastic competitions in this period.|$|E

5000|$|The {{impact of}} the Dresden timpani on composers {{could be seen in}} Giuseppe Verdi opera Otello (1887). The timpani part in Act 1 would not be {{possible}} to play without the use of at least three pedal timpani. Verdi required the timpanist to quickly change the pitch of the drums while also sustaining a roll, demonstrating the composer's understanding of how the pedal timpani worked. It would not be possible for the timpanist to play a sustained note and simultaneously change the pitch of another drum without using a set of pedal timpani.

500|$|Although Smith {{has never}} {{been one of the}} most commercially {{successful}} or career-driven artists, she is one of country music's most celebrated and respected. Music critics, fans, and counterparts alike have considered Smith to be one of the best and most underrated female vocalists in country music history. Music critics have often compared Smith's vocals to that of country legend Patsy Cline, due to her emotional delivery and her strong use of diction and phrasing. In his review of Smith's 1996 compilation The Essential Connie Smith, Jurek explained why Smith's vocals are usually compared to Cline's, [...] "Connie Smith is perhaps the only female singer in the history of country music who can truly claim to be the heiress to Patsy Cline's throne. It's not that there aren't many amazing vocalists in the field, and plenty of legends among them. But in terms of the pure gift of interpretation of taking virtually any song and making it a country song of class and distinction, Smith is it." [...] Many artists in the country music industry have cited Smith as a significant musical influence or one of their favorite musical artists. Chely Wright said that she spent most of her childhood listening to records by Smith. George Jones cited Smith as his favorite female singer in his 1995 autobiography. Elvis Presley had many of Smith's albums in his record collection at his Graceland home and intended on recording Smith's version of [...] "The Wonders You Perform", but never <b>got</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> doing so.

500|$|Dylan's two {{previous}} albums, The Times They Are A-Changin' and Another Side of Bob Dylan both {{ended with a}} farewell song, [...] "Restless Farewell" [...] and [...] "It Ain't Me, Babe" [...] respectively.

Much speculation has surrounded who or what the [...] "Baby Blue" [...] to whom Dylan is singing farewell is. Although Dylan himself has remained mute on the subject, Dylan scholars {{believe that it is}} probably an amalgam of personalities within Dylan's social orbit. One person who has been regarded as the subject of the song is folk singer Joan Baez. Dylan and Baez were still in a relationship and were planning to tour together, but Dylan had been growing as an artist and as a person and may have already been planning to leave the relationship. Another possibility is a singer-songwriter named David Blue. A friend or acquaintance of Dylan's from his days in New York's Greenwich Village, Blue is pictured on the cover of Dylan and the Band's The Basement Tapes album wearing a trench coat. Yet another possibility is Dylan's one-time friend, folk singer Paul Clayton. Although Clayton had been Dylan's friend throughout 1964, and had accompanied Dylan on the road trip across the United States on which [...] "Chimes of Freedom" [...] and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] were written, by 1965 he may have become more devoted to Dylan than Dylan was comfortable with, and Clayton's use of amphetamines may have made him difficult to be around. However, author Paul Williams, in his book Performing Artist: Book One 1960–1973, counters that [...] "Dylan may have been thinking of a particular person as he wrote it, but not necessarily", adding that the song has such a natural, flowing structure to it, that it could [...] "easily have finished writing itself before Dylan <b>got</b> <b>around</b> <b>to</b> thinking about who 'Baby Blue' was." ...|$|E
