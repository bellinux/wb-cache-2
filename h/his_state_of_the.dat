5|$|Freedom from Fear is {{the last}} of the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings produced by the American artist Norman Rockwell. The series was based on the four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union Address on 23 January 2007, President Bush {{announced}} plans to deploy more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq in {{what became known as}} the Surge. Four thousand were specifically earmarked for Anbar, which Bush acknowledged had become both an AQI haven and a center of resistance against AQI. Instead of deploying new units, the Marine Corps chose to extend the deployments of several units already in Anbar: 1st Battalion 6th Marines, 3rd Battalion 4th Marines, and the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU). The 15th MEU would later be replaced by the 13th MEU as the last surge unit.|$|E
5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. Environmental policy {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National Environmental Policy Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

25|$|Jefferson {{was not an}} {{outstanding}} orator and preferred to communicate through writing or remain silent if possible. Instead of delivering <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union addresses himself, Jefferson wrote the annual messages and sent a representative to read them aloud in Congress. This started a tradition which continued until 1913, when President Woodrow Wilson (1913–1921) chose to deliver his own State of the Union address.|$|E
25|$|In January 2015 President Obama {{announced}} the NIH-led Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI) in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address. Through advances in research, technology, {{and policies that}} empower patients, PMI will enable {{a new era of}} precision medicine long envisioned by Collins and many others in which researchers, providers, and patients work together to develop more individualized care. In fiscal year 2016, the first funding for the initiative was awarded, with $130 million allocated to NIH to build a national, large-scale research participant group, called a cohort, and $70 million allocated to NIH's National Cancer Institute as part of PMI for Oncology. The PMI Cohort Program will seek to extend precision medicine to all diseases by building a national research cohort of 1 million or more U.S. participants. In January 2016, in <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address, President Obama called for a new initiative, to be led by Vice President Joe Biden, to galvanize the nation's research efforts against cancer. Fueled by an additional $680 million in the proposed fiscal year 2017 budget for NIH, the National Cancer Moonshot Initiative will aim to accelerate progress toward the next generation of interventions to reduce cancer incidence and improve patient outcomes.|$|E
25|$|In <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nation Address (SONA), President Benigno Aquino III bared the {{anomalies}} {{during the}} Presidency of Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo {{such as a}} budget deficit {{in the first half}} of the year, a depleted calamity fund that mostly went to Pampanga, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo's home province, corruption at the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System, Department of Public Works and Highways, National Power Corporation, Metro Rail Transit Corporation and the National Food Authority. Aquino announced steps to weed out tax evaders, and asked the Commission on Appointments to be easy on his Cabinet.|$|E

25|$|As governor, he {{also argued}} for limits on {{oil and gas}} {{drilling}} {{in order to protect}} the environment. In <b>his</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth address in January 2005, Romney said, “I'm concerned about the preservation of our natural resources. I will file legislation to protect our oceans from off shore drilling and commercial development. The oceans should not be up for grabs like some Wild West land rush.” He signed into law a bill to protect against oil spills and to increase penalties for polluters.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 {{state of}} the union address at the Parliament, Gilani spoke highly of culture, stating the {{historical}} cultural facts and values of cultural legacy of the country. <b>His</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> union address came in response to American secret raid that killed Osama bin Laden in May 2011. Gillani also participated and celebrated the 60th anniversary of the bilateral relations between Pakistan and China. During the state visit of Wen Jiabao in 2010, Gillani and Wen proceeded to sign the cultural relations agreements after inaugurating the Pakistan-China Friendship Centre, a centre of excellence of promoting the cultural relations of China and Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|According to the Constitution, the President Elect {{must take}} the Oath of Office on December 1, before {{a joint session of}} Congress; the Constitution also states that the presidential term begins on December 1. Members of Congress {{belonging}} to the parties in the Coalition had threatened to disrupt the ceremony, with actions similar to those that prevented Vicente Fox from delivering <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union address on September 1. According to the Constitution, if the elected president does not take the Oath of Office on 1 December before a joint session, the presidency is declared vacant and an interim president must be named and new elections called.|$|E

25|$|Hughes {{took office}} on January 2, 2001, with {{priorities}} {{to increase the}} size of the Hillsboro Police Department and improve transportation. The next year he called for more land for the city to accommodate growth and in hopes of adding a university to the area during <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> City address. Later that year he and other county leaders expressed dismay at Metro, the regional government, concerning the purchase of open spaces in the county using bond money approved by regional voters. Hughes complained that the county and city were not receiving as much land as they should based on the tax amounts. On May 29, 2003, he suffered a mild heart attack and had minor heart surgery at Providence St. Vincent Medical Center to undergo angioplasty and install a stent.|$|E
25|$|The Philippines {{then was}} {{experiencing}} widespread blackouts due to huge demand for electricity and antiquity of power plants, the abolishment of the Department of Energy and discontinuation of the Bataan Nuclear Power Plant during the Aquino administration. During <b>his</b> <b>State</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nation address on July 27, 1992, he {{requested that the}} Congress enact {{a law that would}} create an Energy Department that would plan and manage the Philippines' energy demands. Congress not only created an Energy Department but gave him special emergency powers to resolve the power crisis. Using the powers given to him, Ramos issued licenses to independent power producers (IPP) to construct power plants within 24 months. Ramos issued supply contracts that guaranteed the government would buy whatever power the IPPs produced under the contract in U.S. dollars to entice investments in power plants. This became a problem during the East Asian Financial Crisis when the demand for electricity contracted and the Philippine peso lost half of its value.|$|E
