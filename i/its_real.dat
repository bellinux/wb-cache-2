5|$|Abnormalities in the ARH gene, {{also known}} as LDLRAP1, were first {{reported}} in a family in 1973. In contrast to the other causes, two abnormal copies of the gene are required for FH to develop (autosomal recessive). The mutations in the protein tend to cause {{the production of a}} shortened protein. <b>Its</b> <b>real</b> function is unclear, but it seems {{to play a role in}} the relation between the LDL receptor and clathrin-coated pits. People with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia tend to have more severe disease than LDLR-heterozygotes but less severe than LDLR-homozygotes.|$|E
5|$|From {{its initial}} origins in Eastern Sicily, {{especially}} in Catania, the movement got <b>its</b> <b>real</b> impetus {{with the establishment}} of the Fascio of Palermo on June 29, 1892. The Leagues rapidly radiated over all Sicily. In the spring of 1893 the leaders of the movement decided to carry their propaganda to the peasants and miners of the countryside. Between March and October the number of fasci grew from 35 to 162 with more than 200,000 members.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this paper is to show how the problem of finding roots (or zeros) of the monic quaternionic {{quadratic}} polynomials (MQQP) can be solved by <b>its</b> equivalent <b>real</b> quadratic form. The real quadratic form matrices, firstly defined in this paper, are used to form a simple equivalent real quadratic form of MQQP. Some necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of roots of MQQP are also presented. The main idea of the practical method proposed in this work can be summarized in two steps: translating MQQP into <b>its</b> equivalent <b>real</b> quadratic form, and giving directly the quaternionic roots of MQQP by solving <b>its</b> equivalent <b>real</b> quadratic form...|$|R
5|$|By 1982, the Old Strathcona Foundation was {{confident}} {{enough in the}} theatre’s prospects to purchase the building outright from Towne Cinema. By this time, the asking price for the building had dropped to $425,000, which {{was estimated to be}} $8000 below <b>its</b> <b>real</b> market value. The Foundation began to make major upgrades and repairs to the interior of the building. A fundraising drive in 1987 allowed 422 modern sized plush seats to be installed, lowering the theatre’s original seating capacity by almost 240. In 1989, a soundproofed cry room was installed with an independent sound system, allowing patrons with small children to come to films without worry.|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust <b>its</b> <b>real</b> prices in response to a changing economic environment. For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E
5|$|DOS (Disk Operating System) was the {{operating}} system that brought the company <b>its</b> <b>real</b> success. IBM first approached Microsoft about its upcoming IBM Personal Computer (IBM PC) in July 1980. On August 12, 1981, after negotiations with Digital Research failed, IBM awarded a contract to Microsoft to provide {{a version of the}} CP/M operating system, which was set {{to be used in the}} IBM PC. For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called 86-DOS from Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products for less than US$100,000, which IBM renamed to IBM PC DOS. Microsoft did not have an operating system when they closed the deal with IBM and IBM had not done their homework. Due to potential copyright infringement problems with CP/M, IBM marketed both CP/M and PC DOS for US$240 and US$40, respectively, with PC DOS eventually becoming the standard because of its lower price. 35 of the company's 100 employees worked on the IBM project for more than a year. When the IBM PC debuted, Microsoft was the only company that offered operating system, programming language, and application software for the new computer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper first {{studies the}} real estate prices and and its effecting factors, and point out the {{construction}} of urban rail transit effects large on <b>its</b> surrounding <b>real</b> estate prices. Then, the paper clarifies the theoretical basis of its effects, and finally analyzes mechanism that construction of rail transit can make <b>its</b> surrounding <b>real</b> estate value-added. The urban rail transit construction can improve surrounding property accessibility, the residents travel convenient, increasing the intense of land development, changing nature of land use, adjusting industrial layout, accelerating expanded urbanized areas, raising employment opportunities, promoting socio-economic prosperity and development. It provides reference for the reasonable allocation of late-stage value-added benefits, and people can get a comprehensive and systematic understanding {{of the impact of}} urban rail transit construction and <b>its</b> surrounding <b>real</b> estate prices...|$|R
