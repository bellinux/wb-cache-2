40|$|Purpose: In this work, tension, <b>impact,</b> <b>bend</b> {{and fatigue}} tests were {{conducted}} in an AM 60 magnesium alloy. The effects of environmental temperature and loading rates on impact and tension behavior of the alloy were also investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The {{tests were conducted}} using an Instron universal testing machine. The loading speed was changed from 1 mm/min to 300 mm/min {{to gain a better}} understanding of the effect of strain rate. To understand the failure behavior of this alloy at different environmental temperatures, Charpy impact test was conducted in a range of temperatures (- 40 ~ 35 °C). Plane strain fracture toughness (KIC) was evaluated using compact tension (CT) specimen. To gain a better understanding of the failure mechanisms, all fracture surfaces were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, fatigue behavior of this alloy was estimated using tension test under tension-tension condition at 30 Hz. The stress amplitude was selected in the range of 20 ~ 50 MPa to obtain the S-N curve. Findings: The tensile test indicated that the mechanical properties were not sensitive to the strain rates applied (3. 3 x 10 - 4 ~ 0. 1) and the plastic deformation was dominated by twining mediated slip. The impact energy is not sensitive to the environmental temperature. The plane strain fracture toughness and fatigue limit were evaluated and the average values were 7. 6 MPa. m 1 / 2 and 25 MPa, respectively. Practical implications: Tested materials AM 60 Mg alloy can be applied among others in automotive industry aerospace, communication and computer industry. Originality/value: Many investigations have been conducted to develop new Mg alloys with improved stiffness and ductility. On the other hand, relatively less attention has been paid to the failure mechanisms of Mg alloys, such as brittle fracture and fatigue, subjected to different environmental or loading conditions.

40|$|Fibre {{reinforced}} polymers (FRP) {{are finding}} increasing use in structures subjected to high rate loading such as blast or impact. Proper design of such structures requires thorough characterisation {{of the material}} behaviour over a range of loading rates from quasi-static to impact. This thesis investigated the quasi-static and impact response of Glass Fibre Polypropylene (GFPP) in compression, bending and delamination. The bending and delamination response of Fibre Metal Laminates (FMLs) based on GFPP and aluminium was also investigated at quasi-static and impact rates. High strain rate (5 x 10 ^ 2 to 10 ^ 3 /s) compression tests were conducted on GFPP using a compressive Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) and a Direct Impact Hopkinson Pressure Bar (DIHPB), in the through-thickness and in-plane directions. In both loading directions, the peak stress of GFPP increased linearly with the logarithm of strain rate. For in-plane loading, the failure modes were dominated by localised fibre buckling and kink bands, leading to delamination. The through thickness loading produced macroscopic shear and spreading failure modes. However, both of these failure modes are linked to in-ply fibre failures, due to through thickness compression causing transverse tensile strain. Previous studies of similar materials have not explicitly stated the link between through thickness compression and fibre failure associated with transverse tensile strain. A novel test rig was developed for Three Point <b>bend</b> testing at <b>impact</b> rates. The specimen was supported at the outer points on a rigid impacter and accelerated towards a single output Hopkinson Pressure Bar (HPB), which impacted the specimen at its midspan. Previous <b>impact</b> <b>bend</b> test rigs based on HPBs were limited to testing specimens with deflections to failure up to approximately 1 mm, whereas the rig implemented herein measured deflections up to approximately 10 mm. This configuration permits the output HPB to be chosen purely on {{the magnitude of the}} expected impact force, which resulted in superior force resolution to configurations used in other studies. The HPB <b>Impact</b> <b>Bend</b> rig was used to test GFPP and aluminium-GFPP FML specimens, at impact velocities ranging from 5 to 12 m/s. The flexural strength of GFPP increased with strain rate, while the flexural response of the FML specimens was relatively insensitive to strain rate. v Several candidate delamination test geometries were investigated at quasi-static displacement rates (1 mm/min), and the Single Leg Bend (SLB) test was identified as suitable for adaptation to higher rate testing. Single Leg Bend delamination tests of both GFPP and FML specimens were performed using the HPB <b>Impact</b> <b>Bend</b> rig, at <b>impact</b> velocities of 6 to 8 m=s. The shape of the force displacement response for the high rate testswas markedly different from the quasi-static tests, for both the GFPP and FML specimens. Finite element (FE) simulation of the quasi-static and impact rate SLB tests on GFPP indicated that the difference was probably due to the interaction of flexural vibrations and stress waves in the specimen and the impacter cross member. The experimental results and FE analysis suggest that the delamination fracture toughness of GFPP decreases slightly as strain rate increases. High rate delamination tests on FML specimens resulted in unstable crack growth...|$|R

40|$|Specimens {{of birch}} sapwood were decayed {{according}} to the soil jar method. Twelve different fungi commonly found in birch wood were used as test organisms. Every week after the inoculation, the moisture content, the weight loss and the <b>impact</b> <b>bending</b> strength were investigated. Samples with the same incubation time were ground up, and their solubility in 1 % NaOH was calculated. During the course of decay, the moisture content increased more rapidly in samples decayed by brown rot fungi than in samples decayed by white rot fungi. After an incubation time of seven days when, in many cases, the weight loss was negligible, there was already a substantial loss in strength. For high weight losses, the samples decayed by brown rot fungi had lost more of their strength than those decayed by white rot fungi. For low weight losses, however, {{there seemed to be}} little difference in the reduction in strength between samples decayed by white rot fungi and samples decayed by brown rot fungi. The alkali solubility of the samples decayed by brown rot fungi increased steeply during the course of decay, unlike that of the samples decayed by white rot fungi, the solubility of which increased only slightly. The possible cause of the reduction in <b>impact</b> <b>bending</b> strength resulting from fungal attack on wood is discussed.

It brings a great deal of uncertainty and risk factors for pipeline pigging operations. By analysis on dynamic of pig pigging and the <b>impact</b> over <b>bending,</b> this paper established the finite element model, simulated pigging process on the condition that the operating parameters of the pipeline pigging operations were given, analyzed the relationship among pipeline pressure, foam pigging speed and pipe stress, then obtained the security of pipeline pigging operations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{contains}} results {{pertaining to}} investigation of mechanical properties of P 18 (18 % W) high-speed steel subjected to strengthening thermo-cycling heat treatment (STCHT). Optimization of temperature–time {{parameters of the}} STCHT process has been executed for <b>impact</b> strength, <b>bending</b> strength and surface hardness of the Р 18 steel after thermo-cycling treatment. STCHT – process parameters – properties diagrams have been plotted using mathematical models. Treatment with optimum regime permits to increase wear resistance of a cutting tool made of Р 18 steel by 1. 5 to 6. 3 -fold in comparison with a conventionally treated tool. </p...|$|R
