2500|$|Some of China's most {{important}} literature comes from Chengdu: Chengdu has {{been home to}} literary giants, such as Sima Xiangru and Yang Xiong, two masters of Hanfu, a mixture of descriptive prose and verse during the Han dynasty; Li Bai and Su Shi, the most eminent poets of the Tang and Song dynasties respectively; Yang Shen'an, a famous scholar of the Ming dynasty; and Guo Moruo and Ba Jin, two well-known modern writers. Chang Qu, a historian of Chengdu during the Jin dynasty, compiled the earliest local historical records, the Record of Hua Yang State. Zhao Chongzuo, a poet in Chengdu during the Later Shu Kingdom, edited Among the Flowers, the first anthology of Ci in China's history. Meng Chang, the king of Later Shu, wrote the first couplet for the Spring Festival, which says, [...] "A <b>harvest</b> <b>year</b> accepts celebrations, good festivals foreshadow long springs." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German wine {{industry}} consists of many small vineyard owners. The 1999 viticultural survey counted 68 598 vineyard owners, down from 76 683 in Western Germany in 1989/90, {{for an average}} size of 1.5 ha. Most of the 40 625 operators of less than 0.5 ha should likely be classified as hobby winemakers. Many smaller vineyard owners do not pursue viticulture as a full-time occupation, {{but rather as a}} supplement to other agriculture or to hospitality. It is not uncommon for a visitor to a German wine region to find that a small family-owned Gasthaus has its own wine. Smaller grape-growers who do not wish to, or are unable to, commercialise their own wine have several options available: sell the grapes (either on the market each <b>harvest</b> <b>year,</b> or on long-term contract with larger wineries looking to supplement their own production), deliver the grapes to a wine-making cooperative (called Winzergenossenschaft in Germany), or sell the wine in bulk to winemaking firms that use them in [...] "bulk brands" [...] or as a base wine for Sekt. Those who own vineyards in truly good locations also have the option of renting them out to larger producers to operate.|$|E

40|$|The {{variation}} in the seed coat colour of adzuki beans among varieties, <b>harvest</b> <b>years</b> and growing locations, using a two-dimensional colour mapping technique was investigated. It {{was found that the}} differences of the seed coat colour among varieties contributed to the variation of chroma (C*) values, while the differences of the seed coat colour among <b>harvest</b> <b>years</b> were associated with lightness (L*) values. The L* values for the seed coat colour increased when the temperature during the maturing period of adzuki beans was low, and decreased when the temperature was high. The difference in the seed coat colour among the samples from different growing locations was much larger in the L* values than the C* values for samples of the same variety. The seed coat colours of adzuki beans harvested in Hokkaido and China had significantly different C* values, and were easily discriminated by the colour mapping method.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} the {{application}} of different organic and conventional fertilisers on some flavour quality attributes (aroma volatiles, sugars and organic acids) of cv. Golden Delicious apples were investigated by an experimental field trial in two <b>harvest</b> <b>years</b> (2010 and 2012). Through a balanced randomised block design, five organic fertilisation treatments (three different fertilisers at the same nitrogen dose, increase and fractionation of dose {{for one of the}} fertiliser) were compared to each other, to a conventional treatment based on a mineral fertiliser and to a non-fertilised control. Fertilisation treatments significantly affected the level in fruits of several flavour related compounds, such as some aroma volatiles, sugars and organic acids, but few of these responses were consistent across the two <b>harvest</b> <b>years</b> and of remarkable size. Even when treatments gave place to marked differences in the soil mineral nitrogen level, this reflected in a limited impact on flavour related compounds in the fruit, the strongest effect being a 45...|$|R

Descriptive analysis with a trained panel (n = 11 – 14) comprised 17 attributes rated from 0 (‘not at all’) to 10 (‘very’) : four appearance (green, red, area of red colour, skin waxiness), three odour (intense, grassy, fruity), five  texture (hard, crispy, mealy, juicy, tough peel), and five flavour (intense, sour, sweet, astringent, diverse) attributes. Ratedintensities differed between the <b>harvest</b> <b>years</b> but their magnitude {{and direction of}} change varied according to the cultivar. Odour and flavour ratings tended to be higher in 2009 than in 2010 and 2011. The summer 2009 was fairly normal, while summer 2010 was hot and dry, and summer 2011   hot and humid.
