40|$|The heat of {{combustion}} of {{an aircraft}} or spacecraft's fuel can under certain conditions evaporate existing clouds (if not too dense) and yield a distrail or <b>dissipation</b> <b>trail.</b> Narrow dis-trails, the opposite of contrails, are often viewed (3) by ground based observers. Contrails, exhaust trails, ship trails, etc. have been seen on weather satellite imagery most vividly in clear skies (4, 5, 6). Distrails, on the other hand, have probably been seen on space-craft imagery which have not been publ ished. Imagery of the fallstreaks phenomena (3),,ice particles falling from a cloud. are also scarce...|$|E
40|$|Two {{cases of}} distrails (aircraft <b>dissipation</b> <b>trails)</b> with {{associated}} fall streak clouds {{were analyzed using}} multispectral geostationary satellite data. One distrail was observed on 23 July 2000 in a single cloud layer over southeastern Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay. Another set of trails developed on 6 January 2000 {{at the top of}} multilayer clouds off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina. The distrails on both days formed in optically thin, midlevel stratified clouds with cloud-top heights between 7. 6 and 9. 1 km. The distrail features remained intact and easily visible from satellite images for 1 - 2 h in spite of winds near 50 km at cloud level. The width of the distrails spread as far as 20 km within 90 min or less. Differences between the optical properties of the clouds surrounding the trails and those of the fall streak particles inside the distrails allowed for easy identification of the fall streak clouds in either the 3. 9 -micrometer brightness temperature imagery, or the 10. 7 -micrometer - 12. 0 -micrometer brightness temperature difference. Although the three-channel infrared retrieval was better at retrieving cloud properties in the multilayer cloud case, two independent remote sensing retrievals of both distrail cases showed that the fall streaks had larger particle sizes than the clouds outside of the trails...|$|R
