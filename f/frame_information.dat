40|$|Consumers respond {{more favorably}} to {{positively}} <b>framed</b> attribute <b>information</b> than to negatively <b>framed</b> attribute <b>information,</b> {{a finding that}} {{has been attributed to}} the affective associations evoked by each frame (Levin, Schneider, and Gaeth 1998). We contend that framing effects also depend on the range and level of reference values used to evaluate attribute information. When the range of reference values is narrower for a positive frame than a negative frame, attribute values above expected performance levels favor the positively <b>framed</b> <b>information</b> and attribute values below expected performance levels favor the negatively <b>framed</b> <b>information.</b> When the range of reference values is wider for a positive frame than a negative frame, the opposite pattern emerges. Experience with a frame is one factor that reduces the range of reference values recruited to judge attribute information...|$|R
50|$|After the PHY-layer has {{established}} a link, the link layer is responsible for transmission and reception of <b>Frame</b> <b>Information</b> Structures (FISs) over the SATA link. FISs are packets containing control information or payload data. Each packet contains a header (identifying its type), and payload whose contents are dependent on the type. The link layer also manages flow control over the link.|$|E

5000|$|A {{call stack}} is {{composed}} of stack frames (also called activation records or activation frames). These are machine dependent and ABI-dependent data structures containing subroutine state information. This data is {{sometimes referred to as}} CFI (Call <b>Frame</b> <b>Information).</b> [...] Each stack frame corresponds to a call to a subroutine which has not yet terminated with a return. For example, if a subroutine named [...] is currently running, having been called by a subroutine , the top part of the call stack might be laid out like in the picture on the right.|$|E

The description is contained in the trailer <b>Frame</b> <b>Information</b> (FI), which must include as many subfields as the number of slots in the frame, in order to announce the state of each slot. This is meant to discover hidden terminals. To achieve a higher compliance to IEEE 802.11p and regardless of a precise application of ISO/OSI paradigm, FI can be moved inside upper layers, without any major impacts on the overall function.|$|E

50|$|The RS Frame is then {{partitioned}} {{into several}} segments {{of different sizes}} and assigned to specified regions. The M/H data in these regions are protected by an SCCC (Series Concatenated Convolutional Code), incorporating a code rate of 1/2 or 1/4, and is specific to each region in a group. A 1/4 rate PCCC (Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code) is also employed as an inner code for the M/H signaling channel, which includes FIC (Fast Information Channel) and TPC (Transmission Parameter Channel). The TPC carries various FEC modes and M/H <b>Frame</b> <b>information.</b> Once the TPC is extracted, the receiver then knows the code rates being employed and can decode each region at its specified rate.|$|E
5000|$|In a Cathode-ray tube (CRT) system, an {{electron}} beam is projected at a phosphor-coated envelope, producing {{a spot of}} light {{the size of a}} single pixel. This beam is then scanned across a film frame from left to right, capturing the [...] "vertical" [...] <b>frame</b> <b>information.</b> Horizontal scanning of the frame is then accomplished as the film moves past the CRT's beam. Once this photon beam passes through the film frame, it encounters a series of dichroic mirrors which separate the image into its primary red, green and blue components. From there, each individual beam is reflected onto a photomultiplier tube (PMT) where the photons are converted into {{an electron}}ic signal to be recorded to tape.|$|E
5000|$|The Rewriteable Consumer Timecode (RCTC, RC Timecode, or RC Time Code) is {{a nearly}} frame {{accurate}} timecode method developed by Sony for 8mm and Hi8 analog tape formats. The RC timecode is {{written by the}} video camera directly to analog tape tracks and records the hour, minute, second and frame for each frame of video recorded to tape. Officially, RCTC is accurate to within Â±2 to 5 frames. The RC timecode information is written in a separate area of the track so as to not disturb the audio or video information recorded on the tape. The RC timecode was {{used in conjunction with}} the datacode to record date, time and <b>frame</b> <b>information</b> directly to the 8mm tape tracks.|$|E

It was expected that a match between a person's self-discrepancy and framing will lead to more persuasion, under the condition that the information is processed centrally (high involvement). Two experiments were conducted to test this expectation, one through the Internet among obese people and one in the laboratory among students. Both experiments showed that only among those with high involvementassessed as an individual differenceparticipants with an ideal-discrepancy were persuaded the most by the positively <b>framed</b> <b>information,</b> whereas participants with an ought-discrepancy were persuaded the most by the negatively <b>framed</b> <b>information...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{a flying}} spot scanner (FSS) or {{cathode-ray}} tube (CRT) telecine, a pixel-sized light beam is projected through exposed and developed motion picture film (either negative or positive) and collected by a special type of photo-electric cell known as a photomultiplier which converts the light into an electrical signal. The beam of light âscansâ across the film image {{from left to right}} to record the horizontal <b>frame</b> <b>information.</b> Vertical scanning of the frame is then accomplished by moving the film past the CRT beam. In a colour telecine the light from the CRT passes through the film and is separated by dichroic mirrors and filters into red, green and blue bands. Photomultiplier tubes or avalanche photodiodes convert the light into separate red, green and blue electrical signals for further electronic processing. This can be accomplished in âreal timeâ, 24 frames per second (or in some cases faster). Rank Precision-Cintel introduced the âMarkâ series of FSS telecines. During this time advances were also made in CRTs, with increased light output producing a better signal-to-noise ratio and so allowing negative film to be used.|$|E

30|$|Of all {{perceptions}} entrepreneurial {{perception is}} related to mental representation b of entrepreneurship or what individuals think about entrepreneurship (Palich and Bagby, 1995; LiÃ±Ã¡n et al. 2011). This mental representation {{could be related to}} the different aspects of the entrepreneurial process. For example consider opportunity discovery wherein individuals develop heightened awareness (âalertnessâ) of arbitrage situations for profit making (Kirzner, 1979; Sarasvathy et al. 2005). In a similar way while addressing the risks of venturing entrepreneurs tend to <b>frame</b> <b>information</b> in a way that tends to lower its magnitude that it actually is (Simon et al. 2000; Forlani and Mullins, 2000; Douglas, 2006).

40|$|In our experiment, we {{evaluate}} the transferability of frames from Swedish to Finnish in parallel corpora. We evaluate both the theoretical possibility of transferring frames {{and the possibility}} of performing it using available lexical resources. We add the <b>frame</b> <b>information</b> to an extract of the Swedish side of the Kotus and JRC-Acquis corpora using an automatic frame labeler and copy it to the Finnish side. We focus on evaluating the results to get an estimation on how often the parallel sentences can be said to express the same frame. This sheds light on the questions: Are the same situations in the two languages expressed using different frames, i. e. are the frames transferable even in theory? How well can the <b>frame</b> <b>information</b> of running text be transferred from one language to another?...|$|E

40|$|Whereas {{there is}} {{extensive}} documentation that attribute framing influences {{the content of}} peopleâs thought, we generally know less about how it affects the processes assumed to precede those thoughts. While existing explanations for attribute framing effects rely completely on valence-based associative processing, the results obtained {{in the present study}} are also consistent with the notion that negative framing stimulates more effortful and thorough information processing than positive framing. Specifically, results from a simulated business decision-making experiment showed that decision makers receiving negatively <b>framed</b> <b>information</b> had significantly better recall than those receiving positively <b>framed</b> <b>information.</b> Furthermore, decision makers in the negative framing condition were less confident than decision makers in the positively framed condition.

40|$|Rather than {{individual}} consumer preferences, responses to referendum-style contingent valuation surveys on environmental goods may express citizen assessments that {{take into account}} benefits to others. We reconsider the consumer versus citizen hypothesis {{with a focus on}} the role of <b>framing</b> <b>information.</b> Survey data on conservation areas in Ilomantsi, Finland, are used. Different versions of the valuation question were used to encourage the respondents to take the consumer or the citizen role. The citizen version expectedly resulted in substantially fewer zero-WTP responses and protests and higher mean and median WTP, suggesting that the <b>framing</b> <b>information</b> has a major effect on the preferences expressed. The findings support the idea of multiple preferences. For a more confident interpretation of contingent valuation responses, future studies should recognise their intended use in survey design and gain information about respondentsâ motives to determine the presence and type of altruistic motives. altruism, benefitâcost analysis, conservation areas, contingent valuation, multiple preference orderings, referendum, spike model, Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R
