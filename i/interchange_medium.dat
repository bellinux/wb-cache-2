40|$|Using ODA for Translating Multimedia Information The {{purpose of}} this RFC is to inform implementors of {{multimedia}} systems about our experiences using ISO 8613 : Office Document Architecture (ODA). Because ODA is being proposed as an encoding format for use in multimedia mail and file exchange, implementors wishing to use ODA in an open systems environment may profit from our experiences. This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify any standard. Distribution of this memo is unlimited. 2. Overview ODA is a recently approved ISO (8613) and CCITT (T. 410) standard for representing documents containing multifont text, raster images and geometric graphics. This encoding has been specified {{for use in a}} number of related standards, such as X. 400. However, ODA is a very abstract standard, defining entities such as "composite logical object classes " and not common entities, such as "paragraphs". Therefore, effective use of ODA as an <b>interchange</b> <b>medium</b> requires the definition of a document application profile (dap) that defines some common entities and a map between ODA entities defined in the dap and entities used in the interchanged systems...|$|E

He paints this sense of dynamism and motion through his composition, through gestural abstraction, and through forcing movement from the viewer.|$|R
40|$|Rapid mixing, quenching, and {{filtration}} {{experiments with}} chloroplast thylakoid membranes, with energization by acid-base transition, demonstrate that an ATP tightly {{bound to the}} isolated membranes is a transient intermediate in the catalytic sequence for ATP synthesis. The experiments also show {{that most of the}} Pi and ADP bound at a catalytic site is committed to ATP formation without <b>interchange</b> with <b>medium</b> Pi or ADP. Other results give evidence that upon energization, the tightly bound ADP that is detectable in isolated thylakoid membranes or coupling factor ATPase is rapidly released to the medium from a catalytic site. These findings support an alternating site model in which an energy-requiring conformational transition loosens ATP binding at one site and simultaneously promotes Pi and ADP binding at the other site in a manner favoring ATP formation...|$|R
40|$|The Pi ⇄ HOH {{exchange}} {{reaction of}} oxidative phosphorylation is considerably less sensitive to uncouplers than the Pi ⇄ ATP and ATP ⇄ HOH exchanges. The uncoupler-insensitive Pi ⇄ HOH exchange is inhibited by oligomycin. These results and other considerations {{suggest that the}} relatively rapid and uncoupler-insensitive Pi ⇄ HOH exchange results from a rapid, reversible hydrolysis of a tightly but noncovalently bound ATP at a catalytic site for oxidative phosphorylation, concomitant with <b>interchange</b> of <b>medium</b> and bound Pi. Such tightly bound ATP has been demonstrated in submitochondrial particles {{in the presence of}} uncouplers, Pi, and ADP, by rapid labeling from 32 Pi under essentially steady-state phosphorylation conditions. These results lead to the working hypothesis that in oxidative phosphorylation energy from electron transport causes release of preformed ATP from the catalytic site. This release could logically involve energy-requiring protein conformational change...|$|R
