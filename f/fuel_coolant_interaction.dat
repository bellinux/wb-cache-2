40|$|Severe {{accidents}} in light water nuclear reactors occur when reactor vessel water inventory decreases {{and there is}} no available additional water coolant to be delivered into the core. In general, during an extended severe accident sequence a period exists in which the reactor core, after a partial or total melt down, is poured into the lower plenum that can have some water present. The study of the interaction of the melt fuel with the water is the objective of MFCI (Melt <b>Fuel</b> <b>Coolant</b> <b>Interaction)</b> activities. MFCI {{is one of the most}} important issues awaiting resolution in water cooled reactor safety analysis. The progression of a severe accident in a water cooled reactor can lead to energetic (steam explosion) or non-energetic (melt quenching) interactions as the molten fuel relocates and eventually interacts with the coolant either in the vessel lower head (in vessel) or in the cavity (ex-vessel). The MFCI experiments at JRC Ispra site were conducted in the FARO (Furnace And Release Oven) test facility under realistic melt composition and prototypical accident conditions to provide basic information on underlying phenomena. The experimental programme was complemented by comprehensive pre-test and post-test analytical activities based on the development and application of the thermalhydraulic COMETA (COre MElt Thermalhydraulic Analysis) code. The code is developed and assessed on the basis of experimental information acquired in the FARO facility tests, and there are some limitations and uncertainties in their application to the full plant, which need to be identified and possibly quantified. In general the main objective of the PhD research was achieved expanding the general knowledge in Melt <b>Fuel</b> <b>Coolant</b> <b>Interaction.</b> The knowledge was complemented collaborating and complementing the application of COMETA code under conditions not experimented before, developing and improving COMETA code sources and verifying the code consistency, analysing and unifying the COMETA simulations carried so far.

40|$|A steam {{explosion}} {{is an important}} nuclear safety issue {{in case of a}} severe reactor accident because it could induce dynamic loading on surrounding structures, leading potentially to an early release of radioactive material into the environment. Studies of the {{steam explosion}} consequences have to be based on experimental research programs like TROI (Test for Real cOrium Interaction with water) and FCI (<b>fuel</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>interaction)</b> codes like MC 3 D. In this work the TROI- 13 FCI experiment was analysed with the MC 3 D code. The TROI- 13 experiment resulted in a spontaneous steam explosion. The premixing simulation was performed to determine the initial conditions for the steam explosion. A number of steam explosion simulations were performed, changing the mass of melt droplets and position of triggering. The results showed that there is an important influence of the participating mass of melt droplets on the pressure impulse. To determine the participating mass, the processes of melt droplets creation and droplets solidification should be properly taken into account. ...|$|E

40|$|During a {{hypothetical}} severe accident {{of a light}} water reactor (LWR), molten corium could fall {{in the form of}} jet into a water pool. The jet fragmentation is crucial process during <b>fuel</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>interactions</b> (FCI) which fragment into droplets and disperse in the coolant, and it may cause a steam explosion. This paper deals with a study of computational fluid dynamics on the melt jet falling into a water pool in order to get qualitative and quantitative understanding of initial premixing phase of FCI. The preliminary objectives to pursue are modeling of jet fragmentation and estimation of the jet breakup length. A commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT 14. 0 is used for the 2 D numerical analysis employing Volume of Fluid (VOF) method. The problem and simulation conditions are similar to the jet breakup tests carried out at KTH (Manickam et al., 2014). Initially, a fragmentation/breakup pattern of the jet is discussed. Further, the effect of jet diameter and the jet injection velocity on the jet breakup length is studied, {{with a wide range of}} ambient Weber number (Wea) from 1. 25 to 1280. The numerical results compared with the experimental data are in a reasonable agreement. The impacts of physical properties of melt (density, viscosity and surface tension) on the jet breakup lengths are also investigated and presented. Finally the droplet size distributions are obtained based on the simulation results. These preliminary data may be helpful to substantiate the understanding of the phenomena during melt jet <b>interactions</b> with <b>coolant.</b> QC 20150519 This study is supported by the research programs of APRI 8, ENSI and NKS...|$|R

40|$|Sequences of basaltic pillow lavas that {{transition}} upwards with systematic gradation from pillow fragment breccias to fluidal bomb-bearing breccia to bomb-bearing lapilli tuffs are common at Askja volcano, Iceland. Based on the detailed textural investigation {{of three of}} these sequences, we argue that they record temporally continuous transition from effusive to explosive products that were erupted from and deposited at or near a single subaqueous vent. The recognition of such sequences is important as they provide evidence for controls on the onset of explosive activity in subaqueous environments. Such investigations are complicated by the interplay of magmatic gas expansion, phreatomagmatic and mechanical granulation fragmentation mechanisms in the subaqueous eruptive environment. All of the sequences studied at Askja have textural, componentry and sedimentological characteristics suggestive of a close genetic and spatial relationship between the pillow lavas {{and all of the}} overlying glassy clastic deposits. The identification of magma fragmentation signatures in pyroclasts was accomplished through detailed textural studies of pyroclasts within the full range of grain sizes of a given deposit i. e. bomb/blocks, lapilli and fine ash. These textural characteristics were compared and evaluated as discriminators of fragmentation in pyroclastic deposits. The presence of angular vitric clasts within the breccia and lapilli tuff displaying fragile glassy projections indicates little or no postdepositional textural modification. A shift in vesicle and clast textures between the pillow lavas and the large concentration of fluidal bombs in the breccia indicate that the phreatomagmatic explosions were initially triggered by magmatic vesiculation. The initial magmatic gas expansion may have been triggered by depressurization caused by the drainage of the ice-confined lake surrounding Askja. The <b>Fuel</b> <b>Coolant</b> <b>Interactions</b> (FCI) of the more efficient phreatomagmatic explosion was enabled by the increase in the surface area to volume ratio of the fluidal bombs in the water, producing a premix of magma and water. The onset and increasing influence of phreatomagmatic fragmentation is preserved in the presence of very fine blocky ash particles and diminished presence of larger particles such as fluidal bombs. The textural, sedimentological and environmental characteristics of these deposits suggest that phreatomagmatic explosions can be triggered by initial magmatic gas expansion, but that it is likely one of many mechanisms for triggering such explosions...|$|R
40|$|In liquid metal {{fast breeder}} reactors, {{postulated}} {{failures of the}} plant protection system may lead to serious unprotected accidental consequences. Unprotected transients are generically categorized as transient overpower accidents and transient under cooling accidents. In both cases, core meltdown may occur and {{this can lead to}} a molten <b>fuel</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> (MFCI). The understanding of MFCI phenomena is essential for study of debris coolability and characteristics during post-accident heat removal. Sodium is used as coolant in liquid metal fast breeder reactors. Viewing inside sodium at elevated temperature is impossible because of its opaqueness. In the present study, a methodology to depict MFCI phenomena using a flat panel detector based imaging system (i. e., real time radiography) is brought out using a woods metal-water experimental facility which simulates the UO 2 -Na interaction. The developed imaging system can capture attributes of the MFCI process like jet breakup length, jet front velocity, fragmented particle size, and a profile of the debris bed using digital image processing methods like image filtering, segmentation, and edge detection.

40|$|An ex-vessel steam {{explosion}} might occur when during a hypothetical severe reactor accident the reactor vessel fails and the molten core pours {{into the water}} in the reactor cavity. A {{steam explosion}} is a <b>fuel</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> process where the heat transfer from the melt to water is so intense and rapid that the timescale for heat transfer is shorter than the timescale for pressure relief. This could lead to the formation of shock waves and production of missiles at later times, during the expansion of the highly pressurized water vapour, that may endanger surrounding structures. The purpose of the article is to present how steam explosions can be treated with a general purpose Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code, to give an insight of the steam explosion phenomenon in a typical Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) cavity, and to provide a rough assessment of the vulnerabilities of cavity structures to steam explosions. Ta achieve this a fit-for-purpose steam explosion model was developed, followed by a comprehensive and reasonably conservative parametric steam explosion study.

The phenomena associated with the interaction of corium with coolant are of great safety interest as precondition to possible steam explosions and for the lower plenum debris coolability problem.

40|$|Thermohydraulic explosions were {{produced}} by Molten <b>Fuel</b> <b>Coolant</b> <b>Interaction</b> (MFCI) experiments using remelted shoshonitic rocks from Vulcano (Italy). The fragmentation history and energy release were recorded. The resulting products were recovered and analyzed with the scanning electron microscope. Fine particles from experiments show shape and surface features {{that result from}} melt fragmentation in brittle mode. These clasts relate to the thermohydraulic phase of the MFCI, {{where most of the}} mechanical energy is released; they are here called "active'' particles. The total surface area of such particles is proportional to the energy of the respective explosions. Other particles from experiments show shape and surface features that result from melt fragmentation in a ductile regime. These fragments, called "passive'' particles, form after the thermohydraulic phase, during the expansion phase of the MFCI. In order to verify thermohydraulic explosions in volcanic eruptions, we compared experimental products with samples from phreatomagmatic base-surge deposits of Vulcano. Ash particles from the experiments show features similar to those from the deposits, suggesting that the experiments reproduced the same fragmentation dynamics. To achieve discrimination between active and passive particles, we calculated shape parameters from image analysis. The mass of active particles in base-surge deposits was calculated. As the material properties for the natural samples are identical to the experimental ones, the energy measurements and calculations of the experiments can be applied. For a single phreatomagmatic eruption at Vulcano, a maximum mechanical energy release of 2. 75 x 10 (13) J was calculated, representing a TNT analogue of 6. 5 kt...|$|E

40|$|Rapid {{generation}} of high pressures and mechanical work may result when thermal energy {{is transferred from}} the hot molten nuclear fuel to the coolant in an LMFBR accident. Such energetic thermal interactions are facilitated by the large heat transfer area created when molten fuel is fragmented in the coolant. Two aspects of the molten <b>fuel</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>interaction</b> problem are investigated: (1) the effects of gas/vapor blanketing of the fuel on post-fragmentation {{generation of}} pressure and mechanical work, and (2) the mechanism of the fragmentation of the molten fuel as it contacts the coolant. A model developed at Argonne National Laboratory to analyze fragmentation-induced energetic fuel-coolant interactions is modified to allow for gas/vapor blanketing of the fuel. The modified model is applied to a. hypothetical accident involving an FFTF subassembly. The results indicate that high shock pressures are not necessarily precluded by gas/vapor blanketing of the fuel. However, the generation of mechanical work is greatly reduced. A model is developed to simulate the dynamic growth of the vapor film around a hot spherical particle which has been suddenly immersed in a coolant. The model is applied to various cases of hot spheres in water and in sodium. A fragmentation mechanism based {{on the ability of}} the pressure pulsations of the vapor film to induce internal cavitation in the molten material is shown to predict the reported fragmentation behavior of drops of several hot molten materials in water and sodium.

40|$|Detailed field mapping (Map, Appendix B) {{has been}} {{conducted}} {{in and around the}} boundaries of a 14 x 18 km, volcanic complex 35 km northeast of Molteno in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. The structure is interpreted as a subsidence structure, and is filled with two volcaniclastic breccias, numerous lava flows, a number of sedimentary facies, and lies on a base of Clarens Formation overlying Elliot Formation rocks. This is an important study because 'widespread, voluminous fields of basaltic breccias are very rare (see Hanson and Elliot, 1996) {{and this is the first}} time that this type of volcanic complex and its deposits have been described. Detailed analyses of the two volcaniclastic breccias revealed changes in colour, clast types, clast sizes, and degree of alteration over relatively short distances both vertically and laterally within a single breccia unit. The variation in clast sizes implies a lack of sorting of the breccias. The lower of the two volcaniclastic breccias fills the subsidence structure, and outcrops between the Stormberg sedimentary sequence and the overlying Drakensberg basalts and was produced from phreatomagmatic eruptions signalling the start of the break-up of Gondwanaland in the mid-Jurassic. The upper volcaniclastic breccia is interbedded with the flood basalts and is separated from the lower breccia by up to 100 m of lava flows in places, it is finer-grained than the lower volcaniclastic breccia, and it extends over 10 km south, and over 100 km north from the volcanic complex. The upper breccia is inferred to have been transported from outside the study area, from a source presumably similar to the subsidence structure in the volcanic complex. The pyroclastic material forming the upper breccia was transported to the subsidence structure as a laharic debris flow, based on its poorly sorted, unwelded and matrix-supported appearance. However, both breccias are unlikely to have been derived from epiclastic reworking of lava flows as they contain glass shards which are atypical of those derived from the autoclastic component of lava flows. The breccias are therefore not "secondary" lahars. There is also no evidence of any palaeotopographic highs from which the breccias could have been derived as gravity-driven flows. Based on the occurrence of three, 1 m thick lacustrine deposits, localised peperite, fluvial reworking of sandstone and breccia in an outcrop to the south of the subsidence structure, and channel-lags encountered only in the upper units of the Clarens Formation and only within the subsidence structure, the palaeoenvironment inferred for the subsidence structure is one of wet sediment, possibly a shallow lake, in a topographic depression fed by small streams. Magmatic intrusions below the subsidence structure heated the water-laden, partly consolidated Clarens Formation sandstones, causing the circulation of pore fluid which resulted in the precipitation of minerals forming pisoliths in the sandstones. Intruding magma mixed, nonexplosively, with the wet, unconsolidated sediments near the base of the Clarens Formation (at approximately 100 m below the surface), forming fluidal peperite by a process of sediment fluidisation where magma replaces wet sediment and cools slowly enough to prevent the magma fracturing brittly. Formation of fluidal peperite may have been a precursor to the development of FCIs (<b>Fuel</b> <b>Coolant</b> <b>Interactions)</b> (Busby-Spera and White, 1987). The breccias may represent the products of FCIs and may be the erupted equivalents of the peperites, suggesting a possible genetic link between the two. The peperites may have given way to FCI eruptions due to a number of factors including the drying out of the sediments and/or an increase in the volume of intruded magma below the subsidence structure which may have resulted in a more explosive interaction between sediment and magma. Phreatic activity fragmented and erupted the Clarens Formation sandstone, and stream flows reworked the angular sandstone fragments, pisoliths and sand grains into channelised deposits. With an increase in magmatic activity below the subsidence structure, phreatic activity became phreatomagmatic. The wet, partly consolidated Clarens Formation, and underlying, fully consolidated Elliot Formation sediments were erupted and fragmented. Clasts and individual grains of these sediments were redeposited with juvenile and non-juvenile basaltic material probably by a combination of back fall, where clasts erupted into the air fell directly back into the structure, and backflow where material was erupted out of the structure, but immediately flowed back in as lahars. This material formed the lower volcaniclastic breccia. A fault plane is identified along the southwestern margin of the subsidence structure, and is believed to continue up the western margin to the northwestern corner. A large dolerite body has intruded along the inferred fault plane on the western margin of the structure, and may be related to the formation of the lower volcaniclastic breccia, either directly through fluidisation of wet sediment during its intrusion, or as a dyke extending upwards from a network of sill-like intrusions below the subsidence structure. Geochemical analysis of the Drakensberg basalt lava flows by Mitchell (1980) and Masokwane (1997) revealed four distinct basalt types; the Moshesh's Ford, the Tafelkop, the Roodehoek, and the Vaalkop basalts. Basalt clasts sampled from the lower volcaniclastic breccia were shown to belong to the Moshesh's Ford basalt type which does not outcrop in situ within the subsidence structure. This implies that the Moshesh's Ford basalts were emplaced prior to the formation of the lower volcaniclastic breccia, and may have acted as a "cap-rock" over the system, allowing pressure from the vaporised fluids, heated by intruding basalt, to build up. The Moshesh's Ford basalt type was erupted prior to the resultant phreatomagmatic events forming the lower volcaniclastic breccia. ...|$|R

40|$|The Pleistocene Lake Purrumbete Maar {{is one of}} {{the largest}} maar volcanoes world wide, with a complex {{pyroclastic}} sequence that reflects variations in the eruption style, ranging from magmatic influenced dry phreatomagmatic to wet phreatomagmatic. The country rock xenoliths within the pyroclastic deposits originate from very shallow stratigraphic layers indicating a very shallow bowl shaped maar diatreme, that is difficult to explain by the traditional model of downwards growth of a singular explosion point. The detailed field studies, presented here, including mapping, stratigraphic logging, measurements of base surge transport directions and ballistic impact structures, led to the reconstruction of at least three major vent locations, suggesting that the large size is the result of multiple coalesced craters. Vent migration occurred along basement structures and was probably caused by the collapse of the crater walls and clogging of the vent. In addition, a complex eruption history was determined with three eruption phases and at least one significant volcanic hiatus. This is supported by the geochemical data of the Lake Purrumbete pyroclastic sequence, which shows distinct trace element trends that correlate with the stratigraphic height and the three determined eruption phases, indicating that the maar activity was controlled by deep processes within the feeding system. The trace element trends cannot be explained by crystal fractionation or crustal contamination and are best explained by melt differentiation caused by melt transport through highly porous mantle channels. Tapping these melt channels may have controlled the release of single magma pulses and therefore the activity of the Lake Purrumbete Maar. Analysis of the bubble number densities and the bubble size distribution of vesicles preserved in ash sized juvenile clasts of the pyroclastic sequence show that vesicle nucleation appeared in different phases within the conduit, with an early phase deeper in the conduit and a late phase of vesicle nucleation near the fragmentation level, caused by the exsolution of H 2 O and acceleration of the magma. Strain within the magma caused by the acceleration of the melt is also indicated by micro-textures, including stretched vesicles and aligned microlites, whereby the difference in the microlite abundances and the microlite shape, observed in ash particles are difficult to explain with the traditional models of decompression and cooling induced microlite formation. The results of fragmentation experiments conducted in this project show that microlites can form on extremely small time scales. Furthermore the exclusive occurrence of microlites in particles that experienced mechanical stress during brittle fragmentation, suggests that microlite formation may be the result of mechanical stress. The differences in the microlite populations observed in the Lake Purrumbete ash particles are therefore best explained by modification of the microlite population due to stress induced microlite formation caused by the strain of the magma during acceleration near the fragmentation level. In addition, high strain rates may also cause deformation of the magma and the formation of fractures. The fragmentation experiments have also shown that vesiculated magma can react with water in the way of molten <b>fuel</b> <b>coolant</b> <b>interaction,</b> if the magma/water interface is enhanced by fractures, suggesting that the phreatomagmatic eruption style at Lake Purrumbete was supported by fracturing of the magma due to acceleration near the fragmentation level. Furthermore, the results show that pre-stress of the magma, that is most likely caused by strain, has a major influence on the shape of the produced pyroclasts. This research project shows that the formation of a very large maar system is controlled by many factors starting at the source of the melt and magma ascent dynamics to subsurface processes, whereby the formation of a specific volcano form is predominantly controlled by subsurface and surface processes including the availability of water and the surrounding stratigraphy. The results, presented here show that the combination of hard and soft rock substrate together with fractures within the country rock and the location on fault structures led to the formation of this very large maar structure. Aquifer sourced water supply, mass flow of the Black Rock Sandstone and water, together with changing magma ascent rates influenced the explosive eruption dynamics. This research projected has touched on many different aspects of the eruption of very large maar systems and raised new questions which should be addressed in future work. In addition, it has shown the importance of detailed stratigraphic work on this volcano type as the basis of many other studies, such as geochemistry and pyroclast textures. The geochemical variations detected within the Lake Purrumbete pyroclastic sequence suggest, that this volcano type is perfect for studies of mantle processes, as the magma rises very fast to the surface leaving no time for crustal contamination and magma differentiation. Furthermore, highly porous melt channels within the mantle may be the explanation and reason for the activity of intra-plate volcanic provinces and should be further investigated in the future. In addition, strain within the magma seems to have a major influence on the eruption type and the resulting pyroclast shape, the results presented here suggesting that the strain may be linked to the acceleration of the melt near the fragmentation level and to the exsolution of H 2 O. This connection should be further addressed in future work...|$|E
