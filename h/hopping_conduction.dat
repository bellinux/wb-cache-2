50|$|Historically, an {{evidence}} for ionic conductivity was provided {{back in the}} 1880s, when German scientists noticed that a well-calibrated thermometer made of Thuringian glass would show −0.5 °C instead of 0 °C when placed in ice shortly after immersion in boiling water, and recover only after several months. In 1883, they reduced this effect 10 times by replacing a mixture of sodium and potassium in the glass by either sodium or potassium. This finding helped Otto Schott develop the first accurate lithium-based thermometer. More systematic studies on ionic conductivity in glass appeared in 1884, but received broad attention only a century later. Several universal laws have been empirically formulated for ionic glasses and extended to other ionic conductors, such as the frequency dependence of electrical conductivity σ(ν) - σ(0) ~ νp, where the exponent p depends on the material, but not on temperature, at least below ~100 K. This behavior is a fingerprint of activated <b>hopping</b> <b>conduction</b> among nearby sites.|$|E

It is shown that in a 3 D system with Heisenberg exchange interaction the spin excitations have a delocalized part of the spectrum even in the limit of strong disorder, thus leading to the possibility of the coherent spin transport. The spin transport provided by the delocalized excitations can be described by a diffusion coefficient. Non-homogenous magnetic fields lead to the Anderson localization of spin excitations while anisotropy of the exchange interaction results in the Lifshitz localization of excitations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a switching DC-DC Buck converter with enhanced light-load efficiency {{for use in}} noise-sensitive applications. Low noise, spur free operation is achieved by using a sigma-delta-modulator (ΣΔ) based controller, while light load efficiency is realized through the introduction of fine step frequency scaling (FSFS) which continuously adjusts the switching frequency of the converter with load conditions. Regulation efficiency is further improved by adoption of mode <b>hopping</b> (continuous <b>conduction</b> mode (CCM) / discontinuous conduction mode (DCM)) and utilization of a fully digital implementation. Furthermore, the presented converter maintains low output voltage ripple across its entire load range by reconfiguring the ΣΔ modulator's quantization step and introducing dither to the loop filter. The proposed modulator was implemented in 14 nm bulk CMOS process and validated with post layout simulations. It attains a peak efficiency of 95 % at heavy load conditions and 79 % at light loads with a maximum voltage ripple of 15 mV at light loads. N/...|$|R

In the power-law regime, the RRTN violates the Boltzmann's (or Debye) relaxation time approximation strongly.
