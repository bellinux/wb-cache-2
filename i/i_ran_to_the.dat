2500|$|.....about six moons ago, I with my [...] {{and child}} (male) were encamped with thirty others Aboriginal natives, men, women and children, upon the Bor-rang-yallock, when Mr Taylor and many poor men (shepherds) came towards our miam-miams with guns, Mr Taylor was on horseback, {{they came up}} in an {{extended}} line Mr Taylor in the centre they advanced quick and immediately fired upon the natives, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} river and lay down behind a tree among the grass, they killed more than thirty men women and children, my lubra and child were among the dead, the white people threw them into the water and soon left the place, the water was much stained with blood, I saw the dead body of my lubra but did not see my child. I remained for two days near the spot. Two days after the murder Yi-yi-ran (Mr Andreson) and Mr Watson came and saw the bodies and seemed sorry and said to Mr Taylor why did you kill so many lubras and children. Yi-yi-ran, Charles Courtney, James Ramslie and James Hamilton, burned the bodies, and made fires. Mr Taylor, Mr Andreson and Mr Watson came on horseback two days after with a sack and took away part of the bones not consumed.|$|E
60|$|And <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door {{in time to}} see Jim Hawkins, {{safe and}} sound, come {{climbing}} over the stockade.|$|E
60|$|And again {{dodging the}} boom, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> colour lines, handed down their cursed black flag, and chucked it overboard.|$|E
60|$|Wood. Pox verily her! {{it is my}} landlady: Here, hide {{yourself}} behind <b>the</b> curtains, while <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, <b>to</b> {{stop her}} entry.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ship, it {{will take}} time," [...] {{reasoned}} Andy. [...] "By the time I get back {{with some of the}} others it may be too late. What shall I do?" ...|$|R
50|$|So <b>I</b> <b>run</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{creek and}} jumped right in.|$|R
60|$|We assented, and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camels {{that lay}} resting {{just outside the}} arch. Before I reached them, however, Quick called me back.|$|E
60|$|At Oliver's request <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Child of Kings to {{lead her}} to some safer place, {{if it could}} be found. But she would not stir.|$|E
60|$|Crying? I {{had left}} him in {{excellent}} spirits, casting glances of the tenderest admiration at Madame Fontaine. Without waiting to hear more, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dining-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "But you cannot prevent {{your sister}} from doing as she likes," [...] here broke in a tart {{voice from the}} back of the corridor. [...] "Crystal, child! try and bear up while <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English {{hospital}} first and, if necessary, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> English doctor afterwards. And you, Monsieur my brother, be good enough to allow Jeanne <b>to</b> open <b>the</b> door for me." ...|$|R
60|$|Springing from <b>the</b> stoep <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> where <b>the</b> swallow lay, but Sihamba {{was there}} before me {{and had it}} in her hands.|$|R
40|$|Playing {{a game of}} squash, my {{opponent}} hits a drop shot <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left corner. <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> front of the court – I do not bump into him or the walls as I do. Then, seeing that the ball has bounced high, I step out on my right foot, and hit the ball high on the front wall for a cross-‐court lob. What kind of visual information allows me <b>to</b> plan and <b>the...</b>|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door. The widow {{laid her}} finger on her lips. [...] "Not a word, mind, to Minna!" [...] she whispered. [...] "We {{understand}} each other--don't we?" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{my heart}} smote {{me when we}} climbed aboard {{and looked at the}} havoc he had done. The shears were gone altogether. The guys had been slashed right and left. The throat-halyards which I had rigged were cut across through every part. And he knew I could not splice. A thought struck me. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> windlass. It would not work. He had broken it. We looked at each other in consternation. Then <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> side. The masts, booms, and gaffs I had cleared were gone. He had found the lines which held them, and cast them adrift.|$|E
60|$|Sennit and <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lee main-rigging, {{where we}} just {{got a glimpse of}} the hat of the poor fellow, who seemed to be {{swimming}} manfully, as the ship foamed past him.|$|E
60|$|Unmindful of my companion's remonstrances, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corner; {{and slowly}} promenaded past the upright coat and pantaloons on the steps.|$|R
6000|$|... 'What {{is to be}} done?' sighed Gillian. 'Miss White can't walk. Can <b>I</b> <b>run</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> village <b>to</b> get {{something}} to take her home?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was so {{impressed}} with the tone in which they were spoken that <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> round <b>to</b> <b>the</b> drawing-room <b>to</b> protect Miss Carne from violence." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cupboard, and, sure enough, {{found there}} a blue phial of medicine, with the dose {{written on it}} on a paper, and this I {{administered}} to him with what speed I might.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skiff, {{and when}} we had dragged her down the shore until she was waterborne, both of us stopped as with one accord to listen lest an enemy might have been {{creeping}} up on us.|$|E
60|$|As I had surmised, {{the dock}} was not {{over a quarter}} of a mile away, if indeed it was as far. I was a fair swimmer, and without {{hesitation}} <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rail with the full intention of jumping overboard.|$|E
60|$|Mor. So, seeking for shelter, <b>I</b> {{naturally}} <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{old place}} of assignation, the garden-house; where, for the want of instinct, {{you did not}} follow me.|$|R
6000|$|The man {{touched his}} hat. [...] "But I couldn't do that, sir. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Cat and Fiddle. It's long miles, sir. Shall I get a carriage?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there was}} a good-sized tree at hand," [...] she confided to Korak, [...] "I know that <b>I</b> should <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> very top of it in terror of my life." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not return}} to my study. I stood {{by the side of the}} house, with my fists clenched and my eyes set. Then, suddenly, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> garden wall; looking over it, I saw, far down the shaded village street, two gray figures walking away.|$|E
60|$|I gazed about, mad with disappointment. Two {{doors opened}} from this to other rooms. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nearer and listened. Yes, voices {{were coming from}} beyond and one was a woman's, level and cold and filled with scorn. There was no terror in it. It was Victory's.|$|E
6000|$|... "Might ha' been that," [...] {{admitted}} the mate. [...] "Well, when I heard it <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> edge {{and looked down}} at the water, and at first I couldn't see anything. Then I saw what I took to be a dog, but, knowing that dogs can't cry 'help!'--" ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{before the}} words {{was out of}} his mouth, off he flies like a shot through the open door, and his royaliness's parcel with him. <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, and there he was, flying right hover the town, in a northerly direction. And that's all I know; for I would not tell a lie, not if it was hever so. And me, and Thomas--as didn't see it,--and cook, we thinks as how Benson was come for. And cook says as she don't wonder at it, neither; for a grumblinger, more ill-conditioneder--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir, I {{reach in}} my pocket for the {{abstract}} of title; but I suddenly hear my team running away. <b>I</b> <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window and emit the word--or exclamation, which-ever it may be--viz, 'Whoa!' Then I rush down-stairs and down the street, returning in a few minutes. 'Dang them mules,' I says; 'they done run away and busted the doubletree and two traces. Now I got to hoof it home, for I never brought no money along. Reckon we'll talk about that loan some other time, gen'lemen.' ...|$|R
60|$|So I went, {{leaving the}} women wondering, {{for it is}} not our custom to save both when twins are born; but <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> swiftly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gates of the Emposeni.|$|R
6000|$|A light, quick step {{ascended the}} stairs--my heart bounded; I started to my feet. It {{was the same}} step which I used to listen for, and love to hear, in my illness. <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, and opened it. My {{instinct}} had not deceived me! it was my sister! ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, passing several exits {{choked with}} the fear mad mob that were battling to escape. One {{would have thought that}} an entire herd of thags was loose behind them, rather than a single blinded, dying beast; but such is the effect of panic upon a crowd.|$|E
60|$|Noticing {{that the}} Italian {{had left the}} end of the {{aperture}} in the block of ice, and that he was now shouting up the open shaft, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> channel of communication which my Agnes had opened for me, and called through it; but the dear girl had gone.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> {{likewise}} <b>ran</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, {{and this}} fight interested me. There was a great, black-bearded mountaineer-farmer-desperado {{in the midst}} of a circle, pouring out a torrent of abuse at a tall young man.|$|R
60|$|Next, {{just after}} a vivid flash of lightning, {{for the storm}} had broken in earnest now, <b>I</b> <b>ran</b> swiftly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> water's edge, {{accompanied}} by Hans, who was determined <b>to</b> see <b>the</b> last of me.|$|R
60|$|More {{knocking}} {{and louder}} voices. <b>I</b> must <b>run</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door {{and see what}} it is. Oh, Mary! Mary! I hope I am not going to have another fright about you, but I feel sadly like it.|$|R
