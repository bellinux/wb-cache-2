50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1971, a group of thirty <b>day-student</b> girls entered the school, {{beginning}} the school's move toward co-education. The following year, female boarding commenced.|$|E
5000|$|The college had {{originally}} catered to seminarians and boarding students but eventually day students {{were allowed to}} attend. This led to the abolishment of a five-days-a-week class structure {{and the introduction of}} the three day week school time. In 2003 it ceased boarding students and became solely a <b>day-student</b> secondary school.|$|E
50|$|Plans in 1931 envisaged the College {{moving to}} a more {{suitable}} site at Silverstream in the Hutt Valley, but a high demand for education eventually led to a split: the original establishment continued and the boarding section moved to become St Patrick's College, Silverstream, thus allowing room {{for the expansion of}} <b>day-student</b> numbers on the Cambridge Terrace site in central Wellington city.|$|E
50|$|Wilson's Hospital School, a co-educational {{boarding}} school, operates {{under the}} patronage of the Church of Ireland (Anglican Communion). It {{is located in}} the nearby village of Multyfarnham. It serves <b>day-students</b> from the Mullingar area.|$|R
2500|$|Student {{life at the}} Seminary {{involved}} long class days, {{extending from}} 8 AM to lights out at 9:30 PM. [...] Life was also structured by strict rules. [...] For example, students {{were not allowed to}} leave the school without a request from home, and the students were not permitted any visitors unless approved by their parents. [...] Many pupils at the school were residential, but a significant number were <b>day-students</b> living with their families nearby. [...] When the seminary formally opened in 1854, <b>day-students</b> accounted for about two-thirds of the student body. [...] As the reputation of the seminary increased, a greater portion of students came from further away.|$|R
50|$|The {{school is}} {{currently}} called Makumbi Visitation {{and is a}} Jesuit-run high school, {{a part of their}} Makumbi Mission. It enrolls around 846 students, 600 of whom are boarders while the others are <b>day-students</b> from the surrounding area. Technical subjects taught include woodwork, agriculture, and fashion and fabrics.|$|R
50|$|As a {{boarding}} school, St. Paul's {{was able to}} accommodate students from a wide geographic area; over the years, students from Central and South America, France, Greece, Russia, Korea, and Japan attended. However, due to a general decline in boarders, the increasing expense of housing residents, {{and the prospect of}} overhauling a dormitory which was in disrepair, St. Paul's converted to an all <b>day-student</b> program beginning with the 2003-2004 school year.|$|E
50|$|The Putney School is an {{independent}} high school in Putney, Vermont. It was founded in 1935 by Carmelita Hinton {{on the principles of}} the Progressive Education movement and the teachings of its principal exponent, John Dewey. It is a co-educational, college-preparatory boarding school, with a <b>day-student</b> component, located 12 mi outside of Brattleboro, Vermont. Emily Jones is the director. The school enrolls approximately 225 students on a 500 acre hilltop campus with classrooms, dormitories, and a dairy farm on which all of its students work before graduating.|$|E
50|$|A parish {{church was}} later built {{on part of}} the land given {{originally}} to the BES, and remains there to this day. Much of the original land was later sold {{to help in the}} building of Barnes, which was established in 1925 as a school for boarders. The BES schools, as they were popularly known, were primarily boarding schools for Anglo-Indian boys and girls, mainly belonging to the Anglican Church. However, day-scholars were later admitted, and they were of all castes and creeds. In the early 1900s, the BES merged with the Indo British institution which had been founded by Rev. George Candy, in 1837. In 1925, two new schools were established - one for <b>day-students</b> only (Christ Church School), and one for boarders and <b>day-students</b> (Barnes School).|$|R
2500|$|The {{student body}} at St. Peter's Mission changed over time, however. A'aninin (known to whites by the mistranslated name [...] "Gros Ventres") {{boarding}} students soon outnumbered the Métis <b>day-students,</b> and the Jesuits began to successfully encourage the Piegan Blackfeet {{to send their}} children to the school as boarding students as well.|$|R
50|$|About 250 {{students}} attend Gould. 45% {{of the student}} body come from Maine; 22% {{of the student body}} are local <b>day-students.</b> 26% of Gould’s student body is international, while 15% of students come from New England states other than Maine and 14% come from US States outside of New England. Domestic students of color represent 5% of the community. About 30% of students compete in the On-Snow Competition program.|$|R
40|$|M. A. The recent {{social and}} {{political}} changes {{that have taken place}} in South Africa, particularly the integration of the universities, makes this an ideal setting for the study of students’ attitudes and perceptions of their own and other cultural groups. A limitation of existing attitude studies in South Africa and abroad is that these studies have focussed minimally on identifying cultural perceptual processes that underlie intergroup attitudes. In addition, these studies tend to focus mainly on the attitudes of single ethno-cultural groups towards one or a few specific ethnic target groups. The variation of group attitudes of each other across diverse cultural orientation groups has thus mostly been neglected. In order to address such problems, this study aimed at examining cultural group attitudes and core value-orientations (Individualism and Collectivism) amongst 1 st and 2 nd year psychology volunteer students at RAU. More specifically, this study aimed at determining the variation of group attitudes and value-orientations in terms of a number of independent variables, and the correlation between group attitudes and core value-orientations. The study employed a questionnaire survey with a sample of 541 1 st and 2 nd year psychology volunteer students at RAU. The sample included male and female students from the broad cultural orientation groups (Western, African, Middle-Eastern (Muslim) and Indian/Asian cultural orientation groups), and the three main language groups (English, Afrikaans and African languages), as well as resident students and <b>day-students</b> from various faculties and academic years of study. The assessment instruments comprised of an Individualism and Collectivism Likert Scale (IS/CS) (Gudykunst, 1995), designed to measure generalised core value-orientations, and a Semantic Differential Scale (SDS) (Nieuwoudt, 1973), designed to measure attitudes towards five broad cultural orientation groups, namely: Western-Afrikaans, Western-English, Indian/Asian, Middle-Eastern (Muslim) and Indigenous African groups. The independent variables included in the analyses of the data were: gender, resident vs. <b>day-students</b> (intimacy and frequency of contact variable), cultural group membership/identity, and first language. The construct validity and the internal reliability of the I/CS and SDS were investigated by means of principal axis factor analysis and Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients. Independent t-tests were used to identify statistically significant differences between the IS/CS and SDS scores of the male and female respondents and the resident students and <b>day-students.</b> ANOVA and subsequent Scheffé or Dunnett T 3 post-hoc tests were used to identify the group similarities and differences in the scores for the five cultural-identity groups and the three language groups. Finally, Pearsons’ product-moment correlations were used to identify significant correlations between the IS/CS and SDS scores. Important findings were the following: • Females indicated significantly stronger Individualism and Collectivism scores than males. • <b>Day-students</b> indicated significantly stronger Collectivism scores than resident students. • Statistically significant differences were identified in the IS/CS scores of the five cultural-identity groups and the three language groups. • Males and females differed significantly from one another in terms of their perceptions of Indian/Asian cultural groups. • Resident students and <b>day-students</b> differed significantly from one another in terms of their perceptions of Western-Afrikaans and African cultural groups. • The five cultural-orientation groups and the three language groups differed significantly from one another in terms of their perceptions of Western-Afrikaans, Western-English and African cultural groups. • Significant correlations for the Collectivism scores and the SDS scores for the perceptions of the Western-English, Indian/Asian, Middle-Eastern and African cultures were identified. These correlations were however extremely low, indicating that conducting a regression analysis of the SDS attitude scores in terms of the IS/CS scores was not feasible. Theoretical implications were discussed and recommendations were made for future research in this field...|$|R
50|$|St. Agnes was {{situated}} in what were then {{the suburbs of}} Memphis (Vance and Orleans), about {{a mile and a}} quarter from Court Square, the center of the city. The doors were opened on February 4, 1851, with 20 boarders and about 15 <b>day-students.</b> When the school year ended on July 7, 1851, the enrollment had increased to more than 50, and an addition to the school had been completed. The Dominican Sisters also boarded orphans until 1864, when the Sisters opened St. Peter's Orphanage.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} just over 90 {{teaching}} staff and 830 pupils, {{all of whom}} are <b>day-students.</b> It has its own preparatory form for children in Year 6, and its own sixth form for Years 12 and 13. Each student at the school is a member of a house, allowing a system of inter-school competition in sports and other pastimes such as chess, general knowledge and karaoke. Between 2008-2013 Leicester Grammar School was the fastest growing independent school in the country, according to the Independent Schools Bursars' association (ISB).|$|R
25|$|Student {{enrolment}} in {{the academy}} as at 1965 had risen to nearly 600, one-third of whom continued to be <b>day-students,</b> owing to the limited boarding facilities available. Academy administrators introduced a sixth-form department. The sixth-form department was not restricted to only graduates from the academy, and applicants from other schools were admitted. The courses offered in sixth form were {{in the arts and}} science disciplines only, business study was introduced in September 1970. Fifteen Arts students and eight Science students were offered admission into the Sixth Form for the 1961–62 academic year. Female students were admitted into the sixth form, beginning with the first batch of 100 girls for the 1990–91 academic year.|$|R
5000|$|With the {{educational}} {{revolution in the}} 1960s, the scene changed dramatically. Student numbers increased greatly, {{the great majority of}} them being local <b>day-students.</b> A greatly expanded curriculum placed increasing demands on the existing facilities. Accordingly, a new college was constructed {{on the outskirts of the}} town and opened its doors as the new [...] "Counsel" [...] in 1984. Since then the college has grown further with the addition of a technology block (Villanova), a new classroom block (Cascia), and a large sports hall with gymnasium named after the past rector of the college, Fr. John Cosgrave, O.S.A.. More recently, four floodlit astro turf pitches have been added. Catering today for over 850 boys, Good Counsel College continues to provide an education in the Augustinian tradition.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a period}} the school ran a preparatory department, which {{was located in}} Gardyner House as was officially [...] "Form 1". Although this closed in the 1950s {{it was not until}} 1973 that the year groups were re{{numbered}} - prior to September that year year groups were numbered 2, 3, 4, Shell (abbreviated to [...] "Sh") and 5 (followed by Lower, Middle and Upper Sixth). Other traditions that ended in the 1970s were the singing of the school song (before 1972 - but still sung at Old Lancastrian meetings), the requirement to wear a school cap (ended from 1972/3 - though they were still on sale until 1979), shorts for junior boarders (which was also abolished in September 1973), and houses for <b>day-students</b> (which were wound up in 1974).|$|R
5000|$|St. John's College {{was founded}} in 1887 with the {{establishment}} of the “Select School” for young men at the Catholic presbytery, Holy Redeemer Cathedral in Belize City. The founder of St. John's College was Fr. Cassian Gillett, one of four brothers, British Jesuit priests, who arrived in Belize in the 1880s. The school opened with twelve <b>day-students</b> and two boarders. According to the 1897 prospectus, the school’s mission was “to afford the youth of the Colony, and the neighboring Republics, the means of obtaining a solid mental and moral training.” It added that Belize needed “a school of Higher Studies so that our youth would not have to go abroad for preparation for university work.”The school grew quickly. In February 1896, it moved into a newly constructed building on the cathedral grounds. Its name changed from the Select School to St. John’s College, under Fr. William J. Wallace. The enrollment continued to expand, and included boarding students from neighboring Central American republics such as Guatemala and Honduras. This steady expansion forced a second move, to seafront land supplied by the government to the south of town. On July 17, 1917, the faculty and students moved into spacious wooden buildings with wide verandahs and windows open to the sea breeze. The campus was called Loyola Park. More construction followed including a gymnasium and chapel. By 1929 there were 90 students at the College.August 1921 saw an outbreak of yellow fever at Loyola Park. Day students returned to their homes for hospitalization. Boarding students were first taken to a small island just off the coast, Moho Caye. From there boarders from the rural areas of Belize, Yucatán, and Guatemala returned home but those from Honduras were refused admittance in their country. They were quarantined at Sargent's Caye. Two students and two faculty members died before the fever passed.On September 11, 1931 one of the worst hurricanes to hit Belize took 2,500 lives including 11 Jesuits at Loyola Park, where the buildings were leveled and splintered. SJC returned to the cathedral grounds where it remained until 1952, when it moved to its spacious new Landivar campus northwest of town.|$|R
