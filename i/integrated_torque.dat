5000|$|In 1948, Ford {{realized}} {{it was late in}} introducing a fully automatic transmission to its automobile lineup. Ford Engineering Vice President Harold Youngren, recently hired away from Borg-Warner, recommended that Ford license and build a transmission using a design he was working on at his previous employer. Ford and Borg-Warner signed a contract in 1948 which entered B-W into a supply agreement wherein they would build half of Ford's transmissions for five years, with the other half either being built by Ford or by a different supplier. Because of this agreement, Ford licensed the design themselves and broke ground immediately on an assembly plant to build the remaining transmissions. The new plant, called Fairfax Transmission Plant, was dedicated in 1950. The original Ford-O-Matic accomplished two things that Ford's two previous automatic transmissions failed to do. Through the use of an <b>integrated</b> <b>torque</b> converter and planetary gearset, Ford's automatic shifted smoothly without an interruption in torque from the engine. The other was the shifting pattern, revised from PNDLR to PRNDL, which served to reduce [...] "shift shock" [...] when changing gears and reduce [...] "torque shock" [...] when trying to rock a stuck car back and forth. The original Ford-O-Matic, while capable of three forward speeds, started out in second and shifted to third, with first only being used when selecting L on the gear shift column. However, if floored from a standing start, it would immediately shift from second to low then shift back to second and then third as the vehicle accelerated. The Ford-O-Matic was manufactured from 1951 until it was replaced by the C4 in 1964.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{current study}} {{investigated}} stretch variables and mechanical factors of lengthening contractions (LC) in the processes leading to muscular mechanical hyperalgesia in rats to understand mechanisms underpinning delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Methods Under isoflurane anaesthesia, ankle extensor muscles were loaded with repetitive LC with angular stretch velocities (50 °, 100 °, 200 ° and 400 °/s) {{at a fixed}} range of motion (ROM) of 90 °, and with ROMs (30 °, 60 °, 90 ° and 120 °) at a fixed velocity of 200 °/s. Results Mechanical hyperalgesia was observed in a velocity- and ROM-dependent manner. Under the fixed ROM, <b>integrated</b> <b>torque</b> generated during LC (iTq[max]) was inversely correlated with the velocity, but the rate of torque increase during LC (rTq[max]) was positively and significantly correlated with the velocity, and the magnitude of hyperalgesia was correlated with rTq[max] (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). When the velocity was fixed, iTq[max] was significantly correlated with ROM, and the magnitude of hyperalgesia was correlated with iTq[max] (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). Necrotic myofibres were observed only sparsely (p 3 ̆c 0. 05 0. 001). Conclusions Both velocity and ROM are pivotal variables determining the initiation of mechanical hyperalgesia. Neurotrophic factor-mediated peripheral mechanisms, but apparently not inflammatory changes caused by myofibre damage, {{are responsible for the}} mechanical hyperalgesia. Significance Mechanical hyperalgesia appears after LC in a stretch velocity- and range of motion-dependent manner.

40|$|Despite the {{theoretical}} advances in optimal control, satellite attitude control is still predominantly performed by standard controllers, such as PD laws, which {{are easier to}} implement. A switched controller is proposed, based on inverse optimal control theory, which circumvents the complex task of numerically solving online the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation of the global nonlinear optimal control problem. The inverse optimization problem consists of minimizing the norm of the control torque subject to a constraint on the convergence rate of a parameterized Lyapunov function, under {{the effect of the}} benchmark controller, which is chosen to be a PD law without loss of generality. The controller is then modified by gain scheduling to achieve a tradeoff enhancement compared to the benchmark controller, while maintaining torque saturation limits. The extent to which performance can be enhanced is shown to be dependent on the controller parameters. A controller tuning analysis shows how a design settling time limit can be achieved, within the problem’s constraints on the maximum torque and the total <b>integrated</b> <b>torque.</b> The proposed optimization approach is globally stabilizing and presents low implementation complexity, which is highly desirable given the limited resources onboard small satellites...|$|E
40|$|For over 30 years, nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) techniques {{have been used to}} study materials under shear. Collectively referred to as Rheo-NMR, these methods measure material behaviour due to external stimuli and provide spatially and temporally resolved maps of NMR spectra, intrinsic NMR parameters (e. g. relaxation times) or motion (e. g. diffusion or flow). As a consequence, Rheo-NMR has been established as a complementary technique to conventional rheological measurements. In this thesis, new hardware and experimental methods are presented with the goal of advancing this exciting field through further integration of traditional rheometry techniques with NMR experiments. Three key areas of hardware development have been addressed, including: 1) <b>integrating</b> <b>torque</b> sensing into the Rheo-NMR experiment for simultaneous bulk shear stress measurements, 2) constructing shear devices with geometric parameters closer to those used on commercial rheometers and 3) implementing an advanced drive system which allows for new shear profiles including oscillatory shear.

This information demonstrates that the hardware operates as expected and establishes an experimental parameter space for these new techniques.

This includes exploring the influence of shear geometry curvature on the onset of shear banding in a wormlike micelle surfactant system, observing shear induced structural changes in a lyotropic nonionic surfactant simultaneously via deuterium spectroscopy and bulk viscosity as well as studying interactions of flowing granular materials.

The aims of this work are twofold. The first one, at a more technical level, is the implementation of a real-time software infrastructure, based on Orocos and ROS, for a general, robust, flexible and modular robot control framework with a relatively high level of abstraction. The second aim is to utilize this software framework for Programming by Demonstration with a class of algorithms known as Dynamic Movement Primitives. Using kinesthetic teaching with one or multiple demonstrations, the robot performs simple sequential in-contact tasks (e. g. writing on a notepad a previously demonstrated sequence of characters). The system is not only able to imitate and generalize from demonstrated trajectories, but also from their associated force profiles during the execution of in-contact tasks.

40|$|The {{challenging}} {{problem of}} controlling the attitude of satellites subject to actuator failures {{has been the subject}} of increased attention in recent years. The problem {{of controlling the}} attitude of a satellite on all three axes with two reaction wheels is addressed in this paper. This system is controllable in a zero momentum mode. Three axis attitude stability is proven by imposing a singular quaternion feedback law to the angular velocity trajectories. Two approaches are proposed and compared to achieve three axis control: The first one does not require angular velocity measurements and is based on the assumption of a perfect zero momentum, while the second approach consists of tracking the desired angular velocity trajectories. The full state feedback is a nonlinear singular controller. In-orbit tests of the first approach provide an unprecedented practical proof of three axis stability with two control torques. The angular velocity tracking approach is shown to be less efficient using the nonlinear singular controller. However, when inverse optimization theory is applied to enhance the nonlinear singular controller, the angular velocity tracking approach is shown to be the most efficient. The resulting switched inverse optimal controller allows for a significant enhancement of settling time, for a prescribed level of the <b>integrated</b> <b>torque...</b>|$|E
40|$|Demands on {{increased}} {{efficiency and}} reduced emission levels introduce new {{challenges for the}} design of modern diesel engines. In order to fulfill these demands, diesel engines of today {{are becoming more and more}} complex. This escalating complexity not only applies to the engine itself, but also to its control system. As a result, the interest in closed-loop combustion control is growing since it offers more accurate and robust control while requiring less calibration effort than an open-loop control system. This thesis deals with estimation of diesel engine combustion phasing, based on measurements of the crankshaft torque. The purpose is to investigate whether or not a crankshaft <b>integrated</b> <b>torque</b> sensor can provide information about the combustion phasing in a diesel engine and hence enable the control of this combustion property in closed-loop. The proposed method has previously been implemented for combustion phasing control in a gasoline engine and is in this work adapted to suit the principally different and more complex combustion process in a diesel engine. The first part of the studied method consists of separating the measured torque signal into cylinder individual torque contributions. These contributions are then used, together with a combustion model, in order to estimate combustion phasing. Both of these steps are presented and analyzed in this thesis. Based on measurement data, the results indicate that a crankshaft torque sensor is a viable source of information for closed-loop diesel engine combustion phasing control...|$|E

40|$|Gravitational {{coupling}} {{between a}} gaseous disk and an orbiting perturber leads to angular momentum exchange between them which {{can result in}} gap opening by planets in protoplanetary disks and clearing of gas by binary supermassive black holes (SMBHs) embedded in accretion disks. Understanding the co-evolution of the disk and the orbit of the perturber in these circumstances requires knowledge of the spatial distribution of the torque exerted by the latter on a highly nonuniform disk. Here we explore disk-satellite interaction in disks with gaps in linear approximation both in Fourier and in physical space, explicitly incorporating the disk non-uniformity in the fluid equations. Density gradients strongly displace the positions of Lindblad resonances in the disk (which often occur at multiple locations), and the waveforms of modes excited close to the gap edge get modified compared to the uniform disk case. The spatial distribution of the excitation torque density {{is found to be}} quite different from the existing prescriptions: most of the torque is exerted in a rather narrow region near the gap edge where Lindblad resonances accumulate, followed by an exponential fall-off with the distance from the perturber. Despite these differences, for a given gap profile the full <b>integrated</b> <b>torque</b> exerted on the disk agrees with the conventional uniform disk theory prediction at the level of ~ 10 %. The nonlinearity of the density wave excited by the perturber is shown to decrease as the wave travels out of the gap, slowing down its nonlinear evolution and damping. Our results suggest that gap opening in protoplanetary disks and gas clearing around SMBH binaries can be more efficient than the existing theories predict. They pave the way for self-consistent calculations of the gap structure and the orbital evolution of the perturber using accurate prescription for the torque density behavior.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{investigate}} the influence of isometric training protocols with long- and short-duration contractions on the elasticity of human tendon structures in vivo. The elasticity was assessed through in vivo determination of the elongation (L) of the tendons and aponeuroses using ultrasonography, while the subjects performed ramp isometric exercise up to maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Eight young males completed 12 weeks (4 days per week) of a unilateral isometric training programme on knee extensors, which consisted of two different combinations of contraction and relaxation times at 70 % MVC: one leg was trained using a short-duration protocol (3 sets of 50 repetitions of contraction for 1 s and relaxation for 2 s), and the other leg was trained using a long-duration protocol (4 sets {{of a combination of}} contraction for 20 s and relaxation for 1 min). The training volume per session, expressed as the <b>integrated</b> <b>torque,</b> was the same for the two protocols. Both protocols resulted in a significant increase in MVC: 31. 8 ± 17. 2 % for the short-duration protocol and 33. 9 ± 14. 4 % for the long-duration protocol. Moreover, the training produced significant increases in the muscle volume of the constituents of the quadriceps femoris, with similar relative gains for the two protocols: 7. 4 ± 3. 9 % for the short-duration protocol and 7. 6 ± 4. 3 % for the long-duration protocol. The short-duration protocol produced no significant change in L values at any of the force production levels. For the long-duration protocol, however, the L values above 550 N were significantly shorter after training. Analysis revealed that the group × test time interaction effect on tendon stiffness was significant. Stiffness increased significantly for the long-duration protocol, but not for the short-duration protocol. The present study demonstrates a greater increase in stiffness of human tendon structures following isometric training using longer duration contractions compared to shorter contractions. This suggests that the changes in the elasticity of the tendon structures after resistance training may be affected by the duration of muscle contraction...|$|E
