In this paper, the design problem of the maxflat FD <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> is discussed, and a new closed-form expres-sion for its filter coefficients is presented. The filter co-efficients are directly derived by solving a linear system of Vandermonde equations, which are obtained from the flatness conditions of FD filters.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} the problem of parameter optimisation in adaptive digital filtering. Adaptive digital filtering can be accomplished using both Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters and Infinite Impulse Response <b>Filters</b> (<b>IIR)</b> <b>filters.</b> Adaptive FIR filtering algorithms are well established. However, the potential computational advantages of <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> {{has led to an}} increase in research on adaptive <b>IIR</b> <b>filtering</b> algorithms.

These include Stochastic Learning Automata, Evolutionary Algorithms and Annealing Algorithms. Each of these techniques are used for the filtering problem and simulation results are presented showing the performance of the algorithms for adaptive <b>IIR</b> <b>filtering.</b> The relative merits and demerits of the different schemes are discussed. Two practical applications of adaptive <b>IIR</b> <b>filtering</b> are simulated and results of using the new adaptive strategies are presented.

50|$|Digital filters come in both IIR and FIR types. FIR filters {{have many}} advantages, but are {{computationally}} more demanding.

30|$|FIR and <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> {{have their}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages as discussed in the ‘Introduction’ Section. It is possible to design and implement FIR filters {{in such a way}} as to have a linear phase, but they have high order which leads to high complexity. On the contrary, <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> introduce phase nonlinearity but have lower order and lower complexity.|$|R
50|$|A digital <b>IIR</b> <b>filter</b> can {{generally}} approximate {{a desired}} filter response using less computing power than a FIR filter, however this advantage {{is more often}} unneeded given the increasing power of digital processors. The ease of designing and characterizing FIR filters makes them preferable to the filter designer (programmer) when ample computing power is available. Another advantage of FIR filters is that their impulse response can be made symmetric, which implies a response in the frequency domain that has zero phase at all frequencies (not considering a finite delay), which is absolutely impossible with any <b>IIR</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Using the [...] "{{convolutional}}" [...] terminology, {{a classic}} convolutional code {{might be considered}} a Finite impulse response (FIR) filter, while a recursive convolutional code might be considered an Infinite impulse response (<b>IIR)</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

50|$|Disadvantages: The {{performance}} {{surfaces of}} adaptive LMS <b>IIR</b> Adaptive <b>filters</b> are nonquadratic {{and may have}} local minima. Meanwhile, adaptive <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> may become unstable during the adaptation, thus some kind of stability monitoring is needed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The perfect linear phase {{requirement}} can {{be achieved}} only by direct design with an FIR filter {{at the expense of}} high filter order and hence high computational burden for the given specification. Alternatively, <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> can be designed with much smaller orders than their FIR counterparts, but {{at the expense of the}} nonlinear phase. However, it is possible to design almost linear-phase <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> for a given specification of the allowed phase or group delay ripples. This paper presents an improvement to the existing algorithms for the design of almost linear–phase, arbitrary-band <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> and gives a different viewpoint on these methods, showing a considerable improvement in maximum ripples of the magnitude and group delay responses. The idea of decreasing the phase non-linearity of the N-path polyphase <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> with a combination of allpass sections of different order and coefficient polarity is presented. The effect of coefficient quantization, in view of the fixed-point implementation, on the performance of the resulting filter is also shown...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—A novel {{approach}} to designing approximately linear phase infinite-impulse-response (<b>IIR)</b> digital <b>filters</b> in the passband region is introduced. The proposed approach yields digital <b>IIR</b> <b>filters</b> whose numerators represent linear phase finite-impulse-response (FIR) filters. As an example, low-pass IIR differentiators are introduced. The range and high-frequency sup-pression {{of the proposed}} low-pass differentiators are comparable to those obtained by higher order FIR low-pass differentiators. In addition, the differentiators exhibit almost linear phases in the passband regions.
