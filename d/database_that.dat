5|$|ContactPoint was a {{government}} <b>database</b> <b>that</b> held information on all children under 18 in England. It {{was created in}} response to the abuse and death of eight-year-old Victoria Climbié in 2000 in England. Various agencies involved in her care had failed to prevent her death. ContactPoint aimed to improve child protection by improving the way information about children was shared between services. It was designed by Capgemini and previously had the working titles of Information Sharing Index (or IS Index or ISI) and the Children's Index.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{examples}} of protein pairs related by a circular permutation were subsequently discovered in nature or produced in the laboratory. As of February 2012, the Circular Permutation Database contains 2,238 circularly permuted protein pairs with known structures, and many more are known without structures. The CyBase database collects proteins that are cyclic, {{some of which are}} permuted variants of cyclic wild-type proteins. SISYPHUS is a <b>database</b> <b>that</b> contains a collection of hand-curated manual alignments of proteins with non-trivial relationships, several of which have circular permutations.|$|E

Examples include customer <b>databases</b> <b>that</b> record contact, credit, and demographic information about a business' customers, personnel <b>databases</b> <b>that</b> hold information such as salary, benefits, skills data about employees, enterprise resource planning systems that record details about product components, parts inventory, and financial <b>databases</b> <b>that</b> {{keep track of the}} organization's money, accounting and financial dealings.|$|R

5|$|The 1980s {{also saw}} the birth of Cyc, the first attempt to attack the commonsense {{knowledge}} problem directly, by creating a massive <b>database</b> <b>that</b> would contain all the mundane facts that the average person knows. Douglas Lenat, who started and led the project, argued {{that there is no}} shortcut ― the only way for machines to know the meaning of human concepts is to teach them, one concept at a time, by hand. The project was not expected to be completed for many decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the National Geographic Database, the National Register of Electors is used to create preliminary voters lists for each electoral district in Canada for each election, byelection, and referendum. Each candidate from each electoral district is given a voters list for that district, which is {{a subset of the}} data in the National Register of Electors whose addresses are within the boundaries of the district as defined in the National Geographic <b>Database.</b> <b>That</b> data may only be used for election purposes; any other use of that data subjects the user to penalties including fines, imprisonment, or both. The voter lists are updated by returning officers based on information received during an election campaign, ultimately resulting in final voters lists being distributed by election day.|$|E
5|$|London {{also has}} a rich history in {{underground}} music. Noise pioneers, the Nihilist Spasm Band were formed in the city in 1965. Between 1966 and 1971, the group held a Monday night residency at the York Hotel in the city's core, which established it as a popular venue for emerging musicians and artists. Now known as Call the Office, the venue served as a hotbed for punk music in the late 1970s and 1980 and continues to host college rock bands and weekly alternative music nights. In 2003, CHRW-FM developed the London Music Archives, an online music <b>database</b> <b>that</b> chronicles every album recorded in London between 1967 and 2006.|$|E

5|$|The 1986 SQL {{standard}} basically adopted Codd's proposal {{after an}} implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls (alongside duplicate rows) {{as one of}} the most controversial features of SQL, he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information, saving the programmer from many duplicative application-level checks (see semipredicate problem) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires; for example, in order to avoid well known anomalies (discussed in the semantics section of this article). Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing-value functionality, practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls, like certain grouping constructs and outer joins. Finally, he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent, coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information; for example, a <b>database</b> <b>that</b> quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles-per-gallon column.|$|E
