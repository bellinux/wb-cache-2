Pipelines are widely used in industrial applications for the transport of multiphase mixtures of liquid phases or gas and liquid phases. <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> {{is an important component}} of pipeline systems. The numerical study of multiphase flow through <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> have been started a long back. This paper presents a model of multiphase flow through <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> and the redistribution phenomenon of phases at the junction using ANSYS FLUENT Softwar...|$|R

40|$|Microfluidic {{technology}} offers capabilities for the precise handling of small fluid volumes dispersed as droplets. To fully exploit this potential requires simultaneous generation of multiple size droplets. We demonstrate two methods for passively breaking larger drops into precisely controlled daughter drops using pressure-driven flow in simple microfluidic configurations: (i) a <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> and (ii) flow past isolated obstacles. We quantify conditions for breakup at a <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> and illustrate sequential breakup at <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> for making small drops at high dispersed phase volume fractions...|$|R
40|$|Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) based <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> were {{designed}} and studied in this paper. These junctions were {{made up of}} shoulders (zigzag GNRs) joined with stems (armchair GNRs). We demonstrated the intrinsic transport properties and effective boron (or nitrogen) doping of the junctions by using first principles quantum transport simulation. Several interesting results were found: i) The I-V characteristics of the pure-carbon <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> were shown to obey Ohm law and the electrical conductivity of the junction depends on {{the height of the}} stem sensitively. ii) boron (or nitrogen) doping on the stems doesnt change the Ohm law of the <b>T</b> <b>junctions,</b> but the result is opposite when doping process occurs at the shoulders. This feature could make such quasi- 2 D <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> a possible candidate for nanoscale junction devices in a 2 D network of nanoelectronic devices in which conducting pathways can be controlled.

40|$|We propose an {{approach}} for representing an object by its constituent parts and their spatial connections. The approach {{is based on}} a set of primitive volumes called geons. We utilize the edge-junction graph of an object range image as input. This is a graph whose nodes are the junctions and whose arcs are the edges detected from the range image. The three-dimensional geometrical information at <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> allows us to group pairs of corresponding <b>T</b> <b>junctions.</b> By following occluding, limb, concave edges and linking pairs of corresponding <b>T</b> <b>junctions,</b> we decompose the edge-junction graph into different subgraphs. Each of these subgraphs then corresponds to a constituent part of the object. For each part, edge curvature and type guide us to an inference regarding the corresponding geon shape. Also, the spatial connections among these parts can be deduced from concave edges and pairs of corresponding <b>T</b> <b>junctions.</b> Finally, the object is described by a directed graph whose nodes represent the part shapes and whose directed arcs represent the spatial connections...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{remarkable}} regularity of {{the rock}} columns outlined by the cooling related contraction joints in lava flows at sites such as the Giant's Causeway, Ireland, Fingal's Cave, Scotland and the Devil's Postpile, California is well known. Columnar joints are the only system of natural fractures to approach an optimal hexagonal honeycomb-like pattern. 3 -connected vertices in near-surface natural-fracture networks are almost exclusively orthogonal “T-type” junctions. Columnar joints owe their unique quasihexagonal symmetry and the prevalence of six-sided columns {{to the presence of}} “Y” junctions. Initially, the cooling-related fracture network at the upper and lower surfaces of a flow are dominated by <b>T</b> <b>junctions</b> and are similar in appearance to mudcrack patterns. However, as the tips of these cracks grow towards the center of the flow to relieve the thermal strain which develops there during cooling, the poorly positioned ones are eliminated or modified to yield a more regular network dominated by Y rather than <b>T</b> <b>junctions...</b>|$|R
5000|$|An {{experiment}} {{was done in}} Illinois, United States to allow going straight on red (following rules analogous to those used for turns on red) when approaching a <b>T</b> <b>junction</b> on the main road, with the intersecting road on the left.

In such cases, often that lane is also specially delimited with pavement markings or other lane separation devices, to keep left-turning traffic on the intersecting road from colliding with traffic proceeding through the intersection on the main road. The seagull intersection was developed as a safer variation of this.|$|R
