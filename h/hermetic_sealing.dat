40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{in vitro}} {{the effect of}} cavity preparation with microburs and diamond-coated ultrasonic tips on the microleakage and marginal fit of six end-root filling materials. Study Design. The following materials were assessed: amalgam (Amalcap), zinc oxide eugenol (IRM), glass ionomer (Vitrebond), compomer (Cavalite), mineral particle aggregate (MTA) and composite (Clearfil). Cavity preparation was performed with microburs or diamond ultrasonic tips in single-root teeth. The seal was evaluated in two experiments: a microleakage assay on the passage of dye to the interface; and a scanning electron microscopy study and analysis of epoxy resin replicas, measuring the size of gaps in the interface between filling material and cavity walls. Multifactorial ANOVA, multiple comparison test and Student?s t test were used for statistical analyses of the data, considering p< 0. 05 to be significant. Results: Clearfil and MTA achieved a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal.</b> Leakage and interface gap size was greater with Cavalite than with Clearfil and MTA, followed by Vitrebond and IRM. The worst seal was obtained with Amalcap. The use of diamond-coated ultrasonic tips improved the seal and reduced the gap when using materials that did not hermetically seal the cavity (Amalcap, IRM, Cavalite, Vitrebond). The preparation technique did not affect materials that achieved a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> (Clearfil, MTA). Conclusions: Clearfil and MTA obtained a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> due to their excellent marginal fit and are the most recommended materials for clinical use, taking account of their sealing capacity. Ultrasonic cavity preparation is preferable because it improves the seal and marginal fit of materials that do not achieve a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> of the cavity (Amalcap, IRM, Cavalite, Vitrebond) ...|$|R

50|$|These {{transistors}} {{were the}} first to have both diffused bases and diffused emitters.

5000|$|<b>Hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of {{laboratory}} glassware involves using {{a thin layer}} of Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) material or grease to get an airtight seal. The seal may be applied to the ground-glass surfaces to be connected, and the inner joint is inserted into the outer joint such that the ground-glass surfaces of each are next to each other to make the connection. This helps provide a good seal and prevents the joint from seizing, allowing the parts to be disassembled easily. Although silicone grease used as a sealant and a lubricant for interconnecting ground glass joints is normally assumed to be chemically inert, some compounds have resulted from unintended reactions with silicones.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{resistance}} {{element of a}} foil resistor is a special alloy foil several micrometers thick. Since their introduction in the 1960s, foil resistors have had the best precision and stability of any resistor available.

50|$|The first {{hermetically}} sealed models were the P8-9-10 of 1971 using titanium encapsulation with ceramic terminal insulation, developed by David J Cowdery. Bonding of the ceramic was performed using vacuum brazing and an alloy of titanium/nickel {{with a small}} % of copper. The final <b>hermetic</b> <b>sealing</b> of the titanium capsule was performed by a TIG tungsten-inert gas argon welding process within a large bell jar on an automated analogue controlled machine designed and built by Cowdery. These were the first pacemakers using the conventional battery to be {{hermetically sealed}}. Gas products of the battery were absorbed by a chemical 'getter'. Some examples of these models survived to beyond 5 years. By the late 80's TIG welding was replaced by laser welding.|$|E
50|$|Metal, {{and some}} hard plastic valve caps have a rubber-washer seal (or a synthetic-rubber-washer seal) inside {{to help make}} a <b>hermetic</b> <b>seal</b> (airtight seal).

In addition, the rubber washer prevents the cap from loosening and falling off due to vibrations and hence being lost, by acting as a cushion between the cap and the valve stem {{and in this way}} damping the vibrations, though most caps are a softer plastic making the need for a separate seal unnecessary.|$|R
