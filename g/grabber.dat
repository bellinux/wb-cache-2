50|$|Board <b>grabs</b> are tricks {{performed}} while a rider is jumping or {{has gained}} air from popping by <b>grabbing</b> {{the board in}} a number of positions with either hand. Each <b>grab</b> has a different name dependent on which part of the board is <b>grabbed</b> and with which hand it is <b>grabbed</b> by. Rear hand <b>grabs</b> are known as Crail, Indy, Nuke, Tindy, Tail, Tailfish, and Stalefish; while front hand <b>grabs</b> are known as Slob, Mute, Seatbelt, Melan, Method, and Nose.

The first <b>grabbing</b> jaw (2) is placed on a freely accessible first surface {{in the form of}} a surface of the object or a freely accessible side surface of the object. The second <b>grabbing</b> jaw (3) is placed on a second surface {{in the form of a}}n additional freely accessible surface of the object. The first <b>grabbing</b> jaw is pressed with a pressure until an object-specific friction is reached between the first <b>grabbing</b> jaw and the first surface or side surface of the object. The <b>grabbing</b> jaws are arranged at an angle to each other. Before the start of object transport, the <b>grabbing</b> jaws serve as a tilting device about an axis of rotation. Rotation about the base surface edge of the object occurs which restricts the freely accessible side surface of the object with the second <b>grabbing</b> jaw against a support and after rotation th e second <b>grabbing</b> jaw lies underneath the new standing surface of the object. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for: (1) Alternative devices; and (2) Processes for <b>grabbing,</b> transporting and repositioning non-spaced stacked objects.

500|$|While {{reviewing}} the album, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said the songs produced by David Foster are too predictable {{due to their}} [...] "slick commercial appeal". However, Erlewine noted that Braxton [...] "manages to infuse the songs with life and passion that elevates them beyond their generic confines" [...] due to her vocal ability. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly considered the track [...] "a tearjerker so grandiose and yet so intrinsically, assuredly hit-bound, it's the kind of mass-appeal <b>grabber</b> that's probably already sent a jealous Diana Ross diving for a comfort gallon of Häagen-Dazs." [...] Tucker also named it the worst track on Secrets, and further stated: [...] "Un-Break My Heart" [...] is [...] "one of those the-verses-exist-only-for-the-swelling-chorus showstoppers that allude to emotions without ever actually embodying them.

This paper finds that the various dominant definitions of land <b>grabs</b> each apply only partially to southern Chile, that land <b>grabs</b> for conservation need to be understood as the latest stage in a longer process by which the region's natural resources are incorporated into the Chilean and the global economy, and that green <b>grabs</b> interact in various ways with broader resource <b>grabs,</b> particularly for forestry and hydroelectricity.
