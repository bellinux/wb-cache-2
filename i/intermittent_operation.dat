40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{dynamic model}} of the recently introduced semi-solid flow battery system is developed and applied to address issues with important design and operation implications. Because of the high viscosity of semi-solid flow battery suspensions, alternative modes of operation not typically used in conventional redox flow battery systems must be explored to reduce pumping energy losses. Modeling results are presented and compared to experimental observations to address important considerations for both stoichiometric and <b>intermittent</b> flow <b>operation.</b> The importance of active material selection, {{and its impact on}} efficient stoichiometric flow operation is discussed. Electrochemically active zone considerations relevant to <b>intermittent</b> flow <b>operation</b> of semi-solid flow batteries (or other potential electronically conductive flow battery systems) are addressed. Finally, the use of the model as a design tool for optimizing flow channel design to improve system level performance is demonstrated. by Victor Eric Brunini. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|A photoinjector, PHIN (PHotoINjector), {{has been}} {{realized}} at CERN by {{a joint effort}} of several institutes within the European Coordinated Accelerator Research in Europe program. The test facility has been installed and commissioned at CERN with the aim to demonstrate the beam parameters needed for the CLIC Test Facility  3 (CTF 3). This beam is unique with respect to its long bunch train and high average charge per bunch requirements. The nominal beam for CTF 3 consists of 1908 bunches each having a 2. 33  nC charge and a bunch frequency of 1. 5  GHz. Thus, a total charge of ∼ 4. 4 [*][*]μC has to be extracted and accelerated. The stability of the intensity and the beam parameters along this exceptionally high average current train is crucial for the correct functioning of the CLIC drive beam scheme. Consequently, extensive time-resolved measurements of the transverse and longitudinal beam parameters have been developed, optimized, and performed. The shot-to-shot intensity stability has been studied in detail for the electron and the laser beams, simultaneously. The PHIN photoinjector has been commissioned between 2008 and 2010 during <b>intermittent</b> <b>operations.</b> This paper reports on the obtained results in order to demonstrate the feasibility and {{the stability of the}} required beam parameters...|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, many type N {{connectors}} are not labeled, {{and it can}} {{be difficult}} to prevent this situation in a mixed impedance environment. The situation is further complicated by some makers of 75 ohm sockets designing them with enough spring yield to accept the larger 50 ohm pin without irreversible damage, while others clearly do not, and expect users to segregate their connectors and adaptors. In general a 50 ohm socket is not damaged by a 75 ohm pin, but the loose fit means the contact quality is not guaranteed; this can cause poor or <b>intermittent</b> <b>operation,</b> with the thin 75 ohm male pin only barely mating with the larger 50 ohm socket in the female.|$|E

The exhauster would be used during air jetting of accumulated liquids from the cell sumps into the tanks and to make transfers among the tanks within the vault when needed.

Since cessation of vault operations an extremely large amount of rain water and snow melt have accumulated in the cell sumps. The water level in the sumps is substantially above their respective operating levels and there is concern for leakage to the environment through containment failure due to corrosion from backed-up sump liquid. Active ventilation is required to provide contamination control during air jetting operations within the vault.
