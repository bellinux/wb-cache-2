40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a process for the sanitation of weathered <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> surfaces {{and the removal of}} <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> fibres by which the weathered <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> areas are cooled down to a temperature below the freezing point of water, the cooled <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> areas are sprayed with water, the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> areas which exhibit an ice layer are thawed out at ambient temperature and the water resulting from the ice is collected together with the flushed asbestos fibres and the free fibres contained in said collected water is disposed in known ways...|$|R
40|$|<b>Asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> {{pipelines}} {{constitute a}} significant portion of the potable and waste water systems in many countries in the world, including Australia. Most of the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes in the developed countries were installed before 1980, and many utilities are observing that the breakage rate is increasing with the ageing of the pipe. Condition assessment for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes is of important necessity for prioritising rehabilitation and preventing catastrophic pipe failure; however, few techniques are available for direct assessment of the condition of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes and most of them are localised and destructive. This article outlines a pilot field study of the non-invasive and non-destructive condition assessment of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipelines using fluid transient pressure waves. Fluid transient analysis previously conducted by the authors for metallic pipelines is further developed and adapted to <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipes for the detection of localised defects. A new sub-sectional condition assessment technique is proposed for determining the effective wall thicknesses of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> sub-sections within a section of pipe bounded by two measurement points. A field trial is conducted in Australia on an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> water main (which has class changes with varying wall thicknesses) to verify the proposed techniques. The wave speeds, lengths and wall thicknesses of sub-sections in different classes are determined and the results are consistent with the information in the design drawings provided by the water utility. This field study, for the first time, verifies that controlled fluid transient waves can be used as a tool for non-invasive and non-destructive condition assessment of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> pipelines.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} mortality from {{lung cancer}} {{and the risk}} attributable to asbestos separately for <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers and for the general (non-occupationally exposed) population {{in the town of}} Casale Monferrato, where the largest Italian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory had been in operation in 1907 - 86. According to cancer registry data, in the same town the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the general population is about 10 times higher than in comparable Italian provinces. METHOD: Decedents from lung cancer in 1989 - 95 were nominally identified in the list of decedents kept at the Local Health Authority of Casale Monferrato. Workers in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> factory have been identified with a search in the nominal list of workers and the same was done for the wives of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. These lists have already been used in cohort studies. Sensitivity and specificity of the linkage procedure with occupational activity in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production have been evaluated in a previous study. Population at risk was estimated on the basis of official figures and on the results of the cohort study of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers. RESULTS: 227 deaths from lung cancer were included (184 men and 43 women). Among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers mortalities were 234. 0 x 100, 000 person-years among men and 35. 5 among women. Corresponding figures in the general (non- occupationally exposed) population in Casale Monferrato were 80. 6 and 18. 7. The rates in the general population were not higher than {{in the rest of the}} region. Attributable risk (AR) among the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers (and wives) is 67. 5 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 56. 8 to 78. 2) for men and 51. 3 % (95 % CI 14. 9 to 87. 8) among women. Population AR to occupational or paraoccupational exposure in the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production is 18. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 1 to 25. 6) among men and 10. 1 % (95 % CI 0 to 24. 6) among women. CONCLUSION: This work did not show an increase in mortality from lung cancer for the population not exposed occupationally, but a large excess was found among men and women occupationally exposed in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production. The total burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to asbestos may be underestimated, as only occupational exposure in <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> production was taken into consideration. Nevertheless even a single factory can be responsible for a considerable proportion of deaths from lung cancer in a population...|$|R

40|$|The {{predominant}} {{asbestos fibre}} type {{used in the}} production of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> is chrysotile. The use of asbestos in relation to fibre type in a Norwegian <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> plant during 1942 - 80 was 91. 7 % chrysotile, 3. 1 % amosite, 4. 1 % crocidolite, and 1. 1 % anthophyllite respectively. Electron microscopy and x ray microanalysis of lung tissue samples of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> workers who had died of malignant pleural mesothelioma or bronchogenic carcinoma showed a completely inverse ratio with regard to fibre type.

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were: (i) the mapping of <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> roofs in an urban area; and (ii) the {{development}} of a spectral index related to the roof weathering status. Aerial images were collected through the Multispectral Infrared and Visible Imaging Spectrometer (MIVIS) sensor, which acquires data in 102 channels from the visible to the thermal infrared spectral range. An image based supervised classification was performed using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) algorithm. The SAM was trained through a set of pixels selected on roofs of different materials. The map showed an average producer’s accuracy (PA) of 86 % and a user’s accuracy (UA) of 89 % for the <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> class. A novel spectral index, the “Index of Surface Deterioration” (ISD), was defined based on measurements collected with a portable spectroradiometer on <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> roofs that were characterized by different weathering statuses. The ISD was then calculated on the MIVIS images, allowing the distinction of two weathering classes (i. e., high and low). The <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> map was handled in a Geographic Information System (GIS) in order to supply the municipalities with the cadastral references of each property having an <b>asbestos</b> <b>cement</b> roof. This tool can be purposed for municipalities as an aid to prioritize asbestos removal, based on roof weathering status...|$|R
