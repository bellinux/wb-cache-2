5000|$|Norman Rockwell's {{image of}} [...] "Rosie the Riveter" [...] {{received}} mass distribution {{on the cover}} of the Saturday Evening Post on Memorial Day, May 29, 1943. Rockwell's illustration features a brawny woman taking her lunch break with a rivet gun on her lap and beneath her penny loafer a copy of Hitler's manifesto, Mein Kampf. Her lunch box reads [...] "Rosie"; viewers quickly recognized this to be [...] "Rosie the Riveter" [...] from the familiar song. Rockwell, America's best-known popular illustrator of the day, based the pose of his 'Rosie' on that of Michelangelo's 1509 Sistine Chapel ceiling [...] Rosie is holding a ham sandwich in her left hand, and her blue overalls are adorned with badges and buttons: a Red Cross blood donor button, a white [...] "V for Victory" [...] button, a Blue Star Mothers pin, an Army-Navy E Service production award pin, two bronze civilian service awards, and her personal <b>identity</b> <b>badge.</b> Rockwell's model was a Vermont resident, 19-year-old Mary Doyle, who was a telephone operator near where Rockwell lived, not a riveter. Rockwell painted his [...] "Rosie" [...] as a larger woman than his model, and he later phoned to apologize. In a post interview, Mary explained that she was actually holding a sandwich while posing for the poster and that the rivet-gun she was holding was fake, she never saw Hitler's copy of Mein Kampf, and she did have a white handkerchief in her pocket like the picture depicts. The Posts cover image proved hugely popular, and the magazine loaned it to the U.S. Treasury Department for the duration of the war, for use in war bond drives.|$|E
5000|$|First {{step was}} to {{determine}} whether it was indeed a Serbian soldier in the grave under the wooden cross. An exhumation was conducted by the commission on 23 November 1921. Parts of the grenade are found under the skull, almost as a pillow, while the skeleton had the blown left side of the chest, so it is estimated that he was killed by the Austro-Hungarian howitzer while he was watching from the lookout. He was apparently buried in the crater formed by the explosion of the very grenade that killed him. Other objects found in the grave include: parts of the military blouse, Serbian bandolier (belt with fišeklijas, the powder pockets, full of ammunition), knapsack, military boots with telephone wires instead of the shoe laces, a wallet with three coins: two 1904 Serbian coins of 2 dinars, with the profile of King Peter I of Serbia, and one coin of 1 groschen (that is, 20 paras from 1912) and a piece of paper, barely recognizable, which is suspected to be a 10 dinars banknote from 1908. The soldier had no <b>identity</b> <b>badge</b> which suggests that he was either member of the Third Call regiments (with soldiers over 38 years old) or was drafted immediately prior to the battle which is probably correct as the skeletal remains pointed out to a very young male, no older than 19-20 years. It was said that his skull was [...] "small, like of a boy" [...] and that skeleton was petite, of a boyish, thin stature. The ammunition was Russian (Tula Arms Plant, 1906), 7.62 x 57 mm, which means that he used the riffle Mosin-Nagant M1891. The boots were American, M-1910, mostly distributed {{to the members of the}} Personnel department and, to the lesser extent, to the regiments of the First Call (which drafted the youngest soldiers, up to 31 years old). The commission concluded that the remains do belong to the Serbian soldier and reburied him, with the grenade parts, while his personal belongings were taken to the cabinet of the president of the assembly for safekeeping.|$|E

40|$|The use of electronically-based {{physical}} access {{cards to}} secure premises such as government buildings and large corporate offices {{has been in}} operation {{since the inception of}} barcode and magnetic stripe cards in the 1970 s. Over time, for secure access control, these first generation card technologies, based on optical character recognition (OCR) and magnetic ink character recognition (MICR), were replaced by more sophisticated technologies such as smart cards and biometrics, containing encrypted data and techniques that were more difficult to dupe or to replicate (Michael, 2003 a). An employee today, wanting to gain access to their place of work, typically carries a photo identity card in addition to a contactless smart card based on radio-frequency technology, and may also use one of his/her unique physical characteristics (e. g. fingerprint, palmprint, iris or face) for verification. Generally, the more information-sensitive the public or private enterprise, the greater the security measures introduced to safeguard against fraudulent activities. Card technologies, nonetheless, which are items carried by personnel, can also be lost or stolen, and photograph <b>identity</b> <b>badges</b> can also be falsely replicated. This has led some innovators to consider the potential of radio-frequency identification (RFID) or implantable devices for employee identification, with the added possibility of using wireless networks to undertake location fixes on employees in large premises (e. g. open cut mines or manufacturing plants). Automatic identification devices have the added capability of providing access to militarised zones, based on roles and privileges as defined by administrator access control matrices...|$|R
40|$|Animators, architects, designers, {{and others}} {{active in the}} Chinese {{creative}} industries are expert users of tools, both analog and digital. Performances of expert tool use (the wearing of professional identity badges) are strategic ways of signaling creativity understood as sets of skills and character traits essential for attracting work projects but also for professional identity formation. Analogue tools are generally associated with creative openness and fluidity whereas digital tools are discursively constructed as a technological other to the analogue. ‘Older’ creatives (born before 1980) tend to apply some of the media-inflected discourse around the balinghou generation (born 1980 – 1989) to their younger competitors, including an assumed affinity with digital media and technologies (the pinning on of a generational <b>identity</b> <b>badge).</b> Such generational assumptions can {{have the effect of}} reinforcing project hierarchies and denying expert users of digital tools their claims to creativity...|$|E

In the four 20 -minute sessions when hand hygiene was monitored concurrently by the system and infection control nurse, the compliance were 88. 9 % and 95. 6 % respectively (p = 0. 34), and the activity indices were 11. 1 and 12. 9 opportunities per hour, respectively. The hours from 12 : 00 to 14 : 00 had a notably lower compliance (21. 3 %, 95 %CI: 17. 2, 25. 3) than nearly three quarters of the other periods of the day (p < 0. 001). Nurses who used shared badges had significantly (p < 0. 01) lower compliance (23. 7 %, 95 %CI: 17. 8, 29. 6) than both the registered nurses (36. 1 %, 95 %CI: 34. 2, 37. 9) and nursing officers (34. 0 %, 95 %CI: 31. 1, 36. 9) who used named badges.

5000|$|The medieval {{standard}} was usually about eight feet long, but Tudor heralds determined different lengths, {{according to the}} rank of the nobility. [...] "The Great Standard to be sette before the Kinges pavilion or tent - not to be borne in battle" [...] - was 33-foot long. A duke's {{standard was}} 21-foot in length, and that of the humble knight, 12-foot long. These standards, or personal flags, were displayed by armigerous commanders in battle, but mustering and rallying functions were performed by livery flags; notably the standard which bore the liveries and badges familiar to the retainers and soldiers, of which their uniforms were composed. The St. George in the hoist of each standard was the communal symbol of national <b>identity.</b> This <b>badge</b> or banner of England, {{at the head of the}} standard, was the indication that the men assembled beneath it were first, Englishmen, and secondly, the followers of the man whose arms were continued on the standard.|$|R
