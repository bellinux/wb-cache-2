5|$|In 1970, {{the model}} M400 was released, which {{contained}} 35 notes (G–F) and a removable tape frame. It sold over 1,800 units. By the early 1970s, hundreds {{of the instruments}} were assembled and sold by EMI under <b>exclusive</b> <b>licence.</b> Following a financial and trademark dispute through a US distribution agreement, the Mellotron name was acquired by American-based Sound Sales. Streetly-manufactured instruments after 1976 were sold under the name Novatron. The American Mellotron distributor, Sound Sales, produced their own Mellotron model, the 4-Track, in the early 1980s. At the same time Streetly Electronics produced a road-cased version of the 400– the T550 Novatron. By the mid-1980s, both Sound Sales and Streetly Electronics suffered severe financial setbacks, losing their market to synthesizers and solid-state electronic samplers, which rendered the Mellotron essentially extinct. The company folded in 1986, and Les Bradley threw most of the manufacturing equipment into a skip. From 1963 until Streetly's closure, around 2,500 units had been built.|$|E
5|$|During Straits Settlements times, cases {{pertaining}} to Singapore appeared in various privately produced and official series of law reports such as Kyshe's Reports (covering cases decided between 1808 and 1939), the Straits Law Journal (1839–1891) and the Straits Settlements Law Reports (1867–1942). From 1932 until 1992, Singapore cases appeared {{regularly in the}} Malayan Law Journal (MLJ), the only local series of law reports published continuously since the 1930s, except during World War II. The MLJ is still consulted for Singapore cases decided prior to full independence in 1965. Since 1992, judgments of the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore {{have appeared in the}} Singapore Law Reports (SLR), which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> from the Supreme Court of Singapore.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a sample of}} 180 technology licensing contracts closed by German chemical, pharmaceutical, and electrical engineering companies between 1880 and 1913. A regression analysis shows that licensing contracts closed before a patent was granted and contracts closed between firms and individual inventors had a higher probability of including a profit-sharing clause. This supports Jensen and Thursby's (2001) model, who propose equity-sharing licensing contracts to solve moral hazard problems. Moreover, we show that milestones were a substitute for profit shares. Furthermore, <b>exclusive</b> <b>licences</b> offered a significantly higher profit share to the licensor...|$|R

25|$|The Duchy Originals brand was {{originally}} conceived in 1990 as {{an outlet for}} the organic food grown on the Prince of Wales Highgrove House estate and the first product was oaten biscuits. Products were initially sold through high-end stores such as Harrods and Fortnum & Mason. During the 1990s Duchy Originals products began being stocked in farm shops and independent delicatessens and expansion during the 2000s saw a selected range of Duchy Originals products becoming widely available in most major UK supermarkets, with Waitrose as the brand's largest customer. By 2008 sales of Duchy Originals had raised over £7 million cumulatively for The Prince of Wales's Charitable Foundation. Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008 the Duchy Originals business began making losses, amounting to around £3 million in 2009, and in September of that year {{it was announced that}} Duchy Originals had agreed an exclusive deal with Waitrose. From August 2010 products were relaunched under the Duchy Originals from Waitrose brand and the then range of around 200 lines was expanded to over 300. Waitrose invested heavily in the brand and sales doubled during {{the first three years of}} the exclusive arrangement. By 2013 the brand was selling in 30 countries including Australia and Japan. In the summer of 2015 the brand name was changed to Waitrose Duchy Organic. Waitrose has an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> to originate, manufacture, distribute and sell Duchy products within the UK through its stores as well as via third parties. The tradition of donating royalties to charity has continued and the Prince of Wales has continued his involvement with the brand.|$|E

500|$|Over {{the next}} few years Butlin toured the country with the Hills Travelling Fair, leaving his mother to run the Olympia site. Soon he had his own {{travelling}} fair visiting country fairs such as Barnstaple. Butlin opened some permanently sited stalls in 1925, in Barry Island, Wales. In 1927 he leased a piece of land from the Earl of Scarbrough in the seaside town of Skegness. On this land, he set up an amusement park with hoopla stalls, a tower slide, a haunted house, and [...] a scenic railway. In 1928, Butlin secured an <b>exclusive</b> <b>licence</b> to sell Dodgem cars in Europe. The first Dodgems in Britain were available in his park at Skegness; other showmen bought Dodgems from Butlin. His activities in Skegness continued to expand, and by 1930 included a zoo featuring lions, zebras and an African village.|$|E
40|$|While {{the current}} system of {{auctioning}} <b>exclusive</b> <b>licences</b> may {{be the best way to}} allocate new frequencies for today, spectrum auctions may soon become technologically obsolete, economically inefficient, and legally unconstitutional. An alternative is to step beyond the current paradigm of licensed exclusivity to a system of full openness of entry. This would allow access to spectrum bands through access fees that are determined by demand and supply conditions at the time. Prices for access would vary, depending on congestion. Long-term access at a certain price could be obtained by using a futures market. Such a system converts fixed costs of entry into marginal costs of usage, and removes incentives for collusive pricing. ...|$|R

2500|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, judgements handed down by the courts are {{considered}} a source of law. Judgements may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity which have been laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges.

[...] Authors are not charged for publishing in MNRAS, with the costs of publications being met by subscriptions. MNRAS provides a form of open access by providing authors with the option to pay for publication, allowing free access by anyone without charge (hybrid open-access model). Fellows of the RAS are given free online access to the RAS journals {{as part of their}} membership benefits. Downloadable PDF versions of MNRAS articles are made available 36 months after publication (delayed open-access model), on both the journal website and the Astrophysics Data System. MNRAS also permits self-archiving by authors on personal webpages, in institutional repositories, and on the arXiv server (green open access). Also, authors are provided with a link to a perpetually freely accessible PDF file, the idea being that the file itself should not be hosted by the author nor by anyone except the publisher, while the link to it can be freely distributed.

40|$|Summary: There are {{approximately}} 40 Rubus breeding programmes in 19 countries and since 1980, 142 raspberry and 50 blackberry cultivars have been released.

Most raspberry breeders are using wild forms of R. idaeus or wild Rubus species as germplasm and several new cultivars {{have more than one}} donor species in their ancestry.

50|$|Is {{there any}} {{meaningful}} difference between assignments and <b>exclusive</b> <b>licences?</b> If it is true, as the dissent argues, that exclusive licensee {{would have no}} way to give effect to his right to exclude all others including the copyright owner without the right to sue for copyright infringement, then it would seem necessary to collapse any legal distinction between assignments and exclusive licenses in order to give meaning to section 2.7. If {{there was no other way}} to give effect to the right to exclude, than section 2.7 would in fact require that the two concepts be merged.However, it is clear that a claim for copyright infringement is not the only claim that an exclusive licensee could make; an exclusive licensee might also claim for breach of contract. The main difference in law between a claim for breach of contract and a claim for copyright infringement is that the normal remedy for breach of contract is to order the payment of damages, whereas the normal remedy for copyright infringement is an injunction forbidding copying henceforth.|$|R
