40|$|Isothermal and nonisothermal crystallizations of maleic anhydride-modified iPP in <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> model {{composites}} with unsized and sized <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> {{were studied}} by {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC), to evaluate the influence of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> on crystallization behavior. Isothermal crystallization was followed in the temperature range from 391 K to 403 K, and the rate constant and Avrami exponents were determined. Nonisothermal crystallization was carried out at different cooling rates (1 - 20 K/min). It {{was found that the}} crystallization kinetics of MAH-iPP was significantly altered in model composites. Decreased energy of formation of a nucleus with critical dimensions and decreased activation energy for nonisothermal crystallization were determined for the model composites with sized <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> indicating faster growth of lamellae, in spite of model composite with unsized <b>glass</b> <b>fibres...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{modification}} of polypropylene (PP) {{with a combination}} of ethylene, propylene rubber (EPR) and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> (GF) is a well known route to improving its mechanical properties. This is because the reductions in stiffness and strength due to the presence Of rubber particles are more than compensated by the addition of short <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> This study has focused on the combined effects of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and rubber particles on the mechanical properties and mechanisms of deformation in PP-EPR-GF hybrid composites. Several composites with different amounts of rubber and short <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> were examined. To study possible synergistic effects, the total combined weight fraction of rubber and fibres was kept constant at 20 %. The results of tensile tests show that the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> to PP EPR blends promotes yield strength and modulus while reducing elongation at break. Optical microscopy shows that, in the damage zones of all specimens, deformation bands. which appear similar to crazes, are visible after stretching. Scanning electron microscopy shows crazelike features including some voids, which tend to deviate from in plane propagation near the ends of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> The dominant mechanism of deformation in PP EPR GF observed in this work appears to be a crazelike type of damage, which is believed to be highly localised dilatational shear banding, propagating via repeated cavitation...|$|R
40|$|Process-induced {{strength}} loss {{is a major}} {{technical barrier}} to the effective reuse of thermally recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in composite applications. We have developed a novel approach to effectively restore strength in <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> through treatment in alkaline solutions. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibres</b> were treated at elevated temperature and experienced significant strength loss found typically after thermal recycling processes. Different alkaline treatments were then applied to the thermally damaged fibres {{in an attempt to}} restore strength which had been lost {{as a result of the}} heat conditioning procedure. Results indicated that these treatments were able to generate considerable fibre strength recovery. The degree of strength regeneration was found to be highly dependent on reaction conditions, which were investigated and optimised. The positive effect of these simple chemical treatments demonstrated great potential for facilitating the reuse of thermally recycled <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in composite applications...|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1950s and in {{the early}} 1960s, VAT and the French Camions Willème SA had plans for joint production, but only one jointly {{produced}} prototype was ever made; the chassis was from Vanaja, the engine was from AEC, and the cabin, which was a forward control type cabin and partly made from <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> was from Willème.|$|E
5|$|Rockfalls {{from the}} {{limestone}} cliffs of the Avon Gorge {{have caused a}} hazard to motorists on occasion and every year the road is closed to allow for inspection of the cliffs for potentially dangerous cracks and loose rocks, and to allow remedial works. In 1980, a <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced concrete canopy was constructed over the Portway close to where it passes below the Clifton Suspension Bridge, {{in order to protect}} traffic from such rock falls.|$|E
25|$|A {{carbon fibre}} rod is not {{necessarily}} better than a <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> rod; the two fibres have different properties, with their own tradeoffs. Carbon fibre is less flexible (stiffer) than <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> and more brittle and prone to breakage when misused, while carbon fibre allows for longer and faster rods. Carbon fibre also allows for a smaller diameter rod that is more sensitive than a <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> rod. A carbon fibre rod is also much lighter than a <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> rod allowing for longer days of fishing. Each has its purpose in the fishing industry and both improve an anglers chances of being successful when the blanks are used for the right purposes.|$|E

40|$|Among {{other modern}} {{applications}} of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> {{there is a}} strong interest in their use as a strengthening agent for building materials. Alkali-Resistant (AR) <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> serving as ideal reinforcement for concrete proved to be very efficient against crack propagation at very early stages of the concrete setting process. However, a description of their behaviour in real cementous mixtures is missing because by now they have been studied mainly with various model tests simulating conditions of cementous environment. In this study two kinds of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> (Anti-Crack HD and HP) were mixed into Normal Strength Concrete (NSC) and Ultra High Performance Concrete (UHPC) and stored under water for 28 days up to 1 year. Afterwards, chemical durability of the AR <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> was assessed mainly with SEM/EDS analysis. In general, the prepared samples did not demonstrate any signs of leaching or any other severe corrosion defects and they did not behave in a way suggested by the model tests, as reported in literature. In contrast to testing in high alkaline environment, no depleted corrosion layer rich in Zr and Ca was observed and functionality of the <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> remained unchanged...|$|R

25|$|Polyethylene {{terephthalate}} (sometimes written poly(ethylene terephthalate)), commonly abbreviated PET, PETE, or the obsolete PETP or PET-P, is {{the most}} common thermoplastic polymer resin of the polyester family and is used in fibres for clothing, containers for liquids and foods, thermoforming for manufacturing, and in combination with <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> for engineering resins.|$|E
40|$|Fracture {{toughness}} {{and critical}} energy release rate of polyester-reinforced <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> were investigated using linear elastic fracture mechanics approach. The effect of fibre volume fraction of {{chopped strand mat}} <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> in the matrix on the composite properties was considered. Finite-element analysis using FRANC 2 D/L was adopted for further verification. The results showed {{a dramatic increase in}} the values of fracture toughness and critical energy release rate with increasing fibre content. 60 % vf of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> enhanced the fracture toughness and critical energy release rate properties of neat polyester by ∼ 22 -fold and 1200 -fold, respectively. The numerical results showed an agreement with experimental ones...|$|R

However, diesel engine and gas turbine driven alternators are the primary power source for most modern electrically propelled ships. She also had a bulbous bow, two sets of stabilizers, and two funnels side-by-side. The lifeboats, which were made from <b>glass</b> <b>fibre,</b> were placed three decks lower than usual for ships of her type, and were recessed into the hull to allow improved view from the passenger decks.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} of cement mortars reinforced with both <b>glass</b> and basalt <b>fibres</b> is studied. The {{influence of the}} addition of both types of fibre on energy absorption and tensile strength at high strain-rate was investigated, {{and the performance of}} the two types of fibre-reinforced mortar was compared. For this aim, basalt and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> with same diameter and length were used. Static tests in compression, in tension and in bending were first performed. Dynamic tests by means of a Modified Hopkinson Bar were then carried out in order to investigate how <b>glass</b> and basalt <b>fibres</b> affected energy absorption and tensile strength of the fibre reinforced mortar at high strain-rate. The Dynamic Increase Factor (DIF) was finally evaluated. The experimental results show that DIF is not significantly affected by the addition of basalt and <b>glass</b> <b>fibres,</b> while energy absorption at high strain rate is significantly increased by the addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> and only slightly increased by the addition of basalt fibres...|$|R
25|$|First {{production}} run of Birmingham and Midland Motor Omnibus Company (Midland Red) buses takes {{place during the}} 1920s—one of the first British buses to have pneumatic tyres. BMMO later develop petrol and diesel engines during the 1930s, with experimental rear-engined buses being built. By the 1940s experiments with, and production of under-floor engined single-deck buses take place. Experiments and developments of independent front suspension, air suspension, rubber suspension, <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> construction and disc brakes take place during the 1950s. 1959 sees {{the introduction of a}} turbocharged coach capable of almost 100mph, for non-stop motorway services. High speed (motorway) buses are developed with passenger toilets. During the 1960s BMMO becomes the first British bus company to make wide-scale use of computers in compiling bus schedules and staff rosters.|$|E

The straightforward construction techniques of the Do 228 were also reproduced for the 328, despite making increased use of composite materials {{in areas such as}} the rear fuselage and empennage. The 328 reportedly made greater use of composites than any of its direct competitors at launch, the use of the Kevlar-carbon fiber composites is claimed to have reduced its weight by 20 per cent. Various materials are used across the airframe; amongst these, an aluminium alloy is used for the pressure fuselage and much of the wingbox, a titanium alloy for the tail cone, and <b>glass</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced plastic for the radome and leading edge of the vertical stabilizer. Noise-absorbent material is located across the fuselage, while the cabin wall is hung from isolator brackets to reduce vibration and noise transference.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the development of fibre reinforced thermoplastic composite rods using braiding process. An innovative technique has been developed to produce composite rods with outer braided layer of polyester fibres and axially reinforced with high performance <b>glass</b> <b>fibres.</b> Polypropylene filaments which were introduced in to the core along with the <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> during the braiding process formed the thermoplastic matrix upon melting.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> coated with nanocomposites consisting of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and epoxy. Single <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> with different CNT content coating are embedded in a polymer matrix as a strain sensor for composite structures. Raman spectroscopy and electrical response of <b>glass</b> <b>fibres</b> under mechanical load are coupled for in situ sensing of deformation in composites. The {{results show that the}} fibres with nanocomposite coating exhibit efficient stress transfer across the fibre/matrix interface, and these with a higher CNT content are more prone to fibre fragmentation at the same matrix strain. A relationship between the fibre stress and the change in electrical resistance against the fibre strain is established. The major finding of this study has a practical implication in that the fibres with nanocomposite coating can serve as a sensor to monitor the deformation and damage process in composites. © 2012...|$|R
