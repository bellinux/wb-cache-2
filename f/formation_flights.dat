40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an optimization-based cooperative planning system for the efficient routing and scheduling of <b>flight</b> <b>formations.</b> This study considers the use of <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> as a means to reduce the overall fuel consumption of civil aviation in long-haul operations. It elaborates on the operational implementation of <b>formation</b> <b>flight,</b> particularly focusing on <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> routing. A completely decentralized approach is presented, meaning that <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> is not anticipated pre-flight and is not subjected to any predefined routing restrictions. A greedy communication scheme is defined through which all participating aircraft are allowed to communicate with neighboring aircraft in order to establish <b>flight</b> <b>formations.</b> The communication range of aircraft is used as a system parameter to control the allowed communications. A constraint on <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> induced additional flight time is introduced in order to suppress the occurrence of large detours in the assembly of <b>flight</b> <b>formations.</b> A transatlantic case study is presented that contains 347 eastbound flights. Assuming a 10 % fuel flow reduction for any trailing aircraft in formation, overall obtainable fuel savings were estimated at 4. 3 % at the expense of an additional flight time of 10. 3 minutes per flight on average. In this transatlantic long-haul scenario, a <b>formation</b> <b>flight</b> usage rate of 73 % was realized. Aerospace Transport & Operation...|$|R

40|$|The static {{aeroelastic}} equilibrium equations for slender, straight {{wings are}} modified {{to incorporate the}} effects of aerodynamically-coupled <b>formation</b> <b>flight.</b> A system of equations is developed by applying trim constraints and is solved for component lift distribution, trim angle-of-attack, and trim aileron deflection.

Structural and aerodynamic properties are assumed for the gliders, and solutions are calculated for flexible and rigid wings in solo and <b>formation</b> <b>flight.</b> It is shown for a sample application of two gliders in <b>formation</b> <b>flight,</b> that <b>formation</b> disturbances produce greater twist in the wingtip immersed in the vortex than for either the opposing wingtip or the wings of a similar airplane in solo flight.

50|$|Late at night, 11 September, {{orders were}} {{received}} {{to hold the}} 9th Aero Squadron on the alert early in the morning, to bomb and machine gun hostile troops {{in front of our}} advancing infantry. To carry out these orders the twelve available Breguets were divided into flights of four each. The plan was to send the flights over to attack at 30 minute intervals, and thus keep up the enemy troops under a continuous bombardment. The first order to raid was received at 10 A.M. The objective was troop concentration at Buxieres, in the town and along the roads radiating from it. Because of the strong wind and the low cloud ceiling it was considered impracticable to attempt even these small <b>formation</b> <b>flights.</b> Consequently, that the order be obeyed, the leading team of the first flight volunteered to attempt the mission alone, and to determine, if possible, the best method of conducting troop bombing under the existing unfavorable conditions. The team did not return. It was later learned that the Breguet came down in flames south of Commercy, while returning to the airdrome. The mission had been accomplished. After this first loss of the offensive it was decided to send all the airplanes on single missions, and not dissipate the strength of the squadron in small formations.|$|E

This method has implications in different fields as boundary value problems are widely spread and we succeeded to develop an efficient algorithm.

40|$|Motivated by {{the idea}} of {{multiplexed}} model predictive control (MMPC), this paper introduces a new framework for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) formation flight and coordination. Formulated using MMPC approach, the whole centralized formation flight system is considered as a linear periodic system with control inputs of each UAV subsystem as its periodic inputs. Divided into decentralized subsystems, the whole formation flight system is guaranteed stable if proper terminal cost and terminal constraints are added to each decentralized MPC formulation of the UAV subsystem. The decentralized robust MPC formulation for each UAV subsystem with bounded input disturbances and model uncertainties is also presented. Furthermore, an obstacle avoidance control scheme for any shape and size of obstacles, including the nonapriorily known ones, is integrated under the unified MPC framework. The results from simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully achieve robust collision-free <b>formation</b> <b>flights...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we {{introduce}} {{the usage of}} guidance vector fields for the coordination and formation flight of fixed-wing aircraft. In particular, we describe in detail the technological implementation of the formation flight control for a fully distributed execution of the algorithm by employing the open-source project Paparazzi. In this context, distributed means that each aircraft executes the algorithm on board, each aircraft only needs information about its neighbors, and the implementation is straightforwardly scalable to an arbitrary number of vehicles, i. e., the needed resources such as memory or computational power not necessarily scale {{with the number of}} total aircraft. The coordination is based on commanding the aircraft to track circumferences with different radii but sharing the same center. Consequently, the vehicles will travel different distances but with the same speeds in order to control their relative angles in the circumference, i. e., their orbital velocities. We show the effectiveness of the proposed design with actual <b>formation</b> <b>flights</b> during the drone parade in IMAV 2017...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the issues}} related to <b>formation</b> <b>flights,</b> which {{requires}} to be still discussed, is the stability of formation flight in turns, where the aerodynamic conditions can be substantially different for outer vehicles due to varying bank angles. Therefore, this paper proposes a decentralized control algorithm based on a leader as the reference point for followers, i. e. other UAVs and two flocking behaviors responsible for local position control, i. e. cohesion and repulsion. But opposite to other research in this area, {{the structure of the}} formation becomes flexible (structure is being reshaped and bent according to actual turn radius of the leader. During turns the structure is bent basing on concentred circles with different radiuses corresponding to relative locations of vehicles in the structure. Simultaneously, UAVs' air-speeds must be modified according to the length of turn radius to achieve the stability of the structure. The effectiveness of the algorithm is verified by the results of simulated flights of five UAVs...|$|E
