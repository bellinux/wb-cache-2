5|$|Robertson's {{men took}} many Turkish prisoners, {{including}} a senior officer of engineers {{who insisted that}} he would only surrender his sword to the Australian officer in charge. He was disappointed to discover that it was Robertson, a youthful major, but <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over anyway.|$|E
5|$|The {{war started}} with {{encouragement}} from the Voivode of Transylvania {{and a certain}} Dionisie, who later bore the title Ban of Severin. In 1330, Robert captured the long disputed Wallachian citadel of Severin and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to the Transylvanian Voivode.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the restructuring, in 2006 the LCR consortium consisted of engineering consultants and construction firms Arup, Bechtel, Halcrow and Systra (which form Rail Link Engineering (RLE)); transport operators National Express and SNCF (which operates the Eurostar (UK) share of the Eurostar service with the National Railway Company of Belgium and British Airways); electricity company EDF; and UBS Investment Bank. On completion of section 1 by RLE, the line was handed over to Union Railways (South), which then <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to London & Continental Stations and Property (LCSP), the long-term owners of the line. Once section 2 of the line had been completed it was handed over to Union Railways (North), which <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to LCSP. The entire line, including St Pancras, is managed, operated and maintained by Network Rail (CTRL).|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over is {{the seventh}} studio album by {{alternative}} rock band Dinosaur Jr., released on March 25, 1997 on Reprise Records. It peaked at #188 in the United States. According to a 2007 Magnet magazine interview with band leader J Mascis, <b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over is his favorite album from the group's major label {{period of the}} 1990s. The band enjoyed a somewhat renewed appreciation from critics on <b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over. However, {{in the years following}} the band's hiatus, <b>Hand</b> <b>It</b> Over would become hard to find due to it not having the initial strong sales of Where You Been and Without a Sound which both sported moderate radio hits. <b>Hand</b> <b>it</b> over sold 34,000 units in US.|$|R
5|$|Raël founded Clonaid (originally Valiant Venture Ltd Corporation) in 1997, {{but then}} <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> {{over to a}} Raëlian bishop, Brigitte Boisselier in 2000. In 2002 the company claimed that an American woman {{underwent}} a standard cloning procedure {{that led to the}} birth of a daughter, Eve (b. 26 December 2002). Although few believe the claim, it nonetheless attracted national authorities and the mainstream media to look further into the Raëlians' cult status.|$|E
5|$|An {{original}} typescript of {{the laws}} signed by Hitler was found by the US Army's Counter-Intelligence Corps in 1945. It {{ended up in the}} possession of General George S. Patton, who kept it, in violation of orders that such finds should {{be turned over to the}} government. During a visit to Los Angeles in 1945, he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to the Huntington Library, where it was stored in a bomb-proof vault. The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E
5|$|Corder's {{skeleton}} was put {{on display}} in a glass case in the West Suffolk Hospital, and apparently was rigged with a mechanism that made its arm point to the collection box when approached. Eventually, the skull was removed by Dr John Kilner, who wanted to add it to his extensive collection of Red Barn memorabilia. After a series of unfortunate events, he became convinced that the skull was cursed and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> on to a friend named Hopkins. Further disasters plagued both men, and they finally paid for the skull {{to be given a}} Christian burial in an attempt to lift the supposed curse.|$|E

5000|$|David also {{commented that}} the album title could be looked at in two {{different}} ways: [...] "On the one <b>hand,</b> <b>it's</b> coming across like I'm arrogant. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it's</b> saying I {{have a lot more}} composure on the album."" ...|$|R
5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to Koenig, who added another 83 in two months. Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E
5|$|Ideal batting {{conditions}} and clear skies greeted {{the players on}} the second morning. Barnes batted assuredly, while Morris was hesitant and shuffled around the crease. At one stage, Morris scored only seven runs in 55 minutes. Barnes was involved in some interplay with umpire Chester when the latter stopped a drive from Morris with his foot. Barnes picked the ball off the wicket and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to the bowler, prompting Chester to wag his finger in disapproval. Barnes responded by admonishing the umpire for blocking the ball.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 {{the poet}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge rented the cottage. While he lived there he wrote {{many of his}} better known works. He was visited by William Wordsworth and other early members of the Romantic movement. Coleridge moved out in 1799 and the {{building}} was refurbished. Almost 100 years after his occupation some of his admirers leased the property and eventually bought it, after a national campaign and significant private funding. In 1909 they <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to the National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries further renovation and expansion was undertaken, since when it has won awards as a tourist attraction.|$|E
50|$|The {{ambitions of}} the Jewish Anti-Zionist League were twofold. On one <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> sought {{to counter the}} Zionist {{influence}} within the Jewish community in Egypt. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> sought to clarify to the Egyptian public that not all Jews were Zionists.|$|R
50|$|On {{returning}} to normal working, the driver must cancel the ticket by writing CANCELLED across it. If the Pilotman has accompanied {{him over the}} single line he must <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> to him, otherwise he must <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> in {{at the end of}} his shift.|$|R
40|$|The {{constant}} 0 (or !, nil) {{has different}} roles in process algebra: {{on the one}} <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> serves as the identity element of alternative composition, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> stands for a blocked atomic action or for livelock. When extensions with timing are considered, these roles diverge. We {{argue that it is}} better to use two separate constants ¿ 0 and 0 for the different usages. With respect to the termination constant 1 (or 2 ̆ 2, skip), the situation is comparable: on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> serves as the identity element of sequential composition, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>it</b> serves as the identity element of parallel composition, and stands for a skipped atomic action. We have separate constants ¿ 1 and 1 for the different usages...|$|R
5|$|In early March 2014, {{the film}} was leaked into the Internet. Two people related to the film leakage were arrested on 8 March 2014. They were {{identified}} as Mubashir Sheik and Sheik Abid Basha hailing from Guntur. Basha illegally accessed the feed of the film and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Sheik who then uploaded it on YouTube. Post release, the film {{became one of the}} most downloaded titles in recent times and the Anti-Video Piracy team worked for a week since the film's release to reduce the effect of this leak on the film's gross.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers asked that the video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|The first {{production}} batch of uranium slugs were dissolved at the separation plant on 26 December 1944, and in January 1945 Matthias personally couriered {{the first batch}} of plutonium nitrate to Los Angeles, where he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to another courier, who {{took it to the}} Los Alamos Laboratory. Plutonium from Hanford would be used in the Fat Man bomb used in the bombing of Nagasaki. For his wartime services, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
40|$|Methodologism overemphasizes {{methods and}} neglects ontological, epistemological, {{practical}} and political considerations.

50|$|Nature has two inter-related {{meanings}} in philosophy.

40|$|This article {{proposes to}} compare Nietzsche’s will {{of power and}} Gentile’s “concrete logo”.

5|$|The {{script was}} {{received}} by script editor Melinda M. Snodgrass at a fortunate time. The crew {{were looking for}} a script which could go immediately into production in order to free up time to work on other scripts which needed more work. She <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to executive producer Michael Piller, who thought it didn't need much work. He passed it onto fellow executive producer Rick Berman, who held onto it for a week while the writers chased the production crew for updates. The script was then purchased, and Bailey, Bischoff and White were informed that it was due to go into production a week later.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, the Malinska {{class were}} {{classified}} as minelayers. At {{the start of the}} German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia, the five Malinska-class ships were assigned to the Coast Defence Command and spread over three sectors; Malinska in Selce (North Sector), Mosor and Marjan in Šibenik (Central Sector), and Mljet and Meljine in Kotor (South Sector). All five were soon captured by Italian forces, including Malinska which had been scuttled by its crew, but was raised by the Italians and commissioned as Arbe, along with Ugliano (ex-Marjan), Solta (ex-Meljine), Meleda (ex-Mljet) and Pasman (ex-Mosor). In Italian service they were known as the Arbe class, and could carry 30 mines. Following the Italian Armistice, Ugliano was taken over by German forces and probably lost in their hands. Pasman was also captured by the Germans, who <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia. This ship was stranded on the Island of Ist on 31 December 1944, but was not scrapped until 1954.|$|E
5|$|Howden's {{account of}} events reveals that Haraldr {{and his family}} gained control of Moray early in 1196, and charter {{evidence}} suggests that William and royal forces were in the north that summer. Although the Chronicle of Melrose appears to indicate that Hvarflǫð and Haraldr's eldest son was defeated in 1197, {{it is possible that}} this event dates to 1196 instead and relates to William's aforesaid northern campaign. Fordun's account records that William successfully asserted royal power in the northern regions; and Howden's account species that the king stripped Haraldr of his lordship in Caithness, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Haraldr Eiríksson, a claimant to the Orcadian earldom. At some point after this, Howden's account reveals that Haraldr overcame and killed Haraldr Eiríksson, and the Icelandic Annals specifically date the latter's fall to 1198.|$|E
40|$|There {{are often}} used evaluative {{indications}} in Russian legislation during legal rules design – concepts, which are not determined by current law.

50|$|The joker plays as a bug, that is, in the five-card <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> {{can be used}} to {{complete}} a straight or flush if possible; otherwise it is an ace.

5|$|Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Florida State's offense {{started a}} drive at its 20-yard line. Weinke {{completed}} one pass, but two others fell incomplete, and Florida State punted after again going three and out. The Hokies returned the State kick to the Seminoles' 36-yard {{line with a}} 45-yard return. Vick threw an incomplete pass, ran for seven yards, then <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> off to Kendrick, who broke through the Florida State defense and ran ahead 29yards for a touchdown. Rather than attempt an extra point, Beamer ordered a two-point conversion {{in an attempt to}} cut Florida State's lead to just three points. The play, which was Tech's first two-point attempt that season, failed. Even without an extra point, the touchdown still cut Florida State's lead to 2823.|$|E
5|$|While match referee Massimo Busacca and {{his assistants}} {{collected}} their mementoes of the final, the Barcelona team formed a {{guard of honour}} for the Manchester United players, just as the English side had done for Chelsea in 2008. Led by their manager, Alex Ferguson, and team captain, Ryan Giggs, the Manchester United team then ascended the specially constructed rostrum to collect their runners-up medals from UEFA president Michel Platini and secretary David Taylor. Other dignitaries present included Manchester United chief executive David Gill; The Football Association's president Prince William, and chairman Lord Triesman; Barcelona president Joan Laporta; Juan Carlos I of Spain; Royal Spanish Football Federation president Ángel María Villar; and Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Ferguson also collected a commemorative plaque from Platini, but immediately <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> to Giggs.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1798 Sérurier {{temporarily}} {{commanded the}} divisions left in Italy {{where he had}} his hands full trying to calm unpaid soldiers {{who were on the}} verge of mutiny. Bonaparte did not take him on the French campaign in Egypt and Syria because he was too old. Sometime after February 1798, he was ordered to the Army of England where he made his headquarters at Rennes. On 15 September he became Inspector General of the troops in the interior of France. On 5 November 1798 he transferred back to Italy to serve under Army of Italy commander Joubert. Sérurier was ordered by Joubert to occupy Livorno, but instructions soon changed to invade the Republic of Lucca. His cavalry entered Lucca on 22 December 1798 and extorted large sums of cash and clothing for the army's use. Sérurier's 6,000 infantry arrived at the city on 2 January 1799. After declaring that Lucca was a French-style republic on 25 January, he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over to Miollis on 5 February and returned to Mantua. At that time, the Army of Italy was led by Schérer who gave Sérurier command of the Tyrol Division with a paper strength of 8,328 men.|$|E
