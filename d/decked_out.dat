5|$|At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is {{not fully}} set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is {{surprised}} to discover that Doc Hudson, who is <b>decked</b> <b>out</b> in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute, Hicks, refusing to come behind Weathers again, side swipes Weathers, and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory, but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with Rusteze as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.|$|E

Just like Durga Puja, Christmas in Kolkata is an {{occasion}} in which all communities and people across religions take part. The state tourism department organises the gala Christmas Festival every year in Park Street. The whole of Park Street is <b>decked</b> <b>out</b> in colourful lights, and food stalls sell cakes, chocolates, Chinese cuisines, momo, and various other items.

Buddha Purnima, which marks the birth of Gautama Buddha, {{is one of the most}} important Hindu/Buddhist festivals and is celebrated with much gusto in the Darjeeling hills. On this day, processions begin at each of the various Buddhist monasteries, or gumpas, and congregate at the Mall, Chowrasta. The Lamas chant mantras and sound their bugles, and students as well as people from all communities carry the holy books or pustaks on their heads. Besides Buddha Purnima, Dashain, or Dusshera, Holi, Diwali, Losar, Namsoong or the Lepcha New Year, and Losoong are the other major festivals of the Darjeeling Himalayan region.|$|E

25|$|Though {{during most}} of history, men and {{specially}} dominant men have been colourful in pants and skirts like Hindu maharajas <b>decked</b> <b>out</b> in silks and diamonds or the high heeled King Louis XIV of France with a diverted skirt, stockings and long wig. The French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution changed the dress code {{for men and women}} not only in France. From the early Victorian era, there was a decline in the wearing of bright colours and luxurious fabrics by men, with a definite preference for sobriety of dress. This phenomenon the English psychologist John Flügel termed “The Great Masculine Renunciation”. Skirts were effeminized. “Henceforth trousers became the ultimate clothing for men to wear, while women had their essential frivolity forced on them by the dresses and skirts they were expected to wear”. By the mid-20th century, orthodox Western male dress, especially business and semi-formal dress, was dominated by sober suits, plain shirts and ties. The connotation of trousers as exclusively male has been lifted by the power of the feminist movement while the connotation of skirts as female is largely still existing leaving the Scottish kilt and the Albanian and Greek fustanella as the only traditional men′s skirts of Europe.|$|E

Hence she chose acoustic versions of her songs [...] "Telephone" [...] and [...] "Dance in the Dark". She started the performance by sitting in front of a piano and announcing [...] "This is for Alexander McQueen." [...] The whole performance was low-key compared to her previous ones.
