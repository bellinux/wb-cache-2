40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of our study}} {{was to assess the}} apparent digestibility of plant ingredients in diets for juvenile (50 g) and adult (220 g) Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Dietary dry matter and protein apparent digestibility coefficients of four plant-derived feedstuffs (chickpea, maize, high-quality maize protein, and beans) were tested. The beans diet had the lowest apparent <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of dry matter (ADCDM) (69. 41 %), while no significant differences were detected in ADCDM among the other diets; ADCDM was significantly higher in adults compared with juveniles (77. 02 vs. 73. 76 %). Apparent dry matter <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of ingredients (ADCI) was significantly higher in the chickpea (70. 48 %) and high-quality protein maize (71. 09 %) ingredients, and lower in the beans (52. 79 %) ingredient. Apparent dry matter <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of ingredients was significantly higher in juveniles compared with adults (72. 56 vs. 56. 80 %). The protein digestibility of diet (ADCCP) was significantly higher in the reference diet (93. 68 %), while the lowest corresponded to the maize (87. 86 %) and beans (87. 29 %) diets. Significantly lower apparent <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of protein (ADCICP) was obtained with the high-quality maize protein (59. 11 %) and maize (49. 48 %) ingredients, while higher ADCICP was obtained with the chickpea and beans ingredients (71. 31 and 63. 89 %, respectively). The apparent <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of ingredient crude protein ADCICP was significantly higher in juveniles compared with adults (67. 35 vs. 53. 46). Digestibility is generally higher in juveniles, and we recommend using chickpea as an ingredient in diets for Nile tilapia...|$|E

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of faba beans (Vicia faba), Australian sweet lupins (Lupinus angustifolius), white lupins (Lupinus albus) and peas (Pisum sativum) grown in New Zealand for broilers were evaluated {{in terms of}} their nutritional characteristics, protein quality (protein efficiency ratio), apparent metabolisable energy, apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids and the effects on bird performance. The effects of dehulling and extrusion cooking on the nutritive value of legumes were also investigated. The first experiment discussed in Chapter 3 evaluated the effect of cultivars on the nutrient profile and protein quality of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybeans (Glycine max). With the exception of white lupins, cultivars had no effect on the proximate and fibre composition of grain legumes. Starch was the primary carbohydrate component of chickpeas and peas, whilst non-starch polysaccharides were the major carbohydrates in lupins. The legume proteins were deficient in lysine, methionine, cystine and threonine. No differences were found in protein quality between cultivars of the different grain legume species. The lowest weight gain and protein efficiency ratio, in addition to the highest relative pancreatic weight and mortality rate was found in raw soybeans, suggesting that soybeans contained high a concentration of anti-nutritional factors, such as protease inhibitors. Birds fed chickpeas, lupins and peas had a low mortality rate and relative pancreatic weight, confirming that the level of anti-nutrients in these legume seeds was low. The apparent metabolisable energy and apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids of faba beans, Australian sweet lupins, white lupins and peas were determined in the second experiment (Chapter 4). Cultivar effect on the apparent metabolisable energy values was observed only for faba beans and white lupins. Faba beans, white lupins and peas had comparable apparent metabolisable energy values, but these values were higher than those of Australian sweet lupins, and lower than that of soybean meal. No cultivar differences were found in the apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids of grain legumes. The apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids of both lupin species was found to be comparable to that of soybean meal. The effects of feeding diets containing 200 g/kg faba beans, lupins or peas on the performance, digestive tract development and litter quality of broilers were investigated in the third and fourth trials. In the cage trial (Chapter 5), the results showed that the weight gain of birds fed diets containing grain legumes was similar to that of control diet. Feed intake and feed per gain of birds fed diets containing the majority of grain legume cultivars did not differ from those fed the maize-soy diet. Birds fed diets containing faba beans had more dry and friable excreta compared to other treatment diets. The performance of birds fed diets containing 200 g/kg grain legumes during the 35 d grow-out period, in the floor pen trial (Chapter 6), confirmed the results of the cage trial. In this trial, weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were superior to those with meat meal. In cage trials, the modification of some segments of digestive tract development was probably due to the dietary NSP. Whilst in floor pen trial, digestive tract development was not influenced by the inclusion of grain legumes. The effect of methodology of determination (direct vs. difference method) on the apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids of wheat, maize, Australian sweet lupins, peas and soybean meal for broilers was evaluated in the fifth study (Chapter 7). The influence of methodology on apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids was found to vary amongst the feed ingredients. In general, the apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids of test ingredients determined by the difference method was higher than those determined by the direct method, suggesting that the use of the direct method may underestimate the apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of amino acids in low and medium protein ingredients. Data reported in Chapter 8 shows that dehulling increased the apparent metabolisable energy values of faba beans and Australian sweet lupins, but it had no beneficial effect on peas. The increase of apparent metabolisable energy values may be attributed to the decrease in non-starch polysaccharides of these legume seeds after dehulling. The removal of hulls increased the amino acid concentrations, but it had no effect on the apparent ileal <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> of most amino acids. These results suggest that dehulling of grain legumes would be nutritionally beneficial and, likely to be economical in view of the improved amino acid concentrations and energy values. The final experiment (Chapter 9) demonstrated that extrusion of peas markedly influenced the content of crude protein, non-starch polysaccharides, starch, and trypsin inhibitors. The soluble non-starch polysaccharides and trypsin inhibitor contents of the majority of extruded pea samples were higher than those of raw peas, but insoluble and total non-starch polysaccharides decreased with extrusion. Extrusion had no effect on the apparent ileal protein digestibility and the apparent metabolisable energy of peas, but it increased ileal starch digestibility...|$|E

The fish were fed five diets: a control diet as high-quality diet, two levels of dried duckweed (20 % and 40 %) and two levels of fresh duckweed (20 % and 40 %), which were added to the control diet, as low-quality diets. Apparent <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficient</b> estimates were highly correlated (r> 0. 95) between both faecal collection methods.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the apparent protein and energy digestibility of common feed ingredients (soybean meal, fish meal, wheat meal and corn) by juvenile oscars using two different sampling intervals (30 min. and 12 h). The 160 juvenile oscar fish tested (22. 37 ± 3. 06 g BW) {{were divided into}} four cylindrical plastic net cages, each one placed in a 1000 L feeding tank. The experiment was completely randomized in a 2 x 4 factorial design (2 feces collection intervals and 4 feed ingredients) with four replications. The statistical tests did not detect an interaction effect of sampling interval and type of ingredient on <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Sampling interval did not affect protein and energy digestibility. The physical characteristics of juvenile oscar feces likely make them less susceptible to nutrient loss by leaching and can therefore be collected at longer intervals. Protein digestibility of the different ingredients was similar, showing that apparent digestibility of both animal and plant ingredients by juvenile oscars was efficient. Energy <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficients</b> of fish meal and soybean meal were {{higher than those of}} wheat meal and corn. Carbohydrate-rich ingredients (wheat meal and corn) had the worst energy <b>digestibility</b> <b>coefficients</b> and are therefore not used efficiently by juvenile oscars. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to determine the nutritive value of agro-industrial by-products and nutrient digestibility of ensiled sweet corn cob and husk with different levels of Ipil - Ipil leaves (Leucaena leucocephala). Four native cattle were assigned by Latin Square Design to receive all dietary treatments in four experimental periods i. e. ensiled sweet corn cob and husk (ESCH), ensiled sweet corn cob and husk + 10 % Ipil - Ipil leaves (ESCH + 10 % IL), ensiled sweet corn cob and husk + 20 % Ipil - Ipil leaves (ESCH + 20 % IL) and ensiled sweet corn cob and husk + 30 % Ipil - Ipil leaves (ESCH + 30 % IL), respectively.

Os coeficientes de digestibilidade aparente da proteína da soja crua, extrusada, tostada e macerada foram determinadas usando óxido de cromo (0, 5 %) como marcador. Foi elaborada dieta de referência com 26 % de proteína bruta e 4. 352 kcal kg - 1, e a cada alimento avaliado foram substituídas 30 % da dieta-teste. As fezes foram coletadas por pressão abdominal. Todos os produtos analisados apresentaram fatores antinutricionais, mas foi observada menor atividade de inibidor de tripsina no farelo de soja. Sojas que receberam tratamento térmico apresentaram os melhores coeficientes de digestibilidade e menores valores de atividade hemaglutinante do que a soja crua. Não foram observados efeitos dos inibidores de tripsina e taninos sobre o coeficiente de digestibilidade da proteína, mas foi observada relação negativa entre os teores de hemaglutinina com a digestibilidade da proteína bruta. Para a alimentação do pacu recomenda-se a utilização do farelo de soja e da soja processada por extrusão ou tostada.
