40|$|There {{has been}} a shift in recent decades in the {{business-to-business}} field in terms of advancements in technology and increased competition, thus leading to organisations become more attentive on embedding with customers. This concept {{is referred to as}} relationship management and a further concept to embed with strategically important customers is referred to as <b>key</b> account <b>management.</b> The use of <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> has been described as highly individual and it is implemented in various ways and has different approaches. However, it was found that {{there is a lack of}} research regarding important aspects of <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> and how they are conducted in practices in mid-sized organisations with and without a formal <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> programmes. The identified aspects were relationship <b>management,</b> <b>key</b> account <b>management,</b> <b>key</b> account manager, key accounts, key account teams and involvement from top management. By aiming to bridge this gap in research, the authors conducted in-depth interviews in two mid- sized organisations in Sweden, one with an implemented <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> programme and one without any formal <b>key</b> account <b>management.</b> The authors found by analysing the data gathered that there were findings suggesting that the aspects of KAM were performed by both organisations.

25|$|Symmetric-key cryptosystems use {{the same}} key for {{encryption}} and decryption of a message, though a message or group of messages may have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the <b>key</b> <b>management</b> necessary to use them securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps each ciphertext exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as {{the square of the}} number of network members, which very quickly requires complex <b>key</b> <b>management</b> schemes to keep them all consistent and secret. The difficulty of securely establishing a secret key between two communicating parties, when a secure channel does not already exist between them, also presents a chicken-and-egg problem which is a considerable practical obstacle for cryptography users in the real world.|$|E

Cryptographic solutions need to be implemented using industry accepted solutions that have undergone rigorous peer review by independent experts in cryptography. The length and strength of the encryption key is also an important consideration. A key that is weak or too short will produce weak encryption. The keys used for encryption and decryption must be protected with the same degree of rigor as any other confidential information. They must be protected from unauthorized disclosure and destruction and they must be available when needed.

Since the providers invest {{large amounts of money}} in producing multimedia content such as m-applications, presentations, advertising, music clips and games, there should be considered some sensitive problems regarding the “forward lock ” issue, in particular the content transfer from one mobile device to another.

40|$|Traditional, product-driven {{capital goods}} {{suppliers}} have gradually grown {{in size and}} become more global. Simultaneously <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> has become the dominant approach for them to manage their business customers. The {{purpose of the study}} is to describe and analyse, how <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> is organized in global supplier companies which operate in capital goods market. <b>Key</b> account <b>management</b> is seen as a strategic approach, the aim of which is to add value to the supplier–customer relationship. The organizational considerations are regarded {{as a part of the}} process of implementing <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> into the company. When developing from product-driven approach to customer-driven approach, a company usually goes through several phases. Adoption of customer-driven approach brings about changes to the organizational structure as well as to the roles within the organization. When a company plans for the location of people in charge of the <b>key</b> account <b>management,</b> it needs to analyse its own organization, the business environment and the key accounts. Decentralized, centralized and compromised organizational structure models are considered as principal options, each of which have different characteristics regarding adaptation to customers, power positions and communication. Qualitative approach and multiple case study method are used in this study, since a comprehensive understanding of the case companies is sought. Altogether three global supplier companies are analysed on the basis of information obtained through interviews of seven managers with several years of experience from <b>key</b> account <b>management.</b> Theme interview being close to natural conversations is used for the interviews. Cross-case comparison is chosen as the analysis approach to identify the similarities and differences in the case companies. The results give evidence to the companies’ evolution from product-driven to customer-driven organization. Furthermore, the supplier’s offering, the roles of the key account managers, industry-related and country-based differences as well as an in-depth view of the accounts and their decision-making structures are emphasized when plans for <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> are made. The centralized structure is preferred because of its clear role within the organization, while the decentralized structure is described as difficult to manage. Suppliers seek adaptation to customers by using a multilevel approach with customized account teams in managing the key account relationships. Finally, systematic management and clear definition of roles help companies minimize the issues concerning power positions and communication.

40|$|Abstract This study takes intraorganizational {{perspective}} to <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> (KAM) and combines {{the matter with}} customer knowledge processing. The aim {{of the study is}} to create a framework that enables the creation of customer knowledge competence by developing <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> system so that it facilitates internal coordination and enhances customer knowledge processing. The framework of this study is based on an extensive theoretic review on <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> and customer knowledge management. The combination of these topics creates scientific findings of this study. The framework created in this study is reflected to practice through a case company that needs re-organization of its <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> processes. This study utilizes subjectivist approach to the matter and uses constructivist research methods. Besides accumulating theoretical knowledge this study aims also in developing through theory the KAM processes of the case company. Thus it relates also closely to action research, where the researcher takes also a role as a consultant besides the role of a researcher. The empiric evidence is reflected to the theoretical framework. However as studies concerning this matter are limited the aim is through qualitative methods to produce new knowledge and not to test existing theory. Empirically this study is based on an exploratory case study that has some features of descriptive study also. The empiric research confirms the theoretical framework from most parts. Results of this thesis suggest that <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> system can be utilized as a coordination mechanism in order to create customer knowledge competence. However compared to previous studies {{the results of this study}} accentuate esprit de corps i. e. organizations capacity to work toward mutual goals as an antecedent of other <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> processes and reinforces the role of formalization of the <b>key</b> account <b>management</b> approach as an prerequisite for efficient customer knowledge processing. Based on the finding of this study, future studies could concentrate on determining the level of formalization needed for succeeding in the creation of customer knowledge competence. It also suggests that the role of esprit de corps is more important. Thus the development of this would also be valuable in the future...|$|R
