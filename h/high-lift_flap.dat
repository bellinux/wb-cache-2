50|$|The {{prototype}} M.5 Sparrowhawk {{was developed}} from standard Miles Hawk components as an {{entry into the}} King's Cup Race of 1935 piloted by F.G. Miles. The standard Hawk fuselage was shortened and accommodation was for only one pilot, sitting as low as possible. The top decking was reduced in height, a special high-compression version of the de Havilland Gipsy Six engine was fitted, and the undercarriage track was widened. Although the Sparrowhawk won the 1935 speed prize {{at an average of}} 163.64 mi/h km/h over 953 mi, because of heavy handicapping, it only came ninth overall in the race. A further five Sparrowhawks (designated M.5A) were also built as King's Cup Racers and three were delivered to customers but they did not perform spectacularly. In 1936 Victor Smith entered Sparrowhawk G-AELT into the Schlesinger Race from Portsmouth to Johannesburg but had problems with oil after Salonika and eventually retired in Khartoum. The final two M.5A Sparrowhawks were built in 1936 but were not flown until 1940. One was modified and flown to meet a requirement for an experimental aircraft for <b>high-lift</b> <b>flap</b> research with the Royal Aircraft Establishment, it was later de-modified and used as a communications aircraft.

40|$|The {{flight path}} of a small parasol {{monoplane}} equipped with a special type of balanced split flap was determined {{for a series of}} glides during which the time taken to deflect or retract the flap was varied from 1 to 15 seconds in order to study the effect of the time taken to complete a flap movement on the motion of an airplane between the start of a flap movement and the attainment of steady flight with the new flap setting. For flap movements accompanied by a change of lift characteristics, and consequently of velocity, there is an appreciable delay in obtaining a desired change in glide angle even though the flap is operated instantaneously. Immediate control of the glide path is obtained only when the speed is maintained during the flap movement. When the speed is changed, the deviation from the desired path during the transition increases in proportion to the rapidity with which the flap is moved so that, with a <b>high-lift</b> <b>flap,</b> abrupt retraction at speeds less than the minimum speed with the flap retracted may be dangerous if practiced close to the ground...|$|E

The long-term objectives call for research on the fundamentals for a new segment of civil, low noise transport aircraft with short take-off and landing capability, which allows a much better integration into the metropolitan areas of the industrialized society. Such research {{is the focus of}} the Coordinated Research Centre 880. The Centre aims at drastic reductions of airframe noise by developing the fundamentals of noise reducing surfaces in aero-acoustic and aerodynamic design.

40|$|Since {{the recent}} {{more or less}} {{extensive}} adoption of <b>high-lift</b> <b>flaps</b> on airplane wings, the problem of providing satisfactory lateral control without sacrificing {{a part of the}} span of the flaps has become one of some importance. The difficulties have been largely a matter of obtaining satisfactory rolling moments with a smoothly graduated action, together with sufficiently small control forces throughout the entire speed range. As part of an investigation including several different lateral-control arrangements to be used with split flaps, the tests reported in this paper were made on one arrangement in which conventional ailerons of narrow chord are used, and a split flap is retracted into the under surface of th wing forward of th ailerons. When the flap is retracted, the arrangement is as sketched in figure 1 (a). If a simple form of split flap were used, hinged at its forward edge, the appearance when deflected would be as shown in figure 1 (b). The flap if deflected with its leading edge remaining in this forward position would give somewhat less than three fourths of the lift increase of the same flap in the usual rear position. (See reference 1.). If, as shown in figure 1 (c), the split flap ahead of th aileron is moved to the rear as the trailing=edge portion is deflected downward, a double advantage is obtained. The deflected flap can be located in the most effective region for high lift (reference 1), and the force required to deflect the flap is reduced.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of aerodynamic flow control over lifting surfaces in which global, large-scale changes in aerodynamic characteristics are engendered by momentum injection across the flow boundary are investigated in wind tunnel experiments. Due to {{the interaction of}} spanwise arrays of surface-mounted fluidic actuators with the local cross flow, the global flow field can be altered fluidically. The utility of this approach for aerodynamic flow control {{in the absence of}} moving control surfaces is demonstrated in the limits of fully-attached and separated cross flows. In the present investigations, the actuation frequency is selected to be sufficiently high to be decoupled from global flow instabilities. The changes in the aerodynamic loads are attained by leveraging the generation and regulation of “trapped” vorticity concentrations near the surface to alter its aerodynamic shape. Diagnostics include measurements of the aerodynamic forces and moments and of distributions of static pressure on the airfoil surface, and particle image velocimetry (PIV) of the flow over the airfoil and in its near wake. The present investigations have demonstrated that when the base flow is fully attached (at low angle of attack) fluidic actuation alters the aerodynamic characteristics of an airfoil leading to controlled changes in lift and pitching moment along with a significant reduction in form drag. The effectiveness of actuation for mitigation of the adverse effects of separation is demonstrated on a <b>high-lift</b> <b>flap</b> system. It is anticipated that flow control augmentation of the performance of current and future flight platforms will ultimately enable significant mechanical simplification with savings in both weight and maintenance costs.

The high-lift configurations share the cruise geometry that is based on the NASA Common Research Model, and therefore, are also open geometries. A 10 %-scale High Lift Common Research Model (HL-CRM) is being designed for testing at the NASA Langley Research Center 14 - by 22 -Foot Subsonic Tunnel during fiscal year 2018. The overall project plan, status, HL-CRM configurations, and AFC objectives for the wind tunnel test are described...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of aircraft’s wake in high-lift configuration is studied from the rollup until vortex decay. An aircraft {{model and the}} surrounding flow field obtained from high-fidelity Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation are swept through a ground-fixed computational domain to initialize the wake. After the wake initialization, the large-eddy simulation (LES) of the vortical wake is performed until vortex decay. In this paper we consider an aircraft model in <b>high-lift</b> configuration where <b>flaps</b> and slats are deployed. In a few wingspan lengths downstream, the complex vorticity structures of the aircraft wake focus on co-rotating vortex pairs originated from wing- and flap-tips. Each co-rotating vortex pair merges at t∗= 0. 25 and a common counter-rotating vortex pair is formed at around t∗= 1. 0 entraining the turbulent wake into the vortex system. The rolled-up vortex has axial velocity in the vortex core whose magnitude is a half of the maximum tangential velocity. Behaviors of the formed vortex pair {{are similar to those}} of a typical vortex pair defined by a vortex model such as the Lamb-Oseen model. The descent speed of the vortices is slightly faster than that of the reference descent speed, i. e., w = 1. 1 w 0. In addition it is confirmed that the ambient turbulence accelerates vortex linking and decay as in the case of a typical vortex pair. The overall behavior of wake vortices is not affected by the difference of mesh resolution considered here, except for vortex core radius...|$|R
