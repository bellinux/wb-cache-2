40|$|Evolution of {{electronic}} inhomogeneities with back-gate voltage in graphene on SiO$_ 2 $ was studied using room temperature {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} and spectroscopy. The reversal of local contrast in some places in the STS maps and sharp changes in cross-correlations between topographic and conductance maps, when graphene Fermi energy approaches its Dirac point, are attributed to change in charge-state of interface defects. The spatial correlations in the conductance maps, described by two different length scales and their growth during approach to Dirac point, show a qualitative agreement with the predictions of the screening theory of graphene. Thus a sharp change in the two length-scales close to the Dirac point, seen in our experiments, is interpreted {{in terms of the}} change <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of some of the interface defects.

40|$|Large {{unit cell}} {{calculations}} {{of the properties}} of charged point defects in insulators largely neglect dielectric polarization of the crystal, because the periodically repeated cells are so small.

The data are compared with previously measured cross sections for U-ion impact in the projectile energy (E,) range from 1. 4 to 420 MeV U-'. For low recoil-ion charge states a(q) decreases over the whole E, range somewhat more slowly than l /E,, whereas for higher recoil-ion charge states a(q) reaches a maximum at about 10 - 15 MeVu-'. The data are nicely described by parameter-free n-body Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo (~ C T M C) calculations.

40|$|We {{have applied}} a {{combination}} of spectroscopic and diffraction methods to study the adduct formed between squaric acid and bypridine, which has been postulated to exhibit proton transfer associated with a single-crystal to single-crystal phase transition at ca. 450 K. A combination of X-ray single-crystal and very-high flux powder neutron diffraction data confirmed that a proton does transfer from the acid to the base in the high-temperature form. Powder X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated that the transition was reversible but that a significant kinetic energy barrier must be overcome to revert to the original structure. Computational modeling is consistent with these results. Modeling also revealed that, while the proton transfer event would be strongly discouraged in the gas phase, it occurs in the solid state due to the increase <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> of the molecular ions and their arrangement inside the lattice. The color change is attributed to a narrowing of the squaric acid to bipyridine charge-transfer energy gap.

The folding states of proteins in solution are {{monitored by the}} charge state distributions that they produce during ESI and by hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange followed by ESI-MS. The changes <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>state</b> distributions are correlated with earlier studies by optical and other methods which have shown that, in methanol, these proteins form partially unfolded intermediates with induced α-helix structure. Intermediate states formed at about 35 % methanol concentration are found to give bimodal charge state distributions. The same rate of H/D exchange is shown by the two contributions to the bimodal distributions. This suggests the intermediates are highly flexible and may consist of a mixture {{of two or more}} rapidly interconverting conformers. H/D exchange of proteins followed by ESI-MS shows that helical denatured states, populated at around 50 % methanol concentration, transform into more protected structures with further increases in methanol concentration, consistent with previous circular dicroism studies. These more protected structures still produce high charge states in ESI, {{similar to those of the}} fully denatured proteins...|$|E
