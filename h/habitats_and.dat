5|$|Archaea {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} <b>habitats,</b> <b>and</b> as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some archaea survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, archaea include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E

40|$|Summary This timely volume {{presents}} {{recent research}} on the interactions between physical <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> the ecology of salmon. Salmon habitats have been under increasing pressure from catchment management and river management activity, resulting in a decline in available <b>habitat.</b> North American <b>and</b> European scientists review the processes that control habitat availability, explore the issues impacting the quality of this <b>habitat,</b> <b>and</b> assess the biological factors affecting <b>habitat</b> use <b>and</b> the interaction between <b>habitat</b> quality <b>and</b> salmon reproductive success...|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1880s, the Sand Lake area was settled by farmers. Their {{agricultural}} practices depleted wildlife <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> caused a severe decline in waterfowl numbers.

5|$|It is {{also found}} in brackish-water <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> is {{sometimes}} seen swimming in salt water. It has been much more successful at colonizing Atlantic and Gulf coast barrier islands than the copperhead. However, even on these islands, it tends to favor freshwater marshes. A study by Dunson and Freda (1985) describes it as not being particularly salt-tolerant.|$|E
5|$|On this site, 171 {{plant species}} are surveyed. Given {{its size and}} poor soil, this {{diversity}} is notable. Management undertaken {{in recent years has}} been essential to maintaining open areas, the most threatened by primary succession. Thus, the various vegetation layers (pioneer and mature woodland, bushy areas, open areas) provide a mosaic of <b>habitats,</b> <b>and</b> thus remarkable species.|$|E
5|$|Seamounts provide <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> {{spawning}} {{grounds for}} these larger animals, including numerous fish. Some species, including black oreo (Allocyttus niger) and blackstripe cardinalfish (Apogon nigrofasciatus), {{have been shown}} to occur more often on seamounts than anywhere else on the ocean floor. Marine mammals, sharks, tuna, and cephalopods all congregate over seamounts to feed, as well as some species of seabirds when the features are particularly shallow.|$|E

5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, rhododendron, New Zealand flatworm and mink.

40|$|We {{examined}} fish assemblages <b>and</b> <b>habitat</b> {{characteristics in}} four streams within the Oklahoma {{portion of the}} Central Oklahoma/Texas Plains Ecoregion. Our objective was to evaluate the heterogeneity of <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> fish assemblages within a single ecoregion. We were also interested in whether observed patterns in <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> fish assemblages were related. We measured <b>habitat</b> characteristics <b>and</b> sampled fish at four sites {{within each of the}} four streams. MANOVA showed significant differences in <b>habitat</b> among streams, <b>and</b> a UPGMA cluster analysis of Morisita's similarity index values showed that fish assemblages also differed among streams. A relationship between <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> fish assemblages was found with CCA, demonstrating that sampling locations with similar habitat contained similar fish assemblages. In addition, tributary streams of the Arkansas River were more similar to each other, in both fish <b>and</b> <b>habitat</b> characteristics, than to tributaries of the Red River. © 1998 Oklahoma Academy of Scienc...|$|R

5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater <b>habitats,</b> <b>and</b> cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E
5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water <b>habitats,</b> <b>and</b> has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its intolerance of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|All of {{the streams}} in the Nescopeck Creek are {{considered}} sub-optimal <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> {{rated on a}} scale of 1 to 240.

5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|Bears {{have been}} hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; {{they have been}} used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. With their {{powerful}} physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. In modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> illegal trade in bear parts, including the Asian bile bear market. The IUCN lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. The poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.|$|E
