50|$|Many {{different}} kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for electrical conductivity and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, radionuclides, and various molecular species.

The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but in situations where this is impossible, other methods are used. One approach is to model the ice accumulation and flow in order to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth in the ice sheet. Another method is to identify radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases in the cores, and correlate them with other timescales, such as the periodicities in the earth's orbital parameters.|$|E
5000|$|Borehole {{temperatures}} {{are used as}} temperature proxies. Since heat transfer through the ground is slow, temperature measurements at a series of different depths down the borehole, adjusted for the effect of rising heat from inside the Earth, can be [...] "inverted" [...] (a mathematical formula to solve matrix equations) to produce a non-unique series of surface temperature values. The solution is [...] "non-unique" [...] because there are multiple possible surface temperature reconstructions that can produce the same borehole temperature profile. In addition, due to physical limitations, the reconstructions are inevitably [...] "smeared", and become more smeared further back in time. When reconstructing temperatures around 1,500 AD, boreholes have a temporal resolution of a few centuries. At {{the start of the}} 20th Century, their resolution is a few decades; hence they do not provide a useful check on the instrumental temperature record. However, they are broadly comparable. These confirmations have given paleoclimatologists the confidence that they can measure the temperature of 500 years ago. This is concluded by a <b>depth</b> <b>scale</b> of about 492 feet (150 meters) to measure the temperatures from 100 years ago and 1,640 feet (500 meters) to measure the temperatures from 1,000 years ago.|$|E

40|$|A {{framework}} is proposed for analyzing {{the perception of}} motion in depth produced by simple proximal motion patterns of two to four points. The framework includes input structure, perceptual system constraints, and a <b>depth</b> <b>scaling</b> mechanism. The input is relational stimulation described by two proximal dimensions, orientation and separation, that can change or remain constant {{over the course of}} a motion pattern. Combinations of change or no-change in these dimensions yield four basic patterns of proximal stimulation: parallel, circular, perspective, and parallax. These primary patterns initiate automatic processing mechanisms - a unity constraint that treats pairs of points as connected and a rigidity constraint that treats the connection as rigid. When the constraints are activated by perspective or parallax patterns, the rigid connection between the points also appears to move in <b>depth.</b> A <b>scaling</b> mechanism governs the degree to which the objects move in depth in order to maintain the perceived rigidity. Although this {{framework is}} sufficient to explain perceptions produced by three- and four-point motion patterns in most cases, some patterns require additional configurational factors to supplement the framework.

These new depth scales place coeval strata recovered in cores from different holes {{at a single}} site into a common stratigraphic framework. At Site 1150, double coring between Holes 1150 A and 1150 B occurred over only a short interval between ~ 703 and 713 meters below seafloor (mbsf), but this is sufficient to tie the upper portion of the stratigraphic section cored in Hole 1150 A to the lower portion cored in Hole 1150 B. The upper ~ 100 m of the sedimentary section at Site 1151 was double cored with the advanced piston corer and partially cored with the rotary core barrel, resulting in the complete recovery of this interval. The composite depth scales were constructed using Splicer software to vertically adjust the relative depths of various cores from one hole to the depths from another hole so as to align distinct physical properties measured on cores.
