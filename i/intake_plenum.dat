25|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with a CD player instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger chrome-plated grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> is below the fuel injectors and fuel rail), {{a change in the}} vehicle's self-diagnostic system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires. The Touring models, introduced in February 1994, featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission; 195/65R14 Yokohama tires, sportier, more highly bolstered black leather front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats; fog lights; and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E
2500|$|The later City Turbo II's engine {{featured}} an intercooler, {{a revised}} <b>intake</b> <b>plenum,</b> a slightly larger throttle body, a modified inlet manifold, a higher AR turbo compressor, exhaust housings, {{and a slightly}} raised (7.6:1) compression ratio. It produced [...] at 5500rpm and [...] at 3000rpm.|$|E
2500|$|There {{were three}} major {{variants}} of the SR20DE {{used in the}} G20. The first, used from July 1990 to December 1993, was the highport, in which the injectors and fuel rail were located above the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> In January 1994, due to tightening emissions restrictions, Nissan switched to a lowport design, in which the injectors and fuel rail switched places with the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> This design also featured a milder intake camshaft. (Switching it out for the highport intake cam is a popular upgrade to gain more power.) [...] This design was used from 1994 to 1996 and again in 1998. In 1999 Nissan replaced the valvetrain with a roller-rocker arm lifter design {{in place of the}} hydraulic rocker arm previously used, but kept the lowport intake design; many performance parts are not interchangeable between roller-rocker and highport/lowport engines, most notably camshafts.|$|E
50|$|The revised {{cars are}} called 348 GTB (252 made) and GTS (137 made) and were {{presented}} {{to the public as}} the 348 GT versions, equipped with the F119H engine (as opposed to the original F119D and US F119G). The F119H engine got a bump in compression ratio up to 10.8:1 vs the F119D & F119G 10.4:1 compression ratio, taller <b>intake</b> <b>plenums,</b> fuel pressure was raised from 3.4 bar to 3.8 bar, and different camshaft timing.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: An early 4A-GE engine {{with the}} {{sparkplug}} wires removed. The cam covers feature black-and-blue lettering and the 'T-VIS' acronym is {{present on the}} <b>intake</b> manifold <b>plenum.</b>|$|R
50|$|Another type {{of system}} is called a plenum bar system. These are spraybars that are {{installed}} inside of the <b>plenums</b> of the <b>intake</b> manifold. <b>Plenum</b> bar systems are usually {{used in conjunction with}} direct port systems in multi-stage nitrous systems.|$|R
2500|$|Production of the Zonda F {{was limited}} to 25 cars. It came {{equipped}} with an extra headlight and different fog lights at the sides, new bodywork (revised front end, new rear spoiler, more aerodynamic vents all around) that improved the car's aerodynamics, and different side mirrors. Further enhancements over the [...] "S" [...] centered on optional carbon/ceramic brakes developed in conjunction with Brembo, alloy wheels, Inconel exhaust system, hydroformed aluminum <b>intake</b> <b>plenum,</b> and a redesigned [...] "Z preg" [...] weave in the crash structure to improve rigidity and reduce weight.|$|E
50|$|Important design {{elements}} such as the classic horse shoe grille, inset front lights, converging front hood and an exposed <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> would eventually {{be integrated into the}} production Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4.|$|E
5000|$|The DOHC VTEC C30A is a 3.0 L version, {{producing}} [...] and 210 lbft Nm of torque. The {{engine was}} the second Honda Engine ever to utilize Honda's proprietary VTEC variable-valve timing system in an automotive application, which adjusts cam lift and duration depending on engine RPM and throttle position. VTEC allows the C30A to produce a high maximum power level while maintaining a relatively flat torque curve. C30A was also equipped with Variable Volume Induction System (VVIS). VVIS used a primary and a secondary <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> Secondary <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> engages at 4800 RPM to improve engines breathing ability and broadens torque curve.|$|E
50|$|It is {{a version}} of 1 Series 5-door with fine spray water into <b>intake</b> {{manifold}} <b>plenum</b> chamber, turbocharged 3-cylinder petrol engine with increased compression ratio increased from 9.5:1 to 11.0:1, increased engine power and torque by up to 10 percent, low-octane fuel (RON 95) compatibility.|$|R
50|$|The LN3 is {{very closely}} related to the Series I L27 and Series I L67 Supercharged. In fact, supercharger-related {{hardware}} can be fitted to an LN3 without changing the cylinder heads (ECM reprogramming required). The L27 has a two piece, upper <b>plenum</b> <b>intake</b> and lower intake, the LN3 is all one piece.|$|R
5000|$|... "180-degree intake manifolds"....Originally {{designed}} for carburetor V8 engines, the two plane, split <b>plenum</b> <b>intake</b> manifold separates the intake pulses which the manifold experiences by 180 {{degrees in the}} firing order. This minimizes interference of one cylinder's pressure waves with those of another, giving better torque from smooth mid-range flow. Such manifolds may have been originally {{designed for}} either two- or four-barrel carburetors, but now are used with both throttle-body and multi-point fuel injection. An example of the latter is the Honda J engine which converts to a single plane manifold around 3500 rpm for greater peak flow and horsepower.|$|R
5000|$|The FJ20ET was {{installed}} in the DR30 Skyline RS/RS-X/RS-X Turbo C and S12 Gazelle/Silvia RS-X; Turbo C versions of the DR30 were intercooled, {{as well as some}} S12 RS-X trim cars. The <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> chamber was shortened in the S12 compared with the DR30 because of the smaller engine bay and thus produced slightly less torque and power. However the DR30 <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> can be fitted to the S12 engine bay with very little clearance. The DR30 FJ20ET also featured a twin scroll exhaust manifold, the S12 received a smaller log style turbo manifold due to lack of firewall clearance.|$|E
5000|$|The later City Turbo II's engine {{featured}} an intercooler, {{a revised}} <b>intake</b> <b>plenum,</b> a slightly larger throttle body, a modified inlet manifold, a higher AR turbo compressor, exhaust housings, {{and a slightly}} raised (7.6:1) compression ratio. It produced [...] at 5500 rpm and [...] at 3000 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The {{basic design}} is a revised 3VZ-E iron-block engine, mated with {{aluminum}} DOHC 24 valve heads. It has a forged steel crankshaft and cast connecting rods. The upper <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> {{is of the}} split-chamber design with Toyota's ACIS variable-intake system feeding three sets of runners for both heads.|$|E
5000|$|The LN3 was {{replaced}} by the [...] L27 in 1991-1992 and produced [...] from 1992 onward, this engine was referred to as the Series I 3800, or 3800 TPI (Tuned Port Injection). In Australia, the LN3 was also replaced by the L27 by Holden who used the engine in their series 2 (1991) VN Commodore range. However, the Australian L27 retained the LN3's one piece upper <b>intake</b> and lower <b>plenum.</b> Power was still boosted to [...] for the Holden L27, before being boosted to [...] in the revised VR Commodore in 1993. The L36 made its debut in 1995.|$|R
5000|$|Whittle {{designed}} the centrifugal compressor to develop about 4:1 pressure ratio when, {{as far as}} he was aware, the best previously demonstrated performance in a single stage was about 2.5:1. He specified a double sided impeller to give his required air flow from a smaller diameter impeller than could be obtained from a single-sided one. The smaller impeller allowed a higher turbine speed which reduced the loading on the single stage turbine and improved its efficiency. The 16.5 in diameter turbine had to develop [...] to drive the compressor. One disadvantage of a double-sided impeller is the requirement, in an aircraft installation, for an <b>intake</b> with a <b>plenum</b> with its higher pressure losses. A disadvantage for the design of the rotor thrust bearing is no axial load from the impeller to balance that from the turbine.|$|R
50|$|There {{were three}} major {{variants}} of the SR20DE {{used in the}} G20. The first, used from July 1990 to December 1993, was the highport, in which the injectors and fuel rail were located above the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> In January 1994, due to tightening emissions restrictions, Nissan switched to a lowport design, in which the injectors and fuel rail switched places with the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> This design also featured a milder intake camshaft. (Switching it out for the highport intake cam is a popular upgrade to gain more power.) This design was used from 1994 to 1996 and again in 1998. In 1999 Nissan replaced the valvetrain with a roller-rocker arm lifter design {{in place of the}} hydraulic rocker arm previously used, but kept the lowport intake design; many performance parts are not interchangeable between roller-rocker and highport/lowport engines, most notably camshafts.|$|E
5000|$|Because the VZ was {{originally}} for pickup truck and SUV use, the 3VZ-FE {{happens to be}} a physically tall motor. To make the engine fit in FWD engine bays, Toyota tilted the motor towards the firewall. This [...] "tilt" [...] is so severe (~15 degrees) that reaching the rear bank of cylinders is nearly impossible without first removing the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{engine block}} is {{constructed}} of aluminum with fiber-reinforced metal sleeve. A timing chain drives an intermediate gear, which drives the cams. The pistons are forged aluminum. The <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> was designed with minimal volume for fast engine response, and a 14 lb flywheel was fitted until 2004. A high-flow catalyst is supplied {{along with an}} exhaust air-injection system, which greatly decrease catalyst light-off time and cold emissions.|$|E
5000|$|The 3.0 L (2,960 cc) VG30E {{produced}} [...] and [...] Bore is 3.43 in {{and stroke}} is 3.27 in. In 300ZX form, it produced [...] and 173 lbft Nm. On April 1987 the [...] "W" [...] series VG30 was released, adding 5 horsepower but leaving torque unchanged. In 1989, the Maxima received the [...] rating, but also used a variable <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> improving torque to 182 lbft Nm @3200 rpm.|$|E
50|$|The BMW S38 is a straight-6 DOHC {{piston engine}} which {{replaced}} the M88 and was produced from 1986-1996. It {{is based on}} the M88/3 engine. This engine is similar to the M30, but has a 24-valve cylinder head, duplex timing chain, dual overhead cam layout and shim and bucket style valvetrain. In addition to the top end revisions, the S38 also had six individual throttle bodies and intake trumpets fed by a cast aluminum <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Compared to the MT version, the 5-speed AT version came {{equipped}} with the A650E Tiptronic automatic transmission and had a lower compression ratio of 11.1:1, a less aggressive cam profile, smaller steel-alloy valves and smaller 31mm buckets. This engine made [...] at 7,000 rpm and 22.0 kgm Nm at a considerably lower 4,800 rpm. Externally, the AT model can be identified by differences in the wiring loom {{and the lack of}} an acoustic blanket on the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Production of the Zonda F {{was limited}} to 25 cars. It came {{equipped}} with an extra headlight and different fog lights at the sides, new bodywork (revised front end, new rear spoiler, more aerodynamic vents all around) that improved the car's aerodynamics, and different side mirrors. Further enhancements over the [...] "S" [...] centered on optional carbon/ceramic brakes developed in conjunction with Brembo, alloy wheels, Inconel exhaust system, hydroformed aluminum <b>intake</b> <b>plenum,</b> and a redesigned [...] "Z preg" [...] weave in the crash structure to improve rigidity and reduce weight.|$|E
5000|$|The second version {{generation}} 4 3S-GE, the 'Grey Top BEAMS' 3S-GE, was an available engine {{option in}} the RAV4 and second-generation Caldina Active Sports GT in Japan. Even though the valve cover on this engine is black, it {{is referred to as}} the [...] "Grey Top", taking its name from the grey <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> colouring. This naming is as such to differentiate it from the fifth-generation Dual-VVTi [...] "Black Top" [...] in the Altezza. Power output is [...] at 6,600 rpm in the RAV4 and [...] in the Caldina GT. The mechanical differences between the Red Top and Grey Top is the headers and the ECU. Wiring is identical.|$|E
50|$|The {{differences}} between the Second-Gen NSX-R and the NSX-R GT are not fully known. One clear difference is {{the addition of a}} non-functional snorkel attached to the roof of the car. In the JGTC NSX race cars however, this snorkel is fully functional, feeding outside air to an individual throttle body <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> The NSX-R GT also has a lowered suspension and widened body. More aggressive aerodynamic components such as an extended front spoiler lip and large rear diffuser are used as well. It also is speculated that the NSX-R GT incorporates more weight savings over the NSX-R. Honda never advertised what, if any, changes were made to the 3.2L DOHC V6 for the NSX-R GT.|$|E
50|$|When the {{ignition}} is first turned on, the ECU energizes a relay {{that runs the}} fuel pump {{for a short time}} to pressurize the fuel rail. Once the starter motor begins to turn the engine, the ECU gets a 12VDC signal that causes it to run the fuel pump again, and energize the fuel injectors. For the next several seconds, the injector pulse width is wider than normal to provide sufficient fuel for starting. Idle control is performed by adjusting a stepper-motor-driven bypass valve in the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum.</b> When {{the ignition}} is switched off, the ECU winds the bypass valve fully open to provide enough air the next time the engine is started.|$|E
50|$|The V12's new {{management}} system {{was designed by}} Nippon Denso. The top aluminium cover in the engine's valley was redesigned to house two packs of three coils each, with each coil having two high-tension terminals {{for a total of}} twelve. These coilpacks were driven by two Denso ignition modules, which are very similar to Ford EDIS-6 units. The crankshaft in the V12 was switched from a forging to a chill casting. A visibly significant chromed pipe connecting {{the left and the right}} banks of the V12 in the XJ40 platform (intended to vent and route the crankcase blow-by gas to the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum)</b> was changed with the introduction of the X300 to an almost invisible design at the top center of the engine underneath a plastic cover that also hides fuel rails and coilpacks.|$|E
5000|$|From {{at least}} 1991 onward, all S10 Blazers and Jimmies came with 4 wheel {{anti-lock}} brakes as standard equipment. The {{first two years}} of the ABS system had axleshafts with pressed-on ABS toner rings which was eliminated during {{the latter half of the}} 1993 model year (rear ABS control was done via the vehicle speed sensor). The 2.8L V6 was dropped as an option on the S-10 Blazer and Jimmy in 1990, though it was offered as an option on the S-10 and S-15/Sonoma pickups through 1993). A 5-speed manual transmission remained standard through 1994, but only with the TBI engine. Only the two 262 cuin L engines were offered as options - the base TBI and the CPI (introduced in 1992 for the S-series and Chevrolet Astro minivans; the latter had the [...] "Vortec" [...] logo on the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum).</b>|$|E
5000|$|A higher {{performance}} {{variant of}} the Coyote, dubbed Road Runner internally by Ford, is produced under the Boss 302 moniker used for the resurrected Boss 302 Mustang for the 2012 model year. The Boss 302 receives CNC ported heads cast in 356 aluminum providing additional airflow and strength, and a higher lift exhaust camshaft profile is used. Valvetrain components were lightened as much as possible, {{including the use of}} sodium filled exhaust valves, while strengthened powdered metal rods and forged aluminum pistons were added. Piston-cooling jets were also deleted, which are standard in the 5.0 model. Exterior changes include a high-mount <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> (as opposed to the standard engine's low-mounted one) with shorter runners to improve high-rpm power. Power is increased from [...] to , and torque drops from 390 lbft Nm to 380 lbft Nm due to the upgrades. The Boss's redline is increased to 7500 rpm, but has been verified stable up to 8400.|$|E
50|$|Introduced at the 1993 New York Auto Show, {{the main}} {{changes for the}} P10 came as a midyear refresh in April 1993 (model year 1993.5), when dual airbags {{replaced}} motorized seatbelts, leather interiors came standard with power front seats, matte-black side moldings were replaced by body-colored ones, the refrigerant was converted from R12 to R134a, the audio system was upgraded to six speakers with a CD player instead of the previously-standard cassette deck, and other new options such as remote keyless entry were added. In February 1994, the 1994 model year was given a new larger chrome-plated grille and door handles, a lowport engine (replacing the original highport SR20DE, in which the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> is below the fuel injectors and fuel rail), {{a change in the}} vehicle's self-diagnostic system to OBD-II, and larger 195/65R14 tires. The Touring models, introduced in February 1994, featured a limited-slip differential in the transmission; 195/65R14 Yokohama tires, sportier, more highly bolstered black leather front bucket seats and fold-down rear seats; fog lights; and a spoiler on the rear decklid.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1988, Honda {{upgraded}} the C20A V6 engine used {{exclusively in}} the KA5 series Legend with a variable geometry turbocharger, calling it the [...] "Wing Turbo" [...] in a Japanese TV commercial to address the modest power available from the previous engine with variable length intake manifold used in earlier models. The turbocharger compressor housing had four vanes made from heat resistant Inconel alloy surrounding the turbine wheel (on the inlet side of it) that would fluctuate based on engine load and transmission gearing above 2,000 rpm to allow for increased airflow into the engine as needed. The turbo compressor could generate as much as [...] of boost, and was paired with a water cooled intercooler installed inside the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> between the cylinder banks to produce [...] net at 6000 rpm and a maximum torque of [...] at 3,500 rpm. Honda Legend V6 turbo idling The turbo was installed not necessarily to make the engine more powerful, but rather to increase fuel efficiency and reduce emissions, as the Japanese pay a tax {{on the amount of}} emissions the car produces.|$|E
50|$|As the {{successor}} of the BMW N55 engine, the B58 also displaces 3.0 litre (though is slightly larger at 2998cc compared to 2979cc for the N55). It has a larger turbocharger with a 6 {{percent increase in}} turbine wheel size and 10 percent increase in compressor wheel diameter, resulting in a 20 percent increase in boost pressure. The B58 uses a water-to-air intercooler integrated into the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum,</b> thus reducing the charged air volume between the compressor and the intake. This increases performance by maintaining more even temperatures inside the intake. BMW has also incorporated an engine-mounted encapsulation system, which allows the engine to retain much of its heat for up to 36 hours which helps to reduce emissions and wear and tear during start-up, especially in colder climates.As a part of BMW's new modular engine family, the crankcase is a completely new design identically with the B57 diesel version, engineered as both a gasoline and diesel engine in one common part. The closed deck crankcase {{is equipped with a}} completely new structure which can be identified by a complex array of ribs on the exhaust and intake side and an additional reinforcement frame on the oil pump side.|$|E
5000|$|The {{figures for}} the revised turbo engine for the FG XR6 Turbo mimic the old FPV turbo I6, {{but this is an}} {{incorrect}} assumption and the motors are not the same. Firstly, it has a redesigned low-profile <b>intake</b> <b>plenum,</b> as opposed to the circa 1994 broadband manifold intake which originated in the naturally aspirated EF Falcon. The engine employs a new turbocharger and intercooler in conjunction with the Barra 195s hardware and software updates. The result is that the FG XR6 Turbo is actually faster than both FPV's BF Typhoon and the FG XR8. The FG XR6 Turbo uses a smaller turbo than the BA/BF XR6 Turbo so it can spool faster, make more usable power, and make less noise than the larger turbo. This engine also features a 53 Nm overboost feature. The feature can engage depending on the driving style, and when the accelerator pedal is fully pressed to the floor, it can call the computer to overboost and add an additional 53 Nm on top of the 533 Nm, making it a total of 586 Nm of torque for a maximum of 10 seconds. However, depending on the ambient temperature and conditions, this figure is significantly higher than 586Nm. Some sources claim over 640Nm is achieved for 10 seconds. Ford also under-quoted Barra 270T FG's power figures, Ford Engineers claim that the actual power output is close to or over 305kw. Numerous dynamometer printouts from various standard XR6s with the Turbo engine, as well as standard high 12 second passes at drag racing events from various owners Australia wide, help to back up Ford Engineers' claims.|$|E
5000|$|The 5.0 L (4951 cc, 302 cid) [...] "Coyote" [...] V8 is {{the latest}} {{evolution}} of the Modular engine. Ford engineers needed to design a V8, specifically for the Mustang GT, that would compete with the GM 6.2L LS3 used in the new Chevrolet Camaro, and the new Chrysler 6.4L Hemi ESF in the Charger, Challenger, and Grand Cherokee. This engine had to remain close to the same physical size of the outgoing 4.6, and share other specifications with it such as bore spacing, deck height, bell housing bolt pattern, etc. {{in order for the}} engine to utilize existing Modular production line tooling. The result was the 5.0 Coyote, which produced roughly the same amount of power as its competitors, but with a much smaller displacement. To strengthen the block enough to handle increased output, webbing was extensively used as reinforcement in the casting, rather than increasing the thickness of the walls. The <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> was also situated low between the two cylinder banks to meet the height constraint, thus the alternator traditionally placed low and center was moved {{to the side of the}} engine. It shares the 4.6 L's 100 mm (3.937 in) bore spacing and 227 mm (8.937 in) deck height, while bore diameter and stroke have increased to 92.2mm (3.629 in) and 92.7mm (3.649 in), respectively. The engine also retains the 4.6 L's 150.7 mm (5.933 in) connecting rod length, which produces a 1.62:1 rod to stroke ratio. The firing order has been changed from that shared by all previous Modular V8s (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8) to that of the Ford Flathead V8 (1-5-4-8-6-3-7-2). Compression ratio is 11.0:1, and despite having port fuel injection (as opposed to direct injection) the engine can still be run on 87 octane gasoline.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare defferent methodologies of CFD analysis, applied to the <b>intake</b> <b>plenum</b> of a {{turbocharged}} HSDI Diesel Engine. The study is performed by using both an engine cycle simulation code and a 3 D-CFD code. Experiments at the engine dynamometer and at a steady flow bbench support the theoretical study. The most promisig simulation technique presented in the paper is the integrated 1 D and 3 D-CFDsimulation. This numerical approach showed itself to be particularly suitable for analysing complex engine components where the flow patterns are fully transient...|$|E
