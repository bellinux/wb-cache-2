It will also shows advantages of application of the up-to-date digital chain of engineering analysis within which CAD tools are being used as well as strength and <b>fatigue</b> limit <b>analysis.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Computer analysis of the strength analysis by using Finite Element Method (FEM) and <b>fatigue</b> life <b>analysis</b> by using <b>Fatigue</b> Life Prediction Method (FLP) were carried out. Findings: The most strenuous and at the same time opened to a damage risk cylinder zones were localized. Two construction solution possibilities of fixing the tongue stub with a hydraulic cylinder jacket were analysed. Finally Wöhler fatigue graphs for a different values of operating average pressure and stress concentration factor were presented. Research limitations/implications: Further researches should concentrate on modifications and analysis which will help to recognize the best possible zones of fixing a tongue stub with a hydraulic cylinder jacket in order to find the best configuration of construction kinematic pair. Practical implications: Modern engineering construction analyze require not only standard strength analysis but also calculation of fatigue life. Originality/value: The paper can be useful for person who performs strength analysis with a use of finite element method but has never used digital <b>fatigue</b> life <b>analysis</b> method.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 52 - 53) An {{analytical method}} is presented for separating the frequency dependent and frequency independent components of fatigue {{crack growth rate}} data. An expression is then developed {{which can be used}} to calculate the aggressive environment fatigue crack growth rate at an arbitrary frequency. By use of this <b>fatigue</b> data <b>analysis</b> method, aggressive environment fatigue crack growth rates are predicted for two material-environment combinations. For the same two material-environment combinations, fatigue crack growth rates are also calculated using a superposition technique frequently proposed in the literature, in which the environmental fatigue component is determined from sustained load stress corrosion data.

Mesh-insensitive {{structural}} stress {{approach is a}} robust method for <b>fatigue</b> characteristic <b>analysis</b> of welded structures and has been validated in correlating {{a large amount of}} published fatigue test of steel welded joints in the literature.

40|$|The fixed {{jacket is}} still the most common {{offshore}} structure used for drilling and oil production. The structure consists of tubular members interconnected to form a three-dimensional space frame, which can be categorized into a column structure. The structure usually has four to eight legs that are battered to achieve stability against axial compressive loads and toppling due to wave loads. The configuration of a typical member on the jacket structure has significant influence on buckling and fatigue strength. Horizontal and diagonal braces {{play an important role in}} resisting the axial compression and wave load on the global structure. This paper discusses the effect of symmetrical and asymmetrical configuration shapes in buckling and <b>fatigue</b> strength <b>analysis</b> on two types of fixed jacket offshore platforms. The axial compressive and lateral (wave) loads were considered and applied to both structures. The material and dimensions of the two structures were assumed to be constant and homogenous. Crack extension and corrosion were not considered. To assess the buckling and fatigue strength of these structures, due to the symmetrical and asymmetrical configuration shape, the finite element method (FEM) was adopted. Buckling analysis was performed on these structures by taking two-dimensional planes into consideration to obtain the critical buckling load for the local plane; <b>fatigue</b> life <b>analysis</b> was then calculated to produce the fatigue life of those structures. The result obtained by FEM was compared with the analytical solution for the critical buckling load. The stress-strain curve was also applied to show the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical shapes. For <b>fatigue</b> life <b>analysis,</b> the procedure of the response amplitude operator was applied...|$|R
40|$|In {{conventional}} high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> life <b>analysis</b> {{the response}} is generally sufficiently accurate in terms of root-mean square level and power spectral density, {{but there is no}} information available regarding the response probability function.

This study presents a comparative in high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> life <b>analysis</b> between experimental and simulated pressure fluctuations with almost identical probability distributions. An efficient finite element time domain modal formulation was employed to determine the shallow shell responses, and the probabilistic Palmgren-Miner cumulative damage theory in combination with the rainflow counting cycle’s method was used to estimate the fatigue life. An easily applied stochastic non-Gaussian simulation method capable of reliably converging to a target power spectral density function and marginal probability density function was employed to accurately generate the simulated pressure fluctuations.
