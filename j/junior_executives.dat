50|$|Access: Barriers and AdvantagesA {{preference}} for coworkers of similar features to oneself meant that managers often specifically selected individuals to share accounts and deals with; many times, this meant disadvantaging {{women and minorities}} for account allocations, performance evaluations and relative compensation. Connections made through informal networks often advantaged those individuals with better access to clients, accounts, and deals. Often, women are driven to switch fields within the business sector, for example from corporate finance to equity research, from heavily male-dominated to those that are more gender neutral. Such trade may result in substantial pay cuts, as the median earning in the new sector can be {{much lower than the}} median income in the old sector. Moreover, mentorship can {{play an important role in}} one’s experiences at a workplace. Many firms have formal mentorship programs to guide promising new junior employees. In cases where the mentorship starts informally (the senior partner does so without company dictation to do so) some junior employees will inherently have the advantage over their peers. This can often end disastrously for workers who are outside of the informal networks that can start such ties. It should be noted, however, that, on Wall Street specifically, there were many male senior executives who were committed to encouraging success from women <b>junior</b> <b>executives,</b> with 65% of women who had mentors noting their mentors were male.|$|E

5000|$|Another of the industry’s very {{earliest}} systems was the Consensor. In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, William W.

He {{was one of}} the pioneers of applied future studies in the private sector, that is, future studies applied to corporate planning. Through this work he had met Theodore J.

Gordon had conceived and partially developed what would today be called an audience response system, and Simmons immediately saw practical applications for it in large corporate meetings, to allow people to air their true opinions in anonymous fashion, so that each individual's Likert scale answer value for a question would remain secret, but the group's average, weighted with weighting factors, would be instantly displayed.

(IBM's organizational culture was famous for its valuing of conformity; and this was common at other firms, too.) Simmons retired from IBM in January 1972, and soon after he formed a startup company with Gordon, called Applied Futures, Inc., to develop and market the system, which they called the Consensor consensus.

The results of the multiple linear regression were significant, F(2, 104) = 19. 42, p 3 ̆c. 001, R 2 =. 27, suggesting that the model as a whole was able to significantly predict intent to stay.

The junior coalition was cautious about expressing their views because they knew what the CEO wanted and did not want the leader to have a negative impression of them. Therefore, they built a coalition with outside stakeholders and implicitly expressed their opinions through the external actors. They stressed “how bondholders and shareholders would react to the deal”, supporting their argument by submitting a stakeholder opinion. They hired outside experts to investigate failures in similar cases of competitors and foreign firms, intentionally creating a sample selection bias. “Focusing on implementation challenges and external validation of their views, the junior coalition sought to convince the CEO and key personnel that the deal was not viable at that moment and that the company should instead rethink it in the future.” The deal was eventually discarded.|$|E
40|$|Women have {{historically}} borne {{the responsibilities of}} family and home life. With {{the advent of the}} need for dual earner families, many women have used the opportunity inherent in the closing gender gap in access to education, to obtain better paying jobs. Despite this change, women are still expected to bear their historical role of family responsibilities. Whilst many organisations have introduced work-life balance strategies in an effort to assist female employees balance these roles, the effectiveness of these strategies in promoting gender equality beyond junior executive level is doubtful. The data pertaining to this research problem was collected from 15 junior executive women from 15 different organisations through a semi-structured, open-ended interview questionnaire. The key findings are that South African organisations do not offer as many work-life balance strategies as the literature would lead one to anticipate. When they do offer these strategies, they are thought to {{have a negative impact on}} the ability of women <b>junior</b> <b>executives</b> to progress to more senior positions within the organisation. The continued discrimination of women on the basis that they have families and want to be involved with those families has to end in order for gender equality at senior executive levels to become a reality. Women need to take an active role in changing cultural norms by engaging with their spouses to share family responsibility and by shaping future generations to do the same. In addition female senior executives also have a part to play in mentoring female <b>junior</b> <b>executives</b> to attain their desired career aspirations, instead of playing the part of honorary males. The most important change however lies with organisations. They need to be more conscious of their reasons for offering these strategies and need to make these strategies a cultural norm, which may require a cultural shift within the organisation. This change may include encouraging their male employees to use work-life balance strategies. Finally, organisations have to monitor the iii effectiveness of these strategies in meeting the desired goals, like they would do for any other strategy that is believed to be of importance to the organisation...|$|E
40|$|Mentoring is {{the process}} of having a {{significant}} beneficial effect on the life or career of another individual, generally as a result of personal one-on-one contact. A mentor is one who offers knowledge, insight, perspective or wisdom that is especially useful to the other person. Traditionally mentoring has been used to assist promising <b>junior</b> <b>executives</b> climb the career ladder. It usually involved a more skilled senior person sponsoring and encouraging the protégée. Very often this happened through informal networks. Recently the concept of mentoring has taken on a new dimension focused more specifically on career direction, goal setting, role models, mentee visibility, networking, support systems, and a revitalisation of self and career. Current practice has also found peer mentoring to be highly effective and while {{it is important that the}} mentor should be experienced and be able to pass on the wisdom of that experience to the protégée, it is not always necessary for the mentor to be at a very senior level within an organization. Recent practice is also finding that both parties to the mentor process benefit. In the past it was assumed that mentoring was a oneway process in which only mentees gained. In fact, mentors report that their participation in mentor schemes has given them a fresh perspective on their own lives and careers. Drawing heavily from experiences at the University of Southern Queensland, this interactive workshop will throw new light on the ways in which women are changing the traditional ideas and practice of mentoring. To facilitate the process of identifying career directions and pathways, mind mapping will be used to help participants to record their own profiles, and with input on careers counselling, to identify the best matches between mentors and mentees. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} essays investigating {{issues on the}} topic of executive compensation. In both essays, a principal-agent model of executives 2 ̆ 7 actions is expanded to include not only an effort choice but also the determination of a criterion for the adoption of new projects. In particular, it is assumed that an executive 2 ̆ 7 s project evaluation efforts affect the precision of signals regarding the true value of proposed projects, while the executive 2 ̆ 7 s setting of a reservation signal determines the likelihood projects with different characteristics are pursued. ^ Essay One extends the literature on executive compensation by developing and testing the model with respect to the use of equity in executive compensation. In so doing, new evidence is offered on the significance of firm characteristics and executive rank in determining not only the frequency with which equity-based compensation is utilized, both within and across firms, but also the degree to which such forms of payment contribute to the total compensation of executives. The theoretical framework also provides insight into the different roles played by two common forms of equity compensation, restricted stock and stock options. ^ Essay Two more fully explores both theoretically and empirically these two common forms of contracting compensation. Stock grants, unlike stock options, are attractive in that they do not introduce a potential bias in the executive 2 ̆ 7 s decision toward adopting projects. Stock options are attractive in that, for the same expected value as stock grants, stock options provide the principal with leverage to motivate an executive to undertake more extensive project evaluation. Thus, one expects more extensive use of stock options in cases where an increase in effort devoted to project evaluation is more highly valued by the principal. It is argued that this increased gain to additional project evaluation exists at firms with high research and development and for more <b>junior</b> <b>executives.</b> Empirical support for these claims is provided using an extensive panel data set on executive compensation at large U. S. firms. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), College of Business, Washington State UniversityMy {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two essays related to executive roles and insider trading. The first essay examines the information asymmetry that exists between managers and shareholders. However, managers are not one homogeneous group. Information asymmetry may exist amongst managers as well. I test this hypothesis using the trades of different Executive Role Groups. I find that all managers do not trade the same, suggesting they experience a different information environment within the firm. By splitting executives into three groups, which parallels their relative positions in firm hierarchies, I document differences in purchase and sales behavior, controlling for ownership levels, firm and managerial attributes. By forming portfolios based on insider trades, these differences are born out in subsequent excess returns. Information asymmetry is likely to vary across firms in differently regulated environments or vary across time as new laws are implemented to increase disclosure. I find that reduced information asymmetry in more heavily regulated firms results in lower insider trading returns for managers as a whole. However, insiders are unequally affected by this information asymmetry with the senior and <b>junior</b> <b>executives</b> benefiting from information asymmetry while the middle role group (of predominantly financial experts) not apparently exploiting the information asymmetry. The second essay examines whether the information content of certain executive insider trades reflects different trading skill or a different willingness to exploit the information asymmetry that exists between executives and outside shareholders. I consider the information content of equity purchase activity for chief executive officers, chief financial officers and chief operating officers using portfolios based on trading activity. Using the purchase activity of chief financial officers generates significantly higher daily excess returns than using either the purchase activity of chief operating officers or chief executive officers. Superior trading profitability of CFOs suggests that they are either more skilled at trading (skills hypothesis) or {{are more willing to}} use asymmetric information (information hypothesis). I test the skills hypothesis and find no evidence that different skill drives my results. Instead, I find evidence supportive of the information hypothesis with CFOs appearing to exploit asymmetric information in their insider trading.
