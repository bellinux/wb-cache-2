40|$|The {{surface of}} Mercury {{exhibits}} a global tectonic system consisting {{of an ancient}} set of NE and NW tending lineaments and a younger set of planimetrically arcuate escarpments interpreted as thrust of high-angle reverse faults. The trends, distribution, and age relations of these tectonic features {{can be explained by}} a combination of tidal <b>despinning</b> and global contraction of the planet. In our model, early tidal <b>despinning</b> resulted in conjugate shear fractures trending roughly N 60 deg E and N 60 deg W which were subsequently modified by a variety of surface processes to produce the presently visible set of lineaments. Continued <b>despinning</b> plus global contraction produced thrust faults with roughly north-south trends. Final contraction may have postdated <b>despinning</b> and produced randomly oriented thrust faults. All of these events predated the formation of Caloris basin, because basin-associated deposits blanket both lineaments and arcuate thrust faults...|$|R
40|$|International audienceContraction, {{expansion}} and <b>despinning</b> have been {{common in the}} past evolution of solar system bodies. These processes deform the lithosphere until it breaks along faults. Their characteristic tectonic patterns have thus been sought for on all planets and large satellites with an ancient surface. While the search for <b>despinning</b> tectonics has not been conclusive, there is good observational evidence on several bodies for the global faulting pattern associated with contraction or expansion, though the pattern is seldom isotropic as predicted. The cause of the non-random orientation of the faults has been attributed either to regional stresses or to the combined action of contraction/expansion with another deformation (<b>despinning,</b> tidal deformation, reorientation). Another cause of the mismatch may be the neglect of the lithospheric thinning at the equator or at the poles due either to latitudinal variation in solar insolation or to localized tidal dissipation. Using thin elastic shells with variable thickness, I show that the equatorial thinning of the lithosphere transforms the homogeneous and isotropic fault pattern caused by contraction/expansion into a pattern of faults striking east-west, preferably formed in the equatorial region. By contrast, lithospheric thickness variations only weakly affect the <b>despinning</b> faulting pattern consisting of equatorial strike-slip faults and polar normal faults. If contraction is added to <b>despinning,</b> the <b>despinning</b> pattern first shifts to thrust faults striking north-south and then to thrust faults striking east-west. If the lithosphere is thinner at the poles, the tectonic pattern caused by contraction/expansion consists of faults striking north/south. I start by predicting the main characteristics of the stress pattern with symmetry arguments. I further prove that the solutions for contraction and <b>despinning</b> are dual if the inverse elastic thickness is limited to harmonic degree two, {{making it easy to}} determine fault orientation for combined contraction and <b>despinning.</b> I give two methods for solving the equations of elasticity, one numerical and the other semi-analytical. The latter method yields explicit formulas for stresses as expansions in Legendre polynomials about the solution for constant shell thickness. Though I only discuss the cases of a lithosphere thinner at the equator or at the poles, the method is applicable for any latitudinal variation of the lithospheric thickness. On Iapetus, contraction or expansion on a lithosphere thinner at the equator explains the location and orientation of the equatorial ridge. On Mercury, the combination of contraction and <b>despinning</b> makes possible the existence of zonal provinces of thrust faults differing in orientation (north-south or east-west), which may be relevant to the orientation of lobate scarps...|$|R

50|$|Planets {{close to}} their stars on {{circular}} orbits will tend to <b>despin</b> and become tidally locked. As the planet's rotation slows down the radius of a synchronous orbit of the planet moves outwards from the planet. For planets tidally locked to their stars, {{the distance from the}} planet at which the moon will be in a synchronous orbit around the planet is outside the Hill sphere of the planet. The Hill sphere of the planet is the region where its gravity dominates that of the star so it can hold on to its moons. Moons inside the synchronous orbit radius of a planet will spiral into the planet. Therefore, if the synchronous orbit is outside the Hill sphere, then all moons will spiral into the planet. If the synchronous orbit is not three-body stable then moons outside this radius will escape orbit before they reach the synchronous orbit.|$|E

40|$|Lobate scarps on Mercury are {{generally}} accepted to be surface expressions of thrust faulting. This {{is taken as}} evidence of lithospheric contraction on a global scale, reflecting either global cooling, leading to thermal contraction and internal phase changes; or tidal <b>despinning,</b> leading to collapse of an equatorial bulge; {{or a combination of}} both. It has been further suggested that the orientations of lobate scarps could reflect a pattern of mantle convection. Here we review compressional tectonics localized along the interface between basin-fill and the inner walls of > 200 km diameter mercurian impact basins. This occurs as outward-directed thrust faults following the inside of basin rims, and sometimes completely over-thrusting the rim location. Thrusting at the edges of low-latitude basins tends to be most strongly developed at eastern and western rims, suggesting tidal <b>despinning</b> as a driving force. Cross-cutting relationships show examples of thrusting that must considerably post-date the volcanic infilling of the associated basin, suggesting <b>despinning</b> occurring (or continuing) well {{after the end of the}} late heavy bombardment, contrary to previous expectation...|$|R

50|$|It is {{commonly}} {{suggested that there}} is some form of link between the synchronous rotation of the Moon about the Earth, and the mare basalts. However, gravitational torques that result in tidal <b>despinning</b> only arise from the moments of inertia of the body (these are directly relatable to the spherical harmonic degree-2 terms of the gravity field), and the mare basalts hardly contribute to this (see also tidal locking). (Hemispheric structures correspond to spherical harmonic degree 1, and do not contribute to the moments of inertia.) Furthermore, tidal <b>despinning</b> is predicted to have occurred quickly (in the order of tens of millions of years), whereas the majority of mare basalts erupted about one billion years later.|$|R

Melosh and Dzurisin have pointed out the similarity between this predicted tectonic pattern and that observed on Mercury, and they have proposed that the global system of lineaments and arcuate scarps, which is well developed in the Discovery quadrangle, formed in response to early, simultaneous planetary contraction and tidal <b>despinning.</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent {{experiments}} involving liquid jets exhausting into {{a vacuum}} {{have led to}} significant conclusions regarding techniques for detumbling and despinning disabled spacecraft during retrieval operations. A fine water spray directed toward a tumbling or spinning object may quickly form ice over its surface. The added mass of water will absorb angular momentum and slow the vehicle. As this ice sublimes it carries momentum away with it. Thus, a complete detumble or <b>despin</b> is possible by simply spraying water at a disabled vehicle. Experiments were conducted in a ground based vacuum chamber to determine physical properties of water-ice in a space-like environment. Additional ices, alcohol and ammonia, were also studied. An analytical analysis based on the conservation of angular momentum, resulted in <b>despin</b> performance parameters, i. e., total water mass requirements and <b>despin</b> times.

40|$|Eccentricity or {{obliquity}} tides {{have been}} proposed as the missing energy source that may explain the anomalously large radius of some transiting "hot Jupiters". To maintain a non-zero and large obliquity, it was argued that the planets can be locked in a Cassini state, i. e. a resonance between spin and orbital precessions. We compute the tidal heating within "inflated" close-in giant planets with a non-zero eccentricity or obliquity. We further inspect whether the spin of a "hot Jupiter" could have been trapped and maintained in a Cassini state during its early <b>despinning</b> and migration. We estimate the capture probability in a spin-orbit resonance between ∼ 0. 5 AU (a distance where tidal effects become significant) and 0. 05 AU {{for a wide range}} of secular orbital frequencies and amplitudes of gravitational perturbations. Numerical simulations of the spin evolution are performed to explore the influence of tidal <b>despinning</b> and migration processes on the resonance stability. We find that tidal heating within a non-synchronous giant planet is about twice larger than previous estimates based on the hypothesis of synchronization. Chances of capture in a spin-orbit resonance are very good around 0. 5 AU but they decrease dramatically with the semi-major axis. Furthermore, even if captured, both tidal <b>despinning</b> and migration processes cause the tidal torque to become large enough that the obliquity ultimately leaves the resonance and switches to near 0 ^∘. Locking a "hot Jupiter" in an isolated spin-orbit resonance is unlikely at 0. 05 AU but could be possible at larger distances. Another mechanism is then required to maintain a large obliquity and create internal heating through obliquity tide...|$|R
40|$|The tidal torque on an early-type star is {{concentrated}} near {{the boundary between}} the convective core and radiative envelope and a train of gravity waves is excited there. The angular momentum which the torque removes from the fluid is transported outward by the gravity waves, which carry negative angular momentum. Before the surface layers are despun to synchronous rotation, the gravity waves propagate to just below the photosphere where they suffer radiative damping and are partially reflected. It is here that the negative angular momentum is deposited and the primary tidal <b>despinning</b> takes place. The surface layers cannot be spun down below synchronous rotation because as a train of gravity waves approaches a corotation resonance its group velocity and wavelength tend to zero, its amplitude diverges, and it is completely absorbed. Thus, tidal <b>despinning</b> to synchronous rotation proceeds from the outside toward the inside of the star. Our picture provides a neat explanation for the otherwise puzzling discovery by Giuricin, Mardirossian, and Mezzetti that Zahn's theory for tidal evolution in early-type close binaries seems to be compatible with the observed rates of orbit circularization while significantly underestimating the observed rates of spin synchronization...|$|R
