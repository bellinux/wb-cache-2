60|$|Habits and Concluding Remarks.--The {{males are}} {{imbedded}} in the spinose chitine {{border of the}} occludent margin of the scuta, exactly over an oblique fold or notch (fig. 15 á a), close by the umbo. This fold has no direct relation to the males, but being present is taken advantage of by them; for it occurs in the young hermaphrodite, before the attachment of the males, and in species of the genus in which the males are attached to other parts. It occurs, also, in fossil species of Pollicipes, and in these it seems caused by the upper inner part of the valve being rendered more and more prominent during growth: in the present species, I suspect, its origin is connected {{with the formation of}} a ridge bounding the outer side of the pit for the adductor scutorum muscle: we shall see in the next species, that this fold is of the highest importance in relation to the position of the Males. The transparent chitine border of the scuta is broad, and fills up the fold in the shell, so that the outline of the occludent margin is not affected by it: in the drawing (fig. 9) some of the inner layers of chitine (e e), which dipped into and filled up the fold, have been removed, that {{the lower part of the}} animal might be more plainly exhibited. The chitine bears numerous spines of various lengths, which must afford some protection to the males, rudely arranged in lines, parallel to the edge of the valve, indicating the successively-formed layers of chitine; each spine has a fine, tortuous tubulus connecting its base with the underlying corium. The <b>extreme</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the border is thin, forming a kind of lip, close beneath which the delicate tunic lining the sack is attached. During continued growth, the valve is added to in thickness, and so is the chitine border, and likewise in breadth. It appears that the larva of the male must attach itself on the under side of this border, on the edge of the tunic of the sack, and that by the action of the cement, the corium beneath is killed (as I believe always is the case with other parasitic Cirripedia), whereas on both sides, the chitine continues to be added to, so that the male, excepting the upper and always projecting portion, becomes imbedded at first laterally, and ultimately all round: I have seen specimens in several different stages of imbedment. Hence, in old specimens, with a thick and broad chitine border, it might and does come to pass that one male is imbedded (the valve being laid flat) directly beneath another.|$|E
60|$|She {{waited until}} the last man had stepped into the boat, in nervous dread of some one remaining. Then, when the boat had {{vanished}} round the Point again, she {{ran back to the}} cottage, arrayed herself in her husband's pilot coat, hat, and boots, and launched the dingey. It was a heavy, slow, but luckily a stanch and seaworthy boat. It was not until she was well off shore that she began to feel the full fury of the wind and waves, and knew the difficulty and danger of her undertaking. She had decided that her shortest and most direct course was within a few points of the wind, but the quartering of the waves on the broad bluff bows of the boat tended to throw it to leeward, a movement that, while it retarded her forward progress, no doubt saved the little craft from swamping. Again, the feebleness and shortness of her stroke, which never impelled her through a rising wave, but rather lifted her half way up its face, prevented the boat from taking much water, while her steadfast gaze, fixed only on the slowly retreating shore, kept her steering free from any fatal nervous vacillation, which the sight of the threatening seas on her bow might have produced. Preserved through her very weakness, ignorance, and simplicity of purpose, the dingey had all the security of a drifting boat, yet retained a certain gentle but persistent guidance. In this feminine fashion she made enough headway to carry her abreast of the Point, where she met the reflux current sweeping round it that carried her well along into the channel, now sluggish with the turn of the tide. After half an hour's pulling, she was delighted to find herself again in a reverse current, abreast of her cottage, but steadily increasing her distance from it. She was, in fact, on the <b>extreme</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of a vast whirlpool formed by the force of the gale on a curving lee shore, and was being carried to her destination in a semicircle around that bay which she never could have crossed. She was moving now in a line with the shore and the Fort, whose flagstaff, above its green, square, and white quarters, she could see distinctly, and whose lower water battery and landing seemed to stretch out from the rocks scarcely a mile ahead. Protected by the shore from the fury of the wind, and even of the sea, her progress was also steadily accelerated by the velocity of the current, mingling with the ebbing tide. A sudden fear seized her. She turned the boat's head towards the shore, but it was swept quickly round again; she redoubled her exertions, tugging frantically at her helpless oars. She only succeeded in getting the boat into the trough of the sea, where, after a lurch that threatened to capsize it, it providentially swung around on its short keel and began to drift stern on. She was almost abreast of the battery now; she could hear the fitful notes of a bugle that seemed blown and scattered above her head; she even thought she could see some men in blue uniforms moving along the little pier. She was passing it; another fruitless effort to regain her ground, but she was swept along steadily towards the Gate, the whitening bar, and the open sea.|$|E

40|$|The average {{polarization}} {{properties of}} conal single and double profiles directly reflect the polarization-modal {{structure of the}} emission beams which produce them. Conal component pairs exhibit large fractional linear polarization on their inside edges and virtually complete depolarization on their outside edges; whereas profiles resulting from sightline encounters with the outer conal edge are usually very depolarized. The polarization-modal character of subbeam circulation produces conditions whereby both angular and temporal averaging contribute to this polarization and depolarization. These circumstances combine to require that the circulating subbeam systems which produce conal beams entail paired PPM and SPM emission elements which are offset {{from each other in}} both magnetic azimuth and magnetic colatitude. Or, as rotating subbeam systems produce (on average) conal beams, one modal subcone has a little larger (or smaller) radius than the other. However, these PPM and SPM “beamlets ” cannot be in azimuthal phase, because both alternately dominate the emission on the <b>extreme</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the conal beam. While this configuration can be deduced from the observations, simulation of this rotating, modal subbea...|$|E
40|$|Using both {{light and}} high {{resolution}} electron microscopy, we analyzed the {{spatial and temporal}} relationships between the Arp 2 / 3 complex and the nucleation activity that is required for lamellipod extension in mammary carcinoma cells after epidermal growth factor stimulation. A rapid two- to fourfold increase in filament barbed end number occurs transiently after stimulation and remains confined almost exclusively to the <b>extreme</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> of the extending lamellipod (within 100 – 200 nm of the plasma membrane). This is accompanied {{by an increase in}} filament density at the leading edge and a general decrease in filament length, with a specific loss of long filaments. Concomitantly, the Arp 2 / 3 complex is recruited with a 1. 5 -fold increase throughout the entire cortical filament network extending 1 – 1. 5 μm in depth from the membrane at the leading edge. The recruitment of the Arp 2 / 3 complex at the membrane of the extending lamellipod indicates that Arp 2 / 3 may be involved in initial generation of growing filaments. However, only a small subset of the complex present in the cortical network colocalizes near free barbed ends. This suggests that the 100 – 200 -nm submembraneous compartment at {{the leading edge of the}} extending lamellipod constitutes a special biochemical microenvironment that favors the generation and maintenance of free barbed ends, possibly through the locally active Arp 2 / 3 complex, severing or decreasing the on-rate of capping protein. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis suggesting uncapping is the dominant mechanism responsible for the generation of nucleation activity. However, they support the hypothesis of an Arp 2 / 3 -mediated capture of actin oligomers that formed close to the membrane by other mechanisms such as severing. They also support pointed-end capping by the Arp 2 / 3 complex, accounting for its wide distribution at the leading edge...|$|E
40|$|Part 1 : Two new {{fields of}} {{application}} of the hot-wire anemometer are proposed, and the appropriate response equations and measuring procedures are developed. The first analysis leads to a method for the measurement of physically significant statistical quantities in a turbulent flow with heat transfer: for example the turbulence levels, the temperature fluctuation level, the turbulent heat transfer coefficient, the velocity scale, the temperature scale and some spectra. The second analysis {{involves the use of}} the hot-wire in the turbulent isothermal mixing of two appropriately different gases. If the thermal conductivity of the mixture is known and is a monotonic function of the relative concentration, it is possible to measure the mean velocity and mean concentration at any point. If no data are available on the thermal conductivity of the mixture, this additional unknown can be determined by an additional measurement. Furthermore, it is also possible to measure the various statistical functions of the fluctuating velocities and the local concentration fluctuation, provided, again, that the thermal conductivity is a known monotonic function of the concentration. Although the details of the present analysis are dependent upon the accuracy of King's equation for the rate of heat loss from fine wires, the general approach is equally valid for any (possibly more accurate) equation that may be deduced. Part 2 : A detailed investigation has been made of the flow in a round turbulent air jet, heated slightly to permit measurement of mean temperature. Oscillograms of the velocity fluctuation plus direct measurement of the turbulent shear both show that the flow in a fully developed "turbulent" jet is completely turbulent only out to approximately the radius at which the <b>extreme</b> <b>outer</b> <b>edge</b> is in the nature of a "laminar collar", with predominantly radial (inward) mean velocity, and in between the turbulent core and the laminar collar is a rather wide annular transition region. A study of the downstream history of the radial distribution of turbulent velocity shows that the fully developed state of this round jet is reached between 15 and 20 diameters. This conclusion is corroborated by examination of the partition between turbulent motion and mean motion, of total kinetic energy crossing planes perpendicular to the axis in unit time. The directly measured shear distribution is checked roughly by a computation of the same quantity from the mean velocity distribution. A measurement of the double correlation function between points symmetrical about the jet axis shows considerable similarity to the corresponding function in isotropic turbulence, and permits calculation of scale and microscale. With the assumption of constant microscale across a section, a rough estimate is made of the energy balance distribution of production, dissipation and diffusion of turbulent energy. A comparison with momentum transfer, modified vorticity transfer and constant exchange coefficient theories show that none of them is satisfactory. A comparison of mean velocity and temperature distributions verifies Ruden's result that the lateral rate of heat transfer in turbulent shear flow is appreciably greater that the lateral rate of momentum transfer. The use of considerably increased heating, in a second jet unit, has permitted direct measurement of the temperature fluctuation level. Velocity fluctuations were also measured in this case for comparison, and they were found to be the same order of magnitude. The final result is the direct measurement of temperature-velocity correlation and of velocity correlation in the hot jet. This gives a direct measure of the turbulent heat transfer and momentum transfer in the jet, and directly verifies the fact that the former is appreciably greater than the latter. ...|$|E
