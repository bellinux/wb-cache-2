500|$|T-Pain, who co-wrote [...] "Hot as Ice", was in {{the studio}} with Spears in February 2007, and stated that one of the three songs they {{recorded}} was finished in only an hour. He said that he [...] "thought {{she was going to be}} sitting on the couch eating Doritos or nachos or something [...] but she came in, shook my hand, gave me a hug and went right in the booth. She <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and put it down." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{discussing}} {{the development of}} the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics. Williams was more [...] "specific" [...] regarding the lyrics as he wanted to include words directly connected to the film and its character like [...] "bear", [...] "Paddington", and [...] "station"; Stefani said that she preferred for the song to be a [...] "little more abstract". She later reversed this view, saying that she agreed with Williams' interpretation after watching the film with her children and seeing the complete animations of the Paddington Bear character. In an interview with American Top 40, Stefani credited Williams as being central to the recording's development, saying that he was [...] "the one who really <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and was able to channel the film lyrically and make it really happen".|$|E
500|$|On May 15, 2004, when Red Sox regular {{starting}} {{third baseman}} Bill Mueller {{was placed on}} the disabled list, Youkilis was called up for the first time. [...] "I didn't sleep much", Youkilis said. [...] "I got about four hours of sleep. ... They told me the night before I was playing.... I <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and man, I was just amped up and excited." [...] During his first major-league game in Toronto, with his parents watching from the second row behind the dugout, Youkilis (in his second at bat) homered against 1996 Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen, becoming just the seventh player in team history to hit a home run in his first game. As a prank, the team initially gave Youkilis the silent treatment {{when he returned to the}} dugout after his homer. [...] "This one will go down probably as the greatest day of my life", he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{the open}} air," [...] replied the Carrier, [...] "just at dusk. 'Carriage Paid,' he said; {{and gave me}} eighteen-pence. Then he <b>got</b> <b>in.</b> And <b>there</b> he is." ...|$|R

2500|$|It was Ted Post and it {{was more}} relaxed. I {{remember}} running down this hill and getting up so much speed {{that one of these}} fabulous makeup men – big guy, burly chest – had to step in and stop me. Otherwise, I would have tumbled, God knows where. It was a very arduous picture, physically, with those horses and everything, but we just <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and did our jobs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mathis {{had worn}} his trunks very high, {{so that when}} Joe hit Mathis with {{legitimate}} body shots, the referee took {{a dim view of}} them. In the second round, the referee had {{gone so far as to}} penalize Joe two points for hitting below the belt. [...] "In a three-round bout a man can't afford a points deduction like that," [...] Joe would say. Joe then returned to Philadelphia feeling as low as he'd ever been and was even thinking of giving up boxing. Duke Dugent and his trainer Yank Durham were able to talk Joe out of his doldrums and even suggested Joe make the trip to Tokyo as an alternate, in case something happened to Mathis. Joe agreed and while there, he was a workhorse, sparring with any of the Olympic boxers who wanted some action. [...] "Middleweight, light heavyweight, it didn't matter to me, I <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and boxed all comers" [...] Joe would say. In contrast, Mathis was slacking off. In the morning, when the Olympic team would do their roadwork, Mathis would run a mile, then start walking saying [...] "Go ahead, big Joe. I'll catch up." [...] His amateur record was 38–2.|$|E
2500|$|King Kong was {{the first}} film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent The Lost World was {{actually}} the first—although it featured a rampaging Brontosaurus rather than a non-science-based monster—but was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film {{that has been made}} since 1933. These include The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), Godzilla (1954) and Jurassic Park (1993). The dinosaur scenes from King Kong are referenced or mimicked in the three Jurassic Park films, especially the second film, [...] (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a Tyrannosaurus rex) is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called The Venture, which {{is the name of the}} ship in King Kong). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in King Kong, Jeff Goldblum's character asks, [...] "What have they <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> King Kong?" [...] In the third film in this series, a Spinosaurus vs. Tyrannosaurus rex fight is similar to the Kong–rex battle in the original and the second remake.|$|E
6000|$|... 'So that's all {{you have}} to say to an old comrade!' said Dick; 'but, I say, Har'ld, I'm not going so. I must have some tin to take me to Portsmouth. I want to know what you've <b>got</b> <b>in</b> that <b>there</b> bag!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I daresay his bark {{is worse}} than his bite," [...] said the visitor, trembling; [...] "anyway, I’m going to stay here. I saw Mr. Robinson come here, and I believe he’s <b>got</b> him <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> Killing him, perhaps. Oh! Oh!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've <b>got</b> a nest <b>in</b> there!" [...] Peter exclaimed excitedly. [...] "There's no use denying it, Sprite; you've <b>got</b> a nest <b>in</b> <b>there!</b> What a {{perfectly}} lovely {{place for a}} nest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi, Phil, you rat, {{come out}} of that!" [...] roared Captain Hannock, savagely. [...] "What {{business}} have you <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there?</b> Git into the cabin and lively, or I'll warm you good!" ...|$|E
60|$|Breakfast {{was ready}} when I <b>got</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> {{was a cold}} chicken on the sideboard, devilled chicken on the table, a trio of boiled eggs, and a dish of {{scrambled}} eggs. As regarded quantity Mrs. Beale never failed us.|$|E
6000|$|... "My uncle told me I {{should find}} you out here. What have you <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> Pitt? Is {{this what you}} feed them on? I say, you know, queer coves, hens! I wouldn't touch that stuff for a fortune, what? Looks to me poisonous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{suppose it}} would make any {{difference}} how they marched so that they <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> time," [...] Isaac ventured to suggest timidly.|$|R

6000|$|The man in {{the grey}} suit got into an omnibus, going westward. We <b>got</b> <b>in</b> after him. <b>There</b> were latent {{reserves}} of youth still left in Mr. Bruff. I assert it positively--when he took his seat in the omnibus, he blushed! ...|$|R
60|$|One {{day while}} Pan {{was at this}} new uncle's, a dreadful thing happened--his first real tragedy. Some cowboy left the slide door of the granary open. Curly <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> at the wheat. Before it became known he ate {{enormously}} and then drank copiously. It foundered him. It killed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] {{said the}} clerk, staring about him wildly in the darkness. [...] "I've only just got back. I told you I {{had a long}} day's work this morning--I locked the door and shut the window down--it's open now, the window's open. Look! {{somebody}} has <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and taken the keys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it isn't a rat, and I don't {{believe that}} there is a rat there," [...] replied Farmer Brown's boy in triumph. [...] "It's that little scamp of a red {{squirrel}} we've seen racing along the wall at the edge of the Old Orchard lately. I can't imagine how he <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> but there he was, and now here he is." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{that they}} drove on to Market Saffron, and <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> time for lunch, and after lunch Mr. Direck {{explored}} {{the church and}} the churchyard and the parish register....|$|R
60|$|The guard said {{we could}} take any seats we pleased; and when we <b>got</b> <b>in</b> we found <b>there</b> was {{only two or three}} people in it, and we chose two nice armchairs, hung up our wraps, and made {{ourselves}} comfortable and cosey.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've <b>got</b> a {{prisoner}} <b>in</b> <b>there</b> named Blake," [...] went on Pan. [...] "I once lived near him. He {{used to play}} horse with me and ride me on his back. Will you {{let me talk to}} him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alone, I hope. I {{went to the}} station; {{the train}} had been ten minutes gone; but a young lady, alone, in mourning, and with no luggage but a little bag, had <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> for London. Happily, {{they did not know}} her; and it was the {{parliamentary}} train, which is five hours on the road. I telegraphed at once to your brother to meet her at the terminus.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, this marsh was a treacherous spot, and {{the tragic}} story was {{told of a}} cow who <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and sank till nothing was visible but a pair of horns above the mud, which suffocated the unwary beast. For this reason it was called [...] "Cowslip Marsh," [...] the wags said, though it was {{generally}} believed to be so named for the yellow flowers which grew there in great profusion in the spring.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hed trouble attendin' the trial, but I <b>got</b> <b>in.</b> <b>There</b> was a {{good many}} people there, all my boys, an' Judge Dyer with his several clerks. Also he hed with him the five riders who've been guardin' him pretty close of late. They was Carter, Wright, Jengessen, an' two new riders from Stone Bridge. I didn't hear their names, but I heard they was handy men with guns an' they looked more like rustlers than riders. Anyway, there they was, the five all in a row.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Police! order!' {{cried the}} showman. 'An Irish mob has <b>got</b> <b>in,</b> and <b>there's</b> {{an end of}} everything.' So up went the curtain, and the polyp appeared, {{becoming}} rapidly red coral as she perceived what the exhibition was, and why the politeness of the Green Isle revolted from her proclaiming her own unpopularity. But all she did was to turn gruffly aside, and say, 'It is lucky {{there are no more}} ladies to come, Mr. Showman, or the mob would turn everything to a compliment.' ...|$|R
50|$|A man (Sharlto Copley) {{wakes up}} in a large pit full of dead bodies and does not {{remember}} how he <b>got</b> <b>there.</b> <b>In</b> a panic he cries for help before a woman throws a rope down into the pit, allowing him to climb and escape.|$|R
5000|$|Fifth Harmony {{spoke about}} the {{extended}} play in an exclusive interview, saying [...] "It’s definitely going to sound different. All of the songs have a common thread - they’re all a genre of pop, we’ve <b>got</b> a ballad <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> There’s an 80’s song <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> they all sound really different, {{but there is a}} connection there".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you're too good, Seth Bartlett, that's what's {{the matter}} with you! Here's Dan been tellin' that you were jest {{about the same as}} dead when Ninety-four's men <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there.</b> The snuggest house in town burned, an' you thrown out of a home! After all that you've got the nerve to say there's no reason why we should catch Jip Collins! I ain't certain as you've got anythin' to do with it. S'posen the cops find out what was done--an' most likely Ninety-four's driver that you claim is a chum of yours will tell 'em--how are you goin' to help it if they try to find him?" ...|$|E
60|$|DEAR SIR,--What is {{the trouble}} with you? If it is your viscera, you cannot have them taken out and reorganized a moment too soon. I mean, if they are inside. But if you are {{composed}} of them, that is another matter. Is it your brain? But {{it could not be}} your brain. Possibly it is your skull: you want to look out for that. Some people, when they get an idea, it pries the structure apart. Your system of notation has <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there,</b> and couldn't find room, without a doubt that is what the trouble is. Your skull was not made to put ideas in, it was made to throw potatoes at.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Brother Purdy, we {{been having}} some pretty tempting offers from butchers and {{a slew of}} other folks for that lot next to your store, but I persuaded Brother Lyte that we ought to give you a shot at the {{property}} first. I said to Lyte, 'It'd be a rotten shame,' I said, 'if somebody went and opened a combination grocery and meat market right next door and ruined Purdy's nice little business.' Especially--" [...] Babbitt leaned forward, and his voice was harsh, [...] "--it would be hard luck if one of these cash-and-carry chain-stores <b>got</b> <b>in</b> <b>there</b> and started cutting prices below cost till they got rid of competition and forced you to the wall!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothin', Sir, only--only I don't {{think the}} Guard {{will be able}} to come through on so narrer a front, Sir. They'll all be jammed up be'ind the ridge if we've <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> time. It's awful sticky for guns {{at the end of our}} ground, Sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> {{time to help}} drag some of {{the poor}} fellows out.

Fortunately the night shift had just quit work or the casualties {{would have been much}} greater." ...|$|R
6000|$|Before {{any one of}} {{the terrified}} company could reply, the voice of Mr Mountchesney was heard. He was {{approaching}} them; he was no longer calm.

While <b>there</b> is time and we can manage them, you must leave the place." ...|$|R
