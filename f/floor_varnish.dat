50|$|In a style {{reminiscent}} of the Bahay na bato of pre-1860s heavily influenced by Spanish-style architecture, concrete materials are used on the ground <b>floor,</b> <b>varnished</b> wood on the second floor, and capiz for windows and other decorations. The house retains its original materials and architecture, including the molave stairs, the adobe walls, the wooden panels and the machuca tiles. It has a spacious second floor to accommodate social gatherings. A row thick, plaster-coated Tuscan columns supports the veranda on the side facing the Pasig River. The house faces the Pasig River {{because at the time}} it was built, most guests arrived by boat.|$|R

5000|$|Sock hops {{were held}} {{as early as}} 1944 by the American Junior Red Cross to raise funds during World War II. They then became a fad among American {{teenagers}} in 1948. Sock hops were commonly held at high schools and other educational institutions, often in the school gym or cafeteria. The term came about because dancers were required to remove their hard-soled shoes to protect the <b>varnished</b> <b>floor</b> of the gymnasium. The music at a sock hop was usually played from vinyl records, sometimes presented by a disc jockey. Occasionally there were also live bands. The popularity of sock hops coined the phrase Bobby soxer; which described the fans of traditional pop music.|$|R
60|$|My room at {{the hotel}} was as dreary as a stubble-field upon a November evening. The whole house was new, varnished, and hard. My bedroom was small. A piece of new ingrain carpet covered part of the hard <b>varnished</b> <b>floor.</b> Four hard walls and a ceiling, deadly white, {{surrounded}} me. The hard varnished bedstead (the mattress {{felt as if it}} were varnished) nearly filled the little room. Two stiff chairs, and a yellow window-shade which looked as if it were made of varnished wood, glittered in the feeble light of a glass lamp, while the ghastly grayish pallor of the ewer and basin on the wash-stand was thrown into bold relief by the intenser whiteness of the wall behind it.|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the first}} floor is via an elegant timber {{staircase}} with walls and balustrades of paneled timber. A round handrail is fixed with brackets to the balustrade and follows the curve of the staircase. Treads and risers are lined with carpet. Natural light enters the stairwell through the large arched leadlight window which is framed by wall mounted Art Deco light fittings. The vaulted ceiling over the stair is simply detailed and forms an archway to the upper vestibule. The upper level vestibule has walls lined with hard plaster and timber-paneling. Plaster ceilings have moulded plaster cornices. Timber skirting boards, architraves architrave blocks are intact throughout the room and all interior timber work and joinery has a varnished finish. Internal openings are generous in height and doors feature tall glazed pivoting fanlights. The first <b>floor</b> offices have <b>varnished</b> joinery including doors, architraves and picture rails and unusual decorative pelmets. Skirtings in these rooms have been painted.|$|R
40|$|Headspace {{technique}} and gas chromatography method with mas detector {{has been used}} for the determination of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emitted from various building and finishing materials, such as sealing foams, mounting strips, paints, <b>varnishes,</b> <b>floor</b> coverings. The tests were carried out for different temperatures (in the temperature range of 60 to 180 °C) and the time of heated vials with tested materials inside. These tests were conducted to verify the possibility of use this method of determination the VOC emission. Interpretation of chromatograms and mass spectra allowed to identify the type of compounds emitted from the tested materials and the optimum time and temperature for each type of material was determined. The increase in heating temperature of the samples resulted in increase the type and number of identified compounds: for four materials the increase was in the whole temperature range, for others it was from 90 °C. On the other hand, emission from mineral wool was low in whole temperature range. 30 -minutes heating of the samples was sufficient to identify emitted compounds for most of tested materials. Applying a longer time, i. e. 24 hours, significantly increased the sensitivity of the method...|$|R
50|$|Additionally, renovations {{involved}} {{removing the}} entire interior of areas being renovated, such that today's classrooms {{are not merely}} redone versions of the original rooms, but rather, entirely new rooms. One long-debated result of this renovation was that in removing the interior and building it anew, walls of concrete brick and glazed tiling were removed, and replaced uniformly with drywall. As a result, the walls are easily damaged and frequently require patching or painting. One other change was that many windows were covered or eliminated in the renovation. For example, {{the exterior of the}} building today reveals that along the upper section of the gymnasium, stuccoed panels cover what had been large windows. And most classrooms lost half their window area as glass bricks were covered over, leaving only the lower, operable parts of the windows exposed. The rear wall of the interior of the auditorium also once was lined with windows covered with drapes; renovations replaced the windows with walls. The only area of the school that appears nearly as it did when the building first opened is the auditorium and gymnasium lobby, which still combine terrazzo <b>flooring,</b> chrome, blond <b>varnished</b> wood, and glazed bricks, giving this area the character the entire building once had.|$|R
5000|$|The {{north and}} south walls of the one-story living room are wood framed 4 x 8 in columns. The columns are carried beneath the floor line to rest on {{concrete}} block foundation walls. 2 x 8 in floor joists on 16 in centers carry the rough floor.The full-height exterior bay walls are of plate glass. The glass was shipped from Pittsburgh, on special order, by rail and delivered to the contractor at the site for erection. One of the panels, on the screen porch or {{south side of the}} living room wall, is capable of sliding open to a full door of 8 x 9 ft, by means of a continuous steel slide and steel barn door hangers.As stated above, the exterior materials used in the Horner House include naturally bleached heart redwood, bevelled joint cladding, always used vertically, and plate glass. The two-story core of the main house contains manufactured casement windows, transite spandrels and heads with redwood corners and facias. The doors are solid lumber core, stained and varnished.The screened porch is constructed of four built-up columns, suspended from the cantilevered ceiling joists. The <b>floors</b> are pine <b>varnished.</b> The copper screen has been attached with copper-headed nails to the uprights in 36" [...] horizontal bands and then hand-sewn with copper wire at the selvage edges to form a floor-to ceiling screen [...] "wall", in four bays, along its 32 ft length. The screens presently in place on the porch are original.|$|R
5000|$|Woodstock Elementary School was {{completed}} in 1906 {{at a cost of}} $18,913.00 on a three-acre plot of land that had been purchased for $1,600.00, making the total cost of $20,513.00. It was a two-story brick building with six large classrooms. At the front of each classroom, there was a door for the teacher. Near the rear of the classroom, there were two separate adjacent doors, one for the boys and one for the girls. A five-feet high wooden partition extended out into the corridor from between these two doorways, running along the corridor away from the outside wall nearly the length of the classroom. Thus, one section of the corridor provided the girls with their coat hall, and the other section provided the boys with theirs. Two rows of hooks were located on both the partition and the corridor wall for the students to hang their wraps on and during inclement weather they left their galoshes {{on the floor next to}} the wall. [...] The building had hard wood <b>floors</b> and beautifully <b>varnished</b> scrollwork and woodwork throughout the building. Twice each year, the floor was mopped by women hired specifically for this purpose using big long mops, boiling water, and strong soap. The first mopping was done before the beginning of the school year and the second during Christmas break. After the mopping {{was completed}} each time, a coat of linseed oil was applied to the floors. The floors were swept during the year by using a mixture of linseed oil and sawdust as a sweeping compound.The school received its name from the novel Woodstock, written by Sir Walter Scott in 1826. Its setting was a hunting lodge in Woodstock, England. The name was originally suggested by David W. Moffett, an educator in the Granite School District.|$|R
