5|$|In {{addition}} to NIT, Norfolk {{is home to}} Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, with an annual throughput of approximately 48,000,000 tons. Bituminous coal is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, West Virginia, and Kentucky. The coal <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> onto trains {{and sent to the}} port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The SS197SR is {{currently}} offered to civilian shooters {{in addition to}} the SS195LF. It uses the same lead core 2.6-g (40grain) Hornady V-Max projectile as the SS196SR, but it <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> for a muzzle velocity roughly 30-m/s (100ft/s) higher. The projectile has a blue-colored polymer tip instead of the red color used in the SS196 projectile tip. The SS197 has been manufactured by Fiocchi, under contract for FN Herstal, since 2006 and it is distributed in the United States by Federal Cartridge Company.|$|E

5|$|The game uses SoundFonts {{to provide}} {{additional}} ambient sound effects. A Sound Blaster AWE32 or AWE64 is required to use this feature. The player can load a SoundFont and use it for ambient sound effects. Customised SoundFonts can be created to personalise the dungeon. The game features three SoundFonts, one of which <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> at game startup, and Creative offered sample Dungeon Keeper SoundFonts for download.|$|E
5|$|Ridge Racer Revolution {{features}} two hidden modes; 'Drift Contest', where {{points are}} earned {{according to how}} well spins are performed on certain corners, and 'Pretty Racer' (also known as 'Buggy mode'), in which the cars size appears with deformed body sizes, similar to Choro-Q cars, {{which led to the}} arcade game Pocket Racer. Mirrored tracks that function identically to the original game are accessible. Like the first game, a music CD can be inserted and listened to instead of the soundtrack. Unlike the first game, only the last course played <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> into the PlayStation's memory; to switch, the game disc needs to be reinserted before loading.|$|E
5|$|The {{real issue}} is that it moves the moral center more towards the obscene. That it becomes more normal to be more sexually promiscuous, because they are bombarded with imagery that <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> with innuendo, and that is seen as normal, even preferred... if girls and women find their {{identity}} and self-worth in the approval of people, they will {{do whatever it takes}} to become popular and loved. When stars like Rihanna, who blast sexuality, are thrust into the limelight, girls tend to think that is the way for them to be valuable. God tells us that we are fearfully and wonderfully made... bearing His image. Rihanna is selling a lie.|$|E
50|$|It should {{eventually}} {{be possible for}} any ITSO product to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> onto any ITSO card. However, this has only been implemented so far in Newcastle, where Nexus allows Metro tickets to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> on to any ITSO-compliant smartcard, and Greater Manchester, where System One Travelcards can <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> on to most ITSO cards. South West Trains ticket vending machines allow tickets to <b>be</b> <b>loaded</b> onto most ITSO cards.|$|R

5|$|Today, bulkers make up 15% - 17% of the world's {{merchant}} fleets {{and range}} in size from single-hold mini-bulkers to mammoth ore ships able to carry 400,000metric tons of deadweight (DWT). A number of specialized designs exist: some can unload their own cargo, some depend on port facilities for unloading, and some even package the cargo as it <b>is</b> <b>loaded.</b> Over half of all bulkers have Greek, Japanese, or Chinese owners and more than a quarter are registered in Panama. South Korea is the largest single builder of bulkers, and 82% of these ships were built in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Posing as a nurse, Eva wheels Diabolik past {{groups of}} people. He sneaks into the morgue where Valmont's {{body has been}} cremated, {{collects}} the eleven emeralds from his ashes and escapes. The police discover that Diabolik is still alive and offer a million-dollar reward for him. He reacts by blowing up the tax offices. Without tax revenue, {{the country is in}} debt and sells off some gold to buy currency. Twenty tons of gold is melted into one solid block to make it difficult to steal, and the block <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> on a train. Diabolik and Eva divert the train by leaving a burning truck on the tracks and re-route it to a bridge where a bomb is placed. It explodes when the train arrives and the gold falls into the water below. Diabolik and Eva collect it and return it to their hideout.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, running at a display resolution of 320×200 pixels. These versions received less play-testing than other versions, making for a less-fluid game, but the Amiga's sound capabilities afford it a high sound quality compared to contemporary ports. The game released on the Atari ST is identical, {{but with a}} less refined sound, and its colors are less sharp than on Amiga. These versions had code wheel protection that {{made it difficult to}} use unauthorized copies, forcing the player to enter a code (series of figures) looked up from a code wheel that came with the game. The player had to turn the wheel according to the number that was requested in the screen whenever the game <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> in order to reload the game. Another small change between the Amiga and ST versions and the others was that Lester would yell as he grabs the vine in the first area if he was not being chased by the beast in these versions; this feature was omitted from most other versions.|$|E

Programming was mostly in the COBOL, RPG and Assembler languages for the commercial applications that were the predominant uses of this computer, but Fortran {{could also be used}} for the scientific and engineering applications.|$|R
5|$|When {{warfarin}} is newly started, it may promote clot formation temporarily. This {{is because}} the level of protein C and protein S are also dependent on vitamin K activity. Warfarin causes decline in protein C levels in first 36 hours. In addition, reduced levels of protein S lead {{to a reduction in}} activity of protein C (for which it is the co-factor) and therefore reduced degradation of factor Va and factor VIIIa. Although loading doses of warfarin over 5mg also produce a precipitous decline in factor VII, resulting in an initial prolongation of the INR, full antithrombotic effect does not take place until significant reduction in factor II occurs days later. The haemostasis system becomes temporarily biased towards thrombus formation, leading to a prothrombotic state. Thus, when warfarin <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> rapidly at greater than 5mg per day, it is beneficial to co-administer heparin, an anticoagulant that acts upon antithrombin and helps reduce the risk of thrombosis, with warfarin therapy for four to five days, in order to have the benefit of anticoagulation from heparin until the full effect of warfarin has been achieved.|$|E

25|$|The {{differences}} between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript <b>is</b> <b>loaded</b> as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.|$|E

There is a primary Jaw Crusher, two secondary cone crushers, a six bin screening building and a 1.2 Million tonne capacity stockyard.
