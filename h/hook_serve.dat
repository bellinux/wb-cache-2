5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game is spent sailing between islands on Link's boat, the King of Red Lions. The boat's sail is driven by wind that blows across the game world in one of eight directions; a tailwind behind the boat will give it top speed, while sailing against the wind is difficult. The Great Sea features different enemies and obstacles than appear on land. Some items serve new purposes on the King of Red Lions; for instance, the grappling <b>hook</b> <b>serves</b> as a crane for recovering sunken treasure. Link explores the sea {{with the help of a}} sea chart, which can be updated with information on each square and island. Through the game, Link acquires additional charts pointing the way to treasure chests and significant locations. On land, dungeons feature similar maps.|$|R

40|$|A central {{challenge}} in nanotechnology is the parallel fabrication of complex geometries for nanodevices. Here we report a general method for arranging single-walled carbon nanotubes in two dimensions using DNA origami—a technique {{in which a}} long single strand of DNA is folded into a predetermined shape. We synthesize rectangular origami templates (~ 75 nm × 95 nm) that display two lines of single-stranded DNA ‘hooks’ in a cross pattern with ~ 6 nm resolution. The perpendicular lines of <b>hooks</b> <b>serve</b> as sequence-specific binding sites for two types of nanotubes, each functionalized non-covalently with a distinct DNA linker molecule. The hook-binding domain of each linker is protected to ensure efficient hybridization. When origami templates and DNA-functionalized nanotubes are mixed, strand displacement-mediated deprotection and binding aligns the nanotubes into cross-junctions. Of several cross-junctions synthesized by this method, one demonstrated stable field-effect transistor-like behaviour. In such organizations of electronic components, DNA origami serves as a programmable nanobreadboard; thus, DNA origami may allow the rapid prototyping of complex nanotube-based structures...|$|R
50|$|These hooks {{shoot out}} of the rocket when the proper button is pressed and sink a {{tethered}} projectile into the first thing in their path, be it pylon, mine, sporting equipment, body, {{or anything else that}} can be grappled (with the proper upgrade they can even grapple the ground). The grappling hook guns are fixed to shoot out horizontally, 45 degrees to {{the left and the right}} of the rocket's direction of motion. The player can also tap a key to connect the left grapple line to the right one and fly free, leaving a clothesline obstruction for others. Hence, grappling <b>hooks</b> <b>serve</b> a dual purpose: tight turns on pylons and anything else stationary (which are spread throughout the arenas), as well as offensive tactics such as setting traps and grappling mines, other rockets, and even other riders! Rockets also have the ability during play to receive power-ups, such as repair and speed boost. Grappling hook projectiles and cables are also modifiable.|$|R

He became chef of a new restaurant in the Glover Park neighborhood called Blue Ridge in 2009. His work at Blue Ridge led John Mariani of Esquire Magazine to name Seaver the 2009 Chef of the Year. The designation polarized restaurant critics. Seaver left Blue Ridge in early 2010 to work on other projects. His plans for a 6700 sq ft combination sustainable seafood market and restaurant in Logan Circle to be called Diamond District Seafood Company were put on hold indefinitely in 2010 due to problems with the location.

40|$|Object-oriented {{frameworks}} are {{an important}} technique for capturing design expertise. However, the learning curve for a framework is usually quite steep and can be the biggest obstacle in its adoption. We propose an executable and yet readable method for framework documentation using the Java Modelling Language (JML), based on the specification {{of the interaction between}} a framework 2 ̆ 7 s template methods and its customizable hooks. This method is geared toward allowing the developers to quickly instantiate a prototype application from the framework, which can be later tweaked using some other detailed and usually non-executable documentation. We use flow-based assertions to specify the hook method preconditions and template method postconditions. The flow-based precondition for a particular <b>hook</b> <b>serves</b> as a modular documentation of when and how that hook is called in the framework 2 ̆ 7 s overall call-sequence. Similarly, the flow-based postcondition of a template method tells the possible sequences of hook invocations that its execution may cause. Flow-based assertions are written using a few types, which we precisely specify. We also briefly describe a case study that uses our technique to document a Model-View-Controller framework...|$|R
