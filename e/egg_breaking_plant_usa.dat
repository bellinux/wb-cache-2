40|$|Eleven {{percent of}} the eggs {{produced}} in the U. S. go to <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>plants</b> to produce more than 800 million pounds of various liquid egg products annually. This {{study was conducted to}} determine the wastewater problems of thfs industry, the potential for reduction of wastewaters by in-plant management methods, and the treatability of the effluents. This report is divided into three sections- industry re-view, waste characterization and in-plant control, and treatability. Five <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>plants</b> were sampled which covered a size ranging from small installations (one <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> machine) to one of the largest (twelve breaking machines). Three facilities were extensively sampled before and after in-plant management methods were adopted to determine the effectiveness of source control of wastes.

40|$|Part 1 {{appeared}} on page 23 of the March/April issue. In {{a study of}} five <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> <b>plants</b> {{ranging in size from}} small to very large installations, in-plant waste conservation methods resulted in recovery of product with a value between. $ 250 and $ 500 per day for a medium sized facility. After completion of the effluent analysis, detailed in-plant sampling was conducted to determine the source of pollutants. This included collecting weighted composited sam-ples of the egg washer overflow and sump contents, continual overflow from the egg breaker and flushing of vats, tanks, strainers, piping and pasteurizer. Other sources of water included rejected inedible eggs from the washer and breaker operations that were not deposited in the proper receptacles, egg product dripping from the <b>breaking</b> machine, malfunc-tioning <b>egg</b> loading device on the egg washing machine, leaking pumps and piping connections and vat spillovers. All of the latter losses are examples of unmeasurable loss-es that were referred to as floor losses. Examples of the comparison of the total of various sources are shown in Figure 6. Although the egg washers contributed only five to ten percent of the plant’s total wastewa-ter, the BOD loss represented from one quarter to half the total plant loss. Since the total volume of egg washing water in a medium sized fa-cility (three breakers, for example) would-be about 500 gpd, it seemed appropriate to consider removing this entire stream from the sewer.

The yield of dry coagulated solids from wastes collected during cleanup was approximately 12 lb. /IOKl gal., and from the concentrated wastes in the egg washers, the yield was approximately 40 lb. / 1000 gal. The estimated polymer cost for coagulation of the egg washer wastes was $ 0. 80 / 1000 gal. The amino acid composition of five samples of coagulated egg by-products approximated closely the composition of whole eggs. The value of the coagulated solids and the savings in waste treatment charges may encourage segregation and treatment of concentrated <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> wastes...|$|R

40|$|Bacteria {{belonging}} to the Bacillus cereus group are commonly found in soil, air, dust, water and in many raw and processed foods. Several strains of this group have been implicated in food-borne illness. These bacteria are also prolific enzyme producers (lipases, proteases) and are recognised as causing spoilage in several pasteurised foodstuffs. Some strains exhibit psychrotrophic properties, causing an increasing problem during refrigerated storage and distribution of perishable food products. The monitoring and control of these bacteria are then of high importance for the <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> industry. For {{a better understanding of}} their diversity and ecological distribution, successful molecular typing methods are needed. Among the methods described for the typing of B. cereus group strains, the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) has already been carried out in order to build B. cereus genetic maps, to show the genomic diversity among B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, to discriminate B. anthracis from B. cereus and B. thuringiensis, and for several epidemiologic investigations. The aim {{of the present study was}} to discriminate, by a PFGE method adapted in our laboratory from the work of Gautier et al.

40|$|The {{adhesion}} {{of microorganisms}} to industrial surfaces is frequently {{observed in the}} food industry. Adhering bacteria can colonize the surfaces and organize into biofilms that provide cell protection against many stresses such as those due to disinfectants. Poorly controlled, they can {{be the source of}} food product contamination and/or food spoilage, and therefore may have important economical and sanitary consequences. The aim {{of this study was to}} use stainless steel chips for the identification of the type of adhering bacteria inside the pipelines of 7 French <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> companies. Sterile stainless steel chips were suspended inside the pipelines at two levels, before and after the pasteurizer, and at two seasons (summer and winter). After two months, the adhering flora was harvested by sonication and scrapping in tryptone salt, followed by plating onto BHI-YE and incubation for 1 to 7 day(s) at 30 °C, with or without oxygen. After incubation, the colonies were identified by sequencing. The harvested cells were mainly facultative aerobic-anaerobic and Gram positive bacteria. However, a broad range of diversity was highlighted, at the location level (7 companies), at the process level (before and after pasteurization), and at the season level (summer and winter). This study, using a simple system of recovery of adhering cells, highlights the flora present on the surface of the equipments of <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> companies and represents the first step to better understand and control cell adhesion and biofilm development in this type of food industry...|$|R

40|$|Natural {{antibodies}} (NAb) are {{an important}} component of the first line of immune defense. Selective breeding for enhanced NAb levels in chickens may improve general disease resistance. It is unknown what the consequences of selection for NAb will be on the productive performance of laying hens. In this paper we describe the genetic relations between NAb titers binding keyhole limpet hemocyanin at 19 wk age and production traits in a white purebred leghorn chicken line observed in several time periods. A linear animal model was used to estimate (co) variance components, heritabilities, and correlations. Negative genetic correlations were found between egg weight and NAb titers, and between <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> strength and NAb titers. Positive genetic correlations were found between the feed conversion ratio (consumed feed/egg mass produced) and NAb titers, and egg production and NAb titers. Negative phenotypic correlations were found between body weight and NAb titers, between egg weight and NAb titers, and between <b>egg</b> <b>breaking</b> strength and NAb titers. Positive phenotypic correlations were found between egg production and NAb titers, and feed conversion ratio and NAb titers. In general, phenotypic correlations were more often significant, but less pronounced than genetic correlations. Other production traits were not found to be significant related to NAb titers. These findings suggest that there is a genetic tradeoff between levels of immunity and some production traits, although the underlying mechanism(s) remain(s) unclear. The results suggest possible consequences for production efficiency as a result of selective breeding for improved general disease resistance by natural antibodies...|$|R
