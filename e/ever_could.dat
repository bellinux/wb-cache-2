5|$|Passing {{through the}} hands of four owners during its troubled 23-year history, Nittany Furnace never {{fulfilled}} the expectations developed when it replaced the antiquated (charcoal) Bellefonte Furnace. It should arguably never have been built: {{by the time it}} went into blast in 1888, the price per ton of iron had already been driven below $22, a historic low, and it would almost never rise above that figure until the onset of World War I. The sprawling steel works of Pittsburgh, fed by Mesabi Range ore, could produce iron more cheaply than the furnaces at Bellefonte <b>ever</b> <b>could.</b> The principal advantage of a Bellefonte location — proximity to local ore deposits — was negated by the availability of easily mined, high-grade Mesabi ore, hauled by rail.|$|E

25|$|Minerals called clays and sulfates are {{byproducts}} of water. They {{also may}} preserve signs of past life.

Gale is special because both clays and sulfate minerals, which formed in water under different conditions, can be observed.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{was inaugurated}} as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular {{president}}, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, {{before his death}} five years later, {{said that she was}} a better president than he <b>ever</b> <b>could</b> have been. She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed new life into the role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect, and political experience. She reached out to the Irish diaspora (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of Anglo-Irish relations, when she was the first serving Irish president to visit the United Kingdom and meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably the Prince of Wales, to her official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E

It got us international publicity. It put us on the map." ...|$|E
50|$|Tibet {{had closed}} to foreigners but Nepal had just opened up.

Unfortunately for the British, who had enjoyed exclusive access to the mountain for 31 years from Tibet to the north, the Nepalese government gave the 1952 permit to the Swiss.|$|R

500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he put it), under which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible that I <b>ever</b> <b>could</b> have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time." [...] By 1901 he would write of growing [...] "indignant at all [...] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.|$|E
500|$|Also in 2000, she {{appeared}} in Waking the Dead, a film based on the 1986 novel of the same name, playing Sarah Williams, an activist killed by a car bomb in Minneapolis while she was driving Chilean refugees (Strangely, Sarah Williams was also the name of Connelly's character in Labyrinth). Initially, director Keith Gordon was reluctant to cast Connelly in this role as he did not consider her a serious actress. Her agent Risa Shapiro persuaded him to watch Connelly's performance in Far Harbor. Gordon later said: [...] "There was a subtlety and depth even to her gaze that captured more of the relationship than I <b>ever</b> <b>could</b> have hoped for." [...] About her role, Connelly said, [...] "Waking the Dead was the first film I worked on where whatever I did felt like my own thing. I was really trying {{to make something of}} the part and threw myself into it, so that meant a lot to me". The New York Times described her performance, [...] "As Sarah, Ms. Connelly captures a burning ethereality and willfulness that are very much of the period. And she and Mr. Crudup connect powerfully in love scenes that convey the fierce tenderness of a relationship whose passion carries a tinge of religious fervor." ...|$|E
500|$|In season five, Mary Alice {{appears in}} {{multiple}} flashbacks in [...] "The Best Thing That <b>Ever</b> <b>Could</b> Have Happened", including when handyman Eli Scruggs (Beau Bridges) was first starting out and approached Mary Alice on the street, asking {{her if she}} had any work for him. After initially declining, she notices a hole in his shoe and says she has a broken vase that he can glue back together for her. Years later, on the day Mary Alice committed suicide, Eli was at her house dropping something off. He asks if she is alright, to which she says she is, and just as he is about to leave she picks up the vase he glued for her and says she wants him to have it. Eli asks again if she is alright, and she politely asks him to leave. Later that day, after Mary Alice had shot herself, Eli watches police cars and neighbors gossiping from afar, regretting that he did nothing to save her. He then makes a vow to God to not only fix people's belongings but their lives as much as he can as well. In season six, Mary Alice again appears in a flashback in [...] "Epiphany", when she notices four-year-old Eddie Orlofsky (Davin Ransom) witnessing his father leave their family. Mary Alice continues to check on Eddie and his mother Barbara (Diane Farr), bringing them a hot meal and later to bring a teddy bear for Eddie, where she finds the young child left home alone. Mary Alice finds Barbara in a bar, brings her home and scolds her for her poor parenting skills.|$|E

[...] Stylus Magazine called it [...] "a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start." [...] Neumu.net gave it nine stars out of ten and called it [...] "a fierce record". Almost Cool gave it a score of 8.75 out of ten and said, [...] "I'm not sure if it's the work by O'Rourke or the progression of the group (or a little of both), but this disc is so multi-layered that it's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen." [...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more adventurous and rewarding release". The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- {{it becomes clear that}} these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world... <b>ever?</b> <b>Could</b> be..." [...] Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "The most common description of this much-discussed album {{over the past few months}} is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that." [...] Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi." [...] Q likewise gave it four stars and called it [...] "battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts" [...] and that it [...] "at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating." [...] Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke." ...|$|E

Bryant said, [...] "hey were a lot older, at kind {{of the end of}} their careers. We have just a bunch of young racehorses, guys that are eager to compete". Dream Team member Charles Barkley said that he [...] "just started laughing" [...] upon hearing Bryant's comment and thought the 1992 team would win by double digits. Michael Jordan added: [...] "For [...] to compare those two teams {{is not one of the}} smarter things he <b>ever</b> <b>could</b> have done... Remember now, they learned from us. We didn't learn from them". Bird joked, [...] "They probably could. I haven't played in 20 years and we're all old now." [...] Bryant later clarified that he thought the 1992 team was better, but it was [...] "ludicrous" [...] to think his team could not beat the Dream Team in one game.

2500|$|Parnell's {{personal}} complexities or his {{perception of}} a need for political expediency to his goal permitted him to condone radical republican and the atheist Charles Bradlaugh, while he associated himself with {{the hierarchy of the}} Catholic Church. Parnell was a close friend and political associate of fellow land reform activist Thomas Nulty, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Meath, until Parnell's divorce crisis in 1889. Charles Parnell was linked both with the landed aristocracy class and the Irish Republican Brotherhood, with speculation in the 1890s that he may have even joined the latter organisation. The historian Andrew Roberts argues that he was sworn into the IRB in the Old Library at Trinity College Dublin in May 1882 and that this was concealed for 40 years. In Barry O'Brien's Parnell, X, Fenian Parliamentarian John O'Connor Power, relates, 'And, in fact, I was, about this time , deputed to ask Parnell to join us. I did ask him. He said [...] "No" [...] without a moment's hesitation.' He was conservative by nature, leading some historians to suggest that personally he would have been closer to the Conservative rather than to the Liberal Party, but for political needs. Andrew Kettle, Parnell's right-hand man, who shared a lot of his opinions, wrote of his own views, [...] "I confess that I felt , and still feel, a greater leaning towards the British Tory party than I <b>ever</b> <b>could</b> have towards the so-called Liberals." [...] In later years, the double effect of the Phoenix Park trauma and the O'Shea affair reinforced the conservative side of his nature.|$|E
