50|$|Although {{the theory}} of central pattern {{generation}} calls for basic rhythmicity and patterning to be centrally generated, CPGs can respond to sensory feedback to alter the patterning in behaviorally appropriate ways. Alteration of the pattern is difficult because feedback received during only one phase may require changed movement in {{the other parts of}} the patterned cycle to preserve certain coordination relationships. For example, walking with a pebble in the right shoe alters the entire gait, even though the stimulus is only present while standing on the right foot. Even during the time when the left foot is down and the sensory feedback is inactive, action is taken to prolong the right leg swing and extend the time on the left foot, leading to limping.

The physiological mechanisms underlying facultative responses to unpredictable perturbations of the environment will allow us to understand why some populations are able to cope more than others. This is important for basic biology as well as for conservation. Northern populations of White-crowned Sparrow (Zonotrichia leucophrys), show varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> the adrenocortical response to acute stress early in the breeding season. These variations are related to a short breeding season at high latitudes and altitudes (up-regulation of the stress response), and possibly <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> parental care (down-regulation of the stress response). Investigations of many taxa from the northern hemisphere indicate these types <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> are widespread among vertebrates. However, <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> the adrenocortical response to stress is much less well-known in the southern hemisphere and Neotropical birds present an ideal model system to test whether patterns of hormonal responses to stress in the northern hemisphere are consistent worldwide. Equatorial, high altitude, populations of the Rufous-collared Sparrow (Z. capensis costaricensis), a southern congener of the White-crowned Sparrow, have long breeding seasons, but show no early breeding up-regulation of the adrenocortical responses to stress. This pattern is more similar to mid-latitude, low altitude, populations of White-crowned Sparrows. Whether austral high latitude and altitude populations of the Rufous-collared Sparrows modulate these processes, under presumably similar constraints of mid- to high latitude seasonality in the north, is currently under investigation.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that pro- and antisaccades may deploy {{different}} cognitive processes. However, the specific reason why antisaccades have longer latencies than prosaccades is still under debate. In three experiments, we studied the factors contributing to the antisaccade cost by taking attentional orienting and target location probabilities into account. In experiment 1, using a new antisaccade paradigm, we directly tested Olk and Kingstone's hypothesis, which attributes longer antisaccade latency to {{the time it takes to}} reorient from the visual target to the opposite saccadic target. By eliminating the reorienting component in our paradigm, we found no significant difference between the latencies of the two saccade types. In experiment 2, we varied the proportion of prosaccades made to certain locations and found that latencies in the high location-probability (75 %) condition were faster than those in the low location-probability condition. Moreover, antisaccade latencies were significantly longer when location probability was high. This pattern can be explained by the notion of competing pathways for pro- and antisaccades in findings of others. In experiment 3, we further explored the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> <b>of</b> location probability by decreasing the magnitude of high probability from 75 to 65 %. We again observed a pattern similar to that seen in experiment 2 but with smaller modulation effects.

Furthermore, the antisaccade cost can be modulated by probabilistic contextual information such as location probabilities...|$|R

These modifications were made to address the hypothesis that: 1) cyclic extravascular compressional modulation of the cerebral venous bed occurs during positive pressure inhalation; and 2) the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> is diminished with increasing vascular dilation induced by increasing {{the level of the}} partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO 2) within the arterial blood. Modification of the isovolumetric model was accomplished by introducing a cyclic modulation of the resistance of the cerebral venous bed synchronized with ventilation. Simulated model recordings demonstrated that the correlation index between arterial blood pressure and ICP progressively increased monotonically as the level of PCO 2 increased from 30 mmHg to 80 mmHg. These results support the premise that during positive pressure ventilation, cyclic extravascular compressional modulation of primarily the cerebral venous bed produces a cyclic variation of ICP and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> is dependent on the state of vascular dilation...|$|E

Further, aftereffects from overlapped opponent pairs of adaptor shapes (e. g., concave and convex shapes) were substantially modulated by attention [Vision Res. 41 (2001) 3883]. Hypothetically, (1) attention might weight the attended and ignored contours at {{early stages of}} processing, or (2) it might sway opposing neural activity (e. g., of convex- vs. concave-tuned units) at the stage of opponent shape coding. Attentional modulation was equivalent for opponent pairs (producing opposite aftereffects) and non-opponent pairs (producing orthogonal aftereffects) of overlapped adaptor shapes, whether convexity or aspect-ratio aftereffects were measured. Further, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>modulation</b> obtained for these aftereffects (∼ 60 %) was comparable to that obtained for V 4 cells [J. Neurosci. 19 (1999) 1736].

The transferrin receptor (TfR) is involved in iron uptake by internalization of transferrin and is overexpressed in rapidly growing tumors.

To investigate whether these proteins play a role for sensitivity towards artesunate, Oncotest’s 36 cell line panel was treated with artesunate or artesunate plus iron(II) glycine sulfate (FerrosanolH). The majority of cell lines showed increased inhibition rates, for the combination of artesunate plus iron(II) glycine sulfate compared to artesunate alone. However, in 11 out of the 36 cell lines the combination treatment was not superior. Cell lines with high TfR expression significantly correlated with high <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>modulation</b> indicating that high TfR expressing tumor cells would be more efficiently inhibited by this combination treatment than low TfR expressing ones. Furthermore, we found {{a significant relationship between}} cellular response to artesunate and TfR expression in 55 cell lines of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), USA. A significant correlation was also found for ABCB 6, but not for ABCB 7 in the NCI panel.
