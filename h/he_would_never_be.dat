5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, {{he had no}} interest in working outside the film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear in a series of television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to film his stories.|$|E
5|$|The {{police at}} first {{believed}} that Sheila, diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots then turned {{the gun on}} herself. But weeks after the murders Jeremy Bamber's ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Bamber had shot the family with his father's semi-automatic rifle, then placed {{the gun in his}} unstable sister's hands {{to make it look like}} a murder–suicide. A silencer the prosecution said was on the rifle would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila's fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Bamber was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority, sentenced to a minimum of 25 years, and informed in 1994 that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Groves {{remained}} {{in charge of}} the Manhattan Project until responsibility for nuclear weapons production was handed over to the United States Atomic Energy Commission in 1947. He then headed the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, which had been created to control the military aspects of nuclear weapons. He was given a dressing down by the Chief of Staff of the United States Army, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower, and told that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> appointed Chief of Engineers. Three days later, Groves announced his intention to leave the Army. He was promoted to lieutenant general just before his retirement on 29 February 1948 in recognition of his leadership of the bomb program. By a special Act of Congress, his date of rank was backdated to 16 July 1945, the date of the Trinity nuclear test. He {{went on to become a}} vice-president at Sperry Rand.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Harvey was {{selected}} to play his only Test, the Fourth Test at Adelaide, filling in for the injured Barnes. England batted first and made 460 before being dismissed late on the second day. Harvey opened with Arthur Morris, and made 12 in the first innings before being bowled by Bedser while playing an aggressive shot. With {{only a few minutes}} of play left, the Australian captain Don Bradman came in and he too was bowled by Bedser, without scoring a run. Harvey later privately said the Bradman had told him to play cautiously and survive {{until the end of the}} day, rather than attack, and that the captain was angry with the resulting two wickets. According to Harvey, Bradman told him that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> selected for Australia again. The tourists then declared during the last afternoon and left Australia a target of 314. The target was not a realistic offer and Morris and Harvey put on an opening stand of 116 before the latter was bowled for 31 by the medium pace of occasional bowler Norman Yardley. The match ended in a draw with Australia on 1/215.|$|E
25|$|Wray {{served in}} the US Army during the Korean War, and {{contracted}} tuberculosis, which hospitalized him for a year. His stay concluded with the removal of a lung, which doctors predicted would mean <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to sing again.|$|E
25|$|Although Tucker {{was one of}} {{the most}} well-respected legal thinkers of his day, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> {{appointed}} to the Supreme Court of the United States - quite possibly because there were already two Virginians (John Marshall and Bushrod Washington) serving there at the time.|$|E

25|$|Antiwar activist Abbie Hoffman {{burned his}} draft card privately in the Spring of 1967. Hoffman's card {{classified}} him as 4F—unfit for service—because of bronchial asthma.

Thinking his efforts successful, yet heartbroken, Hamid {{makes his way to}} Mecca.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} discussions in whether Benoit {{would ever be}} {{inducted}} into the WWE Hall of Fame.

Chris Jericho also stated that Benoit should never be in the Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|Prior to his retirement, Maldini {{expressed}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> {{moving into a}} coaching career. He was offered a position that would have reunited him with his former manager Carlo Ancelotti by joining Chelsea as a coach having reportedly met with Ancelotti and with Chelsea's owner, Roman Abramovich, to discuss such a possibility. Ancelotti later announced that Maldini had turned down his offer {{to become part of}} Chelsea's coaching staff.|$|E

25|$|On July 4, 1986, 21-year-old Marine Lance Corporal, Howard Foote Jr., an {{aviation}} mechanic at El Toro, took an A-4 Skyhawk on an unauthorized 90 minute joyride over southern California.

He landed the aircraft safely and was subsequently discharged under less than honorable conditions after serving 4 1/2 months in confinement.|$|E
25|$|On November 11, 1991, federal {{prosecutors}} announced that Gravano became a cooperating government witness.

As part of Gravano's cooperation agreement, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> forced to testify against his former crew. On September 26, 1994, a federal judge sentenced Gravano to five years in prison. However, since Gravano had already served four years, the sentence amounted to less than one year.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Loyalists, British {{journalist}} Peter Taylor devotes pages 187–195 to the loyalists' South African arms deals which {{had taken place}} in the late 1980s. Jackson's name does not appear in the account nor is Australia referred to. Joe Gorrod is the only journalist to make these allegations although Henry McDonald (of The Guardian) affirmed that Jackson lived {{for a period of time}} in South Africa during the 1980s. The purported files, which were kept with a friend, would have ensured Jackson that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> sentenced to a lengthy imprisonment.|$|E

60|$|When the {{corporations}} heard this, {{many of the}} men in control were furious, and they threatened the governor in all sorts of ways. They would defeat him if he ever again came up for election, and defeat him so badly that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again <b>be</b> heard of.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> again <b>be</b> on a pennant winner.

25|$|Goebbels {{refused to}} meet Furtwängler to clarify his {{situation}} for several months. During the same period, {{many members of the}} orchestra and of his public were begging him not to emigrate and desert them. In addition, Goebbels sent him a clear signal that if he left Germany <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> allowed back, frightening him with the prospect of permanent separation from his mother (to whom he was very close) and his children. Furtwängler considered himself responsible for the Berlin Philharmonic and for his family, and decided to stay.|$|E
25|$|Among {{those with}} the {{foresight}} to recognize the possibilities of Burbank’s work was Clarence McDowell Stark, who went to California and sought Burbank out. After talking to him in Santa Rosa and seeing {{the results of his}} experiments, Clarence was convinced that Burbank was right and his professorial critics were wrong. To Clarence’s great dismay, he saw that Luther Burbank was operating a small seed and nursery business in an attempt to finance his experiments and provide himself a living. It was clear that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>be</b> able to realize his potential under these meager circumstances.|$|E

Lawyer Brian McMonagle co-hosted a political fundraiser for former District Attorney Bruce Castor early last year but said it took place months before he joined Cosby's defense team in September. Constand's lawyer now wants McMonagle to detail any ties between his office and Castor, including phone records and documents. She wants Cosby to do the same. At a pretrial hearing on April 15, 2016, a judge ruled that Constand is entitled to any documents shared between Castor and Cosby's attorneys.|$|E

[...] Vigar began his cricketing career as a young amateur, playing for the Essex's Young Amateur team against a similar development squad for Surrey in early September 1935.
