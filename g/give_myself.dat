25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.' He didn't care about his life and was doing drugs and was really disconnected from the world {{and a whole lot of}} other personal stuff that I won't get into. If I <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> to that, I can feel the psychological effects of that personality in the same way that an actor can say it wasn't healthy to live in that role so long or bring that role home every night.|$|E
25|$|Today, I, a faithless sinner, renew in {{your hands}} my Baptismal vows; I renounce Satan forever, his pomps and works; and I <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> entirely to Jesus Christ, the Incarnate Wisdom, and will carry my cross after Him all the days of my life, and will be more {{faithful}} to Him than I have ever been. With the entire heavenly court as my witness, I choose you this day for my Mother. I deliver and consecrate myself to you, my body and soul, myself, both interior and exterior, and the worth of my good actions, past, present and future; leaving to you the total right of disposing of me, and all that belongs to me, according to your wish, for the greater glory of God in time and in eternity.|$|E
60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I {{have worked}} too hard; I have <b>given</b> <b>myself</b> {{one day of}} rest, {{and that was not}} enough; so I am <b>giving</b> <b>myself</b> another. I shall go to bed again {{likewise}} so soon as this is done, and slumber most potently.|$|R

500|$|While {{recognized}} {{along with}} Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, and Skinny Puppy as pioneers in introducing industrial music to mainstream audiences, KMFDM describes its sound as [...] "The Ultra-Heavy Beat". Konietzko once stated, [...] "If I was to <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> a label {{it would be}} industrial-alternative-electronic-crossover-rock and danceabilly." ...|$|E
500|$|Finding it {{difficult}} {{to keep up with}} both her schoolwork and her passion, she dropped out of Los Angeles High School in 1921 to pursue a full-time acting career. Reflecting on her decision, Wong told Motion Picture Magazine in 1931: [...] "I was so young when I began that I knew I still had youth if I failed, so I determined to <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> 10years to succeed as an actress." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1808, Champollion {{received}} a scare when French Archeologist Alexandre Lenoir published {{the first of}} his four volumes on Nouvelles Explications des Hieroglyphes. making the young scholar fear that his budding work had already been surpassed. But he was relieved to find that Lenoir still operated under the assumption that the hieroglyphs were mystic symbols and not a literary system expressing language. This experience made him even more determined {{to be the first to}} decipher the language and he began dedicating himself even more to the study of Coptic, writing in 1809 to his brother: [...] "I <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> up entirely to Coptic... I wish to know Egyptian like my French, because on that language will be based my great work on the Egyptian papyri." [...] That same year, he was appointed to his first academic post, in history and politics at the University of Grenoble.|$|E

500|$|The {{story as}} it had {{appeared}} in the London Daily Advertiser had already aroused the public's interest. [...] Fielding had left London believing that he had [...] "ended all the trouble which I thought it necessary for me to <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> in this affair", but on his return he learnt that during his brief absence, amongst others, several [...] "Noble Lords" [...] had attempted to contact him. [...] On 15February a reward was offered for the capture and conviction of John Squires and his unnamed associate. [...] Also listed were the locations at which donations could be left, [...] "either applied to the carrying on of the Prosecution, or given to the poor Girl as a Recompence [...] for her Virtue, and Miseries she has gone through". [...] A rather embellished account of the story was later sent to the press. [...] George Squires could not be found.|$|E
500|$|Jepsen's second studio {{album was}} {{initially}} {{planned to be}} released on February 14, 2012; however, she chose not to release it {{because she wanted to}} make sure she [...] "got the second CD right. I think I got a little nervous about the idea of the sophomore being a little less-than because it's so rushed. So I wanted to <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> the time to not feel that pressure." [...] She then worked with songwriter Josh Ramsay and producer Ryan Stewart on most of the album's tracks. Jepsen's songwriting process was inspired by her life and friends. After the recording sessions were completed, Curiosity was announced as a full-length album, with a digital release date confirmed for February 14, 2012. A few days before its official release, however, the label decided to change the format of the album, turning it into an extended play. The songs cut from the album [...] "Lost and Found", [...] "Alice In Wonderland", [...] "Dear Julian", [...] "Europe" [...] and [...] "Angels" [...] came to have their preview on iTunes Canada, before having changed album to EP.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{inspired}} {{at least two}} satirical Internet urban legends. In 2001, The Onion, an American satirical newspaper, published an article entitled [...] "Harry Potter Sparks Rise in Satanism Among Children," [...] which said that the [...] "High Priest of Satanism" [...] had described Harry Potter as [...] "an absolute godsend to our cause." [...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as she sat {{in a coffee shop}} one grey day, wondering what to do with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll <b>give</b> <b>myself,</b> body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'" [...] This article was also copied into a chain letter and released as [...] "truth" [...] onto the web.|$|E

500|$|Hornish again {{returned}} to Penske in 2006. The team changed manufacturers, joining Honda when Toyota and Chevrolet left the series after the 2005 season. His season highlight was the Indianapolis 500, {{when he passed}} Marco Andretti for the lead on the final lap {{to win in the}} second-closest margin of victory in the race's history. Hornish later said about the pass, [...] "I figured I came all this way, I ought to <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> one more shot at it. I kind of looked at it as, I was going to drive over him if I had to. For Marco to come as a rookie and drive like that he should be proud no matter what." [...] His second win of the season was at Richmond (after leading for all but 38 laps), and he took the points lead after winning the next race at Kansas. His fourth and final win of the season was at Kentucky, when he started second and led for 57 laps. In the season-ending race at Chicagoland Hornish qualified for the pole position and finished third, clinching his third series championship and Penske's first. Although he and Dan Wheldon finished the year with the same number of points, the tie was broken by wins; Hornish had four, and Wheldon two.|$|E
500|$|Lucan's {{daily routine}} {{consisted}} of breakfast at 9:00am, coffee, {{dealing with the}} morning's letters, reading the newspapers, and playing the piano. He sometimes jogged in the park and, while he owned him, took his Doberman Pinscher for walks. Lunch at the Clermont Club was followed by afternoon games of backgammon. Returning home to change into evening dress, the earl typically spent {{the remainder of the}} day at the Clermont, gambling into the early hours, watched sometimes by Veronica. In 1956, while still working at Brandt's, he had written of his desire to have [...] "£2m in the bank", claiming that [...] "motor-cars, yachts, expensive holidays and security for the future would <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> {{and a lot of other}} people a lot of pleasure". He was described by his friends as a shy and taciturn man, but with his tall stature, [...] "luxuriant guardsman's moustache" [...] and masculine pursuits, his exploits made him popular. His profligacy extended to hiring private aircraft to take his friends to the races, asking a car dealer he knew to source an Aston Martin drophead coupé, drinking expensive Russian vodka and racing powerboats. In September 1966 he unsuccessfully screen tested for a part in Woman Times Seven, prompting him to automatically decline a later offer from film producer Cubby Broccoli, to screen test him for the role of James Bond.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1950s, Flanders {{consolidated}} {{his career}} as a broadcaster, on radio, and later on television, in programmes ranging from sports commentary to poetry readings, and including a two-year stint as chairman of The Brains Trust after it moved from radio to television. He preferred performing to writing, and said that he wrote mainly [...] "to <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> something to perform." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Russian Society in Paris he wrote: [...] "I think I {{know the}} Russian man {{down to the}} very bottom of his nature but I <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> no credit for that. It's just that I've never tried to {{investigate}} the 'people's ways' by having conversations with Petersburg's cabmen. I just grew up among common people." [...] Up until 1860 Leskov resided with members of his family (and that of Alexander Scott) in Raisky, Penza Governorate. In the summer of 1860, when Scott & Wilkins closed, he returned to Kiev to work there as a journalist for a while, then in {{the end of the year}} moved to Saint Petersburg.|$|E
2500|$|Haley Elizabeth Reinhart {{was born}} in Wheeling, Illinois, on September 9, 1990, to Patti Miller-Reinhart and Harry Reinhart, {{both of whom are}} musicians and native Chicagoans from the north side and south side, respectively. She has one sister, Angela, who is five years younger than her. Angela is a singer-songwriter and musician, as well, and she {{primarily}} performs indie folk music. Reinhart is of German, Irish, and Italian descent. Around the age of three, her parents would hold her up on stage and have her sing the chorus or vocal harmonies for [...] "Brown Eyed Girl." [...] She began singing seriously when she was 7 or 8 years old, performing with her parents’ band, Midnight, which covers rock songs from the 1960s and 1970s. Reinhart's mother was also the lead singer for a band called The Company She Keeps before she joined Midnight in 1977. When she was nine years old, Reinhart sang LeAnn Rimes' 1996 arrangement of Bill Mack's 1958 classic, [...] "Blue", on a big stage at a tattoo convention, and she was met with [...] "overwhelming" [...] support from the audience. She has been writing poetry since she was eight years old and has competed in many poetry slam competitions throughout her life. She also has a passion for improv and has been active in plays, musicals, and skit performances since childhood. Reinhart began writing songs in Middle School, and she explains that [...] "when I <b>give</b> <b>myself</b> the time to sit down, and reflect, and feel, and let things come out, I find that it’s very easy for me to do." [...] She had several hundred compositions saved on her cell phone before it broke, losing all of the material. Reinhart had planned on auditioning for American Idol ever since middle school, where she received an award {{at the end of the}} year for student [...] "Most Likely to Be on American Idol".|$|E
