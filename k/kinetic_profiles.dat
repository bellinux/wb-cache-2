40|$|AbstractA new {{and simple}} {{strategy}} {{is applied to}} resolve kinetic profile for the reaction of an analyte in unknown matrices, using standard addition method (SAM). The proposed method uses kinetic spectrophotometric data obtained by standard addition of analyte into unknown mixtures followed by the reaction of analyte with a proper reagent. The proposed method extracts kinetic profile for the reaction of an analyte by averaging the <b>kinetic</b> <b>profiles</b> obtained by subtraction of <b>kinetic</b> <b>profiles</b> after and before standard addition. The rate constant can be obtained using computational curve fitting. The performance of method was evaluated by using synthetic data {{as well as several}} experimental data sets. The proposed method can be applied to obtain <b>kinetic</b> <b>profiles</b> of the reactions in the presence of additive interference as well as multiplicative interferences. Hydroxylation reaction of diphenylcarbazide (DPCI) in the presence of diphenylcarbazone (DPCO) as a real system at various pHs was also studied by the present method.

The utility of this approach was tested by screening a library containing FDA approved drugs, experimental compounds, and nature compounds. Compounds with similar activity produced similar impedance-based time-dependent cell response profiles (TCRPs). The compounds were clustered based on TCRP similarity. We identified novel mechanisms for existing drugs, confirmed previously reported calcium modulating activity for COX- 2 inhibitor celecoxib, and identified an additional mechanism for the experimental compound monastrol.

40|$|The stress {{response}} in yeast cells is regulated {{by at least}} two classes of transcription activators—HSF and Msn 2 / 4, which differentially affect promoter chromatin remodeling. We demonstrate that the deletion of SNF 2, an ATPase activity-containing subunit of the chromatin remodeling SWI/SNF complex, eliminates histone displacement, RNA polymerase II recruitment, and heat shock factor (HSF) binding at the HSP 12 promoter while delaying these processes at the HSP 82 and SSA 4 promoters. Out of the three promoters, the double deletion of MSN 2 and MSN 4 eliminates both chromatin remodeling and HSF binding only at the HSP 12 promoter, suggesting that Msn 2 / 4 activators are primary determinants of chromatin disassembly at the HSP 12 promoter. Unexpectedly, during heat shock the level of Msn 2 / 4 at the HSP 12 promoter declines. This is likely a result of promoter-targeted Msn 2 / 4 degradation associated with transcription complex assembly.

Dynamic PET recordings were obtained for 18 F-FP-CMT in six untreated rats, and six rats pretreated with the high-affinity DAT ligand GBR 12909; mean parametric maps of binding potential (BPND) relative to the cerebellum reference region, and maps of total distribution volume (VT) relative to the metabolite-corrected arterial input were produced. 18 F-FP-CMT BPND maps showed peak values of ˜ 4 in the striatum, versus ˜ 0. 4 {{in the vicinity of}} the substantia nigra. Successive truncation of the PET recordings indicated that stable BPND estimates could be obtained with recordings lasting only 45 minutes, reflecting rapid kinetics of 18 F-FP-CMT.

The aim {{of this study was to}} classify single-trial movement intentions associated with two levels of force and speed and three different grasp types using EEG rhythms and components of the movement-related cortical potential (MRCP) as features. The feature importance was used to estimate encoding of discriminative information. Two data sets were used. 29 healthy subjects executed and imagined different hand movements, while EEG was recorded over the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. The following features were extracted: delta, theta, mu/alpha, beta, and gamma rhythms, readiness potential, negative slope, and motor potential of the MRCP. Sequential forward selection was performed, and classification was performed using linear discriminant analysis and support vector machines.
