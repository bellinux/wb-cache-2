2500|$|Another {{case in the}} {{literature}} is Eugene Pauly, known as E.P., a severely amnesic patient (owing to viral encephalitis) {{who was able to}} learn three-word sentences. He performed better on consecutive tests over a 12-week period (24 study sessions). However, when asked <b>how</b> <b>confident</b> he was about the answers, his confidence did not appear to increase. Bayley and Squire proposed his learning was similar to the process required by procedural memory tasks; E.P. could not get the answers right when one word in the three-word sentence was changed or the order of words was changed, and his ability to answer correctly, thus, became more of a [...] "habit." [...] Bayley and Squire claim the learning may have happened in the neocortex, and it happened without the conscious knowledge of E.P. They hypothesized the information may be acquired directly by the neocortex (to which the hippocampus projects) when there is repetition. This case illustrates the difficulty in separating procedural from declarative tasks; this adds another dimension to the complexity of anterograde amnesia.|$|E

As the English had lost by sickness since they left Harfleur fully a thousand men out of the 9,000, and as against these were arrayed at least a hundred thousand--some French historians estimate them at 150,000--comprising most of the chivalry of France, the latter might well regard victory as certain. There were, however, some who were not so confident; among these was the old Duke of Berri, who had fought at Poitiers sixty years before, and remembered <b>how</b> <b>confident</b> the French were on that occasion, and how disastrous was the defeat.

40|$|Confidence Measure (CM) in Speech Recognition System (SRS) {{provides}} {{the information about}} <b>how</b> much <b>confident</b> the recognizer in recognizing the word. Accurate recognition of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) {{is one of the}} most difficult problems in speech recognition today. When speech is produced in a carefully planned manner, ASR systems are successful at accurate recognition and transcription. In this work, Fuzzy Reasoning Scheme is proposed to perform the information compilation step that includes recognition related features that combines through a compilation mechanism, into a more effective way to distinguish between correct and incorrect recognition results. A novel method is described to combine different knowledge sources and estimate the confidence in a word hypothesis via Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) and measure the joint performance of recognition and confidence systems. Here the HCM (Hybrid Confidence Measure) which is a combination of Acoustic CM and Phone Duration based CM and Likelihood Score Ratio (LSR) are incorporated with Fuzzy if-then rules to add up recognition information into CM. Definitions and Algorithms are illustrated with results on the HUB 4 _trigram corpus.

We tested the relative weight that children in general, and high versus low socially anxious children in particular, put on fathers’ versus mothers’ signal {{about whether a}} social situation is safe or a threat. Method:  Children aged 8 - 12 (n = 144) varying in social anxiety were presented scripts of ambiguous social situations in which either the father or the mother acted anxious or <b>confident.</b> Children indicated <b>how</b> anxious or <b>confident</b> they would be. Results:  Fathers’ behaviour influenced high socially anxious children’s confidence or anxiety more than mothers’ behaviour. In contrast, in normal and low socially anxious children, mothers’ behaviour was more influential than fathers’. Conclusions:  Mothers might have the role of teaching social wariness to their low socially anxious children, whereas fathers may teach social confidence to socially anxious children...|$|R
6000|$|... 5. That it was {{a strong}} nation attacking a weak one.--That appeal to {{sentiment}} and to the sporting instincts {{of the human race}} must always be a powerful one. But in this instance it is entirely misapplied. The preparation for war, the ultimatum, the invasion, and the first shedding of blood, all came from the nation which the result has shown to be the weaker. The reason why this smaller nation attacked so audaciously was that they knew perfectly well that they were at the time far the stronger power in South Africa, and all their information led them to believe that they would continue to be so even when Britain had put forth all her strength. It certainly seemed that they were justified in this belief. The chief military critics of the Continent had declared that 100,000 men was the outside figure which Britain could place in the field. Against these they knew that without any rising of their kinsmen in the Cape they could place fifty or sixty thousand men, and their military history had unfortunately led them to believe that such a force of Boers, operating under their own conditions with their own horses in their own country, was far superior to this number of British soldiers. They knew how excellent was their artillery, and how complete their preparations. A dozen extracts could be given to show <b>how</b> <b>confident</b> they were of success, from Blignant's letter with his fears that Chamberlain would do them out of the war, to Esselen's boast that he would not wash until he reached the sea. What they did not foresee, and what put out their plans, was that indignant wave of public opinion throughout the British Empire which increased threefold--as it would, if necessary, have increased tenfold--the strength of the army and so enabled it to beat down the Boer resistance. When war was declared, and {{for a very long time}} afterwards, it was the Boers who were the strong power and the British who were the weak one, and any sympathy given on the other understanding was sympathy misapplied. From that time onwards the war had to take its course, and the British had no choice but to push it to its end.|$|E
