40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we propose}} a novel shape <b>descriptor</b> using {{the concept of}} {{projection}} and statistical moment to generate a new effcient <b>descriptor</b> (called K <b>descriptor).</b> The K <b>descriptor</b> {{can be used as}} a robust and invariant <b>descriptor</b> of global shape of an image. The K <b>descriptor</b> can also extract an intrinsic ”rectangularity” property from non smooth rectangular image. With the help of K <b>descriptor,</b> the rectangle-like and circle-like image are classiﬁed according to the three features: (1) the minimum, (2) the maximum and (3) the standard deviation of K-descriptor proﬁle. SVM was used as the classiﬁer. In the experiment on 1, 000 binary image (500 testing, 500 training), our proposed method achieved 100 % classiﬁcation accuracy. These ﬁndings suggest that K <b>descriptor</b> is a very effcient shape <b>descriptor</b> for rectangle-like classiﬁcation...|$|R

40|$|A novel motion {{activity}} <b>descriptor</b> and its extraction from a compressed MPEG (MPEG- 1 / 2) {{video stream}} are presented. The <b>descriptor</b> {{consists of two}} parts, a temporal <b>descriptor</b> and a spatial <b>descriptor.</b> To get the temporal <b>descriptor,</b> the "motion intensity" is first computed based on P frame macroblock information. Then the motion intensity histogram is generated for a given video unit as the temporal <b>descriptor.</b> To get the spatial <b>descriptor,</b> the average magnitude of the motion vector in a P frame is used to threshold the macro-blocks into "zero" and "non-zero" types. The average magnitude of the motion vectors and three types of runs of zeros in the frame are then taken as the spatial <b>descriptor.</b> Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed <b>descriptor</b> is fast, and that the combination of the temporal and spatial attributes is effective. Key elements of the intensity parameter, spatial parameters and the temporal histogram of the <b>descriptor</b> have been adopted by the draft MPEG- 7 standard [10]...|$|R
