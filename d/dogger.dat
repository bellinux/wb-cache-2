5|$|The German Navy {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast {{in an attempt to}} draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards.

The Germans did not know that the British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey; they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well.

25|$|The damage George Holloway {{was doing}} to the Head and the {{coastline}} became apparent and local opposition grew. There was also some dispute {{as to whether he}} had violated the terms of his lease. Even so, {{by the time he was}} stopped in 1867, a third of the Head had been removed or lost through increased erosion and his mine had almost cut through to the sea beyond. Removal of the ironstone <b>doggers</b> on the sea side of the Head caused the Spit at the Harbour entrance to grow in length, extending to Steamer point by 1890. A long groyne had to be constructed to take the place of the missing <b>doggers</b> and check the erosion. In 1930, after Christchurch Council had refused to meet the asking price, Hengistbury Head (then in private ownership) was sold to Bournemouth for £25,000.|$|R

5|$|The ship {{participated in}} most of the major fleet actions {{conducted}} by the German Navy during the First World War, including the Battles of <b>Dogger</b> Bank and Jutland in the North Sea, and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga and Operation Albion in the Baltic.

5|$|A {{few days}} later, the Kriegsmarine planned Operation Wikinger in {{cooperation}} with the Luftwaffe in the erroneous belief that the British fishing trawlers off the <b>Dogger</b> Bank were cooperating with submarines.

500|$|From 1848 to 1872, the Hengistbury Mining Company – {{formed by}} a Christchurch-based merchant, John E. Holloway – {{extracted}} many more ironstone boulders through quarrying. Holloway brought coal from Southampton, {{and took the}} ironstone as ballast for the return journey. These boulders, known as Iron <b>Doggers,</b> were prized for their high quantity of iron ore (up to 30%). They form the base of Hengistbury Head, {{and the removal of}} a substantial amount of <b>doggers</b> over the years has weakened the headland. These and earlier excavations resulted in a loss of up to a third of the head, caused mainly by erosion after the quarry's closure. The silt washed down also threatened the ecology of the saltmarsh below. This has been reduced by the building of a dam, in 1976, to create a pool. Many [...] "doggers" [...] can still be seen lining the route of the land-train and at the quarry.|$|R

At the end of the war, Moltke was interned with the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow while the ships' fate was being discussed during peace treaty negotiations. The ships were scuttled on 21June 1919 to prevent their seizure by the Allies.|$|E

On 22 January 1915, IIISquadron was detached from the fleet to conduct maneuver, gunnery, and torpedo training in the Baltic.

2500|$|... and indeed, in 1535, Henry VIII {{had ordered}} the removal of all fish weirs as they impeded navigation. The most {{difficult}} part of the journey was gaining entrance to the harbour with its constantly shifting sandbars. In 1665 Edward Hyde, Earl of Clarendon, bought the Lordship of the Manor of Christchurch. As part of his plans to improve trade in the town, he decide to resolve the problems with the entrance to the harbour by cutting a new one through the sandspit at the foot of Hengistbury Head. He commissioned a report which outlined the advantages of doing so, which also suggested that 5th and 6th rate ships could be built there with wood from the New Forest and armed with guns cast from the ironstone <b>doggers</b> which lay in great piles nearby. The building of a fort on the headland, the report concluded, would make the anchorage 'almost impregnable'. In addition an act was proposed to dredge the Avon to make it navigable for larger vessels but this came to nothing. Despite this, Hyde started work on the new entrance, laying down a line of ironstone <b>doggers.</b> These <b>doggers,</b> now known as Clarendon's Rocks, can still be seen at low tide. The new entrance however was continually silting up and in 1703 a large storm hit, damaging the groyne and filling up the new entrance. This appears to have been the last straw and the attempt was abandoned. Over the following 150 years many alternative schemes were put forward but none of them were taken up.|$|R
5000|$|At the Fire and Ice competition, Kayla arrives {{wearing a}} Swift Team jacket, making the Hot <b>Doggers</b> (Kayla's team) think {{she gave up}} on them.

When Fire and Ice begins, Will starts out very well, with Nick close behind. In Run 2, Nick starts to show power and wins the Men's title, making Kayla the only chance the Hot <b>Doggers</b> have left against the Swift team. Kayla does very bad in Run 1, and so does Skye, but Kayla is behind. Skye pulled off a routine in Run 2 and Kayla can only beat her with at least an almost perfect score. Right before her round in Run 2, Richard apologizes to Kayla for not believing in her and hopes that she will win. Sebastian sees this and considers it a distraction from winning. Nick protests that a parent supporting their kid is not a bad thing. Nick then tells Kayla that he followed his father's orders to crash the sled in order to give his father an excuse to kick Kayla off the team as Sebastian before did not believe in her. Nick tells his father that this was his dream, not Nick's. Kayla and Will are both unsure if she will be able to perform the Cloud 9, but after what Nick told her, she is now furious at Sebastian and more determined than ever to beat the Swifts and decides she will do it. With an awesome performance, she successfully lands the Cloud 9, scoring a perfect 10 points from all the judges, winning her first [...] "real" [...] trophy, and making the Hot <b>Doggers</b> overall winners of Fire and Ice. Pia, Linds, Richard, Madeline, Nick, and even Skye applaud her, as well as Sebastian, who now regrets his decision to dump her from his team.|$|R
