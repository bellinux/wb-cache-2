40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the memory of Professor Alex Rubinov Abstract. The diffusion tensor <b>imaging</b> (DTI) <b>model</b> is an important magnetic resonance <b>imaging</b> (MRI) <b>model</b> in biomedical engineering. It assumes that the water molecule dis-placement distribution is a Gaussian function. However, water movement in biological tissue is often non-Gaussian and this non-Gaussian behavior may contain useful biological and clinical information. In order to overcome this drawback, a new MRI model, the generalized diffusion tensor <b>imaging</b> (GDTI) <b>model,</b> was presented in [8]. In the GDTI model, even order tensors reflect the magnitude of the signal, while odd order tensors reflect the phase of the signal. In this paper, we propose to use the apparent skewness coefficient (ASC) value to measure the phase of non-Gaussian signals. We prove that the ASC values are invariant under rotations of co-ordinate systems. We discuss some further properties of the diffusion kurtosis tensor and present some preliminary numerical experiments for calculating the ASC values...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Optoacoustic {{tomography}} (OAT) {{is inherently}} a three-dimensional (3 D) inverse problem. However, most studies of OAT image reconstruction still employ two-dimensional (2 D) <b>imaging</b> <b>models.</b> One important {{reason is because}} 3 D image reconstruction is computationally burdensome. The aim of this work is to accelerate existing image reconstruction algorithms for 3 D OAT by use of parallel programming techniques. Methods: Parallelization strategies are proposed to accelerate a filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm and two different pairs of projection/backprojection operations that correspond to two different numerical <b>imaging</b> <b>models.</b> The algorithms are designed to fully exploit the parallel computing power of graphic processing units (GPUs). In order to evaluate the parallelization strategies for the projection/backprojection pairs, an iterative image reconstruction algorithm is implemented. Computer-simulation and experimental studies are conducted to investigate the computational efficiency and numerical accuracy of the developed algorithms. Results: The GPU implementations improve the computational efficiency by factors of 1, 000, 125, and 250 for the FBP algorithm and the two pairs of projection/backprojection operators, respectively. Accurate images are reconstructed by use of the FBP and iterative image reconstruction algorithms from both computer-simulated and experimental data. Conclusions: Parallelization strategies for 3 D OAT image reconstruction are proposed for the first time. These GPU-based implementations significantly reduce the computational time for 3 D image reconstruction, complementing our earlier work on 3 D OAT iterative image reconstruction...|$|R

The coordinate system itself {{did not have a}} [...] "natural resolution" [...] either, whereas QD scaled everything based on 72 dpi.

We further established highly tumorigenic A 925 LPE 3 cells, which also have the EML 4 -ALK gene fusion (variant 5 a) and are sensitive to ALK inhibitors.

50|$|Designers {{decided that}} it would be {{impractical}} and uneconomical to use Osprey submersible to search the entire test range on its own during its deployment, so a system of different search patterns was established to locate the test sample {{on the bottom of the}} test range.

The color <b>imaging</b> <b>Model</b> 971 sonar would search the area and identify the potential target.

50|$|In 1998, in {{response}} to developer comments about the new operating system, the big announcement at WWDC'98 was the introduction of Carbon, effectively {{a version of the}} classic Mac OS API implemented on OpenStep. Under the original Rhapsody plans, classic applications would run in sandboxed installation of the classic Mac OS, (called the Blue Box) and have no access to the new Mac OS X features. To receive new features, such as protected memory and preemptive multitasking, developers had to rewrite applications using the Yellow Box API. Developer complaints about the major porting effort to what was then a shrinking market and warnings that they might simply abandon the platform, led Apple to reconsider the original plan. Carbon addressed the problem by dramatically reducing the effort needed, while exposing some of the new functions of the underlying OS. Another major introduction at WWDC'98 was the Quartz <b>imaging</b> <b>model,</b> which replaced Display PostScript with something akin to display PDF. Although the reasons for this switch remain unclear, Quartz also included better support for the extant QuickDraw model from the classic OS, and (as later learned) Java2D. Supporting QuickDraw directly in the graphics model also led to a related announcement, that the Blue Box would now be invisible, integrated into the extant desktop, instead of a separate window.|$|E
