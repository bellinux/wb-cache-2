40|$|Colorectal polyps are {{important}} precursors to colon cancer, a major health problem. Colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) {{is a safe}} and minimally invasive examination procedure, in which {{the images of the}} intestine are obtained via digital cameras on board of a small capsule ingested by a patient. The video sequence is then analyzed for the presence of polyps. We propose an algorithm that relieves the labor of a human operator analyzing the frames in the video sequence. The algorithm acts as a binary classifier, which labels the frame as either containing polyps or not, based on the geometrical analysis and the texture content of the frame. The geometrical analysis is based on a segmentation of an image {{with the help of a}} mid-pass filter. The features extracted by the segmentation procedure are classified according to an assumption that the polyps are characterized as protrusions that are mostly round in shape. Thus, we use a best fit ball radius as a decision parameter of a binary classifier. We present a statistical study of the performance of our approach on a data set containing over 18, 900 frames from the endoscopic video sequences of five adult patients.

40|$|The {{goal with}} {{this project was}} to improve an {{existing}} face recognition system for video streams by using adaptive object tracking to track faces between frames. The knowledge of what faces occur and do not occur in subsequent frames was used to filter false faces and to better identify real ones. The recognition ability was tested by measuring how many faces were found {{and how many of}} them were correctly identified in two short video files. The tests also looked at the number of false face detections. The results were compared to a reference implementation that did not use object tracking. Two identification modes were tested: the default and strict modes. In the default mode, whichever person is most similar to a given image patch is accepted as the answer. In strict mode, the similarity also has to be above a certain threshold. The first video file had a fairly high image quality. It had only frontal faces, one at a time. The second video file had a slightly lower image quality. It had up to two faces at a time, in a larger variety of angles. The second video was therefore a more difficult case. The results show that the number of detected faces increased by 6 - 21 % in the two video files, for both identification modes, compared to the reference implementation. In the meantime, the number of false detections remained low. In the first video file, there were fewer than 0. 009 <b>false</b> detections per <b>frame.</b> In the second video file, there were fewer than 0. 08 <b>false</b> detections per <b>frame.</b> The number of faces that were correctly identified increased by 8 - 22 % in the two video files in default mode. In the first video file, there was also a large improvement in strict mode, as it went from recognising 13 % to 85 % of all faces. In the second video file, however,neither implementation managed to identify anyone in strict mode. The conclusion is that object tracking is a good tool for improving the accuracy of face recognition in video streams. Anyone implementing face recognition for video streams should consider using object tracking as a central component...|$|R

Despite the ongoing efforts in this area there is still only a small number of static multiband test images available for the development and evaluation of new image fusion and enhancement methods. Moreover, dynamic multiband imagery is also currently lacking. To fill this gap we present the TRICLOBS dynamic multi-band image data set containing sixteen registered visual (0. 4 - 0. 7 Î¼m), near-infrared (NIR, 0. 7 - 1. 0 Î¼m) and long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8 - 14 Î¼m) motion sequences. They represent different military and civilian surveillance scenarios registered in three different scenes. Scenes include (military and civilian) people that are stationary, walking or running, or carrying various objects. Vehicles, foliage, and buildings or other man-made structures are also included in the scenes. This data set is primarily intended for the development and evaluation of image fusion, enhancement and color mapping algorithms for short-range surveillance applications. The imagery was collected during several field trials with our newly developed TRICLOBS (TRI-band Color Low-light OBServation) all-day all-weather surveillance system. This system registers a scene in the Visual, NIR and LWIR part of the electromagnetic spectrum using three optically aligned sensors (two digital image intensifiers and an uncooled long-wave infrared microbolometer). The three sensor signals are mapped to three individual RGB color channels, digitized, and stored as uncompressed RGB (<b>false)</b> color <b>frames.</b> The TRICLOBS data set enables the development and evaluation of (both static and dynamic) image fusion, enhancement and color mapping algorithms.

The Gaussian mixture model [2] is used to estimate the probability density function of the data points; its parameters are then optimized using the EM algorithm, whose performance is in turn enhanced by its joint use with the K-Means algorithm.

Because of the limitation of the standard deviation and the consideration of temporal and spatial dependencies in the detection unit, the Auto GMM-SAMT system obtains good binary masks. Even uncovered background regions are relatively fast classified as background due to the spatiotemporal adaptive detection method. Despite this fast adaptation to uncovered background areas, for a few <b>frames</b> <b>false</b> positives caused by uncovered background regions might be contained in the masks.

Otherwise Auto GMM-SAMT will deliver the first correct object contours after the uncovered background is correctly identified as such by the detection unit. Nevertheless, Auto GMM-SAMT can keep up with the stand alone implementation of GMM-SAMT. In some cases Auto GMM-SAMT performs even better than GMM-SAMT due to the final shape refinement when comparing the tracking results with the background subtraction results.

Image sensors for cooperative DSSS {{are required to}} have extremely high performance under any condition changes or environmental noise.

30|$|Convolutional {{neural network}} (CNN) is a {{multilayer}} neural network, {{and it is}} also the most classical and common deep learning framework. A new reconstruction algorithm based on convolutional neural networks is proposed by Newman et al. [1] and its advantages in speed and performance are demonstrated. Wang et al. [2] discussed three methods, that is, the CNN model with pretraining or fine-tuning and the hybrid method. The first two executive images are passed to the network one time, while the last category uses a patch-based feature extraction scheme. The survey provides a milestone in modern case retrieval, reviews a wide selection of different categories of previous work, and provides insights into the link between SIFT and the CNN based approach. After analyzing and comparing the retrieval performance of different categories on several data sets, we discuss a new direction of general and special case retrieval. Convolution neural network (CNN) is very interested in machine learning and has excellent performance in hyperspectral image classification. Al-Saffar et al. [3] proposed a classification framework called region-based pluralistic CNN, which can encode semantic context-aware representations to obtain promising features. By combining a set of different discriminant appearance factors, the representation based on CNN presents the spatial spectral contextual sensitivity that is essential for accurate pixel classification. The proposed method for learning contextual interaction features using various region-based inputs is expected to have more discriminant power. Then, the combined representation containing rich spectrum and spatial information is fed to the fully connected network and the label of each pixel vector is predicted by the Softmax layer. The experimental results of the widely used hyperspectral image datasets show that the proposed method can outperform any other traditional deep-learning-based classifiers and other advanced classifiers. Context-based convolution neural network (CNN) with deep structure and pixel-based multilayer perceptron (MLP) with shallow structure are recognized neural network algorithms which represent the most advanced depth learning methods and classical non-neural network algorithms. The two algorithms with very different behaviors are integrated in a concise and efficient manner, and a rule-based decision fusion method is used to classify very fine spatial resolution (VFSR) remote sensing images. The decision fusion rules, which are mainly based on the CNN classification confidence design, reflect the usual complementary patterns of each classifier. Therefore, the ensemble classifier MLP-CNN proposed by Said et al. [4] acquires supplementary results obtained from CNN based on deep spatial feature representation and MLP based on spectral discrimination. At the same time, the CNN constraints resulting from the use of convolution filters, such as the uncertainty of object boundary segmentation and the loss of useful fine spatial resolution details, are compensated. The validity of the ensemble MLP-CNN classifier was tested in urban and rural areas using aerial photography and additional satellite sensor data sets. MLP-CNN classifier achieves promising performance and is always superior to pixel based MLP, spectral and texture based MLP, and context-based CNN in classification accuracy. The research paves the way for solving the complex problem of VFSR image classification effectively. Periodic inspection of nuclear power plant components is important to ensure safe operation. However, current practice is time-consuming, tedious, and subjective, involving human technicians examining videos and identifying reactor cracks. Some vision-based crack detection methods have been developed for metal surfaces, and they generally perform poorly when used to analyze nuclear inspection videos. Detecting these cracks is a challenging task because of their small size and the presence of noise patterns {{on the surface of the}} components. Huang et al. [5] proposed a depth learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and Naive Bayes data fusion scheme (called NB-CNN), which can be used to analyze a single video frame for crack detection. At the same time, a new data fusion scheme is proposed to aggregate the information extracted from each video frame to enhance the overall performance and robustness of the system. In this paper, a CNN is proposed to detect the fissures in each video frame, the proposed data fusion scheme maintains the temporal and spatial coherence of the cracks in the video, and the Naive Bayes decision effectively discards the false positives. The proposed framework achieves a hit rate of 98.3 % 0.1 <b>false</b> positives per <b>frame</b> which is significantly higher than the most advanced method proposed in this paper. The prediction of visual attention data from any type of media is valuable to content creators and is used to drive coding algorithms effectively. With the current trend in the field of virtual reality (VR), the adaptation of known technologies to this new media is beginning to gain momentum R. Gupta and Bhavsar [6] proposed an extension to the architecture of any convolutional neural network (CNN) to fine-tune traditional 2 D significant prediction to omnidirectional image (ODI). In an end-to-end manner, it is shown that each step in the pipeline presented by them is aimed at making the generated salient map more accurate than the ground live data. Convolutional neural network (Ann) is a kind of depth machine learning method derived from artificial neural network (Ann), which has achieved great success in the field of image recognition in recent years. The training algorithm of neural network is based on the error backpropagation algorithm (BP), which is based on the decrease of precision. However, with the increase of the number of neural network layers, the number of weight parameters will increase sharply, which leads to the slow convergence speed of the BP algorithm. The training time is too long. However, CNN training algorithm is a variant of BP algorithm. By means of local connection and weight sharing, the network structure is more similar to the biological neural network, which not only keeps the deep structure of the network, but also greatly reduces the network parameters, so that the model has good generalization energy and is easier to train. This advantage is more obvious when the network input is a multi-dimensional image, so that the image can be directly used as the network input, avoiding the complex feature extraction and data reconstruction process in traditional recognition algorithm. Therefore, convolutional neural networks can also be interpreted as a multilayer perceptron designed to recognize two-dimensional shapes, which are highly invariant to translation, scaling, tilting, or other forms of deformation [7 â€“ 15].|$|R
