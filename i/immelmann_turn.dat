5|$|Flight Unlimited is a 1995 {{aerobatic}} flight simulator video game developed {{and published by}} Looking Glass Technologies. It allows players to pilot reproductions of real-world aircraft and to perform aerobatic maneuvers. They may fly freely, race through floating rings against a timer or take lessons from a virtual flight instructor. The instructor teaches basic and advanced techniques, ranging from rudder turns to maneuvers such as the tailslide, Lomcevak and <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E
5|$|Claus and Lavie are {{initially}} {{treated as}} intruders but eventually befriend {{the crew of}} the Silvana. They learn that the Guild intends to capture Alvis for reasons unknown to them. In the first battle between the Silvana and Guild forces, Guild member Dio Eraclea takes an interest in Claus's flying skills and his signature move, the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn.</b> Wanting to learn more about Claus, Dio willingly allows himself to be captured. He reveals to the Silvana's captain, Alex Row, the existence of one of four Mysteria which act as a key to something known as Exile.|$|E
5|$|The player {{may choose}} to begin flight on a runway or taxiway, or in the air. Aircraft are {{controlled}} via keyboard, joystick, head-mounted display or specialized input devices such as pedals. During flight, several third- and first-person camera angles may be selected. For example, the third-person Flyby View places the camera {{in front of the}} plane as it flies past, while the first-person Three-Way View displays more information about the plane's position and speed than other angles. Certain camera angles, including the Three-Way View and 3-D Cockpit view, provide the player with simulated flight instruments such as an altimeter, airspeed indicator, accelerometer, variometer and tachometer. The game is designed to allow players to perform aerobatic maneuvers such as the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> tailslide, Lomcevak and Cuban Eight. Performances may be recorded and played back, with controls that allow the player to pause, rewind and fast forward. At any time, the player may stop a recording and resume flight from that point.|$|E
50|$|You {{could say}} the Cuban-8 {{maneuver}} is like a figure 8 on a vertical plane that consists of two <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turns.</b>|$|R
50|$|A152 Aerobat: Two-seat aerobatic-capable aircraft, 315 built. Certified for +6/-3 Gs and had {{standard}} four-point harnesses, skylights and jettisonable doors, {{along with}} a checkerboard paint scheme and removable seat cushions to allow parachutes to be worn by the crew. Type approved in 1977 and produced as 1978 to 1985 model years. The following aerobatic maneuvers are approved: chandelles, steep turns, barrel rolls, snap rolls, loops, vertical reversements, lazy eights, spins, aileron rolls, <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turns,</b> Cuban Eights and stalls (except whip stalls).|$|R
500|$|The {{focus on}} the combat drove several other areas of focus for the {{development}} team: according to Garden, Relic spent considerable effort on making high-quality ship models, computer-controlled flight tactics, and maneuvers like <b>immelmann</b> <b>turns</b> because [...] "everyone is going to zoom right in on the first battle, just to watch". They felt that the advanced unit-level maneuvers {{in the context of}} large fleet-wide battles would increase immersion in the game for players, and create a [...] "Star Wars feeling" [...] to the battles. The working title for the game was Spaghetti Ball, chosen for Garden's early vision of the battles in the game as a mass of tangled flight paths as ships maneuvered around each other, contained within a larger sphere of available space.|$|R
5|$|During the journey, Pattle {{developed}} a fever and high temperature. Nevertheless, on 19 April {{he took to}} the skies in several missions. By this date, Pattle's fever had metamorphosed into influenza and his condition had worsened. He did not want his squadron {{to know he was}} unwell. Pattle feared the effect it would have on morale and vowed to continue flying. The officer commanding No. 80 Squadron, Tap Jones, visited Pattle the day before and noticed he was very gaunt, drawn and that he had lost weight. Jones helped the weakened Pattle change into his flying gear. Jones was acting wing commander, but did not ban Pattle from operations. Pattle claimed six victories this day — three Ju 88s and three Bf 109s — plus one Henschel Hs 126 shared and two probables (a Ju 88 and a Bf 109). The battle with the Bf 109s took place over Eleusis and Tanagra airfields. He engaged III./Jagdgeschwader 77 (Fighter Wing 77 or JG 77) in a head-on position and executed an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> which took him behind and above the Messerschmitts and allowed him to claim three of them shot down. No. 33 Squadron claimed four Bf 109s (three were lost). Among the victims was the German ace, Kurt Ubben. Ubben landed in Allied territory and was picked up by a Fieseler Fi 156, escaping to his own lines.|$|E
25|$|It {{became evident}} that the new fighters could make long, steep dives and that the fixed, {{synchronised}} machine gun was aimed by aiming the aircraft. The machine gun was belt-fed, unlike the drum-fed Lewis guns of their opponents. The Fokker pilots took to flying high and diving on their quarry, usually out of the sun, firing a long burst and continuing the dive until well out of range. If the British aircraft had not been shot down, the German pilot could climb again and repeat the process. Immelmann invented the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> a zoom after the dive, followed by a roll when vertical, to face the opposite way, after which he could turn to attack again.|$|E
25|$|The Low Altitude Bombing System (LABS), or toss bombing, tactic {{was first}} made public {{in front of}} a crowd of 3,000 {{including}} 11 state governors on 7 May 1957 at Eglin AFB, when a B–47 Stratojet entered its bombing run at low altitude, pulled up sharply (3.5 g) into a half loop, releasing its bomb under computer control at a predetermined point in its climb, then executed a half roll, completing a maneuver similar to an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> or Half Cuban Eight. The bomb continued upward for some time in a high arc before falling on a target which was a considerable distance from its point of release. In the meantime, the maneuver had allowed the bomber to change direction and distance itself from the target. The development of this system at Eglin dated to at least mid-1955 under Project Back Breaker. The unintended consequence of this tactic would be a series of crashes by B-47s in early 1958 caused by stress-induced cracks which caused the bombers to shed their wings. A fleet-wide inspection and repair program known as Milk Bottle was begun in May 1958 which led to no fewer than nine Technical Orders, with most aircraft cycled through the program by October 1958.|$|E
50|$|The {{instruction}} {{given at}} the CPSs was an adaptation of the primary phase formerly taught at Randolph Field. Each student in primary was required to make at least 175 landings. As {{given at the}} height of the effort, primary flying training was divided into four standard phases. In the pre-solo phase students became familiar with the general operation of a light aircraft. In the second, or intermediate phase, pre-solo work was reviewed, and precision of control was developed. The third, or accuracy, phase demanded high proficiency in various types of landing approaches and landings, and the fourth, or acrobatic, phase required ability to perform loops, <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turns,</b> slow rolls, half-rolls, and snap rolls. In 1944, after the training demand had peaked, the course length was increased back to ten weeks.|$|R
2500|$|DeLay was a {{constant}} aviation promoter through staging exhibitions (including barnstorming) and through performing aviation firsts for the movies. Some of his airshow expertise included the nose dive, ghost dive, <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> barrel rolls, tail spins, multiple loop-the-loops, mock battles, racing, and flying fireworks. DeLay pioneered several aviation firsts for the motion pictures. (details in the next section) ...|$|E
50|$|The Split S {{manoeuvre}} is {{contrasted with}} the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> which is an ascending half-loop that finishes with a half-roll out, resulting in level flight in the exact opposite direction at a higher altitude. The Split S is also called a reversed <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> and can also be written with a hyphen: Split-S. In basic terms, the Immelman and Split S are very similar manoeuvre, both accomplishing the same goal, but the Split S exchanges altitude to gain speed, while the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> exchanges speed to gain altitude.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> {{refers to}} two {{different}} aircraft maneuvers: ...|$|E
50|$|From level flight, 5/8s loop to the {{inverted}} 45° line, 1/2 roll {{to erect}} down 45° line, pull to level flight. The move {{is similar to}} an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> with the difference being in the location in the loop at which the roll is performed. The roll in an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> {{is at the top}} of the loop.|$|E
50|$|Aerobatic {{capabilities}} {{capable of}} maneuvers {{such as the}} <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> Cuban eight, and Split S.|$|E

50|$|In World War I aerial combat, an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> was a {{maneuver}} used {{after an}} attack on another aircraft to reposition the attacking aircraft for another attack.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> {{is named}} after flying ace Max Immelmann. It {{has become one of}} the most popular aerial maneuvers, being {{commonly}} used in airshows all across the globe.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: The flight {{instructor}} {{was designed to}} respond to the player's performance. If a mistake is made during a maneuver—such as the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> demonstrated above—guidance is provided in real-time.|$|E
5000|$|In modern {{aerobatic}}s, an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> (also {{known as}} a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver that results in level flight {{in the opposite direction}} at a higher altitude.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> {{can also}} be {{reversed}} by starting with a half-roll into inverted flight, and then using elevator to pull the aircraft down through a half loop back to level flight.|$|E
50|$|Aerobatics {{are taught}} to {{military}} fighter pilots {{as a means of}} developing flying skills and for tactical use in combat. Many aerobatic manoeuvers were indeed developed in military conflicts, e.g. the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> or Split S.|$|E
50|$|To {{execute the}} <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> the pilot pulls the {{aircraft}} into a vertical climb, and eventually completes half a loop in the aircraft from this climb, inverting the aircraft. The pilot then executes a half-roll to regain level flight.|$|E
50|$|The {{aileron roll}} is {{commonly}} used in air shows and aerial combat training. The use of the pure aileron roll in air combat is contentious, but many common maneuvers bear heavy dependence on the aileron roll. Examples of this are the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> barrel roll, and Split S.|$|E
50|$|Some species, such as deer {{flies and}} the Australian March flies, {{are known for}} being {{extremely}} noisy during flight, though clegs, for example, fly quietly and bite with little warning. Tabanids are agile fliers; Hybomitra have been observed to perform aerial manoeuvres similar to those performed by fighter jets, such as the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn.</b>|$|E

50|$|During the combat, Faber became disoriented and {{separated}} from the other German aircraft. He was attacked by Sergeant František Trejtnar (link in Chech language) of 310 Squadron. In his efforts {{to shake off the}} Spitfire, Faber flew north over Exeter in Devon. After much high-speed maneuvering, Faber, with only one cannon working, pulled an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> into the sun and shot down his pursuer in a head-on attack.|$|E
50|$|In modern {{aerobatic}}s, an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn</b> (also {{known as}} a roll-off-the-top, or simply an Immelmann) is an aerobatic maneuver. Essentially, the aerobatic Immelmann comprises an ascending half-loop followed by a half-roll, resulting in level flight in the exact opposite direction at a higher altitude. It is {{the exact opposite of}} a Split S, which involves a half-roll followed by a half-loop, resulting in level flight in the exact opposite direction at a lower altitude.|$|E
50|$|Max Immelmann (21 September 1890 - 18 June 1916) PLM was {{the first}} German World War I flying ace. He was a pioneer in fighter {{aviation}} and is often mistakenly credited with the first aerial victory using a synchronized gun. He {{was the first}} aviator to win the Pour le Mérite, and was awarded {{it at the same}} time as Oswald Boelcke. His name has become attached to a common flying tactic, the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> and remains a byword in aviation. He is credited with 15 aerial victories.|$|E
5000|$|An Immelmann is {{a popular}} {{inversion}} found on many B&M roller coasters. In an Immelmann, riders enter a half-loop followed by a half twist, and then exit the element traveling {{in the opposite direction}} making a 180-degree turn. The inversion is similar to the sidewinder which exits closer to 90°, or perpendicular to the entrance point. An Immelmann loop becomes diving loop if the entrance and exit points are reversed. The name [...] "Immelmann" [...] comes from the <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn,</b> an aircraft maneuver named after the World War I German fighter pilot Max Immelmann.|$|E

50|$|Riders {{start by}} {{turning into a}} dark tunnel with a siren and a loud boom, before {{shooting}} straight up the 110 ft vertical launch hill at 40 MPH, cresting, and then descending vertically {{down the other side}} of the tower at speeds reaching 55 MPH. Riders then go up and over a small airtime hill with a trim brake, before going up and quickly flipping around an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn.</b> The track levels out before sending riders up into a heartline roll. They then descend and then quickly pass around a small, shallow turn into the trim/safety brake.|$|E

5000|$|By the {{beginning}} of the Somme Offensive, Hartney had been assigned to 20 Squadron as a Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d pilot. On 1 July 1916, while flying over the developing ground attack, Hartney found himself under fire from a Fokker E.III. Hartney smacked his gunner alert, sideslipped from danger, and racked his Royal Aircraft Factory FE.2d into an <b>Immelmann</b> <b>turn.</b> He came out slightly above the German, who was now in a head-on firing pass. Hartney's gunner fired five four-round bursts. Hartney's recollection was, [...] "His tank ablaze, he pulled up almost directly in front of us, then whip-stalled to Eternity." [...] Despite the flames, Hartney was credited with an [...] "out of control" [...] victory.|$|E
