5|$|Sitting Bull and <b>his</b> <b>people</b> {{stayed in}} Canada for 4 years. Due {{to the smaller}} size of the buffalo herds in Canada, Sitting Bull and his men found it {{difficult}} to find enough food to feed <b>his</b> <b>people,</b> who were starving and exhausted. Sitting Bull’s presence in the country led to increased tensions between the Canadian and the United States governments. Before Sitting Bull left Canada, he may have visited Walsh for a final time and left a ceremonial headdress as a memento.|$|E

5|$|Arafat {{remains a}} {{controversial}} figure. The {{majority of the}} Palestinian people view him as a heroic freedom fighter and martyr who symbolized the national aspirations of <b>his</b> <b>people.</b> Conversely, most Israelis came to regard him as an unrepentant terrorist, while Palestinian rivals, including Islamists and several PLO leftists, often denounced him for being corrupt or too submissive in his concessions to the Israeli government.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi also campaigned hard {{going from}} one rural corner of the Indian subcontinent to another. He used {{terminology}} and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated with the culture and historic values of <b>his</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E

5|$|While in Trujillo, Cortés {{received}} messengers from Papayeca, a large native town some seven leagues away, and Champagua (now {{known as}} Chapagua), another nearby town. Both of these settlements were inhabited by Nahuas. Cortés recorded {{the names of}} two Nahua rulers as Pizacura and Mazatl. Pizacura resisted Cortes' overtures and refused to swear fealty; Cortés sent Spanish cavalry and infantry, accompanied by {{a great number of}} Indian auxiliaries. They launched a night attack upon Pizacura's village in the Agalta valley, and captured the Nahua leader with a hundred of <b>his</b> <b>people.</b> The majority were enslaved, while Pizacura was held as a prisoner with two other nobles, and a young man whom Cortés suspected of being the true leader of <b>his</b> <b>people.</b> Pizacura claimed that his resistance was instigated by Mazatl, who opposed peace with the Spanish invaders. Cortés captured Mazatl and asked him to order his subjects to return to their abandoned villages. Mazatl refused, so Cortés hanged him in Trujillo.|$|E

5|$|After the Battle of Edington in 878, Alfred {{established}} {{a network of}} fortified settlements, called burhs, in Wessex to protect <b>his</b> <b>people</b> and territory against Viking attacks, and when Æthelred accepted Alfred's lordship the burhs were extended into Mercia. One of the burhs was Worcester, where Æthelred worked with its bishop and used the standing Roman walls in the town's defences.

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining control over <b>his</b> <b>people</b> worsened {{during the siege}} of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy {{made it difficult for}} a ruler to exert the same degree of authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Anniversaries of {{the most}} {{important}} events of Stephen's life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, including in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at Putna. This doubled as a protest against Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem Doina (written in the style of traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead <b>his</b> <b>people.</b> His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.|$|E
