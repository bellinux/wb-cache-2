2500|$|Consuming {{large amounts}} of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> can {{negatively}} affect your brain. [...] Eating foods with <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> elevates the level of cholesterol and triglycerides in your body. [...] Studies have shown that high levels of triglycerides strongly link with mood problems such as depression, hostility and aggression. [...] This may occur because high triglyceride levels decrease the amount of oxygen that blood can carry to your brain.

2500|$|Blanket {{recommendations}} to lower <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> were criticized at a 2010 conference debate of the American Dietetic Association for focusing too narrowly on reducing <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> rather than emphasizing increased consumption of healthy fats and unrefined carbohydrates.

40|$|A {{focus of}} dietary {{recommendations}} for cardiovascular disease (CVD) {{prevention and treatment}} has been a reduction in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake, primarily {{as a means of}} lowering LDL-cholesterol concentrations. However, the evidence that supports a reduction in <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake must be evaluated in the context of replacement by other macronutrients. Clinical trials that replaced <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> with polyunsaturated fat have generally shown a reduction in CVD events, although several studies showed no effects. An independent association of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> intake with CVD risk has not been consistently shown in prospective epidemiologic studies, although some have provided evidence of an increased risk in young individuals and in women. Replacement of <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> by polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fat lowers both LDL and HDL cholesterol. However, replacement with a higher carbohydrate intake, particularly refined carbohydrate, can exacerbate the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with insulin resistance and obesity that includes increased triglycerides, small LDL particles, and reduced HDL cholesterol. In summary, although substitution of dietary polyunsaturated <b>fat</b> for <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> has been shown to lower CVD risk, there are few epidemiologic or clinical trial data to support a benefit of replacing <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> with carbohydrate. Furthermore, particularly given the differential effects of dietary <b>saturated</b> <b>fats</b> and carbohydrates on concentrations of larger and smaller LDL particles, respectively, dietary efforts to improve the increasing burden of CVD risk associated with atherogenic dyslipidemia should primarily emphasize the limitation of refined carbohydrate intakes and a reduction in excess adiposity...|$|R

METHODS: Adipose tissue and total hepatic fat were higher in the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group than in the hydrogenated fat group. Hepatic lipid peroxidation was greatest in the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group, with consequent lower hepatic vitamin E and A levels. In contrast, serum vitamin A was highest in the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group. Analysis of hepatic lipid fractions found more cholesterol and less high density lipoprotein-cholesterol in the hydrogenated fat group. The hydrogenated fat group had the highest levels of triacylglycerols, followed by the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> group. RESULTS: Significant amounts of trans fatty acids were detected in the hepatic and adipose tissues of the hydrogenated fat group. Among the identified fatty acids, 18 : 1 n 9 had a higher positive association with hepatic cholesterol and triacylglycerols, and a higher negative association with high density lipoprotein-cholesterol.

Separable fat is the greatest determinant of the <b>saturated</b> <b>fat</b> in Australian red meat, and changes in processing and butchering practices have combined to produce red meat today with significantly lower <b>saturated</b> <b>fat.</b> Nutrient analyses in 2002 showed that the separable fat on raw retail samples was up to 38 % less than in comparable cuts in 1983.
