5|$|Goddard had a weak {{heart and}} had never flown before, so he asked his doctor, William Kirkwood, to {{accompany}} him on the trip. As Kirkwood was a resident at a maternity hospital, his presence led to false speculation that Simpson was pregnant, and <b>even</b> <b>that</b> she was having an abortion. The press excitedly reported that the solicitor had flown to Simpson accompanied by a gynaecologist and an anaesthetist (who was actually the lawyer's clerk).|$|E
5|$|Rumours {{circulated}} {{of a brain}} haemorrhage, {{followed by}} competing reports {{that he had been}} mugged and <b>even</b> <b>that</b> he had drunk himself to death. Later, there was speculation about drugs and diabetes. At the post-mortem, the pathologist found three causes of death– pneumonia, brain swelling and a fatty liver. Despite his heavy drinking his liver showed no sign of cirrhosis.|$|E

5|$|A common {{misconception}} is that {{signs are}} iconically self-explanatory, {{that they are}} a transparent imitation of what they mean, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> they are pantomime. In fact, many signs bear no resemblance to their referent, either because they were originally arbitrary symbols or because their iconicity has been obscured over time. Even so, in ASL iconicity plays a significant role; a high percentage of signs resemble their referents in some way. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the medium of sign—three-dimensional space—naturally allows more iconicity than oral language.|$|E
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible from inside the Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts referred to a species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E

5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This incident is not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
5|$|Imprisonment is {{considered}} any restraint on {{the freedom of}} movement, for however short a time. In Austin and another v Metropolitan Police Commissioner, seven hours was considered a sufficient {{period of time to}} constitute false imprisonment (although the claim was ultimately rejected due to the circumstances of a potentially hostile crowd of demonstrators). The requirement is complete restraint; in Bird v Jones, the defendant fenced off part of a footpath for use as a viewing point for a boat race. The claimant, accustomed to walking across it, climbed into the enclosure; the defendants refused to let him pass. They were found not liable for false imprisonment, as another way across existed. There is on the other hand no requirement that the claimant actually attempt to leave, as in Grainger v Hill, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> he knows he is being prevented from leaving, as in Meering v Graham-White Aviation Co Ltd.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{from the}} Department of Civil Aviation {{believed}} water {{in some of}} the fuel tanks of VH-ANA was responsible for rough running of {{one or more of the}} engines; and this ultimately led to intermittent failure of all the engines. The Inquiry led by Mr Justice Simpson found no evidence that there was significant water in the fuel tanks. No radio call was received from Amana to indicate the nature of any problem, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> the crew was aware of a problem. The Inquiry concluded without determining the cause of the crash.|$|E

5|$|It {{is clear}} that Othelake was no longer enjoying the office by 1420. By this time, John Kitley had been {{appointed}} to the post, though the exact date of his appointment is unknown. He was appointed by King Henry V of England on the insistence of the Earl of Ormonde. There {{is no evidence to}} suggest that Kitley had any connection to Ireland, or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> he visited it, but his connection to Earl of Ormonde is interesting. Kitley was succeeded by Thomas Collyer, who had previously served as Clarenceux King of Arms and Lancaster Herald of Arms in Ordinary. Nothing is known of his career as Ireland, and he was succeeded by Thomas Ashwell.|$|E
5|$|One month later, Jupiter {{visits the}} narrator and asks him to come immediately, fearing that Legrand has been bitten by the bug and gone insane. Once they arrive on the island, Legrand insists that the bug will {{be the key to}} {{restoring}} his lost fortune. He leads them on an expedition to a particular tree and has Jupiter climb it until he finds a skull nailed {{at the end of one}} branch. At Legrand's direction, Jupiter drops the bug through one eye socket and Legrand paces out to a spot where the group begins to dig. Finding nothing there, Legrand has Jupiter climb the tree again and drop the bug through the skull's other eye; they choose a different spot to dig, this time finding two skeletons and a chest filled with gold coins and jewelry. They estimate the total value at $1.5 million, but <b>even</b> <b>that</b> figure proves to be below the actual worth when they eventually sell the items.|$|E
5|$|Power {{and water}} schemes were {{expanded}} {{to be able}} to cope with the industrial development occurring. The state was at a disadvantage in that it was completely reliant on imports for its fuel supply. South Australia's near-monopoly electricity supplier, the Adelaide Electricity Supply Company (AESC), was reluctant to build up coal reserves in case of a transportation problem. They ran on coal that was shipped over from New South Wales (NSW), where the mines were inefficient and plagued by communist-agitated industrial strife. Playford demanded that supplies be built up so the factories could keep producing; he managed to secure eight months worth of coal reserves from NSW, but <b>even</b> <b>that</b> began to dwindle due to the continued industrial action. Coal supplies were ordered from South Africa in desperation, at Playford's behest. The frustration he experienced while dealing with the AESC would later prove disastrous to the company as the Premier took action against them.|$|E

5|$|Sedna has an {{exceptionally}} long and elongated orbit, taking approximately 11,400 {{years to complete}} and a distant point of closest approach to the Sun at 76AU. These facts have led to much speculation about its origin. The Minor Planet Center currently places Sedna in the scattered disc, a group of objects sent into highly elongated orbits by the gravitational influence of Neptune. However, this classification has been contested, because Sedna never comes close enough to Neptune to have been scattered by it, leading some astronomers to informally {{refer to it as}} the first known member of the inner Oort cloud. Others speculate that it might have been tugged into its current orbit by a passing star, perhaps one within the Sun's birth cluster (an open cluster), or <b>even</b> <b>that</b> it was captured from another star system. Another hypothesis suggests that its orbit may be evidence for a large planet beyond the orbit of Neptune.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{district}} is densely developed, primarily residential in its {{northern and southern}} portions, with commercial use concentrated in central blocks near Monument Square. The only significant open spaces within it are the one-block Washington Park near its southern end and Seminary Park, the main quad at Russell Sage. Most of the major streets and the central area of the district are lined with multi-story dwellings that are primarily commercial but {{with a mix of}} office and residential space on their upper floors. On the side streets, there are smaller-scale residential townhouses. Institutional use is limited to Russell Sage, a few churches, RPI's buildings and governmental structures like the county courthouse and post office. No industrial use, past or present, is within the district, with the notable exception of the Gurley Building, and <b>even</b> <b>that</b> has been scaled back in recent years.|$|E
5|$|The final {{problem was}} the poor {{financial}} situation that Nicola was in. In {{a letter to the}} Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council dated April 7, 1779, Nicola asked for a pay raise, saying he was unable to purchase food or even clothes. Some members of the Invalid Corps claimed they were unable to provide for themselves. On February 5, 1782, the Pennsylvania Supreme Executive Council fired Nicola from the position of Town Major; their reasoning was that no such duty was needed at the time. During that same month and struggling for money, Nicola asked the Continental superintendent of finance Robert Morris for the money that the Congress did not pay the Corps. <b>Even</b> <b>that,</b> however, failed to give the Invalid Corps its money.|$|E

5|$|The {{large amount}} of CO2 in the {{atmosphere}} together with water vapour and sulfur dioxide create a strong greenhouse effect, trapping solar energy and raising the surface temperature to around 740K (467°C), hotter than any other planet in the Solar System, <b>even</b> <b>that</b> of Mercury despite being located farther out from the Sun and receiving only 25% of the solar energy (per unit area) Mercury does. The average temperature on the surface is above the melting points of lead (600K, 327°C), tin (505K, 232°C), and zinc (693K, 420°C). The thick troposphere also makes the difference in temperature between {{the day and night}} side small, even though the slow retrograde rotation of the planet causes a single solar day to last 116.5 Earth days. The surface of Venus spends 58.3 days of darkness before the sun rises again behind the clouds.|$|E
5|$|The other {{text that}} seems to support the case for Arthur's {{historical}} existence is the 10th-century Annales Cambriae, which also link Arthur with the Battle of Badon. The Annales date this battle to 516–518, and also mention the Battle of Camlann, in which Arthur and Medraut (Mordred) were both killed, dated to 537–539. These details have often been used to bolster confidence in the Historias account and to confirm that Arthur really did fight at Badon. Problems have been identified, however, with using this source to support the Historia Brittonums account. The latest {{research shows that the}} Annales Cambriae was based on a chronicle begun in the late 8th century in Wales. Additionally, the complex textual history of the Annales Cambriae precludes any certainty that the Arthurian annals were added to it <b>even</b> <b>that</b> early. They were more likely added {{at some point in the}} 10th century and may never have existed in any earlier set of annals. The Badon entry probably derived from the Historia Brittonum.|$|E
