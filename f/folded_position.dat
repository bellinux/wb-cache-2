25|$|The SG 550 has a side-folding {{skeletonized}} buttstock (folds to {{the right}} side of the receiver) and a lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is firmly locked in the <b>folded</b> <b>position</b> by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat known as Ilaflon. The gas system's components are made of stainless steel. The barrel, bolt, bolt carrier, and firing pin are all made with steel that has been gas nitrided, hardened and tempered. The bolt and carrier, along with most other components internal to the receiver undergo a phosphating process.|$|E

2500|$|The P-38 {{is easily}} used.

[...] The can is held in the left hand, and the right hand is rotated slightly clockwise, causing the can lid to be punctured. [...] The can is then rotated counter clockwise in the left hand, while the right hand rotates alternatively slightly counterclockwise and slightly clockwise, until the can has been rotated nearly 360 degrees and the lid is nearly free. [...] The lid of the now opened can is lifted, most often with the P-38 cutting edge, and the P-38 is wiped clean, and the cutting point is rotated back to its stowed, folded position; then, the P-38 is returned to its stored location, whether that is dangling on a dog tag chain around one's neck, or in one's pocket if the P-38 is attached to a key ring. [...] Left-handed users simply hold the P-38 in their left hand, with the cutting point aimed towards themselves, while holding the can to be opened in their right hand, while also reversing the sense of the cutting hand movements just described. [...] By tradition, 38 cuts as just described were supposedly required to open a can of C-Rations.|$|E

40|$|Breakage-Fusion-Bridge cycles {{in cancer}} arise when a broken segment of DNA is {{duplicated}} {{and an end}} from each copy joined together. This structure then `unfolds' into {{a new piece of}} palindromic DNA. This is one mechanism responsible for the localised amplicons observed in cancer genome data. The process has parallels with paper folding sequences that arise when a piece of paper is folded several times and then unfolded. Here we adapt such methods to study the breakage-fusion-bridge structures in detail. We firstly consider discrete representations of this space with 2 -d trees to demonstrate that there are 2 ^(n(n- 1) / 2) qualitatively distinct evolutions involving n breakage-fusion-bridge cycles. Secondly we consider the stochastic nature of the <b>fold</b> <b>positions,</b> to determine evolution likelihoods, and also describe how amplicons become localised. Finally we highlight these methods by inferring the evolution of breakage-fusion-bridge cycles with data from primary tissue cancer samples. Comment: 34 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In this paper, {{we present}} a {{framework}} for studying folding problems from a motion planning perspective. In particular, all folding objects are modeled as tree-like multilink articulated `robots', where <b>fold</b> <b>positions</b> correspond to joints and areas that cannot fold correspond to links. This formulation allows us to apply recent techniques developed in the robotics motion planning community for articulated objects with many degrees of freedom (many links) to folding problems. An important benefit {{of this approach is}} that it not only allows us to study foldability questions, such as, can one object be folded (or unfolded) into another object, but also enables us to study the dynamic folding process itself. The framework proposed here has application in traditional motion planning areas such as automation, teaching through demonstration, animation, and most importantly, presents a different approach to the most profound problem in computational biology: protein struction prediction. Indeed, our preliminary experimental results with traditional paper crafts (e. g., box folding) and a relatively small protein are quite promising...|$|R
