500|$|Youngs' selection, {{along with}} some of the other {{selections}} made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered one of the weakest in some circles.

In 1981, however, Lawrence Ritter and Donald <b>Honig</b> included Youngs in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.

500|$|In 1995, Lundgren {{appeared}} in Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic, co-starring Keanu Reeves. The film portrays screenwriter William Gibson's dystopian cyberpunk {{view of the}} future with the world dominated by megacorporations and with strong East Asian influences. Reeves plays the title character, {{a man with a}} cybernetic brain implant designed to store information. Lundgren plays Karl <b>Honig,</b> a Jesus-obsessed hit man and street preacher who wears a robe and carries a shepherd's staff. The film was shot on location in Toronto and Montreal in 12 weeks, filling in for the film's Newark, New Jersey and Beijing settings. The film was premiered in Japan first on 15 April 1995 and features a previously composed score by Michael Danna, different editing, and more scenes with Lundgren and Japanese star Takeshi Kitano. Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, [...] "Johnny Mnemonic {{is one of the great}} goofy gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn't deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis." [...] The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum in Mississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical release film until 2010. Later in 1995, Lundgren {{appeared in}} Ted Kotcheff's The Shooter, also known as Hidden Assassin, an action drama in which he plays Michael Dane, a U.S. Marshall who gets caught up in politics when he is hired to solve the assassination of a Cuban ambassador.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in modeling the electrostatic potential of biological macromolecules is that they exist in water at a given ionic strength {{and that they have}} an irregular shape.

DelPhi, developed in Professor Barry <b>Honig's</b> lab in 1986, was the first PBE solver used by many researchers. The widespread popularity of DelPhi is due to its speed, accuracy (calculation of the electrostatic free energy is only slightly dependent on the resolution of the grid) and the ability to handle extremely high grid dimensions.|$|R

40|$|The essay takes Seyla Benhabib's {{philosophical}} {{concepts as}} an example upon which to base {{an examination of the}} question of which aspects of Kantian philosophy are relevant to the current theory of cosmopolitanism; the way in which thistheory references Kant and whether Kant's cosmopolitan parameters have been re-interpreted. It can be demonstrated that Seyla Benhabib's Another Cosmopolitanism makes significant alterations to the Kantian model. Taking Kant's view of the autonomy of the subject, human rationality and the moral-practical fundamental characteristics of humans as her starting point, she overcomes formal universalism by incorporating the specific other, the dialogue-based model of procedural integration of common norms, rights and institutions and the negotiating process of democratic iteration to regulate the conditions for inclusion and exclusion to ensure world citizens' rights. By doing so Benhabib is able to provide a new substantiation of cosmopolitanism without referencing the teleological principle of nature or neglecting the human morality which focuses on its immediate environment. Cosmopolitanism is conceived of as a utopian project which provides human beings worldwide with a variety of practical-moral objectives upon which to base their specific actions. Critical alternative theories such as the radical democratic cosmopolitanism of Ingram and <b>Honig's</b> antagonistic cosmopolitanism are unable to refute Benhabib's Another Cosmopolitanism as long as the latter is, as intended by the philosopher, understood as a utopian concept...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{a theory of}} action, drawing chiefly {{on the work of}} Hannah Arendt and Michel Foucault. I begin with a discussion of some popular theories of action. As I argue, these theories tend to suffer from three problems: they do not distinguish action from everyday behaviour, they do not account for the way in which action transforms the identity of the actor, and they tend to neglect the innovative and initiatory character of action. In chapter two, I discuss Arendt's theory of political action, which {{goes a long way toward}} redressing these problems. However, the value of Arendt's work is limited by her characterisation of the public sphere as subsumed by a 'social' rather than political form of community. Accordingly, I follow Dana Villa and Bonnie <b>Honig's</b> suggestions that a broader understanding of action is required in order to overcome the weaknesses of Arendt's work. In chapters four and five, I demonstrate that a reading of Foucault can yield just such a broader understanding. I begin with an analysis of The History of Sexuality and the argument that the transformation of ethical subjectivity can function as a means of resistance to the normalising effects of power, before moving on to discuss the essay 'What Is Enlightenment?' I argue that these works are part of a 'transformative project,' in which Foucault aims to facilitate the transformation of subjectivity as a means of resistance to social normalisation. This transformative project can be adapted into a theory of action that locates action within contemporary society but shares some of the best aspects of Arendt's theory. Finally, drawing on the work of Foucault and Adriana Cavarero, these theoretical reflections are applied to a discussion of action in the context of small communities. Small-community models of action are an important consideration because they allow us to avoid the traditional dichotomy between action as a task for the individual who transgresses social norms and action as a project of social reform...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with Arendt’s political theory, particularly those elements of it concerned with political institutions. It treats {{her work as a}} response to a mis-conceptualisation of politics as being fundamentally formed of rulership and command, {{which is to say that}} she opposes treating sovereignty as an essential component of political practice. What Arendt offers, as an alternative, is a full-fledged account of how politics could operate in the absence of sovereignty. This thesis argues that it is a coherent picture, consistent across the course of her work. A particularly important element of this consistency is the closeness of fit between the material which forms the basis of Arendt’s understanding of politics and her account of political foundations. To do so, the thesis begins with a discussion of Arendt’s concept of ‘action’, which forms the basis of her understanding of politics. One of the most distinctive features of this is the importance of individual initiative, understood as responsiveness to the already given. This part of action is an essential part of linking it harmoniously to those other elements of her work which appear here. Arendt’s work on ‘judgment’ is the focus of its own chapter; it is important because judgment is Arendt’s conceptualisation of political discussion modelled on opinion, which has previously been treated as a late-career development, is here treated as consistent with and, essentially, an extension of, certain features of action. On the basis of this combined reading of action and judgment, it is possible to read Arendt’s description of political foundations as an example of the same kind of political activity. Contra <b>Honig’s</b> reading of the political foundation as an opportunity for resistance, this thesis treats it as a political act which invites the participation of later citizens. Finally, an account of Arendt’s institutional thought is completed by presenting her description of the ‘council system’ in combination with Thomas Jefferson’s ‘ward system’. The two combine to form an example of political organisation which both does without a reliance on sovereignty and maximises opportunities for meaningful political engagement.
