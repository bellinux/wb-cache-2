The scientific novelty consists in the following statements: combining turbo-code and Reed-Solomon code of the considered configuration (TC+RS) allowed eliminating saturation effect inherent to offered TC and enhancing EEB to 8. 5 dB versus unencoded QPSK, or increasing EEB at 4. 8 dB versus cascade structure of CnC+interleaver+RS type. The research allows using encoding rate to optimize CnC+interleaver+RS structure. Changing encoding rate from R= 3 / 4 to R= 1 / 2 allowed enhancing EEB to 5. 9 dB. The paper gives assessment of phase noise impact on quantity of corrected errors in the data transmission channel with cascade structure (the amount of corrected errors changed from 13 to 16 in experimental conditions) and conditions enabling to enhance EEB to 5. 6 dB (R= 1 / 2) by means of changing code structure from RS (255, 247) to RS (255, 223) in cascade structure.

40|$|Industrial {{manufacturing}} {{of large-scale}} wind turbines requires the accurate tightening of multiple bolts and nuts, which connect the ball bearings - supporting {{wind turbine blades}} - with the hub, a huge mechanical component supporting blades pitch motion. An accurate tightening of bolts and nuts requires uniformly distributed clamping forces along flanges and surfaces of contact between hub and bearings. Due {{to the role of}} friction forces and the dynamics of the phenomenon, this process is nonlinear and currently performed manually; it is also time consuming, requiring high-cost equipment and expert operators. This paper proposes a set of neural networks, which infer the clamping force achievable with a tightening tool while fastening M 24 nuts on bolts. The tool embeds a torque sensor and shaft <b>encoder,</b> therefore two <b>types</b> of inputs of the neural networks are considered in order to fit the clamping force output: the time signals of (a) the applied torque of the tool and (b) the combination of the torque and of the angular speed of the tool.

This approach could be generalized to other industrial processes and specifically to those requiring repetitive tightening tasks and involving highly nonlinear aspects, such as friction forces. ...|$|R
40|$|Speech {{intelligibility}} of {{two types}} of vocoders was measured using the modified rhyme test. One type of vocoder, a continuous variable slope delta (CVSD), was a waveform <b>encoder.</b> The other <b>type,</b> an advanced multi-band excitation (AMBE), was a parametric encoder. In the first experiment, clear speech was processed through the vocoders. Intelligibility was measured in a control condition, i. e. without vocoding, with each type alone and with two vocoders in tandem. AMBE and CVSD performed similarly, 92. 6 and 90. 4 %, respectively. CVSD-to-AMBE {{had little effect on}} intelligibility, measured at 89. 2 %. However, AMBEto-CVSD had a large degrading effect on intelligibility. The AMBE-to-CVSD direction scored about 81. 7 % intelligibility with clear, unaltered speech signals. The asymmetry between waveform-to-parametric and parametric-to-waveform encoders underscores the non-linear nature of tandem vocoders on intelligibility. When vocoders of the same type were in tandem, there was no additional effect on intelligibility. The double CVSD condition yielded 92. 2 % intelligibility and the double AMBE condition yielded 91 %. The deleterious effects of speech clipping were measured in a second experiment, as these are ubiquitous in military radio transmission systems. The AMBE parametric vocoder performed at the 88 % level in isolation and at 84 % when tandemed with the CVSD waveform vocoder. Alternative methods of encoding speech signals are being explored to improve speech intelligibility performance in military communication systems...|$|R
40|$|Layered video coding creates {{multiple}} {{layers of}} unequal importance, which enables us to progressively refine the reconstructed video quality. When the base layer (BL) is corrupted or lost during transmission, the enhancement layers (ELs) must be dropped, regardless whether they are perfectly decoded or not, which implies that the transmission power assigned to the ELs is wasted. In this treatise, we propose an interlayer forward error correction (FEC) coded video transmission scheme for mobile TV. At the transmitter, the proposed interlayer (IL) coding technique implants the systematic information of the BL into the ELs by using exclusive-OR operations. At the receiver, the implanted bits of the ELs may be utilized for assisting in decoding the BL. Furthermore, the data partition mode of H. 264 video coding is utilized as the source <b>encoder,</b> where the <b>type</b> B and type C partitions will assist in protecting the type A partition. The IL coded bitstream will then be modulated and transmitted over a multi-functional multiple-input multiple output (MF-MIMO) scheme {{for the sake of}} improving the system’s performance in mobile environments. The proposed system may be readily combined with the traditional unequal error protection (UEP) technique, where extrinsic mutual information (MI) measurements are used for characterizing the performance of our proposed technique. Finally, our simulation results show that the proposed system model outperforms the traditional UEP aided system by about 2. 5 dB of Eb/N 0 or 3. 4 dB of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) at the cost of 21 % complexity increase, when employing a recursive systematic convolutional code. Furthermore, unlike the traditional UEP strategies, where typically stronger FEC-protection is assigned to the more important layer, employing our proposed IL coding technique requires weaker FEC to the more important layer. For example, the system relying on channel coding rates of 0. 85, 0. 44 and 0. 44 for the type A, type B and type C H. 264 video partitions, respectively, achieves the best system performance when employing a recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} thesis, we are {{concerned}} with reliable data reconstruction and stability of dynamical systems which are controlled over limited capacity communication channels. Necessary conditions for reliable data reconstruction and stability of sequences in r-mean and probability are derived which depend on the entropy rate of the input to the <b>encoder</b> and the <b>type</b> of reconstruction and stability criteria. These conditions are given {{in terms of the}} Shannon lower bound and they are applicable to linear and nonlinear systems. Using these conditions, some of necessary conditions which are already available in the literature, are obtained as a special case. We discuss some of them throughout the thesis. Moreover, under certain conditions these necessary conditions are also sufficient. The results are applied to a linear stochastic partially observed control system subject to measurement noise when the channel is an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel. Here, we derive an encoder, decoder, and controller for mean square stability and reconstruction using the standard detectability and stabilizability assumptions of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) theory. From obtained conditions for reliable data reconstruction and stability, it is concluded that the Shannon capacity is still an adequate measure for describing the conditions for moment reliable data reconstruction and stability. We find the continuous version of the well known eigenvalue rate condition for continuous time systems when they are controlled over continuous time AWGN channels. This condition is described by the summation of the real parts of the unstable eigenvalues of the open loop time-invariant system. This eigenvalue rate condition is obtained by addressing the necessary condition for stability of a fully observed linear continuous time-invariant noiseless plant; and by constructing an encoding scheme and a stability scheme for reliable data reconstruction and stability of a continuous time plant driven by Brownian motion. Necessary conditions for uniform reliable data reconstruction and robust stability of the uncertain dynamical systems which are controlled over communication channels, are also derived. These conditions are given in terms of the robust entropy rate of the inputs to the encoder and an additional term which is related to the reconstruction and stability criteria. The uncertainty in the dynamical system is described by a relative entropy constraint. Such uncertainty description is a natural generalization of the sum quadratic uncertainty description. These conditions are applied to specific uncertain systems by computing the robust entropy rate. Moreover, a relation between robust entropy rate and the Algebraic Riccati equation appearing in the H infinity estimation and control problem, is established. Under certain conditions the obtained necessary conditions are also sufficient. Furthermore, We study the stability problem of a fully observed controlled Gauss Markov uncertain system which is subject to the sum quadratic uncertainty restriction. In addition, throughout it is shown that the Shannon lower bound is an adequate measure for describing the conditions for reliable data reconstruction and stability of sequences related to a dynamical system which is controlled over a limited capacity communication channel...|$|R
40|$|The Hollow Cylinder Apparatus (HCA) is {{the only}} soil test device that can {{facilitate}} independent control of both the magnitudes and directions of the principal stresses. The stress history and loading conditions {{at a point in}} a soil deposit can be reproduced on a Hollow Cylindrical (HC) specimen, and its constitutive behaviour and pore-pressure response measured. However, shortcomings in the equipment, instrumentation and the procedural approaches can potentially invalidate the test results obtained from existing HCAs. Measurement and process control limitations confine their operation to static testing over the strain range from 0. 0001 to 0. 20. Many of the existing HCAs are incapable of generalised stress path testing. A new HCA that can simulate the complex loading conditions at a point in a soil deposit, on a hollow cylindrical test specimen, was developed. It facilitates accurate measurements of the specimen?s constitutive and pore-pressure responses over the complete strain range during stress path testing or displacement-controlled loading. Test specimen dimensions, which limit the stress non-uniformity during testing to an acceptable level, were identified. A sample preparation apparatus was also developed and a technique was perfected to reconstitute saturated sand specimens in the new apparatus. The research and development of the new HCA?s cell, its pressure systems, the servo-mechanisms, which displace and rotate the loading piston, their instrumentation and ancillary equipment, are described. Linear actuators control the hydraulic systems, which apply the inner and outer confining pressures and the back-pressure to the specimen. Innovative servo-mechanisms, which induce an axial force and a torque across the specimen, are mounted beneath the cell {{so that it can be}} readily assembled and disassembled by an operator. The cell?s tie bars are located inside its acrylic cylinder and the load path through it is extremely stiff. The servo-mechanisms can quasi-statically or dynamically load specimens of all soil types, weak rock and pavement base materials in direct compression, extension or pure torsion, to failure. They can also apply tensile normal stresses to the test specimen to facilitate investigations into the engineering properties of materials other than soil. The mechanisms have a low inertia, zero backlash and insignificant compliance values. The axial force, torque and the confining pressures that are applied and the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s polar deformational, pore-pressure and volume change responses can be accurately measured. Its static deformational response can be measured over the specimen?s zone of uniform stress, near its mid-height using instruments located inside the cell. These instruments can be remotely relocated during a test to accommodate the specimen?s deformational response. The control sensitivity of the pressure systems and servo-mechanisms and the instruments 2 ̆ 7 resolution and accuracy values are sufficient to facilitate low amplitude cyclic testing in order to determine the soil?s quasi-elastic constitutive properties. The specimen 2 ̆ 7 s boundary displacements can also be measured using instruments located outside the cell. They facilitate dynamic measurements over the reduced strain range from the order of 10 - 4 strain, to failure. A hollow-shaft <b>type</b> <b>encoder</b> was uniquely incorporated in this instance to measure the specimen 2 ̆ 7 s twist. The servo-mechanisms can readily produce the high-speed response, which is necessary to facilitate accurate dynamic testing. A complementary control system was integrated in the new HCA with the aim of developing a fully automated stress path and displacement-controlled test device. Test specimens of 71 mm inner diameter, 100 mm outer diameter and 200 mm high were selected in view of theoretical and practical considerations. These dimensions also facilitate the testing of undisturbed samples. The development of the sample preparation apparatus and the technique, which employs the wet-pluviation method followed by tapping that was perfected, is described. This technique can consistently reconstitute specimens with a uniform controlled density and their dimensions have excellent repeatability...|$|R
