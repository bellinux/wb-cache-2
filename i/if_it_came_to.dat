5|$|In {{the wake}} of the floods, several citizens' groups and {{political}} parties, notably the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), strongly recommended that Tiruchirappalli be designated as the second, administrative capital of Tamil Nadu, due to its centralised location, the presence of a large international airport, a low level of congestion, the availability of vacant government land and a decreased likelihood of flooding. PMK leader S. Ramadoss said the party would seriously consider the matter <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> power.|$|E
5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from the underclass and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 1884 convention, Blaine was once more {{considered}} the favorite for the nomination, but President Arthur was contemplating a run for election in his own right. George Edmunds was again the favored candidate among reformers and John Sherman had a few delegates pledged to him, but neither was expected to command much support at the convention. John A. Logan of Illinois hoped to attract Stalwart votes if Arthur’s campaign was unsuccessful. Blaine was unsure he wanted to try for the nomination for the third time and even encouraged General William T. Sherman, John Sherman’s older brother, to accept it <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> him, but ultimately Blaine agreed to be a candidate again.|$|E

25|$|If {{the contestants}} {{had the same}} score {{at the end of}} the game, the scores were reset and the contestants played one tiebreaker {{question}} each, again attempting to match all six celebrities. On Match Game PM, or on the syndicated daytime show if time was running short, a time-saving variant of the tie-breaker was used that reversed the game play. The contestants wrote their answers first on a card in secret, then the celebrities were canvassed to give their answers verbally. Originally, this included regulars Somers, Reilly and Dawson only, but when Dawson left the show, the canvass was expanded to include all six panelists in the usual order. The first celebrity response to match a contestant's answer gave that contestant the victory. If there was still no match, which was rare, the round was replayed with a new question. On the CBS version, the tie-breaker went on until there was a clear winner. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> the sudden-death tie-breaker, only the final question (the one that ultimately broke the tie) was kept and aired.|$|E

500|$|In January 2014, Helen Zille {{announced}} that the DA would be marching to Luthuli House, the ANC's headquarters, saying, “We are taking the fight to Luthuli House to highlight the failure of (President) Jacob Zuma's ANC to cut corruption and create jobs.” Zille said that 6000 people would be marching, each one representing 1000 South Africans who would benefit from the 6 million jobs that the DA promised to create <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> power. The planned date of the march was 4 February 2014, but this was later changed to the 12th due to logistical problems. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) initially denied the DA's application to march but the decision was overturned on 3 February 2014 when the DA took the matter to the Johannesburg High Court. On the 11th, {{it was reported that}} the JMPD had set the march perimeters to prevent the DA from marching to Luthuli House. JMPD spokesperson, Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said, [...] "The protest march by the DA... has been prohibited on the grounds {{that there would be a}} security risk to protesters." [...] The DA {{announced that}} the march would now end at Beyers Naude Square. On the day of the march, an application to stop the DA march filed by the ANC to the South Gauteng High Court was dismissed.|$|E

500|$|Villani was a Guelph, but {{his book}} is much more taken up with an inquiry into what is useful and true than with {{factional}} party considerations. In a departure from Guelph politics, he favored republicanism over monarchy, praising the philosopher Brunetto Latini as [...] "the master and initiator in refining the Florentines, in making them skilled in good speaking and in knowing how to guide and rule our republic according to political science." [...] However, Villani admitted in his writing that republicanism bred factional strife, that benevolent rulers like Robert of Naples were sometimes needed to keep order, and republicanism could become tyrannical <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> represent only one class (such as exclusive favoring of aristocrats, merchants, or artisans). When detailing {{the construction of the}} Florence Cathedral and the artist Giotto di Bondone as the designer of the new bell tower, Villani called him [...] "the most sovereign master of painting in his time." [...] Villani's Cronica also provides the first known biography of Dante Alighieri (1265–1321), author of the Divine Comedy, who Villani described as haughty, disdainful, and reserved. In his revised Cronica of 1322, Villani shortened Dante's biography and the amount of quotations taken from his Divine Comedy. Villani's actions are explained by Richard H. Lansing and Teodolinda Barolini, who write: [...] "Evidently two decades after the poet's death a conservative writer closely identified with the Florentine state still felt obliged to distance himself from the most outspoken critic of the basis of that state's prestige." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens {{and other}} {{radicals}} were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, [...] "Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens's pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon". In April 1862, Stevens {{wrote to a}} friend, [...] "As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody." [...] The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: [...] "Stevens, Sumner and [...] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever I go and whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour [...] has not yet come." [...] The President stated that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, {{he would have to}} side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them [...] "the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with" [...] but [...] "with their faces... set Zionwards". Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. [...] Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful reelection campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln's policies, calling them [...] "flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community". Stevens generally opposed Lincoln's plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote a nephew in June 1863 saying, [...] "The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his grandiose theatrics, Gorgeous George was an accomplished wrestler. [...] While many may have considered him a mere gimmick wrestler, he was actually a very competent freestyle wrestler, having started learning the sport in amateur wrestling as a teenager, and he could handle himself quite well <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a legitimate contest. The great Lou Thesz, who would take the AWA title away from Wagner, and {{who was one of}} the best [...] "legit" [...] wrestlers ever in professional wrestling, displayed some disdain for the gimmick wrestlers. Nevertheless, he admitted that Wagner [...] "could wrestle pretty well", but added that, [...] "he [...] could never draw a fan until he became Gorgeous George." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some saw the Defence Secretary post as {{a reward}} for Portillo's {{cautious}} loyalty to Major during the 1995 leadership challenge of John Redwood, following Major's [...] "back me or sack me" [...] resignation as party leader. Many urged Portillo, the [...] "darling of the right", to run against Major. He declined to enter the first round, but planned to challenge Major if the contest went to a second round. To this end, he set up a potential campaign headquarters, with banks of telephone lines. He later admitted that this had been an error: [...] "I did not want to oppose , but neither did I want to close the possibility of entering a second ballot <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> that." [...] Portillo acknowledged that [...] "ambiguity is unattractive" [...] and his opponents within the party later used Portillo's apparent equivocation as an example of his indecisiveness; [...] "I appeared happy to wound but afraid to strike: a dishonourable position." ...|$|E
2500|$|Francis's tenure was {{dogged by}} {{difficult}} relationships both with his senior players {{and with the}} directors. [...] After the flotation, Sullivan {{felt the need to}} publicly deny rumours that Bruce was lined up as manager, and the rumours resurfaced after he was dropped from the team in November 1997. In March 1998, David Gold had to talk Francis into withdrawing his resignation after the inclusion of the players' lounge in a matchday corporate package, and abuse of his wife and son by people using that area, brought his poor relationship with Brady to a head. She said that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> a choice between the two of them, she would be the only winner. By October 2001, lack of progress had made his position untenable. After a 6–0 League Cup defeat to Manchester City, he left by mutual consent. A period of caretaker management followed while the battle to secure Steve Bruce's release from employers Crystal Palace reached the High Court. Bruce shook up a stale team, taking them from mid-table into the play-offs. This time they were successful, beating Norwich City on penalties in the final, again at Cardiff; the decisive penalty was scored by the 18-year-old Birmingham fan Darren Carter.|$|E

2500|$|The 1912 {{session of}} Parliament opened on 14 February with a stated intent by the Liberal Party in the King's Speech to {{introduce}} a new Home Rule Bill. The bill was to be introduced on 11 April, and four days before that Law travelled to Ulster for {{a tour of the}} area. The pinnacle of this was a meeting on 9 April in the grounds of the Royal Agricultural Society near Balmoral (an area of Belfast), attended by seventy Unionist MPs, the Primate of All Ireland and topped by [...] "perhaps the largest Union Jack ever made" [...] – 48 feet by 25 feet on a flagpole 90 feet high. At the meeting both Law and Carson swore to the crowd that [...] "never under any circumstances will we submit to Home Rule". However, the Parliament Act and the government majority made such a victory against the Bill unlikely unless the government could be brought down or Parliament dissolved. A second problem was that not all Unionists opposed Home Rule to the same degree; some hardcore Unionists would oppose any attempt at Home Rule, others thought it inevitable that the Bill would pass and were simply trying to get the best deal possible for Ulster. The spectre of civil war was also raised– the Ulstermen began to form paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteers, and there was a strong possibility that <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> fighting the British Army would have to be sent in to support the underfunded and understaffed Royal Irish Constabulary.|$|E
2500|$|The Astros won the National League Division Series {{against the}} Atlanta Braves, 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players {{used by a}} single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6–5. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus, hit a game tying home run that allowed the game to {{continue}} in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> that. Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke, hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7–6. Oddly enough, a fan in the [...] "Crawford Boxes" [...] in left field had previously caught Berkman's grand slam and this same fan caught Burke's home run. [...] The National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 NLCS. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games, with Roy Oswalt getting the win. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to Albert Pujols, forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2–0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Current honorary NL President William Y. Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy. Warren Giles, William's father and President of the National League from [...] to , had awarded an MLB franchise to the city of Houston in 1960.|$|E
