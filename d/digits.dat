5|$|As {{in other}} mammals, and unlike in birds, the radius {{is the main}} {{component}} of the forearm. Bats have five elongated <b>digits,</b> which all radiate around the wrist. The thumb points forward and supports the leading edge, and the other <b>digits</b> support the tension held in the wing membrane. The second and third <b>digits</b> go along the wing tip, allowing the wing to be pulled forward against a strong drag force, without having to be thick like they were in pterosaur wings. The fourth and fifth <b>digits</b> go from the wrist to the trailing edge, and repel the bending force caused by air pushing up against the stiff membrane. Due to their flexible joints, bats are more manoeuvrable and more dextrous than gliding mammals.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{hypothesis}} of LDR is in contradiction to some embryological studies on birds which show that, from five developmental sites, the <b>digits</b> that develop are the three middle <b>digits</b> (II, III, IV). This inconsistency has {{been a matter of}} debate for almost 200 years, and has been used by Alan Feduccia to support the controversial hypothesis that birds are descended not from theropods but from some other group of archosaurs which had lost the first and fifth <b>digits.</b> To explain the discrepancy between morphological and embryological data in the context of bird origins, an alternative scenario to LDR was developed by Tony Thulborn and Tim Hamley in 1982. In this scenario, the <b>digits</b> I and V of theropods were reduced in the process of Bilateral Digit Reduction (BDR), with the remaining <b>digits</b> developing to resemble the former <b>digits</b> I-III. Limusaurus was initially considered as evidence for the BDR hypothesis due to it - and other ceratosaurians - having a reduced first digit, with researchers hypothesizing that a similar pattern of reduction occurred among the tetanurans (the sister group of the ceratosaurians).|$|E

40|$|<b>Digit</b> {{comparison}} is {{strongly related to}} individual differences in children’s arithmetic ability. Why {{this is the case}} however, remains unclear to date. Therefore, we investigated the relative contribution of three possible cognitive mechanisms in first and second graders’ <b>digit</b> comparison performance: <b>digit</b> identification, digit-number word matching and <b>digit</b> ordering ability. Furthermore, we examined whether these components could account for the well-established relation between <b>digit</b> comparison performance and arithmetic. As expected, all candidate predictors were related to <b>digit</b> comparison in both age groups. Moreover, in first graders, <b>digit</b> ordering and in second graders both <b>digit</b> identification as well as <b>digit</b> ordering explained unique variance in <b>digit</b> comparison performance. However, when entering these unique predictors of <b>digit</b> comparison into a mediation model with <b>digit</b> comparison as predictor and arithmetic as outcome, we observed that whereas in second graders, <b>digit</b> ordering was a full mediator, in first graders this was not the case. For them, the reverse was true and <b>digit</b> comparison fully mediated the relation between <b>digit</b> ordering and arithmetic. These results suggest that between first and second grade, there is a shift in the predictive value for arithmetic from cardinal processing and procedural knowledge to ordinal processing and retrieving declarative knowledge from memory; a process which is possibly due to a change in arithmetic strategies at that age. status: accepte...|$|R

On hybrids, the three <b>digits</b> refer to the combined gasoline-electric output. For certain models, a lower case letter placed after the alphanumeric designation indicates powerplant type ('h' for hybrid, 'd' for diesel, 't' for turbocharged), while capital letter(s) placed at the end indicates a class subtype (e.g. 'L' for long-wheelbase, 'C' for coupe, 'AWD' for all-wheel drive).
