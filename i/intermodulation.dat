25|$|A linear {{amplifier}} responds to different frequency components independently, {{and does not}} generate harmonic distortion or <b>intermodulation</b> distortion. No amplifier can provide perfect linearity (even the most {{linear amplifier}} has some nonlinearities, since the amplifying devices—transistors or vacuum tubes—follow nonlinear power laws such as square-laws and rely on circuitry techniques to reduce those effects).|$|E
25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that <b>intermodulation</b> distortion is not present in the live audio and so it represents an artificial coloration to the live sound. One advantage of higher sampling rates {{is that they can}} relax the low-pass filter design requirements for ADCs and DACs, but with modern oversampling sigma-delta converters this advantage is less important.|$|E
25|$|Automatic {{gain control}} {{circuits}} require an amplifier's gain {{be controlled by}} the time-averaged amplitude so that the output amplitude varies little when weak stations are being received. The non-linearities are assumed arranged so the relatively small signal amplitude suffers from little distortion (cross-channel interference or <b>intermodulation)</b> yet is still modulated by the relatively large gain-control DC voltage.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, {{it may be}} {{desirable}} to maintain some degree of compatibility with simple AM receivers, while still reducing the signal's bandwidth. This {{can be accomplished by}} transmitting single-sideband with a normal or slightly reduced carrier. This mode is called compatible (or full-carrier) SSB or amplitude modulation equivalent (AME). In typical AME systems, harmonic distortion can reach 25%, and <b>intermodulation</b> distortion can be much higher than normal, but minimizing distortion in receivers with envelope detectors is generally considered less important than allowing them to produce intelligible audio.|$|E
25|$|The {{signal is}} then fed into a circuit {{where it is}} mixed with a sine wave from a {{variable}} frequency oscillator known as the local oscillator (LO). The mixer uses a non-linear component to produce both sum and difference beat frequencies signals, each one containing the modulation contained in the desired signal. The output of the mixer may include the original RF signal at fRF, the local oscillator signal at fLO, and the two new heterodyne frequencies fRF+fLO and fRFfLO. The mixer may inadvertently produce additional frequencies such as third- and higher-order <b>intermodulation</b> products. Ideally, the IF bandpass filter removes all but the desired IF signal at fIF. The IF signal contains the original modulation (transmitted information) that the received radio signal had at fRF.|$|E
25|$|Examples {{of typical}} {{measurements}} are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under {{one or more}} conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); harmonic and <b>intermodulation</b> distortion vs. sound pressure level (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in decibels (dBspl).|$|E
500|$|The {{amplifier}} {{has what}} the manufacturer calls a [...] "dual-mode power supply", where the output stage is only loosely regulated, {{so it is}} free to supply the high voltages needed for musical transients and the large currents at lower voltages needed for driving low-impedance loads in the power amplifier circuitry. The design also incorporates a separate regulated power supply circuit, fed from a secondary winding on the transformer, dedicated to the pre-amplifier and tone control stages. It is thus claimed that <b>intermodulation</b> distortion and blurring of the stereo image due to power supply functioning cannot occur.|$|E

2500|$|There {{has been}} an {{industry}} trend towards sampling rates well beyond the basic requirements: such as 96kHz and even 192kHz This is in contrast with laboratory experiments, which have failed to show that ultrasonic frequencies are audible to human observers; however in some cases ultrasonic sounds do interact with and modulate the audible part of the frequency spectrum (<b>intermodulation</b> distortion).|$|E
2500|$|Other {{highlights}} {{from this period}} include [...] "Solo – In Memory of His Father" [...] from Bill Evans at Town Hall (1966), which also introduced [...] "Turn Out the Stars"; a second pairing with guitarist Jim Hall, <b>Intermodulation</b> (1966); and the solo album Alone (1968, featuring a 14-minute version of [...] "Never Let Me Go"), that won his third Grammy award.|$|E
2500|$|... "There are no Doppelgangers" [...] is a {{fundamental}} theorem, edict or clause of cybernetics due to Pask {{in support of his}} theories of learning and interaction in all media: Conversation Theory and Interactions of Actors Theory. It accounts for physical [...] and is Pask's exclusion principle. It states no two products of concurrent interaction can be the same because of their different dynamic contexts and perspectives. No Doppelgangers is necessary to account for the production by interaction and <b>intermodulation</b> (c.f. beats) of different, evolving, persisting and coherent forms. Two proofs are presented both due to Pask.|$|E
2500|$|The inner ear, for example, does {{significant}} {{signal processing}} in converting sound waveforms into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible. [...] Data compression techniques, such as MP3, {{make use of}} this fact. In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called loudness. Telephone networks and audio noise reduction systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback. [...] Another effect of the ear's nonlinear response is that sounds that are close in frequency produce phantom beat notes, or <b>intermodulation</b> distortion products.|$|E

50|$|In radio applications, <b>intermodulation</b> may be {{measured}} as adjacent channel power ratio. Hard to test are <b>intermodulation</b> signals in the GHz-range generated from passive devices (PIM: passive <b>intermodulation).</b> Manufacturers of these scalar PIM-instruments are Summitek and Rosenberger.

50|$|<b>Intermodulation</b> (IM) or <b>intermodulation</b> {{distortion}} (IMD) is the {{amplitude modulation}} of signals containing {{two or more}} different frequencies, caused by nonlinearities in a system. The <b>intermodulation</b> between each frequency component will form additional signals at frequencies that are not just at harmonic frequencies (integer multiples) of either, like harmonic distortion, but also at the sum and difference frequencies of the original frequencies and at multiples of those sum and difference frequencies.|$|E

50|$|The <b>intermodulation</b> {{intercept}} {{point is a}} measure of an electrical device's linearity. When driven by two sinusoidal waveforms, it is theoretical power level at which the power of the desired tone and the nth-order (where n is odd) <b>intermodulation</b> product intersect.|$|E
5000|$|It {{had higher}} {{inherent}} <b>intermodulation</b> distortion than the pentode. It {{could be reduced}} by adopting an ultra-linear design in a push-pull circuit. This connection links the screen grids to taps on the output transformer. Negative feedback also reduced harmonic and <b>intermodulation</b> distortion.|$|E
5000|$|Clipping is a {{non-linear}} {{process that}} produces frequencies not originally {{present in the}} audio signal. These frequencies can be harmonic overtones, meaning they are whole number multiples {{of one of the}} signal's original frequencies, or [...] "inharmonic", resulting from general <b>intermodulation</b> distortion. [...] The same nonlinear device will produce both types of distortion, depending on the input signal. <b>Intermodulation</b> occurs whenever the input frequencies are not already harmonically related. For instance, playing a power chord through distortion results in <b>intermodulation</b> that produces new subharmonics.|$|E

The higher the signal amplitudes, the more pronounced the effect of the nonlinearities, and the more prominent the <b>intermodulation</b> that occurs — even though upon initial inspection, the system would appear to be linear and unable to generate <b>intermodulation.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Slew-induced {{distortion}} (SID) {{can produce}} <b>intermodulation</b> distortion (IMD) {{when the first}} signal is slewing (changing voltage) at the limit of the amplifier's power bandwidth product.
