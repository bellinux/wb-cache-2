5|$|Block I (RS-25B) – First flown on STS-70, the Block I engines offered {{improved}} turbopumps featuring ceramic bearings, {{half as many}} {{rotating parts}} and a new casting process {{reducing the number of}} welds. Block I improvements also included a new, two-duct powerhead (rather than the original design, which featured three ducts connected to the HPFTP and two to the HPOTP), which helped improve hot <b>gas</b> <b>flow,</b> and an improved engine heat exchanger.|$|E
5|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{cylinder}} valve or pillar valve is to control <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> {{to and from the}} pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic dip tube or valve snorkel screwed {{into the bottom of the}} valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first grit blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded grit. These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

5|$|The size of {{the welding}} torch nozzle depends {{on the amount of}} {{shielded}} area desired. The {{size of the}} gas nozzle depends upon the diameter of the electrode, the joint configuration, and the availability of access to the joint by the welder. The inside diameter of the nozzle is preferably at least three times the diameter of the electrode, but there are no hard rules. The welder judges the effectiveness of the shielding and increases the nozzle size to increase the area protected by the external gas shield as needed. The nozzle must be heat resistant and thus is normally made of alumina or a ceramic material, but fused quartz, a high purity glass, offers greater visibility. Devices can be inserted into the nozzle for special applications, such as gas lenses or valves to improve the control shielding <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> to reduce turbulence and introduction of contaminated atmosphere into the shielded area. Hand switches to control welding current can be added to the manual GTAW torches.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{increasing}} dry solids concentration {{has had a}} significant effect on the main operating variables. The steam flow increases with increasing black liquor dry solids content. Increasing closure of the pulp mill means that less heat per unit of black liquor dry solids will be available in the furnace. The flue gas heat loss will decrease as the flue <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> diminishes. Increasing black liquor dry solids is especially helpful since the recovery boiler capacity is often limited by the flue <b>gas</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{check valve}} lets <b>gas</b> <b>flow</b> in one {{direction}} only. It is usually a chamber containing a ball that is pressed against one end by a spring. <b>Gas</b> <b>flow</b> one way pushes {{the ball out of}} the way, and a lack of flow or a reverse flow allows the spring to push the ball into the inlet, blocking it. Not to be confused with a flashback arrestor, a check valve is not designed to block a shock wave. The shock wave could occur while the ball is so far from the inlet that the wave will get past the ball before it can reach its off position.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{study of}} continuum-rarefied <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> is of considerable interest {{because it can}} provide fundamental knowledge regarding flow physics. Recently, the nonlinear coupled constitutive method (NCCM) has been derived from the Boltzmann equation and implemented to investigate continuum-rarefied <b>gas</b> <b>flows.</b> In this study, we first report the important and detailed issues {{in the use of}} the H theorem and positive entropy generation in the NCCM. Importantly, the unified nonlinear dissipation model and its relationships to the Rayleigh–Onsager function were demonstrated in the treatment of the collision term of the Boltzmann equation. In addition, we compare the Grad moment method, the Burnett equation, and the NCCM. Next, differences between the NCCM equations and the Navier–Stokes equations are explained in detail. For validation, numerical studies of rarefied and continuum <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> were conducted. These studies include rarefied and/or continuum <b>gas</b> <b>flows</b> around a two-dimensional (2 D) cavity, a 2 D airfoil, a 2 D cylinder, and a three-dimensional space shuttle. It was observed that the present results of the NCCM are in good agreement with those of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method in rarefied cases and are in good agreement with those of the Navier–Stokes equations in continuum cases. Finally, this study can be regarded as a theoretical basis of the NCCM for the development of a unified framework for solving continuum-rarefied <b>gas</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R
