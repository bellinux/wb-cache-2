In 1586, Joachim Camerarius provided descriptions of the three basic modern lettuces– <b>head</b> <b>lettuce,</b> loose-leaf lettuce, and romaine (or cos) lettuce. Lettuce was first brought to the Americas from Europe by Christopher Columbus in the late 15th century.

5000|$|Agriculture in the San Luis Valley is {{generally}} concentrated around the Colorado towns of Monte Vista and Center. Principal crops include potatoes, <b>head</b> <b>lettuce</b> and barley.

5000|$|The main crops of {{the area}} are {{vegetables}} which reflect each wave of immigration into Canada, and have traditionally been grown by immigrants for ethnic markets in the Greater Toronto Area and for export. The agricultural plots were originally divided into 5 acre [...] "market garden" [...] family farms, and produce was taken to local markets. In the 1920s the main crops reflected eastern and western European tastes - yellow onions, potatoes, carrots, <b>head</b> <b>lettuce,</b> radish, etc. From the 1950s to the 1980s, Italian greens started to be grown, for example dandelion, escarole, and endive. Demand for Asian greens, such as bok choy, began in the 1990s. With the opening of Highway 400 in the 1950s, farmers quickly gained access to the Ontario Food Terminal in Toronto, vastly expanding their market. Yonge Street and the CN rail (Toronto - Barrie) are situated to the northeast. When the federal government relaxed food import rules in the 1990s and grocery stores consolidated to form large chains across Canada, small family farms growing diverse crops were, for the most part, no longer financially feasible, but a few small family farms still survive. Corporate farms that had bought land in the 1950s sold their plots and a few family farms consolidated, growing mostly onions and carrots for grocery stores, export and food processing companies. Recently the Greenbelt family farmers market introduced by the Ontario government has helped some small family farms.|$|E

50|$|The larvae feed on {{the foliage}} and fruits of plants, and can {{completely}} defoliate small ones. Smaller larvae devour the parenchyma of leaves, so all that remains is the thin epidermis and veins. Larger larvae tend to burrow holes through thick areas of plants. For example, they burrow straight into a <b>head</b> of <b>lettuce</b> rather than neatly removing tissue from one particular leaf. This renders the produce unmarketable. They attack buds and new growth on plants, preventing flowers from opening, new leaves from sprouting, and vegetables from developing.
