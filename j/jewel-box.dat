"Oh, indeed?--ah," [...] said Mr Hazlit, {{drawing out}} a large silk {{handkerchief}} with a flourish, blowing his nose therewith, and casting it carelessly on the table so as to cover the <b>jewel-box.</b> [...] "Well, as you are now ere, pray {{what have you got}} to say to me?" ...|$|E
60|$|Daisy did not, {{but when}} she went to bed, set the <b>jewel-box</b> on the table where it would meet her eyes the first thing in the morning, and then fell asleep trying to decide that she would buy no baubles, since there were better things to spend her money on.|$|E
60|$|Her {{head was}} quite turned by this {{desire for the}} cheap {{trinkets}} which attract all feminine eyes now-a-days, and when, among the pretty things that came {{to her from the}} Christmas tree that night, she received a blue plush <b>jewel-box,</b> she felt that it was almost a duty to fill it as soon as possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "You shall know. We won't forget you, my dear," [...] {{and with}} a caressing touch on the smiling yet wistful face upturned to hers, Mrs. Vaughn went away to pack the empty <b>jewel-box,</b> leaving Daisy to drop a few irrepressible tears on the new gown, over the {{downfall}} of her summer hopes, and the longings all girls feel for that enchanted world that lies beyond the sea.|$|E
60|$|Spike {{had given}} him minute {{directions}} as {{to the position of}} the <b>jewel-box.</b> He found it without difficulty. To his untrained eye, it seemed tolerably massive and impregnable, but Spike had evidently known how to open it without much difficulty. The lid was shut, but it came up without an effort when he tried to raise it, and he saw that the lock had been broken.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the first}} raptures were over, out came the cloak; and Daisy was well repaid for her little trials and sacrifices {{when she was}} folded in it as her mother held her close, and thanked her as mothers only can.

60|$|After {{making an}} {{examination}} of the body, he examined the room with the constable, and found that a <b>jewel-box</b> on the table was open and its contents gone. The watch and chain of the deceased had also disappeared. He looked out of the window, and saw that it could be entered by an active man by climbing up a thick stem of ivy that grew close by. He observed several leaves lying on the ground, and was of the opinion that the assassin entered there.|$|E

60|$|The {{manuscript}} lay {{almost finished}} {{at the bottom}} of his trunk. It could not easily have been stolen for one hour without his knowing. Just when he was about to start on a walk with one of the ladies, he would run upstairs {{to make sure that it}} was still there; he made sure by feeling, and would turn again at the door to make sure by looking.

6000|$|... "I shouldn't {{feel ashamed}} if Mrs. Vaughn found {{me out in}} this, but I should never dare to let her see my bangles and pins, if I got them.

But then, my <b>jewel-box!</b> All empty, and such a pretty thing. Oh dear, I wish I could be wise and silly at the same time." ...|$|E

"This is {{certainly}} a very beautiful handkerchief," [...] observed the mother, after examining me carefully, and with somewhat of {{the manner of a}} connoisseur, [...] "surprisingly beautiful; and yet I almost wish, my child, you had not purchased it. A hundred dollars sounds frightfully en prince for us poor simple people, who live in nutshells of houses, five and twenty feet front, and fifty-six deep, to pay for a pocket-handkerchief. The <b>jewel-box</b> of a young lady who has such handkerchiefs ought to cost thousands, to be in keeping." ...|$|E
60|$|Job Harpur {{was then}} called. He testified to {{entering}} the bedroom {{of the deceased}} with Dr. Arrowsmith, and to the examination he had made of it. There {{he had found the}} <b>jewel-box</b> opened, its contents abstracted, and the watch gone. He could find nothing else disarranged in the room, or any trace whatever that would give a clue as to the identity of the murderer. He then looked out of the window with Dr. Arrowsmith, and saw by a few leaves lying on the ground, and by marks upon the bark of the ivy, that some one had got up or down.|$|E

"I {{shall not}} be safe till I spend that money, so I might as well decide on {{something}} and be at peace," [...] said poor Daisy, after some days of this girlish struggle; [...] "I needn't buy anything for mother and Janey, for I can share my nice and useful presents with them; but I should {{like to be able}} to show the girls my lovely <b>jewel-box</b> with something pretty in it, and I will! Laura needn't know anything about it, for I'm sure she'd think it silly, and so would her mother. I'll slip in now and buy that rose; it's only three dollars, and the other two will get one porte-bonheur, or the dear butterfly." ...|$|E
6000|$|The thankful but disgusted Ginseng {{continued}} her emigration, but soon missed the <b>jewel-box,</b> which in their alarm {{had been dropped}} and burst asunder. She did not much care for the jewels, but it contained some valuable papers, among them the [...] "Examiner" [...] (a print which once had the misfortune to condemn a book written {{by the author of}} this tale) and this she doted on. Returning for her property, she peered cautiously around the angle of a rock, and saw a spectacle that begot in her mind a languid interest. The bear had returned upon a similar mission; he was calmly distending his cheeks with the contents of the broken box. And perched on a rock near at hand sat Juniper waiting for him! ...|$|E
60|$|It was now {{necessary}} to determine what course we ought next to pursue. It might appear presuming in men of our pursuits {{to go to the}} Nest before the appointed time; and did we proceed on to the village, we should have the distance between the two places to walk over twice, carrying our instruments and <b>jewel-box.</b> After a short consultation, it was decided to visit the nearest dwellings, and to remain as near my own house as was practicable, making an arrangement to sleep somewhere in its immediate vicinity. Could we trust any one with our secret, our fare would probably be all the better; but my uncle thought it most prudent to maintain a strict incognito until he had ascertained the true state of things in the town.|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{has been}} dead hours," [...] {{he said to the}} constable, [...] "six or seven hours, I should say. Let us look round. The window is open, you see. Can the murderer have entered there?" [...] He looked out. The wall was covered with ivy, and a massive stem grew close to the window. [...] "Yes," [...] he went on, [...] "an active man could have climbed that. See, there are some leaves on the ground. I think, Harpur, your best plan will be to go down and take your station there and see no one comes along or {{disturbs}} anything. See, this <b>jewel-box</b> on the table has been broken open and the contents are gone, and I do not see her watch anywhere. Well, that is enough to do at present; we will lock this room up again until Mr. Volkes comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, by Mr Berrington," [...] {{continued}} Aileen, [...] "ever since that, papa {{has been}} very hopeful. I don't know exactly what his mind runs on, but I can see that he is making heaps of plans {{in regard to the}} future, and oh! You can't think how glad and how thankful I am for the change. The state of dull, heartbreaking, weary depression that he fell into just after getting the news of our failure was beginning to undermine his health. I could see that plainly, and felt quite wretched about him. But now he is comparatively cheerful, and so gentle too. Do you know, I have been thinking a good deal lately of the psalmist's saying, `it is good for me that I have been afflicted;' and, in the midst of it all, our Heavenly Father remembered mercy, for it was He who sent our <b>jewel-box,</b> as if to prevent the burden from being too heavy for papa." ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{secret was}} put {{away in the}} empty <b>jewel-box,</b> and the cloak hidden in Daisy's trunk; for she felt shy of telling her little {{business}} transactions, lest the Vaughns should consider her extravagant. But the thought of mother's surprise and pleasure warmed her heart, and made {{the last days of}} her visit the happiest. Being a mortal girl she did give a sigh as she tied a bit of black velvet round her white throat, instead of the necklace, which seemed really a treasure, now it was gone; and she looked with great disfavor at the shabby little pin, worn where she had fondly hoped to see the golden rose. She put a real one in its place, and never knew that her own fresh, happy face was as lovely; for the thought of the two mothers made comfortable by her was better than all the pearls and diamonds that fell from the lips of the good girl in the fairy tale.|$|E
6000|$|While I was {{dressing}} a small parcel {{was brought}} up, {{which had been}} left at the door for me. It contained a note and a small <b>jewel-box.</b> The note was from Messrs. Hunt and Roskell, saying, [...] "That they had received orders from Mr. Harmer, of Canterbury, to send me a cross, the choice {{of which he had}} left with them, and a small chain to suspend it round my neck. That they trusted the jewel would give me satisfaction; but that, if I wished, they would exchange it for any other in their shop, if I would favour them with a call." [...] The contents of the case were a small cross, composed entirely of very large diamonds, of the value of which I had no idea, but which looked very lovely, and a small chain to hang it round my neck. I said nothing to Ada, although the door was open, as I wished to surprise her.|$|E
60|$|One or {{two large}} cases he discovered, and forced them open with the crowbar, which Maxwell had dropped {{when he was}} struck insensible, but they {{contained}} nothing worth the labour of having them hoisted up. At last {{he was about to}} leave, after a careful search of more than an hour, when he espied something shining in a corner of what had once been the pirate-chief's cabin. He took it up and found it to be a small box of unusual weight for its size. His sense of touch told him that it was ornamented with carving on its surface, but the light was not sufficient to enable him to see it distinctly. His heart beat hopefully, however, as he hastened as fast as the water would permit out of the cabin, and then, to his joy he found that it was Aileen Hazlit's <b>jewel-box!</b> How it came there he could not guess; but the reader partly knows the truth, and can easily imagine that when the pirate-chief sent his other valuables to the swift prow, as before mentioned, he kept this--the most precious of them all--close to his own person to the last, desiring, no doubt, to have it always under his own eye.|$|E
6000|$|By the end {{of about}} three weeks we had got {{together}} a concoction that, so far as dialogue and characters were concerned, might {{be said to be}} our own. There was good work in it, here and there. Under other conditions I might have been proud of much that I had written. As it was, I experienced only the terror of the thief dodging the constable: my cleverness might save me; it afforded me no further satisfaction. My humour, when I heard the people laughing at it, I remembered I had forged listening in vague fear to every creak upon the stairs, wondering in what form discovery might come upon me. There was one speech, addressed by the hero to the villain: [...] "Yes, I admit it; I do love her. But there is that which I love better--my self-respect!" [...] Stepping down to the footlights and slapping his chest (which according to stage convention would appear to be a sort of moral <b>jewel-box</b> bursting with assorted virtues), our juvenile lead--a gentleman who led a somewhat rabbit-like existence, perpetually diving down openings to avoid service of writs, at the instance of his wife, for alimony--would invariably bring down the house upon this sentiment. Every night, listening to the applause, I would shudder, recalling how I had written it with burning cheeks.|$|E
6000|$|Is {{conscious}} guilt {{a source}} of unmixed pain to the bosom which harbors it? Has not your criminal, on the contrary, an excitement, an enjoyment within quite unknown to you and me who never did anything wrong in our lives? The housebreaker must snatch a fearful joy as he walks unchallenged by the policeman with his sack full of spoons and tankards. Do not cracksmen, when assembled together, entertain themselves with stories of glorious old burglaries which they or bygone heroes have committed? But that my age is mature and my habits formed, I should really just like to try a little criminality. Fancy passing a forged bill to your banker; calling on a friend and sweeping his sideboard of plate, his hall of umbrellas and coats; and then going home to dress for dinner, say--and to meet a bishop, a judge, and a police magistrate or so, and talk more morally than any man at table! How I should chuckle (as my host's spoons clinked softly in my pocket) whilst I was uttering some noble speech about virtue, duty, charity! I wonder do we meet garroters in society? In an average tea-party, now, how many returned convicts are there? Does John Footman, when he asks permission to go and spend the evening with some friends, pass his time in thuggee; waylay and strangle an old gentleman, or two; let himself into your house, with the house-key of course, and appear as usual with the shaving-water when you ring your bell in the morning? The very possibility of such a suspicion invests John with a new and romantic interest in my mind. Behind the grave politeness of his countenance I try and read the lurking treason. Full of this pleasing subject, I have been talking thief-stories with a neighbor. The neighbor tells me how some friends of hers used to keep a <b>jewel-box</b> under a bed in their room; and, going into the room, they thought they heard a noise under the bed. They {{had the courage to}} look. The cook was under the bed--under the bed with the <b>jewel-box.</b> Of course she said she had come for purposes connected with her business; but this was absurd. A cook under a bed is not there for professional purposes. A relation of mine had a box containing diamonds under her bed, which diamonds she told me were to be mine. Mine! One day, at dinner-time, between the entrees and the roast, a cab drove away from my relative's house containing the box wherein lay the diamonds. John laid the dessert, brought the coffee, waited all the evening--and oh, how frightened he was when he came to learn that his mistress's box had been conveyed out of her own room, and it contained diamonds--"Law bless us, did it now?" [...] I wonder whether John's subsequent career has been prosperous? Perhaps the gentlemen from Bow Street were all in the wrong when they agreed in suspecting John as the author of the robbery. His noble nature was hurt at the suspicion. You conceive he would not like to remain in a family where they were mean enough to suspect him of stealing a <b>jewel-box</b> out of a bedroom--and the injured man and my relatives soon parted. But, inclining (with my usual cynicism) to think that he did steal the valuables, think of his life for the month or two whilst he still remains in the service! He shows the officers over the house, agrees with them that the coup must have been made by persons familiar with it; gives them every assistance; pities his master and mistress with a manly compassion; points out what a cruel misfortune it is to himself as an honest man, with his living to get and his family to provide for, that this suspicion should fall on him. Finally he takes leave of his place, with a deep, though natural melancholy that ever he had accepted it. What's a thousand pounds to gentle-folks! A loss, certainly, but they will live as well without the diamonds as with them. But to John his Hhhonor was worth more than diamonds, his Hhonor was. Whohever is to give him back his character? Who is to prevent hany one from saying, [...] "Ho yes. This is the footman which was in the family where the diamonds was stole?" [...] &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was all-important. When a woman {{thinks that}} her house is on fire, her {{instinct}} {{is at once}} to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In {{the case of the}} Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her <b>jewel-box.</b> Now {{it was clear to me}} that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all." ...|$|E
60|$|We passed {{round the}} cathedral, and saw jackdaws {{fluttering}} round the pinnacles, while the bells chimed the quarters, and little children {{played on the}} steps under the grand arch of the entrance. It is very stately, very beautiful, this minster; and doubtless would be very satisfactory, could I only know it long and well enough,--so rich as its front is, even with almost all the niches empty of their statues; not stern in its effect, which I suppose must be owing to the elaborate detail with which its great surface is wrought all over, like the chasing of a lady's <b>jewel-box,</b> and yet so grand! There is a dwelling-house on one side, gray with antiquity, which has apparently grown out of it like an excrescence; and though a good-sized edifice, yet the cathedral is so large that its vastness {{is not in the}} least deformed by it. If it be a dwelling-house, I suppose it is inhabited by the person who takes care of the cathedral. This morning, while listening to the tedious chanting and lukewarm sermon, I depreciated the whole affair, cathedral and all; but now I do more justice, at least to the latter, and am only sorry that its noble echoes must follow at every syllable, and re-reverberate at the commas and semicolons, such poor discourses as the canon's. But, after all, it was the Puritans who made the sermon of such importance in religious worship as we New-Englanders now consider it; and we are absurd in considering this magnificent church and all those embroidered ceremonies only in reference to it.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Palliser was {{of opinion}} that the attempt to search the lady's house was iniquitous. Mr. Bonteen shook his head, and rather thought that, if he were Home Secretary, {{he would have had}} the search made. Lady Chiltern said that if policemen came to her, they might search {{everything}} she had in the world. Mrs. Grey reminded them that all they really knew of the unfortunate woman was, that her <b>jewel-box</b> had been stolen out of her bedroom at her hotel. Madame Goesler was of opinion that a lady who could carry such a box about the country with her deserved to have it stolen. Lord Fawn felt himself obliged to confess that he agreed altogether with Madame Goesler. Unfortunately, he had been acquainted with the lady, and now was constrained to say that her conduct had been such as to justify the suspicions of the police. [...] "Of course, we all suspect her," [...] said Lady Glencora; [...] "and, of course, we suspect Lord George too, and Mrs. Carbuncle and Miss Roanoke. But then, you know, if I were to lose my diamonds, people would suspect me just the same,--or perhaps Plantagenet. It is so delightful to think that a woman has stolen her own property, and put all the police into a state of ferment." [...] Lord Chiltern declared himself to be heartily sick of the whole subject; and Mr. Grey, who was a very just man, suggested that the evidence, as yet, against anybody, was very slight. [...] "Of course, it's slight," [...] said Lady Glencora. [...] "If it were more than slight, it would be just like any other robbery, and there would be nothing in it." [...] On the same morning Mrs. Bonteen received a second letter from her friend Mrs. Rutter. The Tewett marriage had been certainly broken off. Sir Griffin had been very violent, misbehaving himself grossly in Mrs. Carbuncle's house, and Miss Roanoke had declared that under no circumstances would she ever speak to him again. It was Mrs. Rutter's opinion, however, that this violence had been [...] "put on" [...] by Sir Griffin, who was desirous of escaping from the marriage because of the affair of the diamonds. [...] "He's very much bound up with Lord George," [...] said Mrs. Rutter, [...] "and is afraid that he may be implicated." ...|$|E
60|$|The entrance-way to {{the house}} is {{somewhat}} altered since my last visit; and we now, following {{the direction of a}} painted finger on the wall, went round to a side door in the basement story, where we found an elderly man waiting as if in expectation of visitors. He asked us to write our names in a book, and told us that the desk on the leaf of which it lay was the one in which Sir Walter found the forgotten manuscript of Waverley, while looking for some fishing-tackle. There was another desk in the room, which had belonged to the Colonel Gardiner who appears in Waverley. The first apartment into which our guide showed us was Sir Walter's study, where I again saw his clothes, and remarked how the sleeve of his old green coat was worn at the cuff,--a minute circumstance that seemed to bring Sir Walter very near me. Thence into the library; thence into the drawing-room, whence, methinks, we should have entered the dining-room, the most interesting of all, as being the room where he died. But this room seems not to be shown now. We saw the armory, with the gun of Rob Roy, into the muzzle of which I put my finger, and found the bore very large; the beautifully wrought pistol of Claverhouse, and a pair of pistols that belonged to Napoleon; the sword of Montrose, which I grasped, and drew half out of the scabbard; and Queen Mary's iron <b>jewel-box,</b> six or eight inches long, and two or three high, with a lid rounded like that of a trunk, and much corroded with rust. There is no use in making a catalogue of these curiosities. The feeling in visiting Abbotsford is not that of awe; it is little more than going to a museum. I do abhor this mode of making pilgrimages to the shrines of departed great men. There is certainly something wrong in it, for it seldom or never produces (in me, at least) the right feeling. It is an odd truth, too, that a house is forever after spoiled and ruined as a home, by having been the abode of a great man. His spirit haunts it, as it were, with a malevolent effect, and takes hearth and hall away from the nominal possessors, giving all the world the right to enter there because he had such intimate relations with all the world.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the company}} {{assembled}} at Baden, Clive found {{one or two}} old acquaintances; among them his friend of Paris, M. de Florac, not in quite so brilliant a condition as when Newcome had last met him on the Boulevard. Florac owned that Fortune had been very unkind to him at Baden; and, indeed, she had not only emptied his purse, but his portmanteaus, <b>jewel-box,</b> and linen-closet--the contents of all of which had ranged themselves on the red and black against Monsieur Benazet's crown-pieces: whatever side they took was, however, the unlucky one. [...] "This campaign has been my Moscow, mon cher," [...] Florac owned to Clive. [...] "I am conquered by Benazet; I have lost in almost every combat. I have lost my treasure, my baggage, my ammunition of war, everything but my honour, which, au reste, Mons. Benazet will not accept as a stake; if he would, there are plenty here, believe me, who would {{set it on the}} trente-et-quarante. Sometimes I have had a mind to go home; my mother, who is an angel all forgiveness, would receive her prodigal, and kill the fatted veal for me. But what will you? He annoys me--the domestic veal. Besides, my brother the Abbe, though the best of Christians, is a Jew upon certain matters; a Benazet who will not troquer absolution except against repentance; and I have not for a sou of repentance in my pocket! I have been sorry, yes--but it was because odd came up in place of even, or the reverse. The accursed apres has chased me like a remorse, and when black has come up I have wished myself converted to red. Otherwise I have no repentance--I am joueur--nature has made me so, as she made my brother devot. The Archbishop of Strasbourg is of our parents; I saw his grandeur when I went lately to Strasbourg, on my last pilgrimage to the Mont de Piete. I owned to him that I would pawn his cross and ring to go play: the good prelate laughed, and said his chaplain should keep an eye on them. Will you dine with me? The landlord of my hotel was the intendant of our cousin, the Duc d'Ivry, and will give me credit to the day of judgment. I do not abuse his noble confidence. My dear! there are covers of silver put upon my table every day with which I could retrieve my fortune, did I listen to the suggestions of Satanas; but I say to him, Vade retro. Come and dine with me--Duluc's kitchen is very good." ...|$|E
60|$|When we left Lady Eustace {{alone in}} her bedroom at the Carlisle hotel after the {{discovery}} of the robbery, she had very many cares upon her mind. The necklace was, indeed, safe under her pillow in the bed; but when all the people were around her,--her own friends, and the police, and they who were concerned with the inn,--she had not told them that it was so, but had allowed them to leave her with the belief that the diamonds had gone with the box. Even at this moment, as she knew well, steps were being taken to discover the thieves, and to make public the circumstances of the robbery. Already, no doubt, the fact that her chamber had been entered in the night, and her <b>jewel-box</b> withdrawn, was known to the London police officers. In such circumstances how could she now tell the truth? But it might be that already had the thieves been taken. In that case would not the truth be known, even though she should not tell it? Then she thought for a while that she would get rid of the diamonds altogether, so that no one should know aught of them. If she could only think of a place fit for such purpose she would so hide them that no human ingenuity could discover them. Let the thieves say what they might, her word would, in such case, be better than that of the thieves. She would declare that the jewels had been in the box when the box was taken. The thieves would swear that the box had been empty. She would appeal to the absence of the diamonds, and the thieves,--who would be known as thieves,--would be supposed, even by their own friends and associates, to have disposed of the diamonds before they had been taken. There would be a mystery in all this, and a cunning cleverness, the idea of which had in itself a certain charm for Lizzie Eustace. She would have all the world at a loss. Mr. Camperdown could do nothing further to harass her; and would have been, so far, overcome. She would be saved from the feeling of public defeat in the affair of the necklace, which would be very dreadful to her. Lord Fawn might probably be again at her feet. And in all the fuss and rumour which such an affair would make in London, there would be nothing of which she need be ashamed. She liked the idea, and she had grown to be very sick of the necklace.|$|E
60|$|Lady Linlithgow saw {{the jewels}} come back, one by one, ring added to {{ring on the}} little taper fingers, the rubies for the neck, and the pendent yellow earrings. Though Lizzie was in {{mourning}} for her father, still these things were allowed to be visible. The countess was not the woman to see them without inquiry, and she inquired vigorously. She threatened, stormed, and protested. She attempted even a raid upon the young lady's <b>jewel-box.</b> But she was not successful. Lizzie snapped and snarled and held her own,--for {{at that time the}} match with Sir Florian was near its accomplishment, and the countess understood too well the value of such a disposition of her niece to risk it at the moment by any open rupture. The little house in Brook Street,--for the house was very small and very comfortless,--a house that had been squeezed in, as it were, between two others without any fitting space for it,--did not contain a happy family. One bedroom, and that the biggest, was appropriated to the Earl of Linlithgow, the son of the countess, a young man who passed perhaps five nights in town during the year. Other inmate there was none besides the aunt and the niece and the four servants,--of whom one was Lizzie's own maid. Why should such a countess have troubled herself with the custody of such a niece? Simply because the countess regarded it as a duty. Lady Linlithgow was worldly, stingy, ill-tempered, selfish, and mean. Lady Linlithgow would cheat a butcher out of a mutton-chop, or a cook out of a month's wages, if she could do so with some slant of legal wind in her favour. She would tell any number of lies to carry a point in what she believed to be social success. It was said of her that she cheated at cards. In back-biting, no venomous old woman between Bond Street and Park Lane could beat her,--or, more wonderful still, no venomous old man at the clubs. But nevertheless she recognised certain duties,--and performed them, though she hated them. She went to church, not merely that people might see her there,--as to which in truth she cared nothing,--but because she thought it was right. And she took in Lizzie Greystock, whom she hated almost as much as she did sermons, because the admiral's wife had been her sister, and she recognised a duty. But, having thus bound herself to Lizzie,--who was a beauty,--of course it became the first object of her life to get rid of Lizzie by a marriage. And, though she would have liked to think that Lizzie would be tormented all her days, though she thoroughly believed that Lizzie deserved to be tormented, she set her heart upon a splendid match. She would at any rate be able to throw it daily in her niece's teeth that the splendour was of her doing. Now a marriage with Sir Florian Eustace would be very splendid, and therefore she was unable to go into the matter of the jewels with that rigour which in other circumstances she would certainly have displayed.|$|E
