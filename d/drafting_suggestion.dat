40|$|<b>Draft,</b> <b>suggestions</b> are welcome) During the {{republic}} period (1912 - 1949), China suffered from numerous internal conflicts and colonial wars. Historians {{have not yet}} reached an agreement {{on the importance of}} the various conflicts due to their subjective understandings. An objective way {{is to look at the}} people’s perception of a specific conflict’s impact on the economic situation at that moment. We study the impacts of conflicts by examining the bond markets since the people’s confidence on the survivability of the shaky governments could be reflected by the fluctuations of government bond prices. We collect a novel dataset on the prices of Chinese bonds listed in domestic and foreign markets. We first identify the breaks in bond prices, and their corresponding timings and magnitudes. We then match the breaks with the historical events to identify the turning points in the Chinese civil conflicts and the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937 - 1945). Our results suggest that the reactions of domestic and foreign investors depend on the potential damage of the collaterals by the conflicts. Furthermore, we show that the Sino-Japanese conflicts have stronger long-term impacts than the civil wars on bond prices, but the short-term effects are similar. Finally, our turning points from the data match closely with those identified by historians, except the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} how the {{degrading treatment}} and storage conditions of Edvard Munch’s paintings affect the conservation process. The ”kill-and-cure” treatment {{is the term}} used when refering to the storage conditions of Edvard Munch’s paintings during his lifetime. Edvard Munch stored many of his paintings in his outdoor studios or in unsealed storage rooms. The aim for this treatment was partly to achive a matt finish by reducing the glossy effect of oil paint. The ”kill-and-cure” treatment resulted in water stains, bird droppings, seeds and tears in the canvas. The question is whether this dirt should be saved, to what extent it was intentional {{and to what extent}} the continuing degradation should be considered part of the intent. The study examines the importance of how dirt affects the paint layer and also how saving or removing it has practical issues in the conservation process. Ethics and methodology provide the conservator with helpful tools when faced with surface cleaning. Conservators at international institutions were contacted. A questionnaire was sent out to get information on how conservators treat paintings by Edvard Munch with the aspects of dirt, ethics and methodology in mind. Of the contacted institutions 27 % participated in the survey. The study shows no homogenous interpretation of Munch’s intentions with the ”kill-and-cure” treatment among the conservators participating in the survey or in the litterature.

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with the redesign of the mobile application of Huset KBH and takes its starting point in Participatory Design. We examine what the users of Huset KBH seeks in a Huset KBH mobile application. This is done for the purpose of a redesign of the current appli-cation in order to make Huset KBH accommodate the users needs. We examine the users needs through a workshop, which we construct using elements from ‘future workshop’ and ‘talking, doing and making’. The generated empirical knowledge is ana-lyzed on the basis of theories involving ‘usability’ and ‘user interfaces’. This leads us to several problematics which has to be revised on the current application as well as new functions that can be implemented with advantage. Based on the theory of ‘user interfaces’ we explore the possibilities of how to design a user interface for the application. It is our impression that a redesign of the Huset KBH mobile application is legitimate since the participants of the workshop points out problematics about their activities in Huset KBH, which the application is able to abate. In this way a redesign of the Huset KBH mobile applica-tion serves a purpose and shows that there is basis for development {{due to the fact that}} it ac-commodates the users need to make Huset KBH easily accessible. We conclude that the appli-cation is capable of assisting Huset KBH in meeting the users needs by incorporating features that helps locating Huset KBH as well as clarifying the events hosted by Huset KBH.

40|$|Generally {{accepted}} depreciation methods do not {{compute the}} intrinsic {{value of an}} asset, as they do not factor for the Time Value of Money, a key principle within financial theory. This is disadvantageous, as knowing the intrinsic value of an asset can assist with making effective purchase and sale decisions. By applying the Time Value of Money principle to deprecation and book valuation, methods can be formulated to approximate the intrinsic valuation of a depreciable asset, which improves the capacity for buyers and sellers of assets to make rational decisions. A deprecation method is formulated within, which aims to better match book value with intrinsic value. While this method makes many assumptions and thus has limitations, more complex formulas, which factor for {{a greater number of}} variables, can be created using a similar approach, to produce better approximations for intrinsic value.

When the Brown decision was handed down, a full court was present, to emphasize the unanimity of the decision. Robert H.

The analysis will focus on the website of the Azienda Sanitaria dell’Alto Adige / Südtiroler Sanitätsbetrieb, an Internet portal providing information on seven hospitals, and in particular on the texts which appear to be most directly relevant to patients. The aim of the study is to investigate the reciprocal influences between Italian and German in these texts and to determine whether the findings support the hypothesis of a specific “communicative identity” of South Tyrol in the health sector. Following Riedmann’s description (1972) of the South Tyrolean “linguistic peculiarities”, the study will mainly deal with lexical and morphosyntactic aspects; however, attention will be paid also to possible influences on the pragmatic level. The analysis will be preceded by a brief sketch of the historical background to the present situation of multilingualism in South Tyrol, {{as well as of the}} main linguistic studies concerning this area; moreover, some observations will be made on multilingual communication in the health sector and on its social relevance.
