5|$|The use of {{inclined}} elevators {{was intended}} to provide wheelchair-bound patrons with a shorter, easier path to the train platform {{as well as to}} reduce tunneling costs. The two elevators were manufactured by Maspero Elevatori, in Appiano Gentile, Italy, using a controller made on Long Island, speed governors made in Ohio, and buttons and other parts in Queens. The software <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> was written in the United States. Maspero Elevatori assembled the elevators in Italy, and they failed an operational test there, prior to being shipped to the United States. The MTA said the manufacturer chose to use American subcontractors in place of local Italian suppliers after reading the specifications the transit agency submitted. The MTA worked with the manufacturer to try to resolve the problems caused by a very high level of customization.|$|E

25|$|The real Mission Control Center {{consisted}} of two control rooms located on {{the second and third}} floors of Building 30 at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. NASA offered the use of the control room for filming, but Howard declined, opting instead to make his own replica from scratch. Production designer Michael Corenblith and set decorator Merideth Boswell were in charge of the construction of the Mission Control set at Universal Studios. The set was equipped with giant rear-screen projection capabilities and a complex set of computers with individual video feeds to all the flight controller stations. The actors playing the flight controllers were able {{to communicate with each other}} on a private audio loop. The Mission Control room built for the film was on the ground floor. One NASA employee, who was a consultant for the film, said that the set was so realistic that he would leave at the end of the day and look <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> before remembering he was not in Mission Control. By the time the film was made, the USS Iwo Jima had been scrapped, so her sister ship, the USS New Orleans, was used as the recovery ship instead.|$|E

Two minutes after that the [...] "master breaker" [...] alarm went off in the cockpit, and electrical systems throughout the plane began to fail, including power <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> trim system. This made controlling the plane's descent extremely difficult and required great physical exertion from the pilot and first officer. The PA system also failed, leaving the flight attendants unable to communicate efficiently with the passengers; nevertheless, attendants were able to instruct passengers sitting in the exit rows on how to open the doors, a practice that was not standard on commercial airline flights at the time.|$|E

2500|$|After repairs from a {{crash landing}} on 27 June 1949, the XF-89 was flown to March AFB to {{participate}} in the RKO movie Jet Pilot in February 1950. Shortly afterward, the aircraft crashed on 22 February, killing the observer, when flutter developed in the elevator and the subsequent vibrations caused the entire tail to break off. Construction of the production models was suspended until the reasons for the accident were discovered. Engineering and wind-tunnel tests revealed that the geometry of the rear fuselage and the engine exhaust created flutter-inducing turbulence that was aggravated by the high-frequency acoustic energy from the exhaust. Fixes for the problem involved the addition of a [...] "jet wake fairing" [...] at the bottom rear of the fuselage between the engines, external ("ice tong") mass balances <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> pending the design of internal mass balances, and the addition of exhaust deflectors to the fuselage to reduce the turbulence and the consequent flutter.|$|E

At 8 kilometers from the runway the aircraft entered the glide path, after which the flaps were set to 35¬∞. 16 seconds later, the crew increased the engine power to maintain a consistent speed of 260 km/h.

5000|$|An {{elevator}} with a counterbalance approximates {{an ideal}} Atwood machine and thereby relieves the driving motor from the load of holding <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> cab [...] - [...] {{it has to}} overcome only weight difference and inertia of the two masses. The same principle is used for funicular railways with two connected railway cars on inclined tracks, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> on <b>the</b> Eiffel Tower which counterbalance each other. Ski lifts are another example, where the gondolas move on a closed (continuous) pulley system {{up and down the}} mountain. The ski lift is similar to <b>the</b> counter-weighted <b>elevator,</b> but with a constraining force provided by the cable in the vertical dimension thereby achieving work in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Boat lifts [...] are another type of counter-weighted elevator system approximating an Atwood machine.|$|R
