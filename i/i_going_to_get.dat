500|$|The writers for {{the season}} worked in Los Angeles, with {{one member of the}} writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts {{developed}} through the production of the season, explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming, but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that, since Jones is a private investigator, there would be some procedural elements to the show, [...] "but that’s not our focus. There are cases. In particular, there is a large case that carries over the season." [...] Elaborating on this, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the [...] "fun about being a private detective is that the line between what’s legal and what’s not legal gets very blurred....her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case, {{as much as it is}} to go, 'Okay, can I pay the rent? How am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through this day?'" [...] He also added that inspiration {{for the season}} came from [...] "the noir films from the ‘40s" [...] and [...] "film like Chinatown." ...|$|E
500|$|Loeb talked {{further on}} the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of {{scheduling}} by saying [...] "if I'm shooting a television series and that's {{going to go on}} over a six-month or eight-month period, how am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> [...] {{to be able to go}} be in a movie?" [...] He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; [...] "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded." [...] Eric Carroll, producer on , felt with the introduction of Queens-based Spider-Man to the MCU it [...] "would be really fun" [...] to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, [...] "it’s definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later." ...|$|E

Where was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a double century to compensate? My two innings in that match totalled seven runs." ...|$|E

2500|$|While incarcerated at the Stateville Correctional Center in Crest Hill, Illinois, Speck {{was given}} the {{nickname}} [...] "birdman" [...] after the film Birdman of Alcatraz, because he kept a pair of sparrows that had flown into his cell. He {{was described as a}} loner who kept a stamp collection and enjoyed listening to music. His contacts with the warden included requests for new shirts, radio and other mundane items. The warden merely described him as [...] "a big nothing doing time." [...] Speck was not a model prisoner; he was often caught with drugs or distilled moonshine. Punishment for such infractions never stopped him. [...] "How am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in trouble? I'm here for 1,200 years!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{protest of}} the decision, on February 5, 2005, {{students}} formed a sit-in while reading {{passages from the}} center of the school gymnasium. They had shirts with handwritten designs of Bless Me, Ultima; however, only eight of the twenty students had heard or read of the book. Despite staying with his decision to keep the book banned, he acknowledged and respected the decision of the students to make a vocal protest. He told the students his choice was made in order to protect them while a student, Serena Campbell, responded by stating “If we’re sheltered all our lives, what are we going to do when we get to college? If I’m not exposed now, how am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> by in life?”. Conder ended the protest at [...] midday by telling the students that he plans to stand with the decision of what a new a curriculum review committee, that will have two representatives from each grade alongside parents. Moreover, he planned to apologize to Doyle.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Power proceeded, {{setting down}} the tumbler empty, [...] "you won't be bought. How am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{you out of}} the way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite well, but she mustn't expose herself too much. When I go <b>to</b> Dennett's <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her {{a mixture}} from the doctor." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Because it 's {{the fashion}} to have them, and you can't be {{finished}} off properly without. <b>I</b> 'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a pair, and so must you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe I hurt anything, Dave. But {{of course}} I can't be sure until I {{try to run}} the car," [...] {{answered}} Ben. [...] "What's worrying me is: How am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of this fix? I don't believe I can back out--in fact it wouldn't be safe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a young pelican," [...] she replied. [...] "I {{found a lot}} of nests on {{the ground}} over there, and this was in one of them. I chased it all about, until it flopped out here and hid itself {{on the other side of}} this tree. Then I came out quietly and caught it. But how am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it to you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But d----n it, Klara," [...] {{he exclaimed}} impatiently, [...] "I {{have made up}} my mind to come and spend my last evening with you--and when I have {{made up my mind}} to a thing, I am not likely to change it because of a lot of gossiping peasants, because of old Rézi, or the whole lot of them. So if you don't want me to come in by the front door, which is open, or to knock at the back door, which is locked, how am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know yet. But <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it somehow," [...] replied Dave, and {{his tone}} of voice showed that he meant what he said.|$|R
6000|$|He nodded. [...] "I am nigh mad with pain," [...] he said, {{pointing}} to his cheek, [...] "and <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some salve from an apothecary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My wound is not much. But Peck's is bad. I {{hardly knew}} how <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him <b>to</b> the fort. Are the Indians or desperadoes around?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sar, de affair {{happened}} in dis way. When de massas arribe, two o'clock, {{and went in}} for long talk wid de colonel, dis chile said to himself, 'Now what am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them for dinner?' De rations sarve out dis morning war all skin and bone, and war pretty nigh finished at lunch. Sam say to himself, 'Captain Manley's sure to say, 'You dine wid me;' but as Captain Manley hadn't got no food himself, de invitation was berry kind, berry kind indeed; but massa wasn't likely to get fat on dat invitation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I mockingly {{interposed}} at last, [...] "the farthing dip's guttering. And what if it's all true, {{and there}} is such a place, what then? How am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there, pray? Would you like to mummy me and shut me up in a box and carry me there, as they used to in Basman? Years and years ago my father told me of the pygmy men and horses--the same size as yours, I suppose--who lived in caves {{on the banks of the}} Nile. But I doubt if I believed in them much, even then. I am not so ignorant as all that." ...|$|E
6000|$|Having {{observed}} this so strongly, {{the writer}} of these speculations says to himself: [...] "Let me, at all events, try to eliminate any bias, and see the whole thing as should an umpire--one of those pure beings in white coats, purged of all the prejudices, passions, and predilections of mankind. Let me have no temperament for the time being, for I have to set down--not {{what would be the}} effect on me if I were in their place, or {{what would happen to the}} future if I could have my way, but what would happen all the same if I were not alive. Only from an impersonal point of view, if there be such a thing, am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> even approximately at the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Getting {{cautious}} as {{the years}} roll on, aren't you?" [...] Norgate sighed. [...] "I hoped <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something interesting out of you to cable to Berlin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{made up my}} {{mind that}} as soon as I left college <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> married," [...] Dick went on, looking her full in the eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you {{had better}} begin to-night, O'Grady. <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away as soon as I can, and if you will take my advice you will come too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Sherlock! The mean luck of it!--that {{he should}} come just when...." [...] He {{dropped into a}} reverie, and {{presently}} said to himself: [...] "But what's the use of being afraid of him? Anybody that knows him the way I do knows he can't detect a crime except where he plans it all out beforehand and arranges the clues and hires some fellow to commit it according to instructions.... Now there ain't {{going to be any}} clues this time--so, what show has he got? None at all. No, sir; everything's ready. If I was to risk putting it off.... No, I won't run any risk like that. Flint Buckner goes out of this world to-night, for sure." [...] Then another trouble presented itself. [...] "Uncle Sherlock 'll be wanting to talk home matters with me this evening, and how am <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of him? for I've got to be at my cabin a minute or two about eight o'clock." [...] This was an awkward matter, and cost him much thought. But he found a way to beat the difficulty. [...] "We'll go for a walk, and I'll leave him in the road a minute, so that he won't see what it is I do: the best way to throw a detective off the track, anyway, is to have him along when you are preparing the thing. Yes, that's the safest--I'll take him with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... '"I don't think I {{understood}} {{then what}} he meant. The other two had picked themselves up by that time, and they rushed together to the boat. They tramped, they wheezed, they shoved, they cursed the boat, the ship, each other--cursed me. All in mutters. I didn't move, I didn't speak. I watched the slant of the ship. She was {{as still as}} if landed on the blocks in a dry dock--only she was like this," [...] He held up his hand, palm under, {{the tips of the}} fingers inclined downwards. [...] "Like this," [...] he repeated. [...] "I could see the line of the horizon before me, as clear as a bell, above her stem-head; I could see the water far off there black and sparkling, and still--still as a-pond, deadly still, more still than ever sea was before--more still than I could bear to look at. Have you watched a ship floating head down, checked in sinking by a sheet of old iron too rotten to stand being shored up? Have you? Oh yes, shored up? I thought of that--I thought of every mortal thing; but can you shore up a bulkhead in five minutes--or in fifty for that matter? Where was <b>I</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> men that would go down below? And the timber--the timber! Would you have had the courage to swing the maul for the first blow if you had seen that bulkhead? Don't say you would: you had not seen it; nobody would. Hang it--to do a thing like that you must believe there is a chance, one in a thousand, at least, some ghost of a chance; and you would not have believed. Nobody would have believed. You think me a cur for standing there, but what would you have done? What! You can't tell--nobody can tell. One must have time to turn round. What would you have me do? Where was the kindness in making crazy with fright all those people I could not save single-handed--that nothing could save? Look here! As true as I sit on this chair before you [...] ." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thank {{goodness}} for that," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "I {{was wondering how}} <b>I</b> was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them <b>to</b> understand me. Tell them to fall-in two and two and follow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say no more," [...] said Psmith. [...] "If Comrade Repetto is there, that {{is enough}} for me. <b>I</b> am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{on the roof and}} pull it up after me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ray Vitte as Eddie Smith, a man {{who works}} in the mail room. When he meets Judy on her first day, he says, [...] "What?

5000|$|Thomas was {{addicted}} to drugs. During one acid trip, he decided to play with dry ice. His hands were burned so badly that doctors initially thought they would require amputation.

5000|$|Nomis fainted at an after-match {{reception}} at the Angel Hotel in Cardiff and was hospitalized for a night. His wife was pregnant at the time.
