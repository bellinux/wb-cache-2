25|$|In the mid 1520s, the Duke of Norfolk's niece, Anne Boleyn, {{had caught}} the eye of King Henry VIII, and Norfolk's {{political}} fortunes revived with his involvement in the King's attempt to have his marriage to Queen Catherine of Aragon annulled. By 1529, matters of state were being increasingly handled by Norfolk, the Duke of Suffolk, and the Boleyns, who pressed King Henry VIII to remove Cardinal Wolsey. In October, the King sent Norfolk and the Duke of Suffolk to obtain the great seal from the Cardinal. In November, Wolsey was arrested on a charge of treason, but died before trial. Norfolk benefited from Wolsey's fall, becoming the King's leading Councillor and applying himself energetically in the King's efforts to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out</b> of his marriage to Queen Catherine. His loyalty and service to King Henry VIII brought him ample rewards.

In May 1536, when King Henry VIII arrested his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn, Norfolk presided at the trial of his niece as Lord High Steward.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} {{conservation}} efforts being implemented to increase populations now {{is the use of}} hatcheries for protected egg incubation, the goal of which is to create a protected environment for the hatchlings where they can incubate and emerge from the sand without threat of predators and then be released out to sea safely. Unfortunately, this result has not been documented in practice. Often, when hatchlings emerge from the sand in the incubator, they remain enclosed inside and expend much of their preserved energy trying to <b>find</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>out.</b> They also lose the extremely important dark, night hours used to get far away from shore. They are released out to sea, often in the early morning hours, when many predators are about, which limits their chance of survival. In addition, the hatchlings are also often too weak to gain a long distance from shore due to the energy lost in the incubator after hatching. These results have led many to believe that hatcheries are ineffective and should only be used as a last resort. No extensive research has shown the survival rate of the hatchlings after they are released to sea, but one study proclaimed a possible 50% loss after release.|$|E
