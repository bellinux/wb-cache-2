5|$|The pileipellis, the {{top layer}} of hyphae in the cap, is a cutis. The cutis is made up of {{cylindrical}} hyphae between 2 and 5µm thick. The inamyloid and thin-walled hyphae are covered in brown granules. The flesh in the cap is made up of cylindrical hyphae from 4 to 7µm wide with thin cell walls. They are all generative hyphae, and run parallel to one another. They can be either inamyloid or only weakly dextrinoid. The flesh in the gills <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> same as the flesh in the cap, but for {{the fact that it is}} completely inamyloid. The hyphae of the stipitipellis, the uppermost layer in the stem, also form a cutis. The cylindrical hyphae making up the cutis run parallel to one another, and measure from 2.5 to 4.5µm in width, with walls up to 1µm thick. They are encrusted with a brown pigment, and are dextrinoid. The flesh of the stem is made up of generative hyphae running lengthways (that is, up and down the stem). The cells are 5 to 8µm wide, and are smooth and colourless; the cell walls up to 1µm thick. They are dextrinoid. All M.funalis hyphae lack clamp connections.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from the}} {{fundamental}} function of providing astronomers with a reference frame {{to report their}} observations in, astrometry is also fundamental for fields like celestial mechanics, stellar dynamics and galactic astronomy. In observational astronomy, astrometric techniques help identify stellar objects by their unique motions. It is instrumental for keeping time, in that UTC <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> atomic time synchronized to Earth's rotation by means of exact observations. Astrometry {{is an important step}} in the cosmic distance ladder because it establishes parallax distance estimates for stars in the Milky Way.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the most}} common open hole {{completion}} used today. It <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> same described on the vertical open hole completion but on a horizontal well it enlarges significantly the contact with the reservoir, increasing the production or injection rates of your well. Sand control on a horizontal well is completely different from a vertical well. We can no longer rely on the gravity for the gravel placement. Most service companies uses an alpha and beta wave design to cover the total length of the horizontal well with gravel. It's known that very long wells (around 6000ft) were successfully gravel packed in many occasions, including deepwater reservoirs in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Since {{independence}}, the Montenegrin {{society has}} been divided among many issues.

The Serbian population of Montenegro is opposed to the idea of a linguistic separation, just as they are opposed to the separation of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church from the jurisdiction of the Serbian Orthodox Church. The Montenegrin language lacks ISO code, and the Montenegrin Orthodox church is canonically unrecognized.|$|E
25|$|Since {{some of the}} Renaissance {{changes were}} done in haste (especially the wooden roof), as early as in 1616 a new, gradual Early Baroque {{reconstruction}} started based on a design by the main imperial architect Giovanni Battista Carlone. The works were intensified in 1635 and finished around 1647. It was mostly financed by Count Paul Pálffy (Pálfi), {{the captain of the}} castle and county head of Pozsony county. The look the castle received through this conversion <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> look the castle has kept till the present. The northern and western part of the main building have been newly built and a new, 3rd floor was added in the whole building, the main entrance was shifted back {{to the middle of the}} wall, the ancient fortifications were improved, the chapel was shifted from the southern part to the northern part (today’s Musical Hall), and 2 new towers were added– yielding in sum the present 4 towers in the corners. As a reward for not having misappropriated state funds during the conversion, the Diet appointed Count Paul Pálffy lifelong captain of Pressburg Castle, county head of the Pozsony county and usufructuary of the castle (which remained in possession of the crown) in 1650. One year later, the emperor made those functions and titles hereditary for the Pálffys.|$|E

First, Dworkin {{rejects the}} need to distinguish between [...] "legal" [...] rules and a more complete political philosophy, since {{the rule of law}} <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> theory of law and adjudication that he believes is correct. Secondly, the rule of law is not simply the thin or formal rule of law; the latter forms part of Dworkin's theory of law and adjudication. Thirdly, since taking a substantive view {{of the rule of law}} requires choosing what the best theory of justice is, it is necessary to articulate particular conceptions of what liberty, equality and other freedoms require.|$|E

500|$|The {{nervous system}} <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> {{same as in}} other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves {{throughout}} the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function {{to that of a}} fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain. [...] The brain consists of equal parts, cerebrum, midbrain and cerebellum. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity {{in the rest of the}} body. The pineal body, known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians.|$|E
500|$|Iron Man and Iron Man 2 {{director}} Jon Favreau said in December 2010 that {{he would}} not direct Iron Man 3, opting to direct Magic Kingdom instead. He remained an executive producer of director Joss Whedon's crossover film The Avengers and also served as an executive producer of Iron Man 3. Also in 2010, Downey reached out to Shane Black, who directed him in 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, to write and direct the film. In February 2011, Black entered final negotiations to join the project, and in March it was announced that Drew Pearce, who Marvel had originally hired for a Runaways script, would work with Black on the script. Downey said, [...] "Bringing in Shane Black to write and direct Iron Man 3 to me <b>is</b> <b>basically</b> <b>the</b> only transition from Favreau to a 'next thing' that Favreau and the audience and Marvel and I could ever actually sign off on." ...|$|E
