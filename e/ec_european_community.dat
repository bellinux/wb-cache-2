30|$|Trade agreements—to ease {{or remove}} the tariff or {{non-tariff}} barrier to international bilateral trade—have been in operation since 1947 (when GATT—General Agreements of Tariff and Trade—was signed by 23 nations) {{in the name}} of international trade organization or {{in the name of}} regional trade agreements. For the past 50  years, the gravity equation has been applied to evaluate the effects of trade cost variables including regional trade agreements. Ravenstein (1889) was the first to introduce the application of Newton’s Law of Gravitation to economics by using gravity equation to study the immigration. Tinbergen (1962), who first applied the gravity equation to trade flows, found mix effect of the RTA coefficients in the bilateral trade flows. For example, Tinbergen found significant effect of the British Commonwealth membership in trade flows but an insignificant of Benelux RTA. Abrams (1980), Aitken (1973), and Brada and Mendez (1985) found the <b>EC</b> (<b>European</b> <b>Community)</b> to have an economically and statistically significant effect on trade flows among members, whereas Bergstrand (1985), Frankel et al. (1995) found insignificant effects. So far, those studies assumed RTA variable as exogenous and overall all studies found either little or no effect of RTAs. Frankel (1997) argued that if four years (1970, 1980, 1990, and 1992) data are pooled together, the effect of European Community is 16 %. Accounting for endogeneity and using instrumental variable approach (for instance, remoteness of partners of a respective RTA as an instrument), they found that the effect of RTAs on trade is quadrupled. They found systematically, the effect of RTAs on trade flows has been underestimated by 75 %. On average, when ignoring the endogeneity, RTAs increase the trade flows by about 23 %. On the other hand, accounting for endogeneity of RTAs increase the trade flows by about 92 %.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Using a questionnaire, the <b>EC</b> 4 (<b>European</b> <b>Communities</b> Confederation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine) has {{collated}} {{an inventory}} of the accreditation procedures for medical laboratories in the EU. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Accreditation of medical laboratories in {{the countries of the}} EU is mostly carried out in cooperation with national accreditation bodies. These national accreditation bodies work together in a regional cooperation, the European Cooperation for Accreditation (EA). Professionals are trained to become assessors and play a prominent role in the accreditation process. The extent of the training is diverse, but assessors are kept informed and up-to-date by annual meetings. The frequency of assessments and surveillance visits differs from country to country and ranges from 1 to 4 years. More harmonisation is needed in this respect, based on a frequency that can be pragmatically handled by laboratory professionals. In the majority of EA bodies, accreditation is carried out on a test-by-test basis. Many professionals would prefer accreditation of the entire service provided within the actual field of testing (i. e., haematology, immunology, etc.), with accreditation granted if the majority of tests offered within a service field fulfil the requirements of the ISO 15189 standard. The scope of accreditation is a major point of discussions between the EC 4 Working Group on Accreditation and representatives of accreditation bodies in the EA Medical Laboratory Committee...|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that there is}} a problem with delayed {{transposition}} of directives within the EU (European Union). However, the data on which many of these claims are made show some serious shortcomings. By using a new dataset on the transposition of utilities directives that overcomes many of these problems, this paper set out to examine if there are problems with transposition delays in the area of utilities, and if so, how these problems can be explained. It was found that in nearly half of the cases, transposition was delayed, and the average delay was about seven and a half months. There were also significant differences between the member states in this respect. In search for explanations for these differences, existing literature on the compliance with <b>EC</b> (<b>European</b> <b>Community)</b> law was reviewed, and this produced an extensive list of potential explanatory variables. Rather than to test all these variables, a theoretical approach, namely sociological institutionalism, was adopted in order to bring theoretical focus to the analysis. The variables that could be derived from this approach were subsequently selected and tested. Of the explanatory variables that were tested, only the variable “Government efficiency” remained significant when the grouped structure of the data was controlled for. The fact that only a low amount of the variance was accounted for in the analysis, and that the policy area (telecommunications or energy) to which a directive belongs proved to be an important factor in accounting for delays, suggests that the explanatory variables are too broad. This calls for further research in which the explanatory variables are operationalised in such a way that they are more specific to transposition and to the characteristics of a policy area within the member states...|$|E
40|$|The {{first country}} Japan signed an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) was Singapore in January 2002. Since then, Japan has agreed upon EPAs {{with most of}} the Asian-Pacific countries, {{including}} Australia (July 2014), but without Korea and China. This could be described as the first stage of Japan’s FTA/EPA negotiations, set upon a strategy to conclude with countries “as many as possible” and “in the order of conclude-able. ” Japan’s EPAs with Mexico (May 2005), Chile (September 2007), and Peru (March 2012) aimed {{to catch up with the}} US and the European Union’s (EU) free trade policy with Latin American countries, so that Japanese multi-nationals would not reduce market access. Japan’s strategy in this stage had been passive. In the current second stage, which the country has gradually entered into after the global financial crisis, Japan pursues active roles and negotiates with “bigger” partners such as the US (in the TPP, Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement, or Trans-Pacific Partnership), Canada, the EU, Korea and China. Japan’s EPAs with Mexico, Chile and Peru played the role of opening a backdoor to Japan’s highly protected agriculture market, therefore urging a new dimension to the country’s foreign trade policy. While allowing Japanese farmers to export to Latin America, Japan in turn opened its domestic market of wine, beef, chicken, pork and others, which was a compromise the country had rarely made with the US and the <b>EC</b> (<b>European</b> <b>Community)</b> /EU during the history of trade conflicts since the 1970 s. Besides agriculture, Japan is further required to abandon non-tariff barriers and to open public procurement. Whether Japan could take a leap from its familiar and “comfortable” regulated free trade policy into “real” free trade and therefore play a role in setting rules and accelerating global free trade is seriously put into question...|$|E

40|$|Because GABA(A) receptors {{containing}} alpha 2 subunits {{are highly}} represented {{in areas of}} the brain, such as nucleus accumbens (NAcc), frontal cortex, and amygdala, regions intimately involved in signaling motivation and reward, we hypothesized that manipulations of this receptor subtype would influence processing of rewards. Voltage-clamp recordings from NAcc medium spiny neurons of mice with alpha 2 gene deletion showed reduced synaptic GABA(A) receptor-mediated responses. Behaviorally, the deletion abolished cocaine`s ability to potentiate behaviors conditioned to rewards (conditioned reinforcement), and to support behavioral sensitization. In mice with a point mutation in the benzodiazepine binding pocket of alpha 2 -GABA(A) receptors (alpha 2 H 101 R), GABAergic neurotransmission in medium spiny neurons was identical to that of WT (i. e., the mutation was silent), but importantly, receptor function was now facilitated by the atypical benzodiazepine Ro 15 - 4513 (ethyl 8 -amido- 5, 6 -dihydro- 5 -methyl- 6 -oxo- 4 H-imidazo [1, 5 -a] [1, 4] benzodiazepine- 3 -carboxylate). In alpha 2 H 101 R, but not WT mice, Ro 15 - 4513 administered directly into the NAcc-stimulated locomotor activity, and when given systemically and repeatedly, induced behavioral sensitization. These data indicate that activation of alpha 2 -GABA(A) receptors (most likely in NAcc) is both necessary and sufficient for behavioral sensitization. Consistent with a role of these receptors in addiction, we found specific markers and haplotypes of the GABRA 2 gene to be associated with human cocaine addiction.
