60|$|There {{were some}} grown-up children, others growing up, with others {{that were still}} quite small. The boys, I noticed, favoured their mother, and had commonplace faces; the girls took after their father, and though their {{features}} were not so perfect they were exceptionally good-looking. The eldest son--the disjointed, fly-away-looking {{young man who had}} conquered all his enemies--had a wife and child. The eldest daughter was also married, and had one child. Altogether the three families numbered about sixteen persons, each family having its separate set of rooms, but all dining at one table. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it? It seemed easy enough to them. They were serious people in a sense, although always cheerful and sometimes hilarious when together of an evening, or at their meals. But they regarded life as a serious matter, a state of probation; they were non-smokers, total abstainers, diligent at their work, united, profoundly religious. A fresh wonder came to light when I found that this poor woodman, with so large a family to support, who spent ten or twelve hours every day at his outdoor work, had yet been able out of his small earnings to buy bricks and other materials, and, assisted by his sons, to build a chapel adjoining his house. Here he held religious services on Sundays, and once or twice of an evening during the week. These services consisted of extempore prayers, a short address, and hymns accompanied by a harmonium, which they all appeared able to play.|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} {{capitalism}} from {{the industrial revolution}} onwards is one of increasing differences in productivity and living conditions across {{different parts of the}} globe.

However, in spite of this long run trends towards divergence in productivity and income, there are many examples of (initially) backward countries that – at different times – have managed to defy the trend by narrowing the gap in productivity and income between themselves and the frontier countries, that is, by “catching up”. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it?

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a statistical analysis of the first Florida recount. The findings indicate that {{it is highly unlikely}} that the relative increase in Gore's vote total can be explained by mechanical reading errors. Rather it appears partisan biases influenced the outcome. Estimates indicate that on average if a ballot's status changed from no vote to a vote, the chance that it went to Gore was about 15 % higher than one would expect given his fraction of that county's vote. Overall then, controlling for each candidate's vote in a county and the type of ballot used, this paper estimates that Gore picked up 903 "too many" votes in the recount relative to what would have been expected by chance machine read errors. If humans influenced the results <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it? During the recount the ballots were put through the tabulating machines several times. However, machine readings tend to vary from run to run and this means humans, partisan humans, have to decide which of several tallies to report.

E.) on their first take. Despite the low passing percentage in the P. N. L. E. in the past decade, the study sought to answer possible reasons why some nurses conduct self-review, {{what did they do}} to pass, and most importantly, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> it. A multiple explanatory and exploratory case study was used to reveal the answers of the participants to those questions. Specifically, the study sought to answer the following: 1.) What review strategies and techniques, if any, helped them pass the P. N. L. E. ? 2.) What personal traits did these self-reviewees possess which helped them pass the P. N. L. E. ? and 3.) What could be the marks of a P. N. L. E. self-reviewee board passer? The self-review stories of these seven board passers (and four additional who answered an email survey questionnaire for triangulation) were analyzed through within and cross case analyses. Fourteen self-review strategies emerged and seven self-review flow charts were culled from the analyses of the responses. As to the self-reported traits, self-confidence, self-discipline and determination to pass and finish the review were present in most of the participants. A discussion of the implications to the nursing licensure, their pedagogical implications to nursing education, and areas for further study are then presented. The study closes with a document titled “Marks of a Self-reviewee Board Passer”, developed out of the case participants’ stories, highlighting their review strategies, practical tips, and lessons learned to guide future self-reviewees in the P.

30|$|Thanks to the {{extended}} economic {{boom of the}} last 10  years, Peru is {{well on its way}} to reducing urban poverty to first world levels. Even though rural poverty has not fallen nearly as quickly and has shown itself to be relatively insensitive to government efforts at poverty reduction, still Peru is one of only ten countries in the entire world for which we have comparable data where rural poverty has fallen by at least 3 % per year since the millennium (Inchauste et al. 2012). Thus, Peru is both a good example of the rural poverty problem, and a possible guide to a successful strategy for rural poverty reduction. No one should imagine that reducing rural poverty in Peru was going to be easy. The amount of arable land per capita in the Andes is small, the climate is dry and cold and most of the rural population lives at least 10, 000 feet above sea level (Morley 2011). Yet Peru despite these structural handicaps managed to reduce the rural poverty rate from 85 % in 2004 to 55 % 8  years later. <b>How</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> this? That is the central question we want to address in this paper. 2 What role was played by rapid growth, sectoral growth in agriculture, rural–urban migration, government transfers, and improvements in education? What lessons can we learn from the Peruvian experience that can be transferred to other countries with a significant rural poverty problem? We will attempt to answer these questions by means of an analysis of two recent living standards measurement surveys, one in 2004 adjusted by updated population weights and a second in 2012.3 These are big comparable national surveys from which the statistics on poverty in this paper are drawn.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Ancient Studies) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. This {{thesis is}} a study of five books (Jubilees, 1 and 2 Maccabees, the Damascus Document and Josephus Jewish Antiquities) that {{represent}} the literature dealing {{with the issue of}} the Sabbath in significant ways, written between 200 B. C. E. and 100 C. E. In this study the author is determined to find the most prominent ways in which various Jews of the period treated the Sabbath, considering both its theological significance and actual practical application. The author seeks to apply the literary-critical method to the study of these books by identifying how the Sabbath pericopes fit into the larger structure of each book and contribute to the overall argument of each work. After dealing with introductory issues, such as terms, methods, historical settings and methodology, the author then works through the major Sabbath-related pericopes in each book followed by a concluding summary for each book. Then author moves from detailed individual conclusions to general summaries, seeking to deduce the “big picture” of the Judaisms represented in the five works that he researched. Throughout the thesis the author is asking all of the texts the following questions: Was there a major Jewish view of the Sabbath or were the views varied within Judaisms? Was the Sabbath {{one of the most important}} issues facing the Jewish Community or was it rather a peripheral one? What was the place of Covenant with YHWH in the Sabbath thought of the day? What was the impact of the historical events of the period on the views of the Sabbath? Was the understanding(s) of the Sabbath legalistic or was there a depth of heartfelt spirituality accompanying Sabbath observance? Were the rules with regard to the Sabbath actually carried out or were they largely ignored? At the conclusion he attempts to answer these questions point by point based upon the data that he collected by studying the passages related to the Sabbath observance within the books mentioned above. This study is preliminary in nature, since it attempts to provide only some background information to the question: Did the Jewish Christians of the first century change the day of worship from Saturday to Sunday? If so, <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> so while managing to avoid any kind of major debate over the change? This question the author plans to pursue in his forthcoming research...|$|E
