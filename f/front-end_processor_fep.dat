To aid this investigation, NASA Lewis is developing the Hypercluster, a multi-architecture, parallel-processing test bed. The initial operating capability (IOC) being developed for the Hypercluster is described. The IOC will provide a user with a programming/operating environment that is interactive, responsive, and easy to use. The IOC effort includes {{the development of the}} Hypercluster Operating System (HYCLOPS). HYCLOPS runs in conjunction with a vendor-supplied disk operating system on a <b>Front-End</b> <b>Processor</b> (<b>FEP)</b> to provide interactive, run-time operations such as program loading, execution, memory editing, and data retrieval. Run-time libraries, that augment the FEP FORTRAN libraries, are being developed to support parallel and vector processing on the Hypercluster. Special utilities are being provided to enable passage of information about application programs and their mapping to the operating system. Communications between the FEP and the Hypercluster are being handled by dedicated processors, each running a Message-Passing Kernel, (MPK). A shared-memory interface allows rapid data exchange between HYCLOPS and the communications processors. Input/output handlers are built into the HYCLOPS-MPK interface, eliminating the need for the user to supply separate I/O support programs on the FEP...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 22 - 25, 2001 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaA {{traditional}} <b>Front-end</b> <b>Processor</b> (<b>FEP)</b> {{with local}} RAID storage can limit the operational throughput of a high-rate telemetry ground station. The Front-end processor must perform pass processing (frame synchronization, decoding, routing, and storage), post-pass processing (level-zero processing), and tape archiving. A typical fifteen minute high-rate satellite pass can produce data files of 10 to 20 GB. The FEP may require up to 2 hours {{to perform the}} post-pass processing and tape archiving functions for these size files. During this time, it is not available to support real-time pass operations. Honeywell faced this problem {{in the design of}} the data management system for the DataLynx ä* ground stations. Avtec Systems, Inc. and Honeywell worked together to develop a data management system that utilizes a Storage Area Network (SAN) in conjunction with multiple High-speed Front-end Processors (HSFEP) for Pass Processing (PFEP), multiple HSFEPs for Post-pass Processing (PPFEP), and a dedicated Tape Archive server. A SAN consists of a high-capacity, high-bandwidth shared RAID that is connected to multiple nodes using 1 Gbps Fibre Channel interfaces. All of the HSFEPs as well as the Tape Archive server have direct access to the shared RAID via a Fibre Channel network. The SAN supports simultaneous read/write transfers between the nodes at aggregate rates up to 120 Mbytes/sec. With the Storage Area Network approach, the High-Speed Front-end Processors can quickly transfer the data captured during a pass to the shared RAID for post-processing and tape archiving so that they are available to support another satellite pass. This paper will discuss the architecture of the Storage Area Network and how it optimizes ground station data management in a high-rate environment...|$|E
40|$|Indian Institute of ScienceThis {{dissertation}} {{discusses the}} principles, techniques and approaches {{adopted in the}} design of task scheduling algorithms for Distributed Parallel Processing Computer Systems (DPCSs) connected with network of front-end systems (FSs), The primary goal {{in the design of}} scheduling algorithms is to minimise the total turnaround time of the jobs to be scheduled by maximizing the utilisation of the resources of the DPCS with minimum data communication overhead, The users present their jobs to be scheduled at the FS, The FS receives a job and generates a finite set of independent tasks based on mutually independent sections having inherent parallelism, Each task could be scheduled to different available processors of DPCS for concurrent execution, The tasks are of three groups viz,, compute intensive tasks, input. output intensive tasks and the combination of compute and input-output intensive tasks. They may have the execution time almost the same. Some of the tasks may have the execution time larger due to precedence constraints than that of other tasks and they are provided with logical breakpoints which can be utilised to further break the tasks into subtasks during scheduling, The technique of using breakpoint of the tasks is more appropriate when the number of available processors is more than the number of tasks to be scheduled. The tasks of a job thus generated are sent to the <b>front-end</b> <b>processor</b> (<b>FEP</b> or the host processor) of the DPCS in the form of data flow graph (DFG), The DFG is used to model the tasks and represent the precedence (or data dependencies) among the tasks, In order to preserve the constraints among the tasks during scheduling and realise efficient utilisation of the resources of DPCS, the DFG is structured in the form of levels, The FBP of DPCS has a resident Task Manager (TM). The key function of the TM is to schedule the tasks to the appropriate processors of DPCS either statically or dynamically based on the required resources. To realise efficient scheduling and utilisation of the processors of DPCS, the TM uses a set of buffers known as Task Forwarding Buffer (TFB), Task Output Buffer (TOB) and Task Status Buffer (TSB) maintained by the FEP of DPCS. The tasks of a job from the FS are received at the TFB. The TM picks up a set of tasks pertaining to a level for scheduling into a temporary buffer C and obtains the status of the processors of DPCS. In order to realise both static and dynamic approaches of allocation, task to processor relation is considered in the scheduling algorithm. If the number of tasks in C is equal to or greater than the number of processors available, one task per processor is allocated, the remaining tasks of C are scheduled subsequently as and when the processors become available. This method of allocation is called static approach. If the number of tasks in C is less than the number of processors available, the TM makes use of the logical breakpoints of the tasks to generate subtasks equal to the number of available processors. Each subtask is scheduled to a processor. This method of scheduling is called the dynamic approach. In all the case the precedence constraints among the tasks are preserved by scheduling the successor task to the parent processor or near neighbouring processor, maintaining minimum data communication between them. Various examples of Computational Fluid Dynamics problems' were tested and the objective of reduced total turnaround time and maximum utilisation of the processors was achieved. The total turnaround time achieved for different jobs varies between 51 % and 86 % with static approach and 16 % and 89 % with dynamic approach. The utilisation of the processors varies between the 50 % and 92. 5 %. Hence a speed-up of 5 to 8 folds is realised...|$|E

40|$|The {{strategy}} used {{to develop}} the NIF Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS) calls for incremental cycles of construction and formal test to deliver a total of 1 million lines of code. Each incremental release takes {{four to six months}} to implement specific functionality and culminates when offline tests conducted in the ICCS Integration and Test Facility verify functional, performance, and interface requirements. Tests are then repeated on line to confirm integrated operation in dedicated laser laboratories or ultimately in the NIF. Test incidents along with other change requests are recorded and tracked to closure by the software change control board (SCCB). Annual independent audits advise management on software process improvements. Extensive experience has been gained by integrating controls in the prototype laser preamplifier laboratory. The control system installed in the preamplifier lab contains five of the ten planned supervisory subsystems and seven of sixteen planned <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> (<b>FEPs).</b> Beam alignment, timing, diagnosis and laser pulse amplification up to 20 joules was tested through an automated series of shots.

40|$|The control {{network for}} the National Ignition Facility (NIF) is {{designed}} to meet the needs for common object request broker architecture (CORBA) inter-process communication, multicast video transport, device triggering, and general TCP/IP communication within the NIF facility. The network will interconnect approximately 650 systems, including the embedded controllers, <b>front-end</b> <b>processors</b> (<b>FEPs),</b> supervisory systems, and centralized servers involved in operation of the NIF. All systems are networked with Ethernet to serve the majority of communication needs, and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) is used to transport multicast video and synchronization triggers. CORBA software infra-structure provides location-independent communication services over TCP/IP between the application processes in the 15 supervisory and 300 FEP systems. Video images sampled from 500 video cameras at a 10 -Hz frame rate will be multicast using direct ATM Application Programming Interface (API) communication from video FEPs to any selected operator console. The Ethernet and ATM control networks are used to broadcast two types of device triggers for last-second functions in a large number of FEPs, thus eliminating the need for a separate infrastructure for these functions. Analysis, design, modeling, and testing of the NIF network has been performed to provide confidence that the network design will meet NIF control requirements. ...|$|R
