50|$|Sebaceous glands {{are normal}} {{structures}} of the skin but may also be found ectopically in the mouth, where they {{are referred to as}} oral Fordyce granules or ectopic sebaceous glands. On the foreskin they are called Tyson's <b>glands,</b> <b>not</b> to be confused with hirsuties coronae glandis.|$|R
5000|$|A 2010 {{paper on}} salsa food hygiene {{described}} refrigeration as [...] "the key to safe" [...] sauces. This {{study also found}} that fresh lime juice and fresh garlic (but <b>not</b> <b>powdered</b> garlic) would prevent the growth of bacteria.|$|R
60|$|Manganese, Chloride of.--Three leaves {{immersed}} in ninety minims {{of a solution}} of one part to 437 of water; after 22 hrs. no more inflection than often occurs in water; <b>glands</b> <b>not</b> blackened. The leaves were then placed in the usual solution of phosphate of ammonia, but no inflection was caused even after 48 hrs.|$|R
60|$|Arsenious Acid.--A {{solution}} of one part to 437 of water; three leaves were immersed in ninety minims; in 25 m. considerable inflection; in 1 h. great inflection; <b>glands</b> <b>not</b> discoloured. After 6 hrs. the leaves {{were transferred to}} water; next morning they looked fresh, but after four days were pale-coloured, had not re-expanded, and were evidently dead.|$|R
60|$|Cadmium, Chloride of.--Three {{leaves were}} {{immersed}} in ninety minims {{of a solution}} of one part to 437 of water; after 5 hrs. 20 m. slight inflection occurred, which increased during the next three hours. After 24 hrs. all three leaves had their tentacles well inflected, and remained so for an additional 24 hrs.; <b>glands</b> <b>not</b> discoloured.|$|R

[...] "Take this back, and give us the powder." ...|$|R
40|$|Neurofibromas are tumors {{of neural}} origin. They can be solitary {{or may be}} {{associated}} with neurofibromatosis type- 1 (NF- 1). These are mostly seen {{in the head and neck}} region, upper extremities or along the nerves. Visceral neurofibromas are extremely rare. In this paper, we present an unusual case of solitary neurofibroma of the adrenal <b>gland</b> <b>not</b> associated with NF- 1...|$|R

40|$|Saliva, a non- {{invasive}} bio-fluid secreted by the salivary <b>glands</b> <b>not</b> only lubricates {{the oral}} cavity {{but also has}} antibacterial, antifungal and antiviral properties and also regulates pH. It contains mucin, protein, salt, starch and hormones. It can be easily collected {{and can be used}} as a diagnostic fluid in assessing most of the systemic disease. Also they play a major role in monitoring drug level and forensic odontology...|$|R
60|$|Antimony, Tartrate of.--Three {{leaves were}} {{immersed}} in ninety minims {{of a solution}} of one part to 437 of water. After 8 hrs. 30 m. there was slight inflection; after 24 hrs. two of the leaves were closely, and the third moderately, inflected; <b>glands</b> <b>not</b> much darkened. The leaves were washed and placed in water, but they remained in the same state for 48 additional hours. This salt is probably poisonous, but acts slowly.|$|R
40|$|The histochemical {{method to}} {{demonstrate}} L-leucyl-beta-naphtylamidase (LNAase) activity {{has been applied}} to biopsies of normal human ductus deferens, deferential ampulla, seminal vesicle, prostate, bulbourethral (Cowper's) gland, and cavernous urethra. An intensely positive reaction was observed in the secreting epithelia of prostate, Cowper's, and urethral (Littré's) <b>glands.</b> <b>Not</b> only the prostate but also the Cowper's and Littré's glands secrete some LNAase into the semen. A possible role of the seminal LNAase is discussed...|$|R

5000|$|Under microscopy, the {{duodenum}} has a villous mucosa. This {{is distinct}} from the mucosa of the pylorus, which directly joins to the duodenum. Like other structures of the gastrointestinal tract, the duodenum has a mucosa, submucosa, muscularis externa, and adventitia. Glands line the duodenum, known as Brunner's glands, which secrete mucus and bicarbonate in order to neutralise stomach acids. These are distinct <b>glands</b> <b>not</b> found in the ileum or jejunum, {{the other parts of}} the small intestine.|$|R

40|$|A {{train of}} symptoms, coupled with {{retardation}} of tissue metabolism and with inactivity of the reproductive <b>glands,</b> <b>not</b> only accompanies states of experimentally induced hypophysial deficiency, but is equally characteristic of clinical states of hypopituitarism. The more notable of these symptoms are a tendency, in the chronic cases, toward an unusual deposition of fat, a lowering of body temperature, slowing of pulse and respiration, fall in blood pressure, and oftentimes a pronounced somnolence. These symptoms bear a marked {{resemblance to the}} physiological phenomena accompanying the state of hibernation which have heretofore been unsatisfactorily ascribed solely to extracorporeal factors; namely, a seasonal deprivation of food and low temperature. In a series of hibernating animals (woodchucks) {{it has been found}} that during the dormant period histological changes are apparent in many of the ductless glands. The most notable of these changes occur in the pituitary body, as previously observed by Gemelli. The <b>gland</b> <b>not</b> only diminishes in size, but the cells of the pars anterior in some animals at least completely lose their characteristic staining reactions to acid and basic dyes. At the end of the dormant period the gland swells, and as the cells enlarge they again acquire their differential affinity for acid, basic, and neutral stains, {{and at the same time}} karyokinetic figures may appear...|$|R
25|$|In the {{zebrafish}} the pineal <b>gland</b> does <b>not</b> straddle the midline but shows a left-sided bias. In humans, functional {{cerebral dominance}} {{is accompanied by}} subtle anatomical asymmetry.|$|R
2500|$|False pregnancy*, or pseudocyesis, is {{a common}} {{condition}} in female intact dogs. Signs include swelling of the mammary <b>glands,</b> lactation, <b>not</b> eating, and [...] "mothering" [...] small objects.|$|R
50|$|Diagnostic imaging - Abdominal {{ultrasound}} {{may reveal}} small adrenal glands, suggesting adrenocortical atrophy. However, finding normal-sized adrenal <b>glands</b> does <b>not</b> rule out hypoadrenocorticism. Rarely, megaesophagus is evident on radiographs.|$|R
30|$|The {{remaining}} 57 % (27 / 47) {{were treated}} with standard radiotherapy as initially planned. Standard radiotherapy of the prostate <b>gland</b> did <b>not</b> change due to 11 C-acetate PET/CT results.|$|R
40|$|The {{concentration}} of epinephrine and norepinephrine in {{the adrenal gland}} of the dog is comparable in {{the left and right}} glands. Denervation of the left adrenal <b>gland</b> does <b>not</b> decrease the levels of these adrenal catecholamines three weeks after denervation. These findings are in keeping with the concept that catecholamine biosynthesis by the adrenal <b>gland</b> is <b>not</b> dependent on adrenal innervation. Other evidence supporting this concept is reviewed. In contrast to prevailing opinion we have found that the catecholamine content of adrenal glands obtained from conscious dogs is comparable to that in animals with general barbiturate anesthesia...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Time {{resolved}} {{infrared spectroscopy}} (FTIR) and isothermal {{differential scanning calorimetry}} (DSC) {{were used for the}} first time to monitor the chemical reaction in a fast setting brushite forming calcium phosphate cement. It was found that the reaction percentage at a given time was dependent on temperature and <b>not</b> <b>powder</b> to liquid (P/L) ratio. Both methods showed that there was, within the temperature range investigated, a single autocatalytic like setting reaction within the cement paste. Final conversion of the reactants was found to be unaffected by temperature and P/L ratio...|$|R
50|$|The Tassimo system {{utilizes}} proprietary non-reusable plastic beverage pods, called T-Discs, {{which are}} produced and distributed by Mondelēz. A bar code {{on top of}} each T-Disc instructs the machine to use the proper brewing settings. It will then change the water temperature, the amount of water, and the brew time and strength. This allows the Tassimo pod maker to brew a variety of hot drinks: filtered style coffee, cappuccino, short espresso, tea, and hot chocolate. The brewing process takes between 30-60 seconds. Discs containing milk use UHT milk, <b>not</b> <b>powdered</b> milk.|$|R
50|$|A paste or gel {{might become}} a powder {{after it has been}} {{thoroughly}} dried, but is <b>not</b> considered a <b>powder</b> when it is wet because it does not flow freely. Substances like dried clay, although dry bulk solids composed of very fine particles, are <b>not</b> <b>powders</b> unless they are crushed because they have too much cohesion between the grains, and therefore they do not flow freely like a powder. A liquid flows differently than a powder, because a liquid cannot resist any shear stress and therefore it cannot reside at a tilted angle without flowing (that is, it has zero angle of repose.) A powder on the other hand is a solid, not a liquid, because it may support shear stresses and therefore may display an angle of repose.|$|R
40|$|Morphological, {{chemical}} and developmental {{aspects of the}} Dufour gland in some eusocial bees (Hymenoptera, Apidae) : a review. The present revision focused on the more recent data about the Dufour gland in some eusocial bees, taking in account general aspects of its morphology, secretion chemical nature, bio-synthetic pathway and development. Many functions {{have been attributed to}} this gland in eusocial bees, but none are convincing. With the new data about this <b>gland,</b> <b>not</b> only the secretion chemical pathway of the Dufour gland may be reasonable understood, as its function in some eusocial bees, especially Apis mellifera Linné, 1758, which has been extensively studied in the last years...|$|R
5000|$|Drug induced (iatrogenic) hypoadrenocorticism {{is caused}} during abrupt {{cessation}} of a steroid medication. During steroid treatment, the adrenal <b>glands</b> do <b>not</b> function fully. The body senses {{the levels of}} the exogenous steroids {{in the system and}} therefore does not signal for additional production. The usual protocol for stopping steroid medications is not to eliminate them suddenly, but to withdraw from them gradually in a [...] "tapering off" [...] process, which allows the production to adjust to normal. If steroids are abruptly withdrawn, the dormant adrenal <b>glands</b> may <b>not</b> able to reactivate, and the body will need to have its adrenal glucocorticoid hormones replaced by medication.|$|R
50|$|The buccal mass is small, {{about twice}} as long as wide, the {{oesophagus}} opening well forward. Salivary <b>glands</b> are <b>not</b> united, in Holospira roemeri rather short, and on short ducts. In Holospira goldfussi the ducts are long.|$|R
