25|$|Because the {{shielding}} {{is made of}} metal, it {{may also}} serve as a ground. Usually a shielded twisted pair cable has a special grounding wire added called a <b>drain</b> <b>wire</b> which is electrically connected to the shield or screen. The <b>drain</b> <b>wire</b> simplifies connection to ground at the connectors.|$|E

50|$|A foil-screen is {{typically}} used, comprising thin aluminium {{wrapped around the}} conductors. An uninsulated <b>drain</b> <b>wire</b> is contained inside the screen to facilitate ground connection. A less common construction is a lapped or braided screen comprising thin wires wrapped around the conductors. This gives improved flexibility, but less effective screening.|$|E
40|$|Electrical cables that {{dissipate}} spurious static electric charges, {{in addition}} to performing their main functions of conducting signals, have been developed. These cables are intended for use in trapped-ion or ionizing-radiation environments, in which electric charges tend to accumulate within, and on the surfaces of, dielectric layers of cables. If the charging rate exceeds the dissipation rate, charges can accumulate in excessive amounts, giving rise to high-current discharges that can damage electronic circuitry and/or systems connected to it. The basic idea of design and operation of charge-dissipative electrical cables is to drain spurious charges to ground by use of lossy (slightly electrically conductive) dielectric layers, possibly in conjunction with <b>drain</b> <b>wires</b> and/or <b>drain</b> shields (see figure). In typical cases, the <b>drain</b> <b>wires</b> and/or <b>drain</b> shields could be electrically grounded via the connector assemblies {{at the ends of}} the cables, in any of the conventional techniques for grounding signal conductors and signal shields. In some cases, signal shields could double as drain shields...|$|R
30|$|The wounds {{were dressed}} and closed without a <b>drain.</b> The <b>wires</b> were left outside the skin. The foot was immobilized in a below-the-knee cast, and {{weight-bearing}} was not permitted. At 2  weeks, the cast was changed after wound inspection. Four weeks later, the cast was changed and the wires removed. Total cast time was 12  weeks.|$|R

50|$|The VBUS, D−, D+, and GND pins are {{required}} for USB 2.0 communication. The additional USB 3.0 pins are two differential pairs and one ground (GND_DRAIN). The two additional differential pairs are for SuperSpeed data transfer; they are used for full duplex SuperSpeed signaling. The GND_DRAIN pin is for <b>drain</b> <b>wire</b> termination and to control EMI and maintain signal integrity.|$|E
50|$|Cable {{shielding}} may {{be required}} in order to improve a Cat 6 cable's performance in high electromagnetic interference (EMI) environments. This shielding reduces the corrupting effect of EMI on the cable's data. Shielding is typically maintained from one cable end to the other using a <b>drain</b> <b>wire</b> that runs through the cable alongside the twisted pairs. The shield's electrical connection to the chassis on each end is made through the jacks. The requirement for ground connections at both cable ends creates the possibility that a ground loop may result if one of the networked chassis is at different instantaneous electrical potential with respect to its mate. This undesirable situation may compel currents to flow between chassis through the network cable shield, and these currents may in turn induce detrimental noise in the signal being carried by the cable.|$|E
40|$|Neil Muncy [1] {{has shown}} that audio {{frequency}} current flowing on the shield of twisted-pair audio wiring will be converted to differential mode voltage by any imbalance in the transfer impedance of the cable. He hypothesized that the effect is magnified {{by the presence of}} a <b>drain</b> <b>wire</b> and increases linearly with frequency. Whitlock [2] and others have shown that conversion also occurs with capacitive imbalance. This paper confirms Muncy's hypotheses and shows that shield-current-induced noise is significant well into the MHz range...|$|E
40|$|The Tunnel Emitter Transistor {{is based}} on the {{modulation}} of the tunnel current in a Metal Oxide Semiconductor (MOS) structure with an ultra-thin oxide layer. The modulation is accomplished by injecting charge to the oxide-semiconductor interface from a third terminal. Its physical structure closely resembles a p-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (pMOSFET) with a very thin gate dielectric, a contacted substrate and the source and <b>drain</b> <b>wired</b> together; hence it is as easy to fabricate as conventional MOSFETs. TETs work in the same temperature range as normal transistors. This thesis reports on the fabrication and characterisation of Al / SiO 2 / Si TETs with a significantly higher small-signal and large-signal gain than previous work. These devices have been used mainly as a basis for constructing different device models, also presented in this thesis, from which DC and HF behaviour of devices with different designs have have been predicted. TET measurements have also been performed on pMOSFETs, showing that TETs are inherent in devices made with modern CMOS processes. There is currently no application where TETs are used, but the results in this thesis point out a new direction for TET research towards possible niche applications. That direction is a change of materials in the device. Most importantly, the dielectric should be changed to Ta 2 O 5 or some other dielectric with similar electrical properties...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, the Iowa Department of Transportation has {{increased}} its use of recycled Portland Cement Concrete (PCC) as drainable base material below some new pavements. Water flowing out of the longitudinal drains on projects having recycled PCC drainable bases {{was found to have}} a high pH value. The high pH water impedes vegetation growth and becomes a contributing factor to soil erosion at the drain outlet. In addition, the high pH water contributes to the growth of crystalline deposits on the <b>drain</b> outlet <b>wire</b> mesh rodent guard and in some cases caused it to become completely blocked. This research determined which of three choices of recycled PCC drainable base material, gradation, and design would give the lowest pH value in the drain discharge water. The drainable base material having its fines separated out and placed as a 2 -in. (5. 1 -mm) bottom layer, below the remaining coarse material, generally gave pH values around 11. 2 while other designs tested gave pH values around 11. 5...|$|R
50|$|Modern {{papermaking}} techniques use a {{dandy roll}} {{to create the}} laid pattern {{during the early stages}} of manufacture, {{in the same way as}} applying a paper watermark. While in the wet state, the paper stock (a dilute dispersion of the cellulose fibers in water) is <b>drained</b> on a <b>wire</b> mesh to de-water the stock. During this process, a dandy roll with a laid mesh pattern is pressed into the wet stock, displacing the cellulose fiber. This pattern has to be applied at a particular stock consistency; otherwise the pattern will be lost as the fiber flows back while the stock moves past the dandy (too wet), or fiber will pick out of the stock (too dry), causing surface disruption. As the fiber is displaced, localized areas of higher and lower density are produced in a laid pattern, and the pattern is also created on the paper's surface. The pattern is therefore apparent both as one looks through the sheet and as one views its surface. Applying the laid pattern as a mechanical emboss would not create the ribbed pattern seen on looking through the sheet, as this is achieved only by watermarking techniques.|$|R
50|$|On {{lower speed}} {{machines}} at 700 feet per minute, gravity and {{the height of}} the stock in the headbox creates sufficient pressure to form the jet through the opening of the slice. The height of the stock is the head, which gives the headbox its name. The speed of the jet compared to the speed of the wire is known as the jet-to-wire ratio. When the jet-to-wire ratio is less than unity, the fibres in the stock become drawn out in the machine direction. On slower machines where sufficient liquid remains in the stock before <b>draining</b> out, the <b>wire</b> can be driven back and forth with a process known as shake. This provides some measure of randomizing the direction of the fibres and gives the sheet more uniform strength in both the machine and cross-machine directions. On fast machines, the stock does not remain on the wire in liquid form long enough and the long fibres line up with the machine. When the jet-to-wire ratio exceeds unity, the fibers tend to pile up in lumps. The resulting variation in paper density provides the antique or parchment paper look.|$|R
30|$|The US-guided PCNL {{technique}} has been explained elsewhere (Hosseini et al. 2009). Briefly, {{the patient is}} placed in the lithotomy position and, under general or epidural anesthesia, a 6 Fr ureteral catheter is passed into the ureter and kidney by cystoscope. After that the patient is repositioned in the prone position, and percutaneous access to the lower pole of the kidney is obtained under US guidance. It is safe and simple path for access to the lower pole and renal pelvis stone, however, for staghorn stones upper pole, and for pelvis stone, mid-pole calyx were recommended for access to all PCS, ureteropelvic junction and proximal ureter. Retrograde instillation of saline into the PCS was used for enhancing the degree of hydronephrosis and better visualization of the PCS. We used colour-Doppler US system with a 3.5 -MHz probe (BK Medical). At first, US was performed for detection of possible organs located between the puncture site on the skin to the kidney to prevent injury. Under guidance of the US, the lower calyx was punctured with an 18 -gauge nephrostomy needle. Then its stylet was removed and after <b>draining</b> urine, J-tip <b>wire</b> was sent into the PCS. An incision about 10 – 12  mm was made alongside the sheath of needle and got out it. We measured the length of the needle from the skin to PCS for estimation of dilators length. The antenna of the metallic telescopic dilator of the Wolf system was sent into the PCS on the wires. The tract was dilated up to 28 Fr in one step with cone-tip plastic or metallic dilator, and the Amplatz sheath was placed in the PCS. Nephroscopy was performed with a 24 French Wolf nephroscope and the stone was fragmented by pneumatic lithotripter (Lithoclast, EMS). The stone fragments were removed by forceps. In 11 cases who had solitary kidney, antegrade JJ stent was inserted and ureteral catheter was removed. Finally, the presence of any residual stones was checked with US. Floroscopy-guided PCNL was performed in cases in whom USG was failed.|$|R
30|$|A {{transverse}} concave proximal incision is {{made over}} the distal femur and proximal fibula. The fibula, patella and distal femur are exposed. Three lines outlining two visor flaps (like the visor on a motor cycle helmet) are marked. At the medial and lateral ends, the pedicle for each visor is kept as wide as possible. The proximal visor flap contains the patella. The distal visor flap is all capsular. In the Paley modification, the quadriceps muscle remains attached to the superior pole of the patella and no Z lengthening is done to the quadriceps tendon. This allows a new patella to form anterior to the femur. The proximal two visor incisions are made. The most inferior one is made after first detaching the biceps tendon laterally and the semitendinosis tendon medially. The medial head of the gastrocnemius muscle is identified. Dissection is carried out along the lateral border of this muscle to identify and protect the popliteal vessels. Once the vessels are protected, the inferior visor capsular incision is made. The perichondrium on the anterior surface of the patella is incised like the capital letter H, creating two flaps of perichondrium. The superior visor flap is brought under the inferior one to move it distally. If the patella is unossified, it is drilled in a T-shaped fashion to insert BMP 2. Bone wax is used to seal the anterior and posterior aspect of the drill hole in the patella after the BMP 2 is inserted {{in order to prevent}} leakage. The proximal fibular wires are exposed. The distal fibular wires are then exposed through a transverse incision {{at the tip of the}} distal fibular epiphysis. The dome of the talus and the distal fibula are exposed with the wires in place. The wires from the fibula are unbent and removed. New wires are immediately inserted. It is important to keep intramedullary wires in the fibula to prevent inadvertent fracture of the now osteoporotic fibula. The wires are retracted distally and the proximal epiphysis is cut across with a knife and then retracted proximally so that the distal epiphysis can be cut across. The fibular epiphyseal cuts expose the ossific nuclei of the proximal and distal fibula. The talus is cut across parallel to the sole of the foot exposing the talar ossific nucleus. The two wires are withdrawn proximally to align the distal epiphysis of the fibula with the ossific nucleus of the talus. The wires are then drilled antegrade through the talus and out the plantar aspect of the foot with the foot held 90 ° to the fibula. These wires are then withdrawn into the fibula. The upper end of the fibula can be slightly drilled to allow for insertion of the BMP 2 with the patella apposed to the fibula anterior drill hole in the patella opposed to the hole in the fibular epiphysis. The two wires exiting the foot are now advanced in a retrograde fashion through the patella, and the wires protruding on the patellar articular surface are bent 180 ° into a hook. The hook is advanced into the substance of the patella to pull the patella down to the fibula. These two wires need to be pulled below the articular surface to prevent their protrusion into the knee joint. The medial and lateral perichondral flaps are sutured to the side of the fibula. The visor flaps can now be sewn across to each other. At the junction of the quadriceps muscle the remnant of the patella and the muscle are sutured to the inferior visor flap, that was flipped upwards. The remnant of the patella is also sutured to this capsular flap. The inferior aspect of this capsular flap is sutured to the superior edge of the patella in its new position. The inferior aspect of the patella, which is now posterior, is sutured to the posterior capsule. The biceps and semitendinosis tendons are sutured to the lateral and medial aspects of the fibula respectively. The skin is closed in layers over a <b>drain.</b> The <b>wires</b> in the foot can be reinserted. The distal ring is fixed and tensioned to these three wires. The proximal and distal rings are connected with struts. A transverse wire is drilled into the distal fibula and then arced and tensioned to the foot ring, which compresses the ankle fusion site. The two hook wires exiting the plantar aspect of the foot are secured to the foot ring under slight tension.|$|R
