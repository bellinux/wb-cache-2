25|$|The ministry's Contingency Office deputy director, Liang Wannian, {{said the}} optimum {{objective}} of the flu vaccine was {{for the protection of}} <b>high-risk</b> <b>population,</b> especially people with basic illness and pregnant women. The first batch of China's A (H1N1) flu vaccine is expected to be ready by July, and would undergo a two-month clinical test before it is available in the market. China's flu vaccine strategy is to stockpile enough vaccine for one per cent of her population by 1 October, as a preventive measure to encounter any vast outbreak of the flu. Liang said China would take more severe and effective preventive measures at its many gateways and educate the people on the H1N1, also known as swine flu.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population. Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) is an important option for the <b>high-risk</b> <b>population</b> to consider. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure. In addition, RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer. Specifically, RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70% reduction of ovarian cancer risk. BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85% reduction. High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37% (BRCA1 mutation) and 64% (BRCA2 mutation) reduction of breast cancer risk. These benefits are important to highlight, as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population.|$|E

Furthermore, we assessed the influence of only testing <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations.</b> Materials & methods: A decision tree was used. Results: With a willingness-to-pay threshold of (sic) 20, 000 and (sic) 80, 000 per quality adjusted life year, a 100 % sensitive and specific test may have a maximum cost of (sic) 1. 30 and (sic) 1. 95, respectively.

40|$|Summary: Morocco {{has made}} {{significant}} strides in building its HIV research capacity. Based on a wealth of empirical data, {{the objective of this}} study was to conduct a comprehensive and systematic literature review and analytical synthesis of HIV epidemiological evidence in this country. Data were retrieved using three major sources of literature and data. HIV transmission dynamics were found to be focused in <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations,</b> with female sex workers (FSWs) and clients contributing the largest share of new HIV infections. There is a pattern of emerging epidemics among some <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations,</b> and some epidemics, particularly among FSWs, appear to be established and stable. The scale of the local HIV epidemics and populations affected show highly heterogeneous geographical distribution. To optimize the national HIV response, surveillance and prevention efforts need to be expanded among <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations</b> and in geographic settings where low intensity and possibly concentrated HIV epidemics are emerging or are already endemic...|$|R

RESULTS: The number of HIV infections averted in 5 years with $ 1 million in annual prevention spending ranges from 164 in <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations</b> to 0. 4 in very-low-risk populations. Fortyfold to two-hundredfold differences in prevention costs could equalize HIV infections averted.

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the {{community}} health promotion project is to collaborate with community partners to promote human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) awareness and screening among <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations.</b> Background. HIV infection is prevalent among <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations</b> including intravenous drug users, commercial sex workers and {{men who have sex}} with men. Routine HIV screenings can lead to early detection of HIV infection and prevent acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and promote health. However, the overall rate of HIV screening is still low among <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations.</b> Barriers to screening include fear and stigma associated with requesting/seeking HIV screening and lack of patient and public education about HIV. Project Description. From August to December 2015, senior nursing students in a baccalaureate program collaborated with several community organizations to plan and implement an HIV awareness and screening promotion project among <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations.</b> Students designed and distributed HIV educational materials including flyers, posters, and surveys in downtown of a northwest city, at a local behavioral health center, and on campus of a state university. Students also conducted HIV screening and education at the local behavioral health center and on the state university campus. Outcomes. Students screened and educated 97 individuals in the community. Through the community health promotion project, students promoted HIV awareness and screening among high risk populations. Conclusions. Collaboration with community partners is an effective way to promote HIV prevention and screening. Future HIV prevention and screening should involve community partners with emphasis on HIV education and prevention...|$|R

40|$|Patients with {{schizophrenia}} and <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations</b> have elevated {{rates of}} eye movement abnormalities. However, {{it is not}} known whether these abnormalities are specific to eye movements or whether they are also found in more traditional domains of motor control. Most studies examining the motor function of patients with schizophrenia have involved patients treated with medication; abnormalities in motor function could be a result of treatment rather than the disease itself. If motor abnormalities are related to schizophrenia, they should also be found in neuroleptic-naïve patients and possibly in <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations</b> in whom eye movement abnormalities are also observed. We reviewed relevant empirical papers published in the last 35 years. Results suggest that approximately one-fifth of neuroleptic-naïve patients with schizophrenia have increased rates of parkinsonism and neurological soft signs. In <b>high-risk</b> <b>populations,</b> replicated findings include delayed motor development in preschizophrenia subjects, and poor motor skills in the offspring of patients with schizophrenia.
