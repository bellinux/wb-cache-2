40|$|Traditionally, bond {{insurers}} {{have provided}} guarantees of payments on municipal bonds, where defaults {{have been very}} limited. But since the late 1990 s they have become increasingly involved as guarantors of elements of various structured financial products: in particular, the credit enhancements provided by these entities have {{played an important role}} in making securities based on sub-prime loans attractive to a wide range of investors. It is this trend change in their activity that has become the focal point in concerns about the health of these entities that have grown during the financial turbulence. The note identifies three policy issues that arise in the context of the current challenges facing these entities and it draws some preliminary findings. First, while concerns regarding the potential financial stability implications of further downgrades and/or failures of some of these companies have ebbed somewhat from their peaks in early 2008, the situation still bears monitoring. Second, current developments raise questions regarding the role of financial guarantors in specific financial market segments. In this context, there appears to be a public interest in the continued availability of <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> <b>payments</b> on municipal bonds. Private solutions seem to be forthcoming. Third, transparency of the financial guarantee insurance sector is limited. In this context, the performance of credit rating agencies in providing guidance for investors regarding the quality of the guarantees provided by financial guarantors appears to have been uneven. ...|$|E

50|$|The Ruhrort-Crefeld District Gladbach Railway Company {{built the}} Homberg am Rhein via Krefeld to Viersen with {{a length of}} 33.6 {{kilometres}} and opened it on 15 October 1849. Because of financial difficulties, the company received a government <b>guarantee</b> <b>on</b> its interest <b>payments.</b> Under an agreement of 26 September 1846, {{it was agreed that}} the Prussian state would be responsible for both companies in order to promote construction and operation of the railways.|$|R
40|$|State {{guarantees}} to insurance policy-holders remove {{the need for}} counterparty credit risk assessment and create a moral hazard that may result in excessive risk-exposure and underpricing in the insurance industry. The arrangements at Lloyd’s <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> policies written by individual Lloyd’s syndicates {{can be expected to}} have similar effects. An analysis of the behaviour of Lloyd’s in the 1970 s and 1980 s provides a case study that demonstrates some of the practical consequences of this moral hazard: insurers with insufficient capital resources, excessive exposure to high-volatility catastrophe reinsurance business, and underpricing of risks. ...|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the product}} {{solutions}} that could be sold {{under the banner of}} Global Supply Chain Financing include, but are not limited to: 1.) Global asset-based lending (GABL) - Enables middle market companies to monetize off-shore or in-transit inventory. This results in increased liquidity to this class of borrower, 2.) Inventory finance - Enables companies that supply to large buyers to secure financing on inventory that they are required by buyers to hold. This results in an improvement in the net cash conversion cycle for the buyer while providing the supplier with capital at a reduced rate. 3.) Receivables management services - Provides third-party outsourcing of receivables management and collections process. It also provides financing of those receivables and <b>guarantees</b> <b>on</b> the <b>payment</b> of those receivables. 4.) Payables discounting -Provides third-party outsourcing of the payables process and leverages a buyer’s credit quality to obtain favorable financing rates for suppliers. This results in lower cost of capital for the supplier, a portion of which can be passed on to the buyer. 5) Insurance- Further mitigates trade risk through cargo, credit, and transaction dispute insurance.|$|R
50|$|The second {{consisted}} in <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>payment</b> <b>on</b> {{bills of}} exchange from third parties. If the third party issuing the bill would default, the accepting house would pay the bill itself. This guarantee of course was provided for a fee. This service need not have any connection with Dutch traders, or even with the Dutch entrepôt. It served international trade in general. Though this divorce between credit provision and trade has been interpreted as undermining Dutch trade itself {{in the age of}} relative decline of Dutch commerce, it probably was just a defensive move in a time of increasing foreign competition, protecting a share for Dutch commerce, and providing another outlet for commercial capital that would otherwise have been idle. The size of this business was estimated to be about 200 million guilders around 1773.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that the Reverend James Maxwell completed work on the Academy not approved by the Board of Trustees and personally <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payment.</b> <b>On</b> March 1, 1810, the Trustees heard the auditor's reports and found that the accounts of the Building Committee, chaired by Father Maxwell, were in a shambles. Reverend Maxwell had ordered finishing work on the Academy that had not been approved by the Board and had given his personal guarantee for payment. This was against the bylaws of the Board of Trustees and it was adopted that from that moment forward a strict enforcement of financial procedures would be observed. However, it is doubtful that Father Maxwell paid any heed to this directive. The Board's only recourse was to collect past due subscriber accounts. George Bullett, a Trustee, was appointed to collect accounts in the lead mining districts, and Elias Austin Elliott was appointed to complete a similar task in St. Louis.|$|R
40|$|In 1996 the G- 10 {{central banks}} {{launched}} a major campaign to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk. The chosen strategy {{was founded on}} the belief that the private sector, with the active support of the public sector, had the power to contain the risk that first came into focus {{at the time of the}} 1974 failure of Bankhaus Herstatt. Recognising, however, that success was not <b>guaranteed,</b> the Committee <b>on</b> <b>Payment</b> and Settlement Systems has monitored progress closely for two years to determine the need for further action. This report, prepared on behalf of the CPSS by its Steering Group on Settlement Risk in Foreign Exchange Transactions, concludes that encouraging progress has been made over the past two years but more needs to be done. Many individual institutions have significantly enhanced the way they manage their foreign exchange settlement exposures, groups of institutions have been working constructively on risk-reducing multicurrency services, and a number of key payment systems have benefited from useful improvements. However, many banks still do not manage their exposures appropriately and industry efforts have not yet realised their full risk-reducing potential. Thus, despite significant progress, the potential consequences of a disruption in the foreign exchange settlement process remain considerable. As a result, the G- 10 central banks hav...|$|R
50|$|In Canada {{the most}} common type of annuity is the life annuity, which is {{normally}} purchased by persons at their retirement age with tax-sheltered funds or with savings funds. The monthly payments from annuities with tax-sheltered funds are fully taxable when withdrawn as neither the capital or return thereon has been taxed in any way. Conversely income from annuities purchased with savings funds is divided between the return of capital and interest earned, with only the latter being taxable. An annuity can be a single life annuity or a joint life annuity where the payments are guaranteed until the death of the second annuitant. It is regarded as ideal for retirees as it is the only income of any financial product that is fully guaranteed. In addition, while the monthly payments are for the upkeep and enjoyment of the annuitants, any <b>guaranteed</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> non-registered annuities are continued to beneficiaries after the second death. This way the balance of the guaranteed payments supports family members and becomes a two-generation income.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Analysis of guaranteed loans to franchisees of a select franchise organization reviewed by GAO, approved from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2011, showed the Small Business Administration (SBA) approved {{a total of about}} $ 38. 4 million for 170 loans made by 54 lenders. SBA's <b>guaranteed</b> portion <b>on</b> these loans was approximately $ 28. 8 million. Of the total population of 170 loans, 74 loans defaulted, 55 of which (74 percent) originated from four lenders that had the highest loan volume and default rates on loans to the franchisees. SBA made guarantee payments of around $ 11 million on the defaulted loans to franchisees, including about $ 8. 5 million in <b>guarantee</b> <b>payments</b> <b>on</b> the 55 defaulted loans from these four lenders. Of the 88 loans reviewed from the four lenders, 55 (63 percent) defaulted. In comparison, 19 of the 82 loans (23 percent) that originated at the other 50 lenders to the franchisees defaulted. As part of GAO's investigative work, GAO interviewed the owners of 22 franchisees of the franchise organization in GAO's review, of which 16 defaulted on their loans and 10 filed for bankruptcy protection. Interviewed franchisees noted difficulties meeting anticipated revenue estimates and limited access to information that would aid in business planning. ...|$|R
5000|$|Mortgage lending {{is a major}} sector finance in the United States, {{and many}} of the {{guidelines}} that loans must meet are suited to satisfy investors and mortgage insurers. Mortgages are commercial paper and can be conveyed and assigned freely to other holders. In the U.S., the Federal government created several programs, or government sponsored entities, to foster mortgage lending, construction and encourage home ownership. These programs include the Government National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (known as Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (known as Freddie Mac). These programs work by offering a <b>guarantee</b> <b>on</b> the mortgage <b>payments</b> of certain conforming loans. These loans are then securitized and issued at a slightly lower interest rate to investors, and are known as mortgage-backed securities (MBS). After securitization these are sometimes called [...] "agency paper" [...] or [...] "agency bonds". Whether or not a loan is conforming depends on the size and set of guidelines which are implemented in an automated underwriting system. Non-conforming mortgage loans which cannot be sold to Fannie or Freddie are either [...] "jumbo" [...] or [...] "subprime", and can also be packaged into mortgage-backed securities. Some companies, called correspondent lenders, sell all or most of their closed loans to these investors, accepting some risks for issuing them. They often offer niche loans at higher prices that the investor does not wish to originate.|$|R
