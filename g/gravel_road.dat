40|$|<b>Gravel</b> <b>roads</b> form a large {{percentage}} of the road network in Sweden. The public road network under the jurisdiction of the Swedish National Road Administration has a total length of some 98, 000 kilometres. About 22, 000 km of this network consists of <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> In addition, there are about 74, 000 kilometres of private road and 210, 000 kilometres of forest roads.

5|$|Around 1932, a <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> from SR 219 to SR 32 {{was built}} in Auglaize County, and was {{designated}} as SR 364 two years later. In 1936, the designation was extended southward along a <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> from its terminus at SR 219. This changed the southern terminus to SR 705, east of Osgood in Darke County. SR 364's northern terminus, SR 32, was renumbered to SR 54 in 1938, and it was renumbered again to SR 29 one year later. The section of SR 364 from SR 219 to SR 29 was also paved at this time. All of the highway was paved by 1940. In 1973, SR 29 was realigned northward to a divided highway, and its old alignment became part of SR 703. SR 364 was also extended to SR 29 via a concurrency with SR 703.|$|E

50|$|The {{district}} is serviced by {{a network of}} surfaced and <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> The main highways are the Mutare-Nyanga A15 highway and the Selbourne to Honde Valley road. During the rainy season {{some parts of the}} district are inaccessible by road due to the bad state of roads. The district council does not have the capacity to maintain <b>gravel</b> <b>roads,</b> hence the District Development Fund(DDF) is now maintaining most of the <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> In Honde Valley some areas are only accessible only by four-wheel-drive enabled vehicles due to the terrain.|$|R

In Wyoming, the major tributary is Goose Creek, which flows out of a basin with Sheridan, Wyoming at its center, and so this entire basin area has well-developed paved and <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> In addition to the roads that run along the Tongue and its major tributaries, there is a network of <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> that cross the highlands between the stream valleys.|$|R
5|$|At this point, much of {{the assumed}} route was a <b>gravel</b> <b>road.</b> Only the section south of Orono was paved. The Lindsay to Norland section was paved in the 1940s, and north of that point {{beginning}} in 1954. It would take until 1958 for paving to commence south of Lindsay.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{was built}} around 1956, as a <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> from US 61 in Vicksburg, to MS 1 in Fitler. The {{southern}} terminus was moved in 1960 to near Redwood, and the highway was completely paved by 1984.|$|E
5|$|What is now MS 5 {{originally}} existed as an unnumbered {{unpaved road}} by 1928. The MS 5 designation was assigned by 1932 {{for the road}} running from US 78 in Hickory Flat to the Tennessee border in Michigan City, where it connected to SR 18. This road was a <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> south of Ashland and an earth road north of Ashland. Two years later, the portion north of Ashland became a <b>gravel</b> <b>road.</b> In 1943, the northern terminus of MS 5 was cut back to its current location at US 72, with MS 7 connecting to SR 18 at the Tennessee border. By 1948, the portion of route south of Ashland was paved. The remainder of the route was paved three years later. Since then, the route has not undergone any alignment changes.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{traffic flow}} on low-volume <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> and {{deficiencies}} of national road infrastructure, are increasingly apparent in Lithuania. <b>Gravel</b> <b>roads</b> do {{not comply with}} requirements, resulting in low driving comfort, longer travelling time, faster vehicle amortization, and dustiness. The control of dustiness {{is one of the}} most important road maintenance activities on <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> Another important issue is the assurance of required driving comfort and safety. Soft asphalt and Otta Seal technologies were proposed as a sustainable solution for the improvement of low-volume roads in Lithuania. Five <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> were constructed with soft asphalt, and 13 <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> were sealed with double Otta Seal, in 2012. The main aim of this research was to check soft asphalt and double Otta Seal’s ability to self-heal, on the basis of the results of the qualitative visual assessment of pavement defects and distress. The qualitative visual assessment was carried out twice a year following the opening of the rehabilitated road sections. The results confirmed soft asphalt and double Otta Seal’s ability to self-heal. The healing effect was more than 13 % and 19 % on roads with soft asphalt and double Otta Seal, respectively. In addition, on some roads, all cracks observed in spring self-healed during summer...|$|R

The highway was still a <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> when the designation was removed by 1960.|$|E

5|$|The Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) {{designated}} M-149 along a <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> in late 1930; {{the highway}} provided access from US2 northerly to Palms Book State Park. A second highway, the first creation of M-125, was formed later in 1931 along another <b>gravel</b> <b>road</b> to connect US2 southerly with the Thompson State Fish Hatchery. When US2 was rerouted in the Manistique area in 1936, that highway was moved further south closer to Lake Michigan; M-149 was extended eastward along {{a section of}} the paved highway formerly a part of US2 to connect with M-125 at the Indian Lake State Park. From that point south, M-149 replaced M-125 to Thompson. The former routing of US2 became CR442 except for the section used to extend M-149. In the latter half of 1960 or the beginning of 1961, the MSHD paved the sections of M-149 north and south of the former US2 segment, completely hard-surfacing the roadway for the first time.|$|E

40|$|Dust is {{a health}} concern {{because of its}} {{potential}} to contain respirable particles (PM 10 or PM 2. 5). It is also a nuisance issue for residents living {{in the vicinity of}} <b>gravel</b> <b>roads.</b> Although numerous techniques are used in attempts to reduce the dust generated from <b>gravel</b> <b>roads,</b> all have limitations and the search for more effective means of reducing dust levels from <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> continues. Anecdotal evidence suggests that dust from <b>gravel</b> <b>roads</b> is reduced for roads that incorporate a geotextile separator. Geotextile separators offer the potential to reduce dust while providing enhanced driving characteristics and reduced maintenance of the roads. Quantitative information is needed to determine if indeed the geotextile does reduce the amount of dust and if so, what the effectiveness level is. A field monitoring program has been designed and implemented {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} geotextiles to reduce dust. In the first field trial, dust levels for the geotextile sections were reduced by three to five times compared to the background dust levels. Non-woven, needle-punched and non-woven, spunbonded geotextiles provided about the same level of dust reduction...|$|R
