40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{numerical}} {{results for the}} problem of ‘high’ (of order unity) <b>Knudsen</b> number gas <b>flow</b> past a micro‐airfoil, for low flow velocity. The results are generated using an enhanced version of the transition probability matrix (TPM) method. The TPM is a non‐statistical kinetic method [1] for computing neutral particle transport in high <b>Knudsen</b> number <b>flows.</b> The problem of high Knudsen number, low Mach number gas flow has been studied in the past using several computational approaches, such as the Information Preservation (IP) method [2] and the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method [2]. For low Mach numbers, the DSMC approach suffers from statistical noise [3]. The IP method extends {{the range of the}} particle method by reducing the statistical noise of the approach. The need for a method which is capable of describing the particle distribution function for high <b>Knudsen</b> number <b>flows</b> at low flow velocities has led to an investigation of alternative kinetic approaches, such as the IP[4]. In this paper we present an altogether different approach to the problem of statistical noise, the transition probability matrix (TPM) method [1, 5, 6, 7]. We give a brief overview of the TPM method, and compare its strengths and weaknesses to those of the IP and DSMC methods.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} algorithm {{based on}} the Langevin equation has been recently proposed to simulate rarefied gas flows. Compared with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, the Langevin method is more efficient in simulating small <b>Knudsen</b> number <b>flows.</b> While it is well-known that the cell sizes and time steps should be smaller than the mean free path and the mean collision time, respectively, in DSMC simulations, the Langevin equation uses a drift term and a diffusion term to describe molecule movements, so no direct molecular collisions have to be modeled. This enables the Langevin simulation to proceed with a much larger time step than that in the DSMC method. Two critical issues in Langevin simulation are addressed in this paper. The first issue is how to reproduce the transport properties as that described by kinetic theory. Transport coefficients predicted by Langevin equation are obtained by using Green-Kubo formulae. The second issue is numerical scheme with boundary conditions. We present two schemes corresponding to small time step and large time step, respectively. For small time step, the scheme is similar to DSMC method as the update of positions and velocities are uncoupled; for large time step, we present an analytical solution of the hitting time, which is the crucial factor for accurate simulation. Velocity-Couette flow, thermal-Couette flow, Rayleigh-Bénard flow and wall-confined problem are simulated by using these two schemes.

40|$|We {{determine}} the size {{effect on the}} lattice thermal conductivity of nanoscale wire and multilayer structures formed in and by some typical semiconductor materials, using the Boltzmann transport equation and focusing on the <b>Knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> effect. For both types of nanostructured systems {{we find that the}} phonon transport is reduced significantly below the bulk value by boundary scattering off interface defects and/or interface modes. The <b>Knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> effects are important for almost all types of semiconductor nanostructures but we find them most pronounced in Si and SiC systems due to the very large phonon mean-free paths. We apply and test our wire thermal-transport results to recent measurements on Si nanowires. We further investigate and predict size effects in typical multilayered SiC nanostructures, for example, a doped-SiC/SiC/SiO$_ 2 $ layered structure that could define the transport channel in a nanosize transistor. Here the phonon-interface scattering produces a heterostructure thermal conductivity smaller than what is predicted in a traditional heat-transport calculation, suggesting a breakdown of the traditional Fourier analysis even at room temperatures. Finally, we show that the effective thermal transport in a SiC/SiO$_ 2 $ heterostructure is sensitive to the oxide depth and could thus be used as an in-situ probe of the SiC oxidation progress.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, shale {{reservoirs}} {{emerged as one}} of the fast growing hydrocarbon resources in the world unlocking vast reserves and reshaping the landscape of the oil and gas global market. Gas-condensate reservoirs represent an important part of these resources. The key feature of these reservoirs is the condensate banking which reduces significantly the well deliverability when the condensate forms in the reservoir below the dew point pressure. Although the condensate banking is a well-known problem in conventional reservoirs, the very low permeability of shale matrix and unavailability of proven pressure maintenance techniques make it more challenging in shale reservoirs. The nanoscale range of the pore size in the shale matrix affects the gas flow which deviates from laminar Darcy flow to <b>Knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> resulting in enhanced gas permeability. Furthermore, the phase behaviour of gas-condensate fluids is affected by the high capillary pressure in the matrix causing higher condensate saturation than in bulk conditions. A good understanding and an accurate evaluation of how the condensate builds up in the reservoir and how it affects the gas flow is very important to manage successfully the development of these high-cost hydrocarbon resources. This work investigates the gas <b>Knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> under condensate saturation effect and phase behaviour deviation under capillary pressure of gas-condensate fluids in shale matrix with pore size distribution; and evaluates their effect on well productivity.

In order to verify the computer code, the flow field in the slip regime is solved and compared with the results of Navier Stokes equation with the slip boundary condition.

Alternatively, the gas flow through micro-geometries can be investigated reliably using the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method.

The mixing process is assumed to be complete when the mass composition of each species deviates by no more than ± 1 % from its equilibrium composition. To enhance the mixing process, we focus on the effects of inlet-outlet pressure difference and the pressure ratios of the two incoming CO and N 2 streams on the mixing enhancement.

40|$|Selective {{removal of}} water from the Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) during {{reaction}} may allow the use of a cobalt catalyst with crystal size < 6 nm hence increasing the catalyst activity. Zeolite membranes are a potential route to in-situ water removal due to their chemical and thermal stability under FTS reaction conditions. Zeolite membranes with a low Si/ Al ratio are hydrophilic. It has been hypothesised that reducing the Si/ Al ratio will result in increased water selectivity and permeance. It is also hypothesised that the separation process can be modelled using the MaxwellStefan (MS) formulation. MFI zeolite membranes were synthesised on a-alumina supports, of varying Si/ Al ratio. Two synthesis techniques were used: viz. with and without the assistance of structure directing agents. The membrane physical properties were characterised by SEM and XRD. Membrane quality was evaluated using n-hexane porosimetry. Single gas and mixture separations were carried out. A trans-membrane pressure gradient was applied in single gas measurements. Binary and ternary mixture separations were carried out using a model reaction mixture that approximates FTS conditions. This mixture was fed to a Wicke-Kallenbach cell. The total pressure {{on both sides of the}} membrane was equal, with a sweep gas applied to remove the permeate. Single gas permeation measurements on a blank support shows that viscous and <b>knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> are the dominant transport mechanisms in the support. A single gas permeation model for the zeolite membranes show that viscous and <b>knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> still dominate in pure component measurements. This due to the high flux through the zeolite films. During mixture separations viscous and <b>knudsen</b> <b>flow</b> are negligible as there is no pressure gradient. Comparing pure component and binary mixture separations the flux of hydrogen decreases by more than two orders of magnitude for the binary case. In the binary system water adsorption results in blockage of pores hence hydrogen permeance is reduced. Binary H 20 /H 2 separation selectivity increases with decreasing Si/ Al ratio. Increasing temperature results in a decrease in this selectivity. Water adsorption decreases with increasing temperature hence hydrogen can permeate faster. With the addition of n-hexane as a third component, permeance of water and hydrogen decrease, however ternary H 20 /H 2 separation selectivity increases. The Maxwell-Stefan model developed does not predict binary hydrogen permeation well. Permeance is much higher than predicted by the model possibly due to defects. Ternary hydrogen permeance is however more accurately predicted. Water and n-hexane permeances are predicted well by the model...|$|E

40|$|With discretized {{particle}} velocity space, a unified gas-kinetic scheme for entire <b>Knudsen</b> number <b>flows</b> has been constructed {{based on the}} Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model (2010. J. Comput. Phys., 229, 7747 - 7764). In comparison with many existing kinetic schemes for the Boltzmann equation, besides accurate capturing of non-equilibrium flows, the unified method has no difficulty to get accurate solution in the continuum flow regime as well, such as {{the solution of the}} Navier-Stokes equations. More importantly, in the continuum flow regime, the time step used by the unified scheme is determined by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition, which can be many orders larger than the particle collision time. In some sense, the unified method overcomes the time step barrier for many kinetic methods, such as direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), direct Boltzmann solver and many other kinetic solvers. The unified scheme is a multiscale method, where the macroscopic flow variables and microscopic gas distribution function are updated simultaneously. In an early approach in the unified BGK (U-BGK) scheme, the heat flux in the BGK model is modified through the update of macroscopic flow variables, then this modification feeds back into the update of non-equilibrium gas distribution function. In this paper, we are going to develop a unified scheme for the Shakhov model, the so-called unified Shakhov (U-Shk), where the heat flux is corrected directly through the modification of gas distribution function. Theoretically, it will be shown that current U-Shk is more consistent than the U-BGK for the highly non-equilibrium flow computations. The study of shock structures from low to high Mach numbers will be presented and the simulation results will be compared with DSMC solutions as well as possible experimental measurements. The result improvement of U-Shk over U-BGK is clearly achieved. Based on the simulation results, now we fully believe that the unified scheme is an accurate and efficient flow solver in all <b>Knudsen</b> number <b>flow</b> regime...|$|R
