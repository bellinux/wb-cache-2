He stated: Money {{is the only thing that}} keeps them playing...If they earned the same money as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I was playing they'd have retired at 34 as <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and Australian cricket would be the better for it.|$|E

5|$|After Francia's death he was {{succeeded by}} Carlos Antonio López, (called ‘López I’ by some authors, a {{convenient}} if inaccurate designation), {{the father of}} Francisco Solano López (‘López II’). López <b>I</b> <b>did</b> open up Paraguay to foreign trade and technology, but the steamship made his country vulnerable to invasion and he understandably feared the machinations of his powerful neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Eight words spoken quietly, indifferently, without emotion. Eight short, simple words....For {{a part of}} {{a second}} I glimpsed my mother and my sisters moving away to the right. Tzipora held Mother's hand. I saw them {{disappear}} into the distance; my mother was stroking my sister's fair hair...and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not know that in that place, at that moment, I was parting from my mother and Tzipora forever.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> it {{deliberately}} {{and with}} all my power, because I felt that by nothing but the sacrifice of human life would the nation be brought to realise the horrible torture our women face!

50|$|I am wiser {{than this}} man, for {{neither of us}} appears to know {{anything}} great and good; but he fancies he knows something, although he knows nothing; whereas <b>I,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know anything, so <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not fancy <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> In this trifling particular, then, I appear to be wiser than he, because <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not fancy <b>I</b> know what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know.|$|R
5000|$|The campaign, {{utilizes}} {{the slogan}} [...] "I do want change", and is articulated in six fundamental points: [...] "I <b>do</b> not repudiate, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not assist, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not snitch, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not follow, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not cooperate, and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not repress." [...] Furthermore, {{as a symbolic}} gesture of non-cooperation with the Cuban regime, {{members of the organization}} cross their arms over their chests.|$|R
5|$|I had to {{therefore}} {{come up with}} my {{own decisions}} about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to think it works.|$|E
5|$|I {{should not}} be {{surprised}} if this were to terminate in my death. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not expect to encounter what has beset me since my elevation to the Presidency. God knows I have endeavored to fulfill what I conceived to be an honest duty. But I have been mistaken. My motives have been misconstrued, and my feelings most grossly outraged.|$|E
5|$|It's my {{definitive}} {{statement in}} regards to the incredible pay-back I've received for having the nerve to talk about the things that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{in the past few years}} with my Sex book and my record. It's getting it off my chest. It is defensive, absolutely. But it's also sarcastic, tongue-in-cheek. And I'm not sorry. I do not apologize for any of it.|$|E

60|$|No, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not want}} to raise people using my own {{position}} as a standard, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not want to}} be one of a gang of consciously superior people, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want arrogantly to change the quality of other lives. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to interfere with other lives, except incidentally--incidentally, in this way that <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to get to an understanding with them, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> want to share and feel with them in our commerce with the collective mind. <b>I</b> suppose <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not stretch language very much when I say I {{want to get rid of}} stresses and obstacles between our minds and personalities and to establish a relation that is understanding and sympathy.|$|R

5|$|Last year I decided I'm {{not doing}} music until I'm excited again, then this {{came along and}} also <b>I</b> <b>did</b> end up making another record which I'll release at some point. It's just being mastered, it's a lovely album; I didn't write this one, this is old songs and I have to sort out my situation- I don't want the same problem as before.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to {{everything}}. For me, everything that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like <b>I</b> <b>did</b> anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
5|$|The end of World War <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not see the}} end of {{fighting}} for the Indian Army—they were involved in the Third Afghan War in 1919, and then the Waziristan Campaign in 1919–1920 and again in 1920–1924. Operations against the Afridis in 1930–1931, the Mohmands in 1933 and again in 1935 and finally just before the outbreak of World War II operations in Waziristan again in 1936–1939.|$|E

5|$|The show {{consisted}} of four segments with each segment being {{followed by an}} interlude to the next segment, and it ended with an encore. The show began with Spears descending from a giant orb. Most of the songs displayed energetic dance routines {{with the exception of}} the second segment, which featured mostly ballads. The encore {{consisted of}} a performance with pyrotechnics. The Oops!... <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> It Again Tour received positive reviews from critics, who praised Spears's energy onstage as well as the band. It was also a commercial success, the reported dates by Billboard averaged $507,786 in grosses and nearly 15,841 in attendance, bringing a total of $43.6 million and more than 1.4 million of tickets and became one of the highest grossing tours of 2000. The Oops!... <b>I</b> <b>Did</b> It Again Tour was broadcast by many channels around the world.|$|E
5|$|Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I mostly {{only know}} things are {{different}} because people ask me different questions, but I don't feel like things are very changed. I mean, I still, I {{do the same things}} that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before … I think about the same things, so … I'm the wrong kind of person to be really big and famous.|$|E
