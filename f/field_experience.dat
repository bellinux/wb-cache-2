5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Brazil in 1915, {{for the purpose of}} capturing more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this his introduction to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Like Ney, Friedrich Freiherr von Hotze, the Austrian commander, {{was also}} a cavalry officer. Unlike Ney, he had broad <b>field</b> <b>experience.</b> The Swiss-born Hotze had entered the {{military}} service of the Duke of Württemberg in 1758 and had been promoted to Rittmeister, or captain of cavalry; he had campaigned briefly in the Seven Years' War, but saw no combat. Later, {{he served in the}} Russian army in the Russo-Turkish War (1768–74). With an Austrian commission, he joined the Habsburg imperial army, and served in the brief War of the Bavarian Succession (1778–79). His campaigning in the War of the First Coalition, particularly at the Battle of Würzburg, had earned him the confidence of Archduke Charles and elevation to the ranks of nobility by Charles' brother, Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor.|$|E

40|$|<b>Field</b> <b>experiences</b> {{are defined}} as {{situations}} that provide pre-service teachers (PTs) actual contact with students in a natural setting while allowing {{for the possibility of}} manipulating instructional variables (Seiforth & Samuel, 1979).

This also applies to our theoretical framework, where such a focus supports the assertion that mutuality and reciprocity among the campus and community, {{in this case the}} service learning course and school site, respectively, are the cornerstones to service learning [47].|$|R

The pilot controls blade pitch with tubes running inside the mast and rotor blades to move servo flaps that pitch the blades, reducing required force and avoiding the added weight, cost and maintenance of hydraulic controls.|$|E
25|$|The initial {{requirement}} was {{to raise}} an artillery regiment, an engineer squadron, an infantry battalion, a medical unit, and a service corps company. For {{much of the}} 1950s the army was preoccupied {{with the task of}} building itself and training existing and new personal. To this aim the British Army Training Team (BATT) advisory group carried out training for ex-members of the CDF within the Ceylon Army, senior officers were sent to the British Army Staff College, Camberley and some attached to units of the British Army of the Rhine to gain <b>field</b> <b>experience.</b> New officers were sent for training at Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst which continued until the 1960s and both officers and other ranks were sent to specialist training courses in Britain, India, Pakistan and Malaya. There were no formations and all units were structured to directly function under the Army Headquarters. However temporary field headquarters were to be formed at the time requirement arose.|$|E

25|$|Holý's <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> {{among the}} Berti people of Pakistan {{allowed him to}} {{undertake}} an extensive study of cousin marriage in their culture. Holý believed {{that many of his}} findings could generalize to other Middle Eastern groups. He noted that stated reasons for cousin marriage could be both pragmatic and symbolic. Stated pragmatic reasons for cousin marriage might be stated in terms of advantages for the husband such as warmer relations with his father-in-law, quicker entertainment of the husband's family by the wife {{in the case of a}} visit due to them being her relations, greater loyalty and devotion of the wife, and the ease of regaining a wife after a serious quarrel where she has withdrawn to the house of her own family. Stated pragmatic reasons for the parents included gaining access to the labor of a daughter's children by marrying her to a kinsman and thereby keeping her family close by, increased attentiveness on the part of a wife to her aging in-laws if she is related to them, and the ease of marital negotiations if the parents are brothers, or in the next best case, if the mother of one child is the sister of the father of the other child.|$|E
25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of <b>field</b> <b>experience,</b> penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing the plow to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks the plow into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes the plow to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes the plow to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E

500|$|While {{the main}} Habsburg army faced Frederick at the Elbe, a smaller army {{under the command}} of Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon guarded the passes from [...] Saxony [...] and Lusatia into Bohemia. Laudon was another battle-hardened and cagey {{commander}} with extensive <b>field</b> <b>experience,</b> but even he could not cover the long frontier completely. Shortly after Frederick crossed into Bohemia, Prince Henry, a brilliant strategist in his own right, maneuvered around Laudon's troops and entered Bohemia at Hainspach. To avoid being flanked, Laudon withdrew across the Iser River, but by mid-August, the main Austrian army was in danger of being outflanked by Henry on its left wing. At its center and right, it faced a well-disciplined army commanded by Frederick, arguably the best tactical general of the age and feared for his victories against France and Austria in the previous war.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} in cocking and firing the weapon, it did have several advantages; its barrel {{did not have to}} be replaced or require high-grade materials that were expensive to produce, there was little muzzle blast that could give the user's position away, and the size of the barrel meant it could accommodate relatively large calibre munitions. However, the weapon did have drawbacks. It was very heavy and bulky, which meant that it was quite unpopular with the British and Commonwealth troops who were issued with it. There were also problems with ammunition reliability and accuracy. Although the PIAT was theoretically able to penetrate approximately [...] of armour, <b>field</b> <b>experience</b> during the Allied invasion of Sicily, which was substantiated by trials conducted during 1944, demonstrated that this capability was often nullified by problems of accuracy and round reliability.
