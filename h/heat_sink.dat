5|$|Servicing Mission 2, {{flown by}} Discovery in February 1997, {{replaced}} the GHRS and the FOS with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS), replaced an Engineering and Science Tape Recorder {{with a new}} Solid State Recorder, and repaired thermal insulation. NICMOS contained a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> of solid nitrogen to reduce the thermal noise from the instrument, but shortly after it was installed, an unexpected thermal expansion resulted in part of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> coming into contact with an optical baffle. This led to an increased warming rate for the instrument and reduced its original expected lifetime of 4.5 years to about 2 years.|$|E

40|$|A common {{challenge}} in low temperature instrumentation is adequately <b>heat</b> <b>sinking</b> signal wires between room temperature and devices at base temperature. Using cryostat space for adequate <b>heat</b> <b>sinking</b> typically {{comes at the}} cost of complexity or experimental space. As such, it is useful to know how much <b>heat</b> <b>sinking</b> is adequate given the materials, heat sources and cooling capacities involved. We present a differential equation for modeling the heat flowing out of a flat cable along an interval over which it is adhered to an insulating interface which is bound to a metallic <b>heat</b> <b>sinking</b> surface and numerical results for realistic <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> in the Kelvin range.

5|$|Most {{materials}} with high thermal conductivity are also electrically conductive, such as metals. In contrast, pure synthetic diamond has high thermal conductivity, but negligible electrical conductivity. This combination is invaluable for electronics where diamond {{is used as}} a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> for high-power laser diodes, laser arrays and high-power transistors. Efficient heat dissipation prolongs the lifetime of those electronic devices, and the devices' high replacement costs justify the use of efficient, though relatively expensive, diamond heat sinks. In semiconductor technology, synthetic diamond heat spreaders prevent silicon and other semiconducting materials from overheating.|$|E
5|$|One {{method is}} to use the ground as a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building by means of a ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity of the burning material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E

In this paper, different parameters of metalfoams in Y-shaped bifurcation microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> are designed and investigatednumerically. The effects of Reynolds number, porosity of metal foam, and the pore density(PPI) of the metal foam on the microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> are analyzed in detail.

40|$|Based on the Constructal Theory, parallel-flow and {{counterflow}} microchannels <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> with bifurcations are {{put forward}} {{to manage the}} temperature nonuniformity and further reduce the temperature of microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> bottom plates. Several models with different lengths of bifurcations are designed, and the corresponding laminar fluid flow and heat transfer of all models have been investigated through numerical simulations.

The {{results show that the}} thermal performance of counterflow microchannel <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> is better than that of parallel-flow <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> for the same geometry, and bifurcation can improve the thermal performance for all cases.

5|$|Owing to air {{compression}} {{in front of}} the plane as it travelled at supersonic speed, the fuselage heated up and expanded by as much as 300mm (almost 1ft). The most obvious manifestation of this was a gap that opened up on the flight deck between the flight engineer's console and the bulkhead. On some aircraft that conducted a retiring supersonic flight, the flight engineers placed their caps in this expanded gap, wedging the cap when it shrank again. To keep the cabin cool, Concorde used the fuel as a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> for the heat from the air conditioning. The same method also cooled the hydraulics. During supersonic flight the surfaces forward from the cockpit became heated, and a visor was used to deflect much of this heat from directly reaching the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{industrial use}} of diamond is in cutting, drilling, grinding, and polishing. Most of these applications {{do not require}} large diamonds; in fact, most diamonds of gem-quality except for their small size can be used industrially. Diamonds are embedded in drill tips or saw blades, or ground into a powder for use in grinding and polishing applications. Specialized applications include use in laboratories as containment for high pressure experiments (see diamond anvil cell), high-performance bearings, and limited use in specialized windows. With the continuing advances {{in the production of}} synthetic diamonds, new applications are becoming feasible. Garnering much excitement is the possible use of diamond as a semiconductor suitable for microchips, and because of its exceptional heat conductance property, as a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> in electronics.|$|E
25|$|When the {{air flow}} through the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> decreases, this results in an {{increase}} in the average air temperature.

50|$|In a {{joint effort}} of the {{particle}} physics group of the University of Regensburg and the IBM Research and Development Laboratory Böblingen, Germany, a water-cooling solution for the compute nodes was developed which completely replaces the original fans and <b>heat</b> <b>sinks.</b> The processors are cooled by custom-designed copper <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> through which water flows directly. This minimizes the temperature difference between the compute cores and the coolant. A copper pipeline provides the water flow and is also thermally coupled to passive <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> for other components such as memory, chipset, and voltage converters.|$|R
25|$|The {{inlet air}} {{temperature}} relates strongly with the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base temperature. For example, if there is recirculation of air in a product, the {{inlet air temperature}} is not the ambient air temperature. The inlet air temperature of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is therefore higher, which also results in a higher <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base temperature.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{tests are}} one of the more popular ways to {{determine}} the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> thermal performance. In order to determine the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> thermal resistance, the flow rate, input power, inlet air temperature and <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base temperature need to be known. Vendor-supplied data is commonly provided for ducted test results. However, the results are optimistic and can give misleading data when heat sinks are used in an unducted application. More details on <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> testing methods and common oversights can be found in Azar, et al.|$|E
25|$|Another {{parameter}} {{that concerns}} the thermal conductivity of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> material is spreading resistance. Spreading resistance occurs when thermal energy {{is transferred from}} a small area to a larger area in a substance with finite thermal conductivity. In a <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> this means that heat does not distribute uniformly through the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> base. The spreading resistance phenomenon is shown by how the heat travels from the heat source location and causes a large temperature gradient between the heat source and {{the edges of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This means that some fins are at a lower temperature than if the heat source were uniform across the base of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This nonuniformity increases the heat sink's effective thermal resistance.|$|E

25|$|As power {{dissipation}} of components increases and component package size decreases, thermal engineers must innovate to ensure components won't overheat. Devices that run cooler last longer. A <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> design must fulfill both its thermal {{as well as}} its mechanical requirements. Concerning the latter, the component must remain in thermal contact with its <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> with reasonable shock and vibration. The <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> could be the copper foil of a circuit board, or a separate <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> mounted onto the component or circuit board. Attachment methods include thermally conductive tape or epoxy, wire-form z clips, flat spring clips, standoff spacers, and push pins with ends that expand after installing.|$|E
25|$|A <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is {{designed}} to maximize its surface area {{in contact with the}} cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air. Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> <b>Heat</b> <b>sink</b> attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or thermal grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> and the heat spreader on the device. A <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient and durable heat exchangers. First and foremost, copper is an excellent conductor of heat. This means that copper's high thermal conductivity allows heat to pass through it quickly. Aluminium is used in applications where weight is a big concern.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This makes sure that all the air goes through the channels formed by the fins of the <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> When the air flow is not ducted, a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.|$|E
25|$|In general, a <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> {{performance}} {{is a function}} of material thermal conductivity, dimensions, fin type, heat transfer coefficient, air flow rate, and duct size. To determine the thermal performance of a <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> a theoretical model can be made. Alternatively, the thermal performance can be measured experimentally. Due to the complex nature of the highly 3D flow in present applications, numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can also be used.
