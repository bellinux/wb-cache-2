The cephalon is effaced (smooth and mostly featureless), an evolutionary trend also seen in Illaenus and Trimerus, though not as pronounced as that of Bumastus. The <b>glabella</b> (the central lobe of the head) is almost fused to the fixigena.|$|E

2500|$|Subcision is {{a process}} used to treat deep rolling scars left behind by acne or other skin diseases. It {{is also used to}} lessen the {{appearance}} of severe <b>glabella</b> lines, though its effectiveness in this application is debatable. Essentially the process involves separating the skin tissue in the affected area from the deeper scar tissue. This allows the blood to pool under the affected area, eventually causing the deep rolling scar to level off {{with the rest of the}} skin area. Once the skin has leveled, treatments such as laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion or chemical peels can be used to smooth out the scarred tissue.|$|E

The {{skin of the}} mid-third of the nose covers the cartilaginous dorsum and the upper lateral cartilages and is relatively elastic, but, at the (far) distal-third of the nose, the skin adheres tightly to the alar cartilages, and is little distensible. The skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semi-rigid anatomic unit that maintains the graceful curve of the alar rim, and the patency (openness) of the nostrils (anterior nares). To preserve this nasal shape and patency, {{the replacement of the}} alar lobule must include a supporting cartilage graft—despite the alar lobule not originally containing cartilage; because of its many sebaceous glands, the nasal skin usually is of a smooth (oiled) texture. Moreover, regarding scarrification, when compared to the skin of other facial areas, the skin of the nose generates fine-line scars that usually are inconspicuous, which allows the surgeon to strategically hide the surgical scars.|$|E

60|$|Some {{time after}} the {{publication}} of the translation of Professor Schaaffhausen's Memoir, I was led to study the cast of the Neanderthal cranium with more attention than I had previously bestowed upon it, in consequence of wishing to supply Sir Charles Lyell with a diagram, exhibiting the special peculiarities of this skull, as compared with other human skulls. In order to do this it was necessary to identify, with precision, those points in the skulls compared which corresponded anatomically. Of these points, the <b>glabella</b> was obvious enough; but when I had distinguished another, defined by the occipital protuberance and superior semicircular line, and had placed the outline of the Neanderthal skull against that of the Engis skull, in such a position that the <b>glabella</b> and occipital protuberance of both were intersected by the same straight line, the difference was so vast and the flattening of the Neanderthal skull so prodigious (compare Figs. 22 and 24, A.), that I at first imagined I must have fallen into some error. And I was the more inclined to suspect this, as, in ordinary human skulls, the occipital protuberance and superior semicircular curved line on the exterior of the occiput correspond pretty closely with the 'lateral sinuses' and the line of attachment of the tentorium internally. But on the tentorium rests, as I have said in the preceding Essay, the posterior lobe of the brain; and hence, the occipital protuberance, and the curved line in question, indicate, approximately, the lower limits of that lobe. Was it possible for a human being to have the brain thus flattened and depressed; or, on the other hand, had the muscular ridges shifted their position? In order to solve these doubts, and to decide the question whether the great supraciliary projections did, or did not, arise from the development of the frontal sinuses, I requested Sir Charles Lyell to be so good as to obtain for me from Dr. Fuhlrott, the possessor of the skull, answers to certain queries, and if possible a cast, or at any rate drawings, or photographs, of the interior of the skull.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{observe the}} facial {{spectrum}} {{and color of}} different points, the positions of heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney of traditional Chinese medicine reflecting on the face, in healthy participants and those with a sub-health status, so as to provide an objective basis for health evaluation. METHODS: The health condition of 470 subjects without acute and chronic conditions was assessed using the Health Evaluating Questionnaire H 20 V 2009. The subjects were diagnosed with health (more than 80 score) or sub-health (score between 60 and 80) status according to the questionnaire score. The subjects with a sub-health status were also analyzed using the five-viscera syndrome differentiation of traditional Chinese medicine using the form for collecting information according to the four examinations. Then for gathering the facial color information, CIE L*a*b and C values and reflections of wavelengths ranged from 400 to 700 nm were measured using a CM- 2600 D spectrophotometer on 8 points of the face, including the frontal part, <b>glabellas,</b> nose, mandible, two cheeks and eyelids. RESULTS: L value of the sub-health group was {{higher than that of}} the health group (P< 0. 05), and a, b and C values were lower than those of the health group (P< 0. 05), suggesting that the facial complexion of the sub-health group was pale/whiter than the health group. The reflectance rates of wavelengths (from 400 to 550 nm) of the sub-health group were higher than those of the health group (P< 0. 05), which suggested that the facial complexion of the sub-health group was partially green. The a, b and C values of the forehead, <b>glabellas</b> and nose of subjects in the sub-health group were apparently different from the health subjects. L values of five-viscera types were significantly different from people of a health status (P< 0. 05). There were some differences in color values among the five-viscera groups: lung group’s color values were significantly different from the others in terms of a, b and C values. The spectral reflectance of different viscera groups of the sub-health group also showed certain differences: reflectance of wavelengths at 400 to 490 nm in the lung group and at 520 to 580 nm in the spleen group showed significant difference from the other groups, and the lung group was lower and the spleen group was higher than the others. CONCLUSION: There are some differences in facial spectrum and color in different sites of the face in sub-health status of different viscera syndrome types, which can provide an objective basis for health evaluation.
