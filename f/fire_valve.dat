50|$|Other PCP {{rifles and}} pistols are regulated, i.e. the <b>firing</b> <b>valve</b> {{operates}} within a secondary chamber {{separated from the}} main air reservoir by the regulator body. The regulator maintains the pressure within this secondary chamber at a set pressure (lower than the main reservoir's) until the main reservoir's pressure drops {{to the point where}} it can no longer do so. As a result, shot to shot consistency is maintained for longer than in an unregulated rifle.|$|R

5000|$|In practice, the {{arrangement}} {{had a number}} of disadvantages. Cracks developed in the oil bath casing due to incorrect welding procedure. Condensation caused corrosion, and oil leaked out through inadequate seals, causing wheelslip and <b>fire</b> hazards. <b>Valve</b> timing was highly unpredictable; this has been attributed to chain stretch, although Bulleid claimed that it was allowed for. The chains were replaced as part of a valve and piston examination at around 30,000 to 36,000 mi, by which time they were considerably worn. This wear, in the chain pins and sprockets, could result in an elongation of the chains by as much as 6 in. Bulleid asserted that a slack of 3 in would be absorbed by the chain coming under load, with the remaining valve irregularity corrected by adjusting the cut-off.|$|R

50|$|The {{very first}} {{internal}} combustion engines did not compress the mixture. The {{first part of}} the piston downstroke drew in a fuel-air mixture, then the inlet valve closed and, in the remainder of the down-stroke, the fuel-air mixture <b>fired.</b> The exhaust <b>valve</b> opened for the piston upstroke. These attempts at imitating the principle of a steam engine were very inefficient.There are a number of variations of these cycles, most notably the Atkinson and Miller cycles. The diesel cycle is somewhat different.|$|R
50|$|Propellants {{are forced}} into the {{combustion}} chamber by compressed air, stored at 200 bar in two steel vessels. This pressure is released through an electrically-fired cartridge that opens a valve with a blow-out disc. This is {{the full extent of}} the electrical control system. Once <b>fired,</b> the <b>valve</b> does not close again. A pressure regulator delivers air at 33 bar, through a shuttle valve that pressurised first the catalyst tanks and then the propellant tank. This delay ensures reliable ignition in the combustion chamber. A non-return valve ensures that no catalyst can flow backwards into the air or propellant plumbing, with an explosive result. A rubber diaphram, broken as propellant pressure builds, ensures that there is no backflow through the combustion chamber either. Z-stoff was known for problems of clogging injectors and so an inline filter was used.|$|R

The resulting damage was estimated at $700,000 and the three faced felony criminal damage to property charges.|$|R
5000|$|Most <b>fire</b> hydrant <b>valves</b> are not {{designed}} to throttle the water flow; {{they are designed to}} be operated full-on or full-off. The valving arrangement of most dry-barrel hydrants is for the drain valve to be open at anything other than full operation. Usage at partial-opening can consequently result in considerable flow directly into the soil surrounding the hydrant, which, over time, can cause severe scouring. Gate or butterfly valves can be installed directly onto the hydrant orifices to control individual outputs and allow for changing equipment connections without turning off the flow to other orifices. These valves can be up to 12 inches in diameter to accommodate the large central [...] "steamer" [...] orifices on many US hydrants. It is good practice to install valves on all orifices before using a hydrant as the protective caps are unreliable and can cause major injury if they fail.|$|R
50|$|A {{floating}} ball valve {{is one where}} the ball is not {{held in place by}} a trunnion. In normal operation, this will cause the ball to float downstream slightly. This causes the seating mechanism to compress under the ball pressing against it. Furthermore, in some types, in the event of some force causing the seat mechanism to dissipate (such as extreme heat from <b>fire</b> outside the <b>valve),</b> the ball will float all the way to metal body which is designed to seal against the ball providing a somewhat failsafe design.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} rupture, the {{pipeline}} control operators detected a sudden change in pumping pressure (indicating possible rupture or severe leakage) in the area, {{but failed to}} take immediate action {{to stop the flow}} of product.

At this point, two burning streams of propane were shooting out of the car, one horizontal from the transfer valve, and one vertical from the safety valve. The heat from the streams of burning propane continued to heat the tank, increasing pressure to dangerous levels.|$|R
50|$|This signal {{indicates}} that {{a portion of the}} building's fire protection system has been disabled (such as a <b>fire</b> sprinkler control <b>valve</b> being closed and, consequently, a sprinkler tamper switch being activated), or, less frequently, that a lower priority initiating device has been triggered (such as a duct smoke detector). Depending on the system's design, the supervisory point may be latching, meaning the panel must be reset to clear the supervisory condition, or non-latching, meaning the indicator automatically goes out when the condition has cleared. However, some panels require a reset regardless of whether the supervisory point is latching or non-latching.|$|R
50|$|Gaseous fire {{suppression}} {{is a term}} to describe the use of inert gases and chemical agents to extinguish a fire. Also called clean agent {{fire suppression}}.

50|$|An {{additional}} {{function of}} the PU Valve was to provide thrust variations {{in order to maximize}} payload. The second stage, for example, operated with the PU valve in the closed position for more than 70% of the <b>firing</b> duration. This <b>valve</b> position provided 225000 lbf kN of thrust at a 5.5:1 propellant (oxidizer to fuel by weight) mixture ratio (when the PU valve was fully open, the mixture ratio was 4.5:1 and the thrust level was 175000 lbf kN). During the latter portion of the flight, the PU valve position was varied to provide simultaneous emptying of the propellant tanks. The third stage also operated at the high-thrust level {{for the majority of the}} burning time in order to realize the high thrust benefits. The exact period of time at which the engine operated with the PU valve closed varied with individual mission requirements and propellant tanking levels.|$|R
