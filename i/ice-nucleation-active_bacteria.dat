40|$|Not {{every cell}} {{of a given}} {{bacterial}} isolate that has ice-nucleating properties can serve as an ice nucleus {{at any given time}} and temperature. The ratio between the number of ice nuclei and number of bacterial cells in a culture (i. e. nucleation frequency) was found to vary with incubation temperature, growth medium composition, culture age, and genotype. Optimal conditions for ice nucleus production in vitro included incubation of the bacterial cells at 20 to 24 °C on nutrient agar containing glycerol. The relationship between nucleation frequency and frost injury was examined by subjecting corn seedlings to − 4 °C immediately after they were sprayed with bacterial suspensions with different nucleation frequencies and by following both ice nucleus concentration and bacterial population size on leaves of corn seedlings as a function of time after bacterial application. The amount of frost injury to growth chamber-grown corn seedlings at − 4 °C was a function of the number of ice nuclei active at that temperature on the leaves. The number of ice nuclei, in turn, is the product of the nucleation frequency and population size of <b>ice-nucleation-active</b> <b>bacteria</b> present on the leaves...|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that the {{presence}} of <b>ice-nucleation-active</b> (INA) <b>bacteria,</b> such as Pseudomonas syringae and Erwinia herbicola, will result in ice formation several degrees centigrade higher than would otherwise occur. Seven possible chemical frost protectants were applied to Lisbon lemons of the Yuma Mesa Ag Center. Four replications of effectiveness of the materials were evaluated by determining tip bum and fruit damage following two subfreezing episodes in December 1987. There were no statistically significant differences between treatments under the conditions of this study...|$|R
