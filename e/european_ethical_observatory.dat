40|$|This article {{analyses}} the {{recourse to}} {{religion as a}} source of law in the legal and political order of the European Union. It demonstrates that the legitimacy of religious input into law is recognised institutionally, symbolically and substantively. However, religious influence within the Union’s public order must accommodate cultural and humanist influences that can serve to limit attempts to reflect religious teaching in law and which are particularly restrictive of the influence of outsider faiths whose demands cannot be routed through culture and those faiths with extensive political ambitions. Thus, the Union’s approach is characterised by a complex and shifting balance between religious, cultural and humanist influences which is struck in a pluralist context that attempts to reconcile the differing balances between such influences in individual Member States with the need to maintain the open and sufficiently religiously neutral common <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> framework necessary for the functioning of the Union as a polity.

40|$|The {{figure of}} the Other stands {{prominently}} at the centre of debates concerning European social and political identity. Notwithstanding the centrality of such a notion, the {{figure of the}} Other appears as underdeveloped. Who is, theoretically speaking, the Other? And what does the proposition tell us about the way in which Europe understands itself? This article explores these questions by analysing problems in the legal framework of EU citizenship and immigration law as well as in its national implementation. This legal framework is symptomatic of a profound malaise affecting Europe. Increasingly adopting a strategy based on the principle of “revolving doors” as a means of dealing with outsiders, Europe treats the Other as a “Xenos”, an alien form of life which is included yet distrusted, welcomed yet under threat of expulsion. This conception of the Other as Xenos reflects a solipsistic, static and auto-referential idea of Europe, one that ultimately prevents the formation of a pluralistic and multifaceted European identity, and endangers the <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> and political project as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ethical {{investing}} {{is growing}} in importance due to investors’ concern with environmental and social issues. However, there is difference of opinion regarding {{the extent to which}} the limited investment universe affects the financial return of ethical investments. Recent empirical findings suggest that while there is no statistically significant difference in the returns of ethical and conventional funds, ethical funds tend to be less risky due to having better managed firms in the portfolio. More nuanced conclusions are drawn by Nofsinger and Varma (2014) who provide evidence that US ethical mutual funds outperform conventional funds in times of crisis at the cost of underperformance in non-crisis times, indicating that ethical funds are “safer” investments. Purpose: This thesis builds on the latter findings, focusing on the European market instead. Its purpose is to examine whether <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> mutual funds are safer than European conventional mutual funds in times of crisis and non-crisis. An analysis of the ethical funds’ screening-styles, returns and risk factor loadings will be performed to explain their volatility relative to conventional funds. The empirical investigation is based on a matched pair analysis of 33 <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> mutual funds and 33 European conventional mutual funds with a European investment universe between 01 - 2005 and 01 - 2015. Method: Volatility in the funds’ returns is estimated econometrically by means of three types of GARCH models (GARCH, TGARCH and EGARCH). To explain volatility differences, we moreover calculate the funds’ risk factor loadings from a five factor model. In addition, we test to what degree the variance in the ethical funds’ returns is influenced by screening techniques, and whether there are any significant differences regarding the techniques being applied. Conclusion: Basedonthevariance,weobservethatethicalfundshavealowermeanreversionfroma shock and greater exposure in the volatility to certain market news. We moreover show that they are less exposed to systematic market risk and small firms. During the crisis we find that ethical funds react more to certain market news but less exposed to the systematic market risk. The empirical results also suggest an overperformance of ethical funds in times of crisis at the expense of underperformance in times of non-crisis, indicating support for Nofsinger and Varma’s (2014) conclusion. The PRO/ESG screen exhibits an asymmetric return while the Best-in-Class approach has the highest return and lowest variance. ...|$|R

40|$|Driven by an {{interest}} in ethical fashion consumption and having identified the necessity for {{a clear understanding of}} consumer traits within this increasing phenomenon, we conducted a quantitative research, adopting a objectivist and positivist stance, involving over three-hundred young Swedish consumers. Positioning ourselves {{along the lines of the}} behavioral decision theory and assuming a positivist stance, we aimed to identify how young Swedish fashion consumers differ in personal values based on their ethical preferences. The empirical data, collected administering questionnaires among students of Lund University, enabled us to segment consumers based on their attitudes towards ethical fashion issues and consequently to establish their arrangement of personal values. This research contributes to a theoretical understanding and segmentation of ethical fashion consumers and consequently has a remarkable practical value for practitioners within the fashion industry. Four consumer segments are detected and fine nuances are defined using an extended and complete general personal values list such as the Schwartz’s Value Index.

40|$|I examine in {{this paper}} the {{experience}} of "resentment" in Chinese and <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> thinking, particularly in early Confucian ethics and in Nietzsche's genealogy of ressentiment. Self-cultivation is articulated in the Analects in light of issues of recognition and resentment. In contrast to European discourses of recognition and resentment, the compilers of the Analects recognized the pervasiveness of resentment under certain social conditions and the ethical demand to counter it both within oneself and in relation to others. In early Confucian ethics, resentment is understood {{in a variety of}} senses. Overcoming resentment in oneself and in others is a primary element of becoming a genuinely exemplary or noble person in the ethical sense; the ignoble person by contrast is fixated on his or her own limited and self-interested concerns. Whereas contemporary Western ethical theory typically assumes that symmetry and equality are the primary means of overcoming resentment, I examine how the asymmetrical recognition of the priority of the other appears necessary for overcoming resentment in the Analects. Early Confucian ethics integrates a nuanced and realistic moral psychology of resentment and the ethical self-cultivation necessary for dismantling it in promoting a condition of humane benevolence. Benevolence is oriented toward others even as it is achieved in the care of the self and self-cultivation...|$|R
40|$|Retrospective {{research}} is conducted on already available data and/or biologic material. Whether such research requires that patients specifically {{consent to the}} use of "their" data continues to stir controversy. From a legal and ethical point of view, it depends on several factors. The main criteria to be considered are whether the data or the sample is anonymous, whether the researcher is the one who collected it and whether the patient was told of the possible research use. In Switzerland, several laws delineate the procedure to be followed. The definition of "anonymous" is open to some interpretation. In addition, it is debatable whether consent waivers that are legally admissible for data extend to research involving human biological samples. In a few years, a new Swiss federal law on human research could clarify the regulatory landscape. Meanwhile, hospital-internal guidelines may impose stricter conditions than required by federal or cantonal law. Conversely, Swiss and <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> texts may suggest greater flexibility and call for a looser interpretation of existing laws.

40|$|The annual {{congress}} of the European Society of Anaesthesiology (ESA) {{is one of the}} largest anaesthesia congresses in the world and exhibits more than 1200 abstracts annually. The aims of this study were to quantify the frequency of inadequate evidence of ethical approval for abstracts submitted to the ESA congress and to examine whether abstracts without appropriate ethical approval were subsequently accepted. All abstracts submitted in 2015 were adjudicated according to <b>European</b> <b>ethical</b> criteria. The proportion of submitted abstracts that lacked evidence of appropriate ethics committee approval. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of accepted abstract that lacked evidence of appropriate ethical approval; the proportion of correctly identified case reports; the proportion of accepted abstracts that lacked evidence of appropriate ethics committee approvals corresponding to location (within/outside Europe); and the proportion of accepted abstracts that lacked evidence of appropriate ethics committee approvals corresponding to a specific area of research. In total, 1792 abstracts were reviewed and 1572 (87. 7 %) involved humans. In 527 (29. 4 %), the authors failed to demonstrate adequate ethical approval with higher rates in abstracts submitted from Europe (32. 1 %) than the rest of the world (23. 5 %), P  <  0. 001. Appropriate approvals were reported in 80 % of animal studies, 74. 6 % of case reports and 57. 6 % of human research studies.

The modern concept {{of the welfare state}} is moving towards or criticism or calls for modernization, opposed tolerant and critical approaches to the welfare state. Current models of the welfare state reflect new trends in society related to globalization, new market conditions, technology. The only coherent theory of the welfare state is now available. Differences in approaches have been largely the extent and limits of state intervention, the extent of security and social activities of the state. Constitutionally secured new approaches on which the welfare state provides only the basic needs of man, and the man himself has {{to take care of yourself}} and your family that is embodied in the concept of "employment state," "state, which promotes labor," "social investment state" "preventive model state.

The main content of the welfare state becomes gradually create the conditions for self-working person, primarily because labor activity. The center of gravity of the welfare state is transferred to facilitate the emergence of the highest number of effective jobs, promote entrepreneurship and self-employment to other forms of public support. Today there has been a common trend in the development of models of the welfare state on the one hand, the reduction of social programs, the desire to improve their cost-effectiveness and impact, and on the other - the expansion of social partnership, decentralization of power, strengthening regional (within the country) and local authorities. Thus there is a change in the role of both the state citizen. A person is not only an object of social policy, but also as an active subject of, user and producer of social services. In the typology of welfare state models must take into account the convergence of ideologies under the influence of globalization and individualization.

However, researchers struggle with significant regulatory heterogeneity; an enabling European Union (EU) -wide framework is missing. The {{aims of the}} study were to systematically review the evidence for best practice and to establish recommendations for collaborative research. The Paediatric Rheumatology European Single Hub and Access point for paediatric Rheumatology in Europe (SHARE) project enabled a scoping review and expert discussion, which then informed the systematic literature review. Published evidence was synthesised; recommendations were drafted. An iterative review process and consultations with Ethics Committees and <b>European</b> experts for <b>ethical</b> and legal aspects of paediatric research refined the recommendations. SHARE experts and patient representatives vetted the proposed recommendations at a consensus meeting using Nominal Group Technique. Agreement of 80 % was mandatory for inclusion. The systematic literature review returned 1319 records. A total of 223 full-text publications plus 22 international normative documents were reviewed; 85 publications and 16 normative documents were included. A total of 21 recommendations were established including general principles (1 - 3), ethics (4 - 7), paediatric principles (8 and 9), consent to paediatric research (10 - 14), paediatric databank and biobank (15 and 16), sharing of data and samples (17 - 19), and commercialisation and third parties (20 and 21).

40|$|This thesis {{offers a}} reading of the late Yugoslav writer Danilo Kiš by looking at how a {{particular}} tradition of <b>European</b> aesthetics and <b>ethical</b> philosophy (namely Levinas and Blanchot) can be compared to Danilo Kiš’s poetics. Beyond critically evaluating Kiš, I am to make connections between ethics, literature and philosophy. The major objective of my thesis is to argue that ethical is embedded as aesthetical in Kiš’s poetics as both Blanchotian and Levinasian understanding of ethics, i. e. as a non-dialectical and non-intentional movement from ‘I’ to the ‘other’ in the midst of passivity of dying (which is for both Blanchot and Levinas ‘other’ death). The thesis demonstrates {{that there are a number}} of strands in Levinas’s and Blanchot’s thought that, while differently expressed, can also be traced at work in Kiš’s writing, and which can, as such, help to elucidate certain crucial aspects of the latter. Taking into consideration Kiš’s obsessive writing on the violence of the last century – both left and right – I argue that what permeates his prose is death as both possibility and a radical impossibility consequent upon the il y a, a crucial philosophical concept in Levinas’s ethical philosophy and Blanchot’s literary ‘theory’. For this reason, the thesis aims to assert that what permeates Kiš’s prose is what Critchley terms ‘atheist transcendence’: the burden of responsibility for the death of the other human radically excludes theodicy. My research is significant in so far as conceptualisations of death to be found in continental European philosophy have hardly been directly juxtaposed with those found in Kiš’s prose. Since according to Blanchot, literature’s demand is always ambiguous and as such it exposes us to the question of being, in my thesis I analyse how this refusal of language to cease the tension of pluralism operates in Kiš’s prose as the ethical...|$|R

Mutations in genes that encode relevant proteins for synaptic functions are being increasingly identified in neuropediatric disorders. The present work {{is focused on}} synaptic dysfunction in Rett Syndrome, which is caused by mutation in the MECP 2 gene. This encodes for methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP 2), an essential epigenetic regulator in mammalian brain development. Rett syndrome {{is characterized by a}} period of cognitive decline, hand stereotypies, autistic traits and seizures, following an apparently normal early infancy. This disease can be classified as a synaptopathy, since it comprises simultaneously impairments in synaptogenesis, synaptic maturation and synaptic plasticity. There is evidence for the possibility of phenotypical rescue in Mecp 2 deficient mice models, but current treatments for Rett Syndrome are primarily symptomatic therapies for epilepsy or behavioral disturbances, and not for correction of the underlying brain abnormalities. The molecule γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory (hyperpolarizing) neurotransmitter in the adult brain, but has excitatory (depolarizing) action in the developing brain, when it binds to GABA A receptors. This functional shift is dependent of neuronal maturational changes that include differences in the expression of cation chloride cotransporters, which regulate intracellular chloride concentration. One of the key molecular changes for this process is a perinatal neuronal membrane upregulation of potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC 2), an ion cotransporter that extrudes chloride form the cell, together with sodium potassium chloride cotransporter 1 (NKCC 1), which transports choride into the cell. Deregulation of cation chloride cotransporters’ expression or function has been associated with neurodevelopmental disorders like neonatal seizures, fragile X, tuberous sclerosis, Down syndrome, underpinning the relevance of this balance for an adequate central nervous system postnatal development. In the present thesis, I describe a disturbed GABAergic maturational process in Rett Syndrome, regarding intracellular chloride regulation. Starting from the clinic, we searched for a method to detect synaptic proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid of pediatric patients. The earlier postnatal period is characterized by intense synaptogenesis and synaptic pruning, allowing the detection of these proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid, using immunoblot analysis. Since we were interested in GABAergic function maturation, and this process was dependent on the expression of NKCC 1 and KCC 2, abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid levels of these proteins were searched in Rett Syndrome patients and a decrease in KCC 2 was observed. In order to obtain a model to understand the impact of this reduction of KCC 2 in neuronal function, human iPSCs were reprogramed from Rett patients’ fibroblasts. Human skin biopsies were collected in accordance with <b>European</b> and National <b>ethical</b> regulation and induced pluripotent stem cells were generated from fibroblasts upon infection with a retroviral vector expressing the four canonical transcription factors (Oct 4, Sox 2, Klf 4, and Myc). Neural commitment of patient specific induced pluripotent stem cells was induced under defined conditions. Neuronal cortical populations were then derived in a monolayer culture system using a protocol that mimicks human cortical development in vitro. Perforated patch recordings were performed in these neurons, and GABA-evoked postsynaptic currents were measured to evaluate GABA A receptor equilibrium potencial. Our preliminary data indicates that recordings from MECP 2 mutant cells exhibit a GABA A receptor equilibrium potential that is more positive than in recordings from control cells, suggesting pathologic changes in chloride gradient, characteristic of an immature state. These results were complemented with experiments in the extensively characterized Mecp 2 knock out mouse model (Mecp 2 tm 1. 1 Bird/J). The level of KCC 2 protein expression is lower in Mecp 2 -KO mice, when compared to control littermates, as addressed by western blot analysis of 6 week old hippocampi. Moreover, hippocampal electrophysiological recordings show reduction of membrane resting potential and threshold potential in the Mecp 2 knock-out model, where synaptic transmission evaluated by Input/Output curves reveals an increased excitatory synaptic transmission. Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin relevant for synaptic function, neuronal maturation and neuronal survival. Several groups have reproduced experiments that consistently support a regulatory role of MeCP 2 upon BDNF expression. There is also evidence supporting the interference of BDNF upon KCC 2 expression. Since BDNF is highly relevant in Rett Syndrome pathology, several pre-clinical and clinical strategies are being designed and tested to improve Rett Syndrome, restoring BDNF levels and physiological actions. Based on the knowledge about a facilitatory effect of adenosine on BDNF actions, we hypothesized that the modulation of BDNF with adenosine receptor agonists would have a positive effect in synaptic function in the Rett Syndrome mouse model. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is accepted as a neurophysiological paradigm to test synaptic plasticity, the basic process underlying learning and memory. Adenosine is a neuromodulator that acts mainly through A 1 and A 2 A receptors. The activation of A 2 A receptors (A 2 ARs) potentiates BDNF synaptic actions in healthy animals. Therefore, we explored whether the activation of A 2 ARs in the Rett Syndrome animal model facilitates BDNF action upon LTP. We found that BDNF facilitatory actions upon LTP are absent in the Rett Syndrome animal model, suggesting that, in addition to BDNF reduction, there is also impairment in its actions, even when it is administered exogenously. This dysfunction could be explained by a reduction in the levels of the main BDNF receptor (the full length tropomyosin-related kinase B), which we describe {{for the first time in}} the present study. When BDNF was combined with the selective A 2 AR agonist, CGS 2168, the BDNF effect upon LTP was restored, similar to what was observed in hippocampal slices from wild type animals with BDNF alone. Together these data highlight A 2 ARs as new possible therapeutic targets to increase BDNF actions in Rett Syndrome. In conclusion, this work contributes to elucidate two significant downstream effects of MeCP 2 impairment. The first is the abnormality of GABA postsynaptic actions upon GABAA receptors, suggested by a cerebrospinal fluid proteomic change and corroborated by findings in the Mecp 2 knock out animal model and in human neurons, derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of Rett Syndrome patients. This system is now available for pharmacological screening of compounds that target the detected disturbances with direct evaluation of phenotypical rescue, at a cellular level. KCC 2 reduction or impaired function appears to have also impact on synaptic structure and plasticity, and is a pathophysiological mechanism that contributes to several neurodevelopmental disorders. The second is the reduction of the main BDNF receptors in the hippocampi of the Rett Syndrome animal model. We have also shown that, using an adenosine A 2 ARs agonist, it is possible to restore BDNF actions upon LTP, a paradigm for synaptic plasticity. Adenosine, through A 2 ARs, positively modulates the intracellular signaling cascades activated by BDNF, bypassing the BDNFtropomyosin-related kinase B receptor impairment that occurs in Rett Syndrome.
