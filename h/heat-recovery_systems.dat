In this paper, a combined solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and gas turbine fuelled by natural gas is proposed as an attractive option to limit {{the environmental impact of}} the marine sector. It includes a study of a heat-recovery system for 18 MW SOFC fuelled by natural gas, to provide the electric power demand onboard commercial vessels. Feasible <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>systems</b> are investigated, taking into account different operating conditions of the combined system. Two types of SOFC are considered, tubular and planar SOFCs, operated with either natural gas or hydrogen fuels. This paper includes a detailed thermodynamic analysis for the combined system. Mass and energy balances are performed, not only for the whole plant but also for each individual component, in order to evaluate the thermal efficiency of the combined cycle. In addition, the effect of using natural gas as a fuel on the fuel cell voltage and performance is investigated. It is found that a high overall efficiency approaching 70 % may be achieved with an optimum configuration using SOFC system under pressure. The hybrid system would also reduce emissions, fuel consumption, and improve the total system efficiency...|$|E

40|$|Three {{alternative}} {{power cycles}} were compared in application as an exhaust-gas <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>system</b> {{for use with}} advanced adiabatic diesel engines. The power cycle alternatives considered were steam Rankine, organic Rankine with RC- 1 as the working fluid, and variations of an air Brayton cycle. The comparison was made in terms of fuel economy and economic payback potential for heavy-duty trucks operating in line-haul service. The results indicate that, in terms of engine rated specific fuel consumption, a diesel/alternative-power-cycle engine offers a significant improvement over the turbocompound diesel used as the baseline for comparison. The maximum imporvement resulted {{from the use of}} a Rankine cycle <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>system</b> in series with turbocompounding. The air Brayton cycle alternatives studied, which included both simple-cycle and compression-intercooled configurations, were less effective and provided about half the fuel consumption improvement of the Rankine cycle alternatives under the same conditions. Capital and maintenance cost estimates were also developed for each of the <b>heat-recovery</b> power cycle <b>systems.</b> These costs were integrated with the fuel savings to identify the time required for net annual savings to pay back the initial capital investment. The sensitivity of capital payback time to arbitrary increases in fuel price, not accompanied by corresponding hardware cost inflation, was also examined. The results indicate that a fuel price increase is required for the alternative power cycles to pay back capital within an acceptable time period...|$|R

Consequently, heat pumps can improve energy efficiency in industrial processes as well as energy savings when conventional passive-heat recovery is not possible. In this paper, possible ways of saving energy in the chemical industry are considered, {{the objective is to}} reduce the primary energy (such as coal) consumption of power plant. Particularly the thermodynamic analyses of integrating backpressure turbine of a power plant with distillation units have been considered. Some practical examples such as conventional distillation unit and heat pump are used as a means of reducing primary energy consumption with tangible indications of energy savings. The heat pump distillation is operated via electrical power from the power plant. The exergy efficiency of the primary fuel is calculated for different operating range of the heat pump distillation. This is then compared with a conventional distillation unit that depends on saturated steam from a power plant as the source of energy. The results obtained show that heat pump distillation is an economic way to save energy if the temperature difference between the overhead and the bottom is small. Based on the result, the energy saved by the application of a heat pump distillation is improved compared to conventional distillation unit.

40|$|International audienceA {{field survey}} {{was carried out}} in seven newly built {{energy-efficient}} houses in France. Several indoor air-quality indicators (total volatile organic compounds, volatile organic compounds, aldehydes, carbon monoxide, particulate matter less than 2. 5 micrometre in diameter (PM 2. 5) and radon) and indoor environmental parameters (carbon dioxide, temperature, relative humidity and noise) were measured before and during the houses' first year of occupancy. The air exchange per hour (ACH) and air exhaust rate were measured simultaneously, and the perceptions of the occupants were evaluated with a questionnaire. The results show that the levels of aromatic hydrocarbons, terpenes, alkanes and aldehydes were higher before occupancy than during occupancy, whereas the opposite trend was observed for PM 2. 5. During occupation, the concentrations of acetaldehyde, alpha-pinene, ethylbenzene, limonene, styrene, toluene and xylenes decrease, most likely because of the decrease in emissions sources from houses. At the same time, the levels of benzene, formaldehyde, hexaldehyde, n-decane and n-undecane temporarily increase because of human activities. The PM 2. 5 levels show seasonal variation. Compared to standard French houses, the concentrations of benzene, ethylbenzene, m- and p-xylenes, PM 2. 5 and radon were low, whereas the CO 2 and formaldehyde levels were not significantly different. In contrast, the levels of acetaldehyde, hexaldehyde, n-decane, n-undecane, oxylene and styrene were higher in these new homes, possibly because of the emissions from products and materials. Mechanical ventilation with <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>systems</b> allows for ACH levels of 0. 5 h- 1 or higher, making the air drier. Shortcomings of the system are also reported...|$|E

As the economic costs of electrical-energy gener-ation rise and the environmental costs become more evident, energy conservation becomes a clear al-ternative to building more nuclear or sulphur-emit-ting plants. The first step to conservation is development of appropriate technologies. How-ever, after such technologies are developed, adop-tion may be very slow when the technology is embodied in durable capital items such as struc-tures or machines. An understanding of the in-vestment behavior of those who could be expected to use energy-conserving equipment or structures would be of value in predicting or attempting to modify rates of adoption and, thus, energy use. Attempts to quantify the behavioral relationships connected with investment at the firm (farm) level have generally focused on large field crop and grain storage equipment. Using a probit model, Hill and Kau found farm size, farm type, tenancy, operator age, and specific corn crop variables significant in determining investment in grain dryers in Illinois. Similarly, farm size, tenancy, corn production, and corn use variables were important determinants of grain bin investment in a tobit study by Dixon, Hill, and Saffell. A more recent multivariate analysis of tractor and combine investments found soil type, value of machinery inventory, operator age, and education to influence machinery investment decision making (Johnson, Brown, and O'Grady).

50|$|Otto {{engines are}} about 30% efficient; in other words, 30% {{of the energy}} {{generated}} by combustion is converted into useful rotational energy at the output shaft of the engine, while the remainder being losses due to waste heat, friction and engine accessories. There {{are a number of}} ways to recover some of the energy lost to waste heat. The use of a Turbocharger in Diesel engines is very effective by boosting incoming air pressure and in effect provides the same increase in performance as having more displacement. The Mack Truck company, decades ago, developed a turbine system that converted waste heat into kinetic energy that it fed back into the engine's transmission. In 2005, BMW announced the development of the turbosteamer, a two-stage <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>system</b> similar to the Mack system that recovers 80% of the energy in the exhaust gas and raises the efficiency of an Otto engine by 15%. By contrast, a six-stroke engine may reduce fuel consumption by as much as 40%.|$|R
40|$|The {{exhaust gas}} from an {{internal}} combustion engine contains approximately 30 % of the thermal energy of combustion. Waste heat recovery systems aim to reclaim a proportion of this energy in a bottoming thermodynamic cycle to raise the overall system thermal efficiency. The inverted Brayton cycle considered as a potential exhaust-gas <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>system</b> is a little-studied approach, especially when applied to small automotive power-plants. Hence, a model of an air-standard, irreversible Otto-cycle and the inverted Brayton cycle using finite-time thermodynamics (FTT) is presented to study heat recovery applied to an automotive {{internal combustion engine}}. The other two alternatives power cycle, the pressurized Brayton cycle and the turbo-compounding system, are compared with the Inverted Brayton Cycle (IBC) to specify {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of three alternative cycles. In the current paper, an irreversible Otto-cycle model that includes an array of losses is used as a basis for the bottoming cycle. The deviation of the turbomachinery from the idealized behavior is described by the isentropic component efficiencies. The performance of the system as defined as the specific power output and thermal efficiency is considered using parametric studies. The results show that the performance of the inverted Brayton cycle can be positively affected by five critical parameters – the number of compression stages, the cycle inlet temperature and pressure, the isentropic efficiency of the turbomachinery and the effectiveness of the heat exchanger. There exists an optimum pressure ratio across the IBC turbine that delivers the maximum specific power. In the view of the specific power, installing a single-stage of the inverted Brayton cycle appears the best balance between performance and complexity. Three alternative cycles are compared in terms of the thermal efficiency. The results indicate that the pressurized and Inverted Brayton Cycle can improve the performance of the turbocharged engine only when the turbomachinery efficiencies are higher than a critical value which changes with the operating condition. High performance of the IBC turbomachinery is required to ensure that the turbocharged engine with the inverted Brayton cycle is superior to that with turbo-compounding system...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the fuel}} energy in an {{internal}} combustion engine is lost as heat, mainly through hot exhaust gas. The high energy losses, and high temperatures of the exhaust gas, provide favorable conditions for applying a waste-heat recovery system. Among the available options, systems based on the Rankine cycle show the highest potential in terms of reducing fuel consumption. Water or water-based mixtures have several advantages over organic fluids as working fluids for such applications of the Rankine cycle, in terms of cost, thermal stability, safety {{and complexity of the}} system. They also have several disadvantages, including possible freezing for pure water, high boiling temperature and high heat of vaporization. Hence, higher temperatures and amounts of waste heat are needed for reliable operation of the system. However, few experimental investigations have addressed the practical challenges associated with water and their effects on the performance and operation of a system in a driving cycle. This paper presents results of experiments with a full-scale system for recovering waste heat from the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) of a 12. 8 L heavy-duty Diesel engine on a test bench. The working fluid used in the experiments was deionized water and a 2 -cylinder piston expander served as an expansion device. The engine was kept in standard configuration, except for minor modifications required to implement the <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>system.</b> The prototype EGR boiler was designed to fit in the space initially designated for the production EGR cooler. The assembly was operated in the operating points of the European Stationary Cycle (ESC). The results show that the trade-off between boiling pressure, sufficient superheating of the water and cooling of the EGR caused by the pinch-point in the boiler poses a major challenge when using water as a fluid. Low flow rates at low load points were challenging for boiler stability. During operation, the blow-by of working fluid into the lubrication system of the expander and vice versa was also problematic. Special steam-engine oil with high viscosity and good water separation capability was used to weaken this effect. The Rankine cycle-based test system attained a thermal efficiency of 10 % with EGR as the only heat source. Results, major constraints and possible means to improve the system when using water as a working fluid are presented here. Simulation models developed for the EGR boiler and the piston expander supported this effort...|$|R

Hence, {{a model of the}} inverted Brayton cycle using finite-time thermodynamics (FTT) is presented to study heat recovery applied to a highly downsizing automotive {{internal combustion engine}}. IBC system consists of a turbine, a heat exchanger and compressors in sequence. The use of IBC turbine is to fully expand the exhaust gas available from the upper cycle. The remaining heat in the exhaust after expansion is rejected by the downstream heat exchanger. Then, the cooled exhaust gases are compressed back up to the ambient pressure by one or more compressors. In this paper, the exhaust conditions available from the engine test bench data were introduced as the inlet conditions of the IBC thermodynamic model to quantify the power recovered by IBC, thereby revealing the benefits of IBC to this particular engine. It {{should be noted that the}} test bench data of the baseline engine were collected by the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedures (WLTP). WLTP define a global harmonized standard for determining the levels of pollutants and CO 2 emissions, fuel consumption. The IBC thermodynamic model was simulated with the following variables: IBC inlet pressure, turbine pressure ratio, heat exchanger effectiveness, turbomachinery efficiencies, and the IBC compression stage.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new air-heating system concept for energy-efficient dwellings. It {{is a system}} designed to heat a low-energy building by coupling a <b>heat-recovery</b> ventilation <b>system</b> with a three-fluid heat exchanger located on the chimney of a wood-pellet stove. The proposed work focuses on the heat transfer that occurs between flue gases, the ventilation air and the combustion air within a triple concentric tube heat exchanger with no insulation at its outer surface. The main objective is to predict outlet temperature for the specific geometry of the heat exchanger studied here. Thus, the governing differential equations are derived for a counter-co-current flow arrangement of the three fluids. Then analytical solutions for the steady-state temperature distribution are obtained {{as well as the}} amount of heat transferred to the outside. An expression for the effectiveness of the heat exchanger is also proposed. Based on these results, calculations are performed on a case study to predict the fluid temperature distribution along the heat exchanger.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the level of environmental impact and primary energy resulting from demands placed on residential ventilation and heating systems; a conventional residential house built to the 2007 Norwegian building code with a standard heating system was compared against three technology scenarios used in a passive house of the equivalent size. Both houses have wooden framework and cladding and are projected by the Norwegian building company Norbohus. An economical evaluation of the heating systems was also done. The alternative heating option for the conventional house, Stord TEK 07, was based on current Norwegian energy consumption patterns; a combination of electricity and firewood is used to meet heating demand. This heating mix was also modeled as an option for the heating requirements of the passive house, named Stord Passive S 1. Additionally, a solar collector system (Stord Passive S 2) and an air-to-water heat pump (Stord Passive S 3) were modeled for the passive house. Finally, a balanced mechanical ventilation system was evaluated for both buildings. The life-cycle assessment method used was the ReCiPe method and the electricity used in the operation phase was based on the Nordic electricity mix. The results of this study indicate that Stord TEK 07 has the largest emission output in relation to output of CO 2 -eq, presented in the impact category &# 147;Climate change&# 148;. From a life-cycle perspective, the heating system requirements of a Stord TEK 07 house are 47. 5 and 45 percent higher than the renewable energy solutions of passive house scenarios S 2 and S 3, respectively. Total life-cycle primary energy requirements in the Stord TEK 07 house were almost twice that of the renewable solutions in the passive house. Using the Norwegian standard heating system of Stord TEK 07 in a passive house as was done in Stord Passive S 1, also results in a large improvement; output of CO 2 -eq and use of primary energy was reduced by 34 - 35 percent. Stord TEK 07 has also the highest emission output in most of the other impact categories and the largest present value costs, when building constructing costs are excluded. The heat pump solution, Stord Passive S 3, has the lowest impact in most categories; however, the solar collector system Stord Passive S 2, had lower output of CO 2 -eq. Stord Passive S 2 has also lower present value costs then the air-water heat pump Stord Passive S 3. A balanced ventilation system with 80 percent heat recovery was studied for both the houses. The benefit of heat recovery is recognizable in all the impact categories considered. The energy consumption and potential harmful emissions resulting from the electrical energy used by fans during the life cycle far exceed the environmental impacts that result from manufacture and transportation of the ventilation unit. The study revealed that the <b>heat-recovery</b> <b>system</b> must have efficiency greater than 15 percent to achieve reduction concerning output of CO 2 -eq and use of primary energy for Stord TEK 07; this requirement increases to 42 percent in houses built to the passive house standard house, Stord Passive. </p...|$|R
