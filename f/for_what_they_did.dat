Eleanor Roosevelt came in ninth. In 2001, the Eleanor Roosevelt Legacy Committee (Eleanor's Legacy) was founded by Judith Hollensworth Hope, who was its president until April 2008. It inspires and supports pro-choice Democratic women to run for local and state offices in New York. The Legacy sponsors campaign training schools, links candidates with volunteers and experts, collaborates with like-minded organizations and provides campaign grants to endorsed candidates. In 2007, she was named a Woman hero by The My Hero Project.|$|E

She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> but she repented for her sins.

When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E
2500|$|Meanwhile, Eric Finch, {{a veteran}} detective {{in charge of}} the regular police force—"the Nose"—begins {{investigating}} V's terrorist activities. Finch often communicates with Norsefire's other intelligence departments, including [...] "the Finger," [...] led by Derek Almond, and [...] "the Head", embodied by Adam Susan: the reclusive government Leader, who obsessively oversees the government's Fate computer system. Finch's case thickens when V mentally deranges Lewis Prothero, a propaganda-broadcasting radio personality; forces the suicide of Bishop Anthony Lilliman, a paedophile priest; and prepares to murder Dr. Delia Surridge, a medical researcher who once had a romance with Finch. Finch suddenly discovers the connection among V's three targets: they all used to work at a former Norsefire [...] "resettlement camp" [...] near Larkhill. That night, V kills both Almond and Surridge, but Surridge has left a diary revealing that V—a former inmate and victim of Surridge's cruel medical experiments—was able to destroy and flee the camp, and is now eliminating the camp's former officers <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> at the camp. Finch reports these findings to Susan, who suspects that this vendetta may actually be a cover for V, who, he worries, may be plotting an even bigger terrorist attack.|$|E
2500|$|A larger {{ceremony}} was held again on April 8 in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, {{this time with}} Governor Sandoval Díaz and the victims' families. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony. In his eight minute speech, Sandoval Díaz stated that the attack would not go unpunished. [...] "They {{will not be an}} extra number in our statistics," [...] he said. He also stated that the assassins were going to [...] "pay" [...] <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>did,</b> and clarified {{that it was not a}} cry for war, but rather a cry for peace and justice. He also asked all police corporations to continue fighting organized crime. Solorio Aréchiga read the names of all the officers killed, but had to stop momentarily to sob. For each of the names, the policemen repeated the same process as before, yelling [...] "present" [...] for each of them. After that, the police band did a taps call. Once it concluded, the audience clapped for one minute. The coffins were wrapped in the Flags of Jalisco. In front of each coffin was a flower arrangement, the banner of the Fuerza Única branch, and a framed photograph of the victim. Each of the victims' family members were given an official banner of the state of Jalisco. A year later, on April 6, 2016, the Government of Jalisco hosted another ceremony near the ambush site with the victims' families. Fuerza Única banners were placed across the mountainous road where the attack occurred.|$|E

This paper is, thus, an invitation to a conversation; just by having this conversation, if we have it in a reflective and inclusive way, we will strengthen our sense of mission and our ties to and relevance for the community.
