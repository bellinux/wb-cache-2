Both of these developments are included in a compressor designed for the small centrifugal plant air market, but potential applications exist beyond this single type of turbo machine. The new bearing design is {{discussed in terms of}} its usage with two gear <b>driven</b> <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> one running at 36, 000 rpm and the other running at 50, 000 rpm. Major design aims achieved were for increased effective rotor/bearing system damping, rugged construction features and ease of assembly and maintenance. The microprocessor based compressor control system includes all normal monitoring functions plus adaptive digital control techniques with memory based learning. The dual loop interactive system is equipped only with setpoint adjustments, as the control is capable of self-adapting its PID values based on the last incremental system response...|$|R

50|$|This overrunning-clutch pinion {{arrangement}} was phased into use {{beginning in the}} early 1960s; before that time, a Bendix drive was used. The Bendix system places the starter <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> on a helically cut drive shaft.

40|$|Two input <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts</b> and one 1 st {{intermediate}} <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> used in gearboxes of sugar-crushing mills {{were reported}} to have failed prematurely after about 3, 600 hr of service against a specified life of 100, 000 hr. These shafts were referred to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Investigation revealed that the pinions have failed by surface contact fatigue/spalling due to low surface hardness and unusual hardness profile on the teeth. Examination also revealed non-uniform case depth and surface hardness from one tooth to another. Studies showed that improper heat treatment of the components was responsible for such metallurgical abnormalities leading to premature failure of the pinions. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report. A few recommendations are also suggested to prevent recurrence of similar failures...|$|R

This work elucidates the metallurgical investigation that was carried out on a failed <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> for analyzing the cause for failure. Fractography revealed the initiation of a crack from the keyway corner. Mechanical testing indicated that the yield strength of the material was lower than the specified value. Observation of the bowl mill at site after failure indicated that hard lumps {{were present in the}} bull ring segment, which clearly made it evident that there was sudden jamming of it which in turn led to overloading of the <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> leading to the initiation of crack.

40|$|AbstractThe goal of {{this paper}} is to model electro-dynamically the pinion-engaging {{mechanism}} (PEM) of starter motors. The purpose of the PEM is to switch a high current by means of relatively low control current. The PEM is the system of components (solenoid switch, pinion-engaging lever, and overrunning clutch with <b>drive</b> <b>pinion)</b> that engages the <b>drive</b> <b>pinion</b> with the ring gear. The solenoid switches consist of a pull-in winding and a hold-in winding and a movable iron core. The electro-dynamic model of the solenoid switch contains the inductance and its partial derivatives which depend on the current and the position of the solenoid armature. An electromechanical measurement method is proposed to determine the inductance and its derivative for various positions of the solenoid switch. The experimental results are implemented in the electro-dynamic model using energy-based modeling applying the Euler-Lagrange formalism...|$|R

50|$|The {{layout of}} the engine was {{completed}} by 15 August 1939 and the engineering drawing by 15 October. The first prototype began bench tests on 29 November 1939. A total of five prototypes were built in 1939 and another five in 1940. They could not reach the engine's specified power output and suffered from broken crankshafts, <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts</b> and crankcase covers. Production had been planned to begin in 1941, but this was postponed while further development work continued. More prototypes were built between 1941 and 1943 and the engine began its state acceptance tests in December 1943. It failed the tests and was cancelled in early 1944.|$|R
5000|$|Jaguar {{first used}} the Dana 44 in an IRS in 1961 for the Jaguar E-type {{as well as}} other models. It was used through 1996 (Jaguar IRS Article). There are some {{differences}} in the Jaguar Dana 44, however. The differential (possibly the entire axle assembly) was made by Salisbury, a U.K. division of Dana Corporation. The ring gear in the Salisbury version uses slightly smaller mounting bolts and the <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> is a different diameter than the common version. Naturally the cast housing is also unique to the IRS model. Standard 8.5" [...] Dana 44 ring and pinion gear can be used in the IRS model {{through the use of a}} special installation kit which includes special shouldered bolts to mount the standard ring gear to the IRS carrier and a special pinion bearing set to fit the standard <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> to the IRS housing. Gear distributors with knowledge of the Jag IRS should be able to get the installation kit. US Dana 44 gears a slightly stronger than Jaguar gears, and Jaguar gears higher priced, but once the installation kit price is added to the lower US gear prices cost is about the same. If Jaguar makes the needed gear ratio there isn't much difference in strength. The consensus in the hot rodding community is that the Jaguar IRS is good for up to 500 hp from the factory. Most V-12 Jaguar and E-type six-cylinder models used limited slip versions, other models (mainly the XJS) used a standard differential stock with limited slip as an option.|$|R

Measuring system - portable 12 -channel signals analyzer LMS SCADAS Mobile (SCM 05) was used. Conducted experiment shows that acoustic characteristics of the pump unit depend on different material drive and driven rotor.

5000|$|The {{geometry}} of the rack system has a large impact {{on the construction of}} turnouts. If the rack is elevated above the running rails, {{there is no need to}} interrupt the running rails to allow passage of the driving pinions of the engines. Strub explicitly documented this in his U.S. patent. [...] Strub used a complex set of bell-cranks and push-rods linking the throw-rod for the points to the two throw-rods for the moving rack sections. One break in the rack was required to select between the two routes, and a second break was required where the rack rails cross the running rails. Turnouts for the Morgan Rack system were similar, with the rack elevated above the running rails. Most of the Morgan turnout patents included movable rack sections to avoid breaks in the rack, but because all Morgan locomotives had two linked <b>drive</b> <b>pinions,</b> there was no need for a continuous rack. So long as the breaks in the rack were shorter than the distance between the <b>drive</b> <b>pinions</b> on the locomotive, the rack rail could be interrupted wherever there was need to cross over a running rail.|$|R
40|$|LecturePg. 131 - 144 For {{more than}} 40 years, {{integrally}} geared centrifugal compressors {{have been in}} use worldwide, in the plant air sector first, and increasingly in the process industry. Apart from reliability, efficiency and operating range, the most striking features of this compressor concept, particular when used in the process industry, are the versatility and configurability of the machine. Today, all sorts of process gases, including toxic and flammable ones, can be compressed or expanded using integrally geared centrifugal compressor and expander units. The high level of modular construction employed in integrally geared turbomachines (IGTMs) allows for {{a high degree of}} standardization; the resulting building block system makes it possible to adapt the machine concept to each field of application and, in particular, to the customer's own requirements. Of prime importance here are the definition and geometry of the interfaces between the individual modules and equipment units, such as compressor and expansion stages, gear case, <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> seal systems, etc. The integrally geared centrifugal compressor has conquered many ranges of application in the process industry starting with compressors operated purely on air, followed by nitrogen and then carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, chlorine, hydrocarbons, acetylenexide, and isobutyric aldehyde, and so forth. A recent success involving the compressing of high purity oxygen to high discharge pressures using integrally geared centrifugal compressors deserves special mention. It had been thought that this could only be achieved using single shaft compressors. This means that for oxygen, too, the advantages of integrally geared centrifugal compressors such as efficiency and very broad operating ranges can be used, {{as in the case of}} variable oxygen supply systems (varox) in air separation plants. Energy recovery in the process industry has presented integrally geared centrifugal compressors with a new task. Tail gases often have high energy contents which can be returned directly to a compression process in the same machine through addition of expander stages. In its original concept, the integrally geared centrifugal compressor is primarily suitable for the use of low-speed drive units. By using "free" <b>pinion</b> <b>shaft</b> extensions or additional <b>pinion</b> <b>shafts,</b> high speed <b>drive</b> units without an external intermediate gear can also be used. This aspect, together with the integration of expander stages already mentioned, leads to a very interesting and economical application of integrally geared centrifugal compressors: alongside compression and expansion functions, IGTMs can be used for mechanical output power distribution in sophisticated process equipment such as dimethylterephthalate (DMT) and pure terephthalic acid (PTA systems) ...|$|R
25|$|The advertised February {{introduction}} of a fully synchronized, four-speed transmission RPO 651 was postponed until the 1961 model year.

50|$|In {{order to}} {{stabilize}} the yaw bearing against rotation a means of braking is necessary.
