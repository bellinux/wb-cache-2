Before the 2008 recession, <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> were $100,000 to $150,000. As of late 2015, <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> were down to $50,000. Around that time, many new members were reportedly not charged an initiation fee or were no longer required by the club to fully pay it within five years. Annual dues were $19,400 a year.|$|E

25|$|An area Farnsworth tried but {{ultimately}} failed to develop was {{the recruitment of}} women. His desire was for {{a branch of the}} Klan to stem the growth of Catholics in public education and strengthen moralistic teachings in the home. For him women were the answer. Mrs. Gertrude Witham was promoted to Major Kleagle of the Maine Women of the KKK. However Farnsworth and Witham failed in effectively recruiting new women members. It also became apparent as timed passed that some of the female Klan were foreign-born (i.e. Canadian). This resulted in the dismissal of these women and their suing of the Klan to recover their <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> and dues. On top of this Farnsworth continued to charge $10 for <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> instead of the agreed-upon fee by the national women’s organization of $5. These efforts outside of the guidelines of the national Klan, along with other perceived misconduct, would eventually lead to Farnsworth’s resignation as King Kleagle of Maine.|$|E

25|$|Members {{joining the}} Los Angeles, New York, or Miami SAG locals were {{assessed}} an initial fee {{to join the}} Guild of $3,000. At the time of initiation, the first minimum semi-annual membership dues payment of $58 must have also been paid, bringing the total amount due upon initiation into the Guild to $3,058. All other SAG locals still assessed <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> at the previous rate.

25|$|In {{its first}} three years, {{the only source}} of income of the Association was that which was derived from {{membership}} and <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> and from contributions. In time, the association hoped to erect a building in San Francisco, the rentals of which would suffice to pay the running expenses of the Association, as well as sick benefits, when it is required. The library of the Association was a source of gratification to the members. More than 500 volumes were contributed, besides files of many of the leading dailies, weeklies, monthlies. The Association wanted first to accumulate complete sets of the published works of members, then works by Pacific Coast writers, then reference books, and finally, rare and standard books. The organization's librarian {{was a member of the}} American Library Association.|$|E

2500|$|New Klan founder William J. Simmons joined 12 {{different}} fraternal {{organizations and}} recruited for the Klan with his chest covered with fraternal badges, consciously modeling the Klan after fraternal organizations. Klan organizers called [...] "Kleagles" [...] signed up {{hundreds of new}} members, who paid <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> and received KKK costumes in return. The organizer kept half the money and sent the rest to state or national officials. When the organizer was done with an area, he organized a rally, often with burning crosses, and perhaps presented a Bible to a local Protestant preacher. He left town with the money collected. The local units operated like many fraternal organizations and occasionally brought in speakers.|$|E
2500|$|With {{respect to}} immigration, the Socialist International felt {{pressure}} from the trade union movement to opine in favor of tight immigration restrictions which would reduce the ability of employers {{to make use of}} low cost newcomers in place of established union workers. The ultimate resolution did not go far in catering to such a demand, however, condemning the importation from abroad of strikebreakers or those previously entering into restrictive employment contracts, but insisting that unions not only admit immigrant workmen but do so on the basis of reasonable <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> and dues structures. This position proved acceptable to the radical foes of conservative craft unions and their [...] "narrow, petty-bourgeois" [...] agenda, such as Russian delegate V. I. Lenin, who asserted in no uncertain terms that the resolution adopted [...] "fully meets the demands of revolutionary Social-Democracy".|$|E
2500|$|In 1915, {{the second}} Klan {{was founded in}} Atlanta, Georgia. Starting in 1921, it adopted a modern {{business}} system of using full-time paid recruiters and appealed to new members as a fraternal organization, of which many examples were flourishing at the time. The national headquarters made its profit through a monopoly of costume sales, while the organizers were paid through <b>initiation</b> <b>fees.</b> It grew rapidly nationwide {{at a time of}} prosperity. Reflecting the social tensions pitting urban versus rural America, it spread to every state and was prominent in many cities. The second KKK preached [...] "One Hundred Percent Americanism" [...] and demanded the purification of politics, calling for strict morality and better enforcement of prohibition. Its official rhetoric focused on the threat of the Catholic Church, using anti-Catholicism and nativism. Its appeal was directed exclusively at white Protestants; it opposed Jews, blacks, Catholics, and newly arriving Southern European immigrants such as Italians. Some local groups threatened violence against rum runners and notorious sinners; the violent episodes generally took place in the South.|$|E
50|$|It will be {{extremely}} difficult for consumers to find the necessary cash to pay the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> up front {{at a time when}} they are taking out a loan precisely because they are in need of cash. Most lenders will thus be unable to afford to pay the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> on taking out a loan, particularly in the case of the very poor borrowing for consumption purposes. These people will thus be forced to allow the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> to be capitalised and re-paid, probably in the same number of instalments as the initial loan, and subject to the same interest rate as the initial loan. The result will be that the effective monthly cost of credit will increase.|$|R

2500|$|Disputes {{over the}} {{constitutional}} and statutory status of union shop and agency shop agreements began {{almost immediately after}} the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act. In the Supreme Court's first major ruling on the issue in Railway Employes' Dept. v. Hanson, 351 U.S. 225 (1956), the Court held that the union security provisions of the Railway Labor Act were constitutional, but withheld judgment as to [...] "the validity or enforceability of a union or closed shop agreement if other conditions of union membership are imposed or if the exaction of dues, <b>initiation</b> <b>fees</b> or assessments is used as a cover for forcing ideological conformity or other action in contravention of the First or the Fifth Amendment." [...] The ruling in Hanson appeared to call into serious question the viability of union shop agreements. Five years later, in Machinists v. Street, 367 U.S. 740 (1961), the Court held that the Railway Labor Act [...] "denies the authority to a union, over the employee's objection, to spend his money for political causes which he opposes." [...] The high court also confronted the issue of remedy in Machinists v. Street, and outlined several options which unions and employers might adopt as well as rejecting remedies which the district court in the case had chosen. [...] The Supreme Court returned to the union security issue three more times in 1963. [...] In NLRB v. General Motors Corp., 373 U.S. 734 (1963), the Court held that agency fees equal to dues are not prohibited by the National Labor Relations Act. Nonetheless, in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 373 U.S. 746 (1963), the Court questioned whether an agency fee set at a level equal to member dues was unfair because it set collective bargaining fees higher for non-members than for members. After reargument, however, the Court in Retail Clerks v. Schermerhorn, 375 U.S. 96 (1963), did not reach the issue again and instead decided the case on narrow procedural grounds (concluding that Florida's right-to-work law outlawed the union shop provision at issue). The Court further elaborated on the issue of remedies in Railway Clerks v. Allen, 373 U.S. 113 (1963), allowing agency fee payers to opt out of all political expenditures rather than enunciate specific examples but refusing to allow them to act as a class. The Supreme Court extended its constitutional and equity analysis to public employees in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209 (1977), holding that, where public employee collective bargaining exists and agency fee clauses are clearly authorized by law, public employee agency fee mechanisms are also constitutional.|$|E

50|$|Dues are {{different}} from fees and assessments. Fees are generally one-time-only payments made by the union member to the union to cover the administration of ongoing programs or activities. One example is the <b>initiation</b> <b>fee,</b> a fee charged by the union to the worker when the employee first joins the union. The <b>initiation</b> <b>fee</b> covers the administrative costs of joining the union. Fees may, however, be ongoing. For example, a union program (such as a welfare or benefit fund) may be offered only to those union members who pay a regular fee {{to participate in the}} fund.
