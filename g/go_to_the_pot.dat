60|$|But I cannot {{pass without}} some brief notice our habit--continually, {{as it seems}} to me, gaining strength--of putting a large {{quantity}} of thought and work, annually, into things which are either in their nature necessarily perishable, as dress; or else into compliances with the fashion of the day, in things not necessarily perishable, as plate. I am afraid almost the first idea of a young rich couple setting up house in London, is, that they must have new plate. Their father's plate may be very handsome, but the fashion is changed. They will have a new service from the leading manufacturer, and the old plate, except a few apostle spoons, and a cup which Charles the Second drank a health in to their pretty ancestress, is sent to be melted down, and made up with new flourishes and fresh lustre. Now, so long as this is the case--so long, observe, as fashion has influence on the manufacture of plate--so long you cannot have a goldsmith's art in this country. Do you suppose any workman worthy the name will put his brains into a cup or an urn, which he knows is <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> melting <b>pot</b> in half a score years? He will not; you don't ask or expect it of him. You ask of him nothing but a little quick handicraft--a clever twist of a handle here, and a foot there, a convolvulus from the newest school of design, a pheasant from Landseer's game cards; a couple of sentimental figures for supporters, {{in the style of the}} signs of insurance offices, then a clever touch with the burnisher, and there's your epergne, the admiration of all the footmen at the wedding-breakfast, and the torment of some unfortunate youth who cannot see the pretty girl opposite to him, through its tyrannous branches.|$|R

40|$|Dreidel is {{a popular}} game played during the festival of Chanukah. Players start with {{an equal number of}} tokens, and {{contribute}} one token each to a common pot.
