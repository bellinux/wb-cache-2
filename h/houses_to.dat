5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would {{have been one of the}} last genuine Dutch-style <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
5|$|From the 1888 harvest, Monet {{produced}} three canvases featuring two stacks each (Wildenstein #'s 1213-5) {{against the}} backdrop of hills along the left bank of the Seine and a few Giverny <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> the right. Then, he turned to his left to capture two scenes (1216-7) in which the hills are shrouded by a line of poplars.|$|E
5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, William Stones {{partnered with}} Tennant Brothers {{to acquire the}} Sheffield Free Brewery, closing the brewery and {{dividing}} the estate between themselves. In the same year, the company purchased Mappin's Brewery of Rotherham, and the brewery was closed down the following year. The takeover added around 100 public <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> their tied estate, to make a total of 300. As a result, Stones had the second largest tied estate in Sheffield after Tennant's.|$|E
5|$|Lighting {{also served}} Gaudí for the {{organisation}} of space, which required a careful {{study of the}} gradient of light intensity to adequately adapt to each specific environment. He achieved this with different elements such as skylights, windows, shutters and blinds; a notable case is the gradation of colour used in the atrium of the Casa Batlló to achieve uniform distribution of light throughout the interior. He also tended to build south-facing <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> maximise sunlight.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people put}} up bat <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> attract bats. The 1991 University of Florida bat {{house is the}} largest {{occupied}} artificial roost in the world, with around 300,000 residents. In Britain, thickwalled and partly underground World War II pillboxes have been converted to make roosts for bats, and purpose-built bat houses are occasionally built to mitigate damage to habitat from road or other developments.|$|E

5|$|The {{areas on}} each side of the marina, {{formerly}} occupied by the two power stations and chemical plant, have been redeveloped to provide a wide range of housing, from town <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> social housing to exclusive flats.

5|$|The {{construction}} of the extension to Kew Gardens brought significant growth to Queens, specifically in Forest Hills and Kew Gardens. With the subway providing a quick and cheap commute, Forest Hills became a more desirable place to live, {{and as a result}} new apartment buildings were built in advance of the line's opening to accommodate the expected influx of residents. Forest Hills was transformed from a quiet residential community of one-family <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> an active population center.|$|E

5|$|The most {{important}} economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, {{all types of}} resources can be stored, some technologies are researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> support a higher population.|$|E
5|$|The {{new wave}} of {{construction}} brings the university's stock of <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> 328, including several duplexes.

5|$|As CTroop {{reached the}} forming up {{point for the}} assault it met heavy machine gun fire from the gun battery. ATroop {{bypassed}} them to occupy <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> cover the assault. The next to arrive was DTroop, which had a special ladder to cross the anti-tank ditch around the battery. Realising that the man carrying the ladder had been killed crossing the beach and the ladder left behind, they looked for another way to cross. They discovered wooden planks bridging the gap that the defenders used to access the town. DTroop crossed and captured the machine gun posts around the battery. With the machine guns taken, EandFTroops began their assault. The attack was successful but they discovered the guns were only wooden dummies made from telegraph poles. The real guns had been removed three days previously and positioned further inland.|$|E
5|$|As {{time went}} by, Matilda {{directed}} {{more of her}} attention to the Cistercian order, This order was very fashionable in England and Normandy during the period, and was dedicated to the Virgin Mary, a figure of particular importance to Matilda. She had close links to the Cistercian Mortemer Abbey in Normandy, and drew on the house for a supply of monks when she supported the foundation of nearby La Valasse. She encouraged the Cistercians to build at Mortemer on a grand scale, with guest <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> accommodate a range of visitors of all ranks, and may have played a part in selecting the paintings for the monastic chapels.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating {{a member of the}} same sex. Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

5|$|Building {{practices}} {{along the}} coast also included boathouses, fishing cottages, piers, etc. Here, houses for livestock and people were typically built up from the actual shoreline. A typical medium-sized farm in the inland of Norway would include a dwelling house (våningshus), hay barn (låve), livestock barn (fjøs), one or more food storage houses (stabbur), a stable, and occasionally separate houses for poultry, pigs, etc. Houses that had separate heat sources, e.g., washing houses (eldhus) and smithies were usually kept separate from the other <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> prevent fires. Outhouses were typically separate, small structures. If the farm housed craftsmen, there would also be separate houses for carpentry, wheel making, shoemaking, etc.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, the Boddington family {{shareholding}} had {{dwindled to}} around 40 per cent. On the 22 December 1940, the brewery water tanks {{were hit by}} bombs during the Manchester Blitz, and the brewery had to be closed down for several months, with production moved temporarily to the nearby Hydes Brewery. The brewery was rebuilt with the most up-to-date and modern equipment of the time, {{and was the first}} in Europe to install stainless steel brewing vats. In 1961, the brewer Whitbread took a 13 per cent stake in the company. In 1962 the company purchased Richard Clarke & Co of Reddish, Stockport, adding 60 public <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> the firm.|$|E
5|$|Following from draft {{plans in}} August 2016, a new {{planning}} application was submitted by Interesting Developments on 16 January 2017 {{to convert the}} pub back into a house as it appeared around 1900, demolishing the 20th century extensions and modifications and restoring historic features such as the interior fireplaces and the oculus window, A separate part to the planning application included three two-storey two-bedroom terraced <b>houses</b> <b>to</b> be constructed on the pub garden, along with a redesigned and landscaped car park to include a charging station. An additional house {{to the rear of}} the pub was considered but not proposed; campaigners criticised the absence of plans to preserve some historic features, the partial demolition of the building and the proximity of the new buildings. Despite objections, planning permission was granted by Medway Council on 13 June 2017.|$|E
