40|$|Background: To {{estimate}} a pooled {{association between}} hearing <b>impairment</b> {{and risk of}} mild cognitive <b>impairment</b> and dementia. Methods: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for prospective cohort studies that examined the association between hearing <b>impairment</b> and risk of mild cognitive <b>impairment</b> and/or dementia. Random-effects models were fitted to estimate the summary risk ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence interval (CIs), which represents the pooled association between hearing <b>impairment</b> with risk of mild cognitive <b>impairment</b> and dementia, compared to subjects free of hearing <b>impairment.</b> Results: Four studies on hearing <b>impairment</b> with mild cognitive <b>impairment</b> and 7 studies on hearing <b>impairment</b> with dementia {{were included in the}} meta-analysis. A total of 15, 521 subjects were studied with follow-up periods between 2 and 16. 8 years.

Results Hearing <b>impairment</b> along with motor <b>impairment</b> in children is associated with significantly increased proportions of suboptimal levels of function and significantly lower HRQOL. Children with hearing <b>impairment</b> and no motor <b>impairment</b> had significantly lower scores in the emotional health and school function domains of the PedsQL than children with normal hearing, but {{there was no significant difference}} in the physical and social health domain scores.

When researchers compared {{the results of these}} medical exams, it was revealed that although there were no <b>impairments</b> of cognitive functions, Polyakov experienced a clear decline in mood as well as a feeling of increased workload during the first few weeks of spaceflight and return to Earth. However, Polyakov's mood stabilized to pre-flight levels between the second and fourteenth month of his mission. It was also revealed that Polyakov did not suffer from any prolonged performance <b>impairments</b> after returning to Earth. In light of these findings, researchers concluded that a stable mood and overall function could be maintained during extended duration spaceflights, such as manned missions to Mars.|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language <b>impairments</b> in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language <b>impairments</b> that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In a {{prospective}} study, we assessed the prevalence {{and significance of}} visual and hearing <b>impairment</b> in 896 patients who were hospitalized for rehabilitation following hip fracture. Visual <b>impairment</b> was defined as visual acuity equal to worse than 6 / 60 in the better of the two eyes. Hearing <b>impairment</b> was defined as mean decibel level equal to or higher than 60 in the better of the two ears. Visual <b>impairment</b> was found in 210 patients (23. 4 %) and hearing <b>impairment</b> was found in 231 patients (25. 8 %). Simultaneous visual and hear-ing <b>impairment</b> was seen in 72 patients (8 %). In univariate analysis, the absolute efficacy of rehabilitation was signifi-cantly lower in patients with visual <b>impairment</b> compared to those without (p = 0. 00001) and in patients with hearing <b>impairment</b> compared to those without (p = 0. 002). However, in multivariate analysis, visual, but not hearing, <b>impairment</b> {{was found to be}} independently associated with the absolute efficacy of rehabilitation (p = 0. 001). In light of these results, we propose that in the first phase of rehabilitation, patients’ visual acuity needs to be optimized.
