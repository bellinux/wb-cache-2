40|$|The new European Financial Supervisory Authorities have {{received}} much {{attention in the}} literature, particularly due to their exceptional emergency decision-making powers. By contrast, this article explicitly chooses to focus on these agencies' less explored yet equally crucial role: their (quasi-) rule-making responsibilities. While being less striking at first sight than their emergency counterparts, these <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers</b> are considerable, carry significant consequences, and raise some interesting dilemmas and concerns. This article complements the previous contribution by going at {{a lower level of}} specification and zooming in on a crucial case for studying rule-making by agencies as the Authorities constitute a culmination of agency <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers,</b> as well as agency powers, more broadly. The article will analyse the Authorities' main (quasi-) <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers</b> and the relevant procedures.

40|$|The <b>rule-making</b> <b>power</b> of the European Commission, {{dissertation}} Mgr. Mgr. Jiří Lenfeld, M. A.; supervisor: doc. JUDr. Richard Král, Ph. D., LL. M. Charles University, Faculty of Law, Department of European Law Prague, March 2013 The {{aim of the}} dissertation is {{to analyse}} {{the role of the}} European Commission in the legislative process of the European Union with the focus on procedures for adoption of legally binding Union acts. The European Commission {{is one of the main}} institutions of the European Union. It represents and upholds the interests of the EU as a whole and manages the day-to-day business of implementing EU policies. However, to limit the role of the European Commission to that of an executive body would be misleading. Its role in the EU institutional system is much broader than that. The European Commission is the most important legislator among the EU institutions and is also empowered with an almost exclusive power to submit drafts of EU legal acts. The <b>rule-making</b> <b>power</b> of the European Commission could be seen from two different points of view. In a narrow sense of the word it could be seen as a power conferred on the European Commission by the Treaties to propose drafts and to adopt EU legal acts implementing legally binding Union acts.

Therefore, the Plaintiffs assert that the FHFA is required to follow the APA’s requirements and give notice of the Directives or provide a formal public comment period. In other words, the FHFA created law without undergoing the proper procedures. Therefore, failure to follow APA requirements empowers the court to vacate the directives or to instruct the FHFA to follow proper APA procedure.

Non-compliance to CAC regulation presents a serious challenge to its effectiveness [...] The manner in which CAC is enforced differs between countries. For example, in the USA, some regulators who are tasked with implementing CAC techniques are given <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers.</b> Whereas in the UK, regulatory standards are more commonly set by departments of government. This is achieved through both primary and secondary legislation which is subsequently exacted by regulatory bureaucracies.

Enforcement of CAC often involves the use of uniform sanctions, this can result in small businesses feeling the burdens of regulation more severely than companies of a larger size.|$|R

40|$|The use of {{framework}} laws or 'skeleton' {{bills with}} lots of open texture and far-reaching delegation of <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers</b> to the executive, to independent agencies and to private rule-makers has started a process of the creeping 'deparliamentarisation' of legislation both at the national and the European level. In the Netherlands the position of Parliament as a co-actor in the legislative process is enshrined in the Constitution {{but that does not}} seem to protect citizens against the outsourcing of legislative tasks to non-elected bodies. At the European level a primacy of the parliamentary legislature appears to be emerging. Especially Article 290 TFEU lays down conditions for the delegation of regulatory powers and provides the European Parliament and Council with some tools for monitoring and control. How do framework directives relate to these conditions and does the choice for framework legislation at the EU level also affect the primacy of the national legislature? The central claim of this contribution is that the concept of the primacy of the legislature, which is supposed to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of legislation, is itself poorly protected by the current constitutional rules and practices.

40|$|This book {{deals with}} the {{difficult}} question of whom the European Parliament represents. Some legal provisions indicate that the European Parliament represents 'the peoples of the member states'; others frame it as the representative body of the 'Union citizens'. Parliament’s representative status is still a work in progress. Its evolution is driven in particular by actions of the European Parliament itself. Step by step it 'Europeanises' its electorate and the representation thereof. The treaties of the European Union have provided the European Parliament with only limited <b>rule-making</b> <b>power</b> to define whom it represents. However, Parliament’s need and capacity to act are also determined by what is considered 'appropriate behaviour'. As the present study reveals, it is generally accepted that elected parliaments ought to have substantial ‘representative autonomy’. The existence of this norm explains why, in defiance of formal limitations, {{the autonomy of the}} European Parliament to define itself and its electorate has effectively increased since the moment it was directly elected in 1979.

40|$|The {{forthcoming}} Commission White Paper on Governance devotes a {{good deal}} of attention to the possibility of delegating <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers</b> to independent European agencies. The extensive debate stimulated by thepreparation of this document has revealed deep differences of opinion. The orthodox doctrine, stubbornlydefended by the Legal Service, holds that such delegation would upset the balance of power among ECinstitutions, reduce the Commission’s ability to fulfill its duties under the treaties, and ultimately undermine theconstitutional foundations of the Community. By contrast, the reformers maintain that the received view ondelegation is by now completely outdated, and that the principle of institutional balance should be interpreteddynamically. These officials work {{at the cutting edge of}} regulatory policy and hence are particularly concernedabout the loss of status and credibility of the Commission. A career in an independent European agency isviewed as a promising alternative. The discourse of both reformers and defenders of the status quo depends crucially on the concept ofinstitutional balance. I argue that this concept can be properly understood only in the context of the venerabletheory of mixed government. This suggests that the European Community is not so much sui generis as the latterdayversion of a pre-modern model of governance. ideas; national interest; common interest; institutions; Europeanization; Europeanization...|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, the US was at {{the center}} of {{international}} instability that was a consequence of its rapid monetary growth (James, 1996). The US, however, had learned the fate of its predecessor’s key currency (e.g. Sterling). Britain’s experience as monetary hegemon demonstrated to the US the problems faced by a reserve currency when foreign monetary authorities, individuals, and investors chose to convert their reserves. In terms of monetary power defined by reserves, the US share of reserves had fallen from 50 percent in 1950 to 11 percent in August 1971 (Odell, 1982, p. 218). Although, the US had become considerably weak in defending convertibility, its <b>rule-making</b> <b>power</b> was second to none. Rather than being constrained by the system it created, the US moved to the conclusion that it “was better to attack the system than to work within it” (James, 1996, p. 203). This decision was based on the recognition of the inseparability between foreign policy and monetary policy. The termination of the Bretton Woods system signified the subordination of monetary policy to foreign policy. The closing of the gold window was a fix that was assigned to “free…foreign policy from constraints imposed by weaknesses in the financial system” (Gowa, 1983,p. 69).|$|R
40|$|Eleven federally {{recognized}} Indian {{tribes are}} located in Wisconsin. When civil disputes arise between tribal and non-tribal members, {{one of the first}} questions is which court has jurisdiction to resolve the parties’ quarrel. It may be that both the state and tribal courts have jurisdiction, such that the next question is, which court should proceed? Over the past several years, the Wisconsin Supreme Court, using both its decision-making and <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers,</b> along with sustained, cooperative efforts of tribal and state court judges, has devised various rules and guidelines by which many interjurisdictional issues can be decided. Decisions by the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Teague v. Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians resulted in jurisdictional allocation protocols for the two judicial districts where the bulk of the state’s Indian tribes are located. More recently, the state Supreme Court approved statutory guidelines for a less formal discretionary transfer of state court cases to tribal courts within Wisconsin. Other states may wish to use one or both mechanisms for assigning or transferring jurisdiction between tribal and state courts. To better explain the Wisconsin experience and to help readers identify areas of possible jurisdictional overlap, this article first will describe some of the procedural background of Teague and of the first case to apply the Teague protocol.

According to the German Court the Treaty of Lisbon does not transform the European Union into a Federal State (Staatsverband), but into a Confederation of States (Staatenverbund). In spite of the 1993 landmark judgment, the so-called “Maastricht Urteil”, the Court steps forward and focuses also the subject-matters that necessarily have to pertain to the Member States jurisdiction, the so-called “domain réservé”. The German Federal Constitutional Court decision on the Lisbon Treaty arouses the reflection on the core of State sovereignty and on the boundaries of the EU legal system and focuses on the force of the right to vote of every citizen, the basis of democracy. Furthermore, the decision of the German Federal Constitutional Court highlights the well-known issue of the EU’s identity and the balancing between EU democracy and Member State sovereignty.

40|$|The piece {{examines}} {{proposals for}} changing the current system for registering securities under the Securities Act of 1933. Under the current transaction-based system, issuers must register each non-exempt public offering of securities. Despite the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s <b>rule-making</b> <b>power,</b> regulatory revision, at least {{with respect to the}} implementation of any major changes to the existing federal securities regulation landscape, has traditionally followed a somewhat cyclical model. First, there is discussion in the academic and professional literature, commenting on, criticizing or proposing changes to some facet of the existing regulatory system (“public debate”); then, either overlapping with or following this public debate, the SEC may informally float non-binding suggestions for changes, through presentations at conferences, or unofficial articles and publications written by SEC staff members (“agency debate”). Again, perhaps overlapping with the agency debate, the SEC may next issue a formal statement, such as a release, containing proposals to address, and even further shape the discourse, seeking comments on the statements (“agency proposal”). After renewed public debate, and taking into consideration, to varying extents, the comments made, the SEC then exercises its <b>rule-making</b> <b>power</b> and formalizes the revisions into rules (“agency action”). Because of the cyclical nature of the model, as new rules are enacted and put into effect, courts may have an opportunity to interpret them or to pass on their constitutionality, and commentators and the private bar have an opportunity to evaluate the success of the new rules and any deficiencies or other issues arising therefrom, generating additional public debate. Thus, {{in the aftermath of the}} agency action, the cycle starts all over again (“next public debate”). The agency action portion of the model has become much easier for the SEC to accomplish in recent years. The SEC is now authorized by statute to go beyond rule-making simply to carry out the provisions of securities laws. Agency action to adopt a company registration system is the next logical step in the progression from a transaction-based registration system to a company-based registration system. This progression includes the public debate and agency action that was the precursor of company registration - the adoption of the integrated disclosure system for the primary offering and secondary trading markets and the adoption of the shelf registration process. This was followed by the penultimate step towards a company-based registration system, the universal shelf. Arguably, the entire federal securities regulatory system fits into the cyclical model. This Article, however, is limited to an exploration of the company registration proposal put forth by the SEC in July 1996 in its historical context. Part II of this Article is an application of the cyclical model to the adoption of the integrated disclosure system and the shelf registration process. Part III is an application of the cyclical model to the SEC 2 ̆ 7 s company registration proposal as a logical outflow of prior debates, including a discussion of possible issues left unresolved by or raised by the company registration proposal that may generate the next public debate, with a recommendation that the SEC adopt company registration...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article, and of its earlier {{companion}} article (Part (1) Rule-making, 12 European Business Organization Law Review (2011) p. 41), {{is to examine the}} implications of the new European Securities and Markets Authority which was established in January 2011. In the wake of the financial crisis, the case for institutional reform and for conferring regulatory and supervisory powers on a central EU authority became compelling. But any institutional design would have struggled given the necessity for compromise. The central difficulty is one of nuance. Where on the spectrum from national powers to EU powers, and with respect to regulation and supervision, should any new body's powers be placed if optimum outcomes are to be achieved? The question is further complicated by the different dynamics and risks of centralising rule-making and of centralising supervision, even if there is considerable symbiosis between these activities. This article considers ESMA's supervisory powers. It argues that, by contrast with its <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers,</b> the current and potential extent of ESMA's supervisory powers has pushed ESMA too high up the spectrum towards EU intervention. Local supervision of the EU rule-book represents an important safety valve for the EU financial market but this safety valve may be obstructed by ESMA's undue standardisation of supervisory practices. ESMA's extensive direct supervisory powers are also troubling given concerns as to their effectiveness. It was {{always going to be a}} challenge to draw the dividing line between ESMA's supervisory powers and those of national competent authorities.

40|$|The Connecticut Practice Act, {{effected}} January 1, 18 S 0, {{has established}} what {{has generally been}} {{considered one of the}} most effective systems of civil procedure in existence. There were various reasons for this success. The Act was adopted after considerable experience in the various states with the Field code or reformed procedure inaugurated in New York in 1848 as well as with the reform in England accomplished by the Judicature Acts of 1871 and 1873. Profiting by the teachings of this experience it avoided some of the pitfalls met with elsewhere and developed a simple and effective union of law and equity. Fairly extensive <b>rule-making</b> <b>power</b> was continued in the courts, the benefits of which, while not fully realized, have become increasingly apparent since the creation a few years ago of a Judicial Council.

Unfortunately even a fine practice system, like all orderly processes involving an increasing number of technical requirements, tends to petrifaction, and some danger may be discerned lest the originally excellent Connecticut system becomes overtechnical just at a time when a ferment of reform activity is remolding the procedure of several states and of the federal trial courts. The publication of a new Practice Book compiled by a Committee of Superior Court Judges, containing over 300 forms of complaints and a total of 680 official forms, affords perhaps a fitting occasion to express some concern lest Connecticut lose its procedural preeminence...|$|R
40|$|International {{relations}} {{theory has}} posited that transnational advocacy networks (TANs) affect {{international human rights}} norms. Human rights norms are created through a political process that involves both state and non-state actors. I establish in this project the importance of network structure as a determinant for how well human rights principles advocated by transnational networks transition into international norms. Centralized network structure is {{a key factor in}} explaining TAN effectiveness over time. Using insights from social network analysis, I build a theory that argues centralization in networks leads to the ability for certain nodes to control the agenda and <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers,</b> allowing for a core set of principles to develop within a network, and making it more likely those principles can be advocated successfully in international politics. In a historical overview of the post-World War II era, I demonstrate that although many principles of human rights existed {{in the middle of the}} 20 th century, none held an internationally normative status. Even a document as vaunted as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights evinces the lack of agreement, rather than the consensus over which rights were mattered most. I then move to a network analysis of Amnesty International, from 1968 - 1980, demonstrating the power of centralization as the factor explaining its success in influencing international norms. I also show that Amnesty's network structure differed from its formal structure, affecting the flows of information within the network. I move to a comparison of other human rights-related TANs, the International Red Cross, Oxfam International, and Médecins Sans Frontières. Finally, I conclude with an analysis of state behavior as an indicator of international norms, using economic sanctions data from the 20 th centur...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the issue}} of the most {{efficient}} allocation of regulatory responsibilities among the subnational, national, and European Community (EC) levels of government is addressed. The most obvious impact of EC regulations on national and subnational policies is a transfer of legislative competences to the EC, as the principle of supremacy of EC law bars member states from passing laws inconsistent with the relevant EC legislation. There are less obvious but no less important ways in which EC regulations influence the political process in the member states. Thus, the process of implementation of EC regulations at the national level has led to an increase in the <b>rule-making</b> <b>powers</b> of the member states' executives and a corresponding weakening {{of the role of the}} national parliaments. Also, the relationship between central and subnational governments is significantly affected, especially in countries with a federal or regional structure. It is argued that, despite the theoretical and political appeal of decentralization in a community of nations as varied as in the EC, many regulatory powers will have to be surrendered by the national governments after completion of the internal market. The dilemma of regulatory federalism is that, although local governments are more attuned to individual tastes, they are also unlikely to make a clean separation between the provision of public goods for their citizens and engaging in policies designed to the advantage of the locality at the expense of its neighbours. Because the integrated European market is such a new creation, the threat posed by the strategic use of regulation to the advantage of one jurisdiction at the expense of other jurisdictions is probably more serious than the danger of excessive and inefficient uniformity. It is also important to keep in mind that the optimal assignment of regulatory responsibilities between different levels of government does not have to coincide with existing national boundaries. There may be significant externalities and a need for coordination between some, but not all, regions within a country or group of countries. A model which deserves particular attention in this context is that of consortia or compacts' among several states, or regions within different states, sharing similar problems. ...|$|R
