Show runner Mike Scully commented that, [...] "It's hard enough <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up with the ideas, but when Dominic and the animators can make it, it's really fantastic." ...|$|E
500|$|Henry {{scored two}} late goals in Arsenal’s victory over Birmingham City on 4 December 2004. Wenger {{replaced}} Lehmann in goal with Almunia, {{who made his}} league debut. Arsenal then faced league leaders Chelsea at Highbury; the match was billed as [...] "Judgement Day" [...] by Sky Sports. With Vieira suspended and Gilberto and Edu injured, Wenger picked Flamini to partner Fabregas in midfield. The first chance of the match went to Henry, who scored inside 75 seconds. John Terry levelled the score, but Henry restored Arsenal’s lead from a contentious free-kick – Graham Poll allowed the striker to take it quickly without warning the Chelsea players.

There were no further goals and the match ended 2–2, meaning Chelsea remained five points clear of Arsenal.

[...] They played several tracks from their upcoming album, at that point entitled It's What's Not There That Makes What's There What It Is. By May, it had been renamed to Paper Scissors Stone. Matthews was looking forward to the new releasing, explaining to NME that [...] "I think it's stronger than the last album, a bit more avant garde!...It's a bit less stupid.

Simon Webbe added: [...] "We believe {{this is going to be}} the best {{springboard}} <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back on.
