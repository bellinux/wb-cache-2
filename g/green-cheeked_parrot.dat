5000|$|Pineapple is {{cinnamon}} and yellow-sided combination. They have a breast of bright colors, a tan head and lime green feathers {{on the back}} like a cinnamon <b>green-cheeked</b> <b>parrot.</b> The tail feathers {{are the same as}} a yellow-sided, showing a halo effect.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Green-cheeked</b> <b>parrots</b> {{are common}} in aviculture and are popular {{companion}} parrots. They are playful, affectionate and intelligent, known as having a [...] "big personality in a small body". They can learn to talk, albeit with a limited vocabulary and a gravelly voice. They like to be held (although some like it more than others) and can learn tricks such as lying on their backs, [...] "kissing," [...] shaking, hanging upside down and even can be potty trained. <b>Green-cheeked</b> <b>parrots</b> are quiet, so even an apartment dweller can enjoy their companionship. They can be prone to biting, particularly when young, but an owner can cure this behavior with patience and time.|$|R
50|$|They love fruits, (especially {{bananas and}} raisins), and seeds such as {{sunflower}}, safflower, and hemp seeds—all {{found in their}} natural environments. <b>Green-cheeked</b> <b>parrots</b> also love table food—they are flock animals and love to eat with their family. They can eat potatoes, carrots, corn, bread, pasta, and plain popcorn. A clipped and/or caged bird can become obese from eating too many fatty seeds such as sunflower seeds and peanuts. A bird-pellet diet with a calcium supplement provides proper nutrition and should comprise 60-70% of their diet. A {{good rule of thumb}} is 70% pellet diet, 20% fruit and vegetables and <10% treat items. Parrots with health problems related to the kidneys should not be fed a high protein diet, as it may lead to gout; veterinarian prescribed low-protein diets are available for birds with such conditions. <b>Green-cheeked</b> <b>parrots</b> can live to 30 years with proper care, though the average lifespan is typically 10 years due to owner neglect.|$|R
5000|$|The red-crowned amazon, (Amazona viridigenalis) {{also known}} as red-crowned <b>parrot,</b> <b>green-cheeked</b> amazon, or Mexican {{red-headed}} parrot, is an endangered amazon parrot native to northeastern Mexico. The current native wild population of between 1,000 and 2,000 is decreasing. The main threats to the native bird's survival are the illegal export of trapped birds from Mexico to the United States {{and the destruction of}} habitat.|$|R
