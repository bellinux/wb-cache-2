40|$|Ensilage of {{red clover}} results in lower {{concentrations}} of non-protein nitrogen {{compared to other}} forage legumes. It is assumed that the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity in red clover is related to this effect. Therefore, a laboratory ensiling trial was carried out to quantify the changes in crude protein (CP) fractions during the ensiling process using the Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System. At four cutting <b>dates,</b> <b>fresh,</b> wilted and ensiled herbage of three red clover genotypes and white clover grown in two systems (with and without mechanical stress) was sampled. The specific PPO activity was measured photometrically in fresh leaves of the plants. Concentrations of fraction A increased from 130 - 197 g/kg CP to 372 - 544 g/kg CP during the fermentation process leading to a drop in true protein, primarily fraction B 1. The most important source of variance was the ensiling stage, except for fraction C.

Peaches are a tree crop, so the fruit are never in contact with the soil, and fecal contamination from past land use is not a serious concern. Furthermore, the non-bearing orchard establishment phase allows time for any microbiological contamination present to have time to become inactivated. The possibility of toxic residues in the soil, such as heavy metals from sewage sludge or excessive pesticide residues, should receive greater scrutiny. Soils may also become naturally contaminated with animal feces. For example, deer browsing in peach orchards may leave fecal contamination behind. The key management imperative is that manure should never have an opportunity to come in contact with fruit. Drops or windfalls, peaches that fall to the ground, should never be picked up and utilized as fresh-market fruit. Irrigation Water. Clean water, free of pathogenic microorganisms, is a key component of good, on-far...|$|R

40|$|Traditional {{agriculture}} and non-chemical crop production {{have a long}} story; however organic agriculture which relies on local and in-farm inputs, {{with the aim of}} protecting ecological balances and developing biological cycles on the one hand while regarding regulations and specific standards on the other hand, doesn’t have a very long history. There are numerous environmental reasons for the priority of organic agriculture to conventional systems such as increasing biodiversity, reducing chemical residue in plant and animal products, reducing greenhouse gases and air temperatures; and socio-economic factors like equity and sustainability. Worldwide, in 2006 about 31 million hectares were managed organically with estimated international sales of over 38 billion US dollars. There are very specific standards, regulations and criteria for organic agriculture for the security of producers and consumers, suitable competition between producers and clear regulations for international trades of organic products. Standards in organic agriculture are principles, regulations and criteria that must be considered from production up to processing and consumption. Although Iran has a very long history in {{agriculture and}} a variety of cereals and pulses have been domesticated in its regions, unfortunately, there are no organic production plans and standards for this country. During these recent years, there have been international interests especially on behalf of European countries towards exporting some organic products such as pistachio, walnut, <b>date,</b> <b>fresh</b> fruits and saffron from Iran, but the main reason for the refusal of our products could be the absence of organic standards which are to be considered during the production of those products.

This study evaluates three different freezing methods, namely cryogenic freezing (CF) using liquid nitrogen; individual quick freezing (IQF) and conventional slow freezing (CSF) in preserving the quality and stability of dates during frozen storage. <b>Fresh</b> <b>dates</b> were frozen utilizing the three methods. The produced frozen dates were frozen stored for nine months.

In all plantings, the earliest (2 May) lifting gave highest average second-year survival in all species. In another study, Mullin (1978) found that outplantings of frozen-stored 3+0 white spruce were consistently successful to the end of July only with the earliest -lifted (25 April) stock. Sutton (1982) also used 3+0 white spruce in outplanting every 2 weeks from the end of June through the growing season in 3 successive years on a variety of sites in northern Ontario. Despite variation in planting stock, poor storage environments and adverse weather, 4th-year results showed a consistent pattern of reasonable survival and growth rates among trees planted through July, with a rapid decline in performance of trees planted thereafter. Overwinter storage of stock has also been employed. It has the advantage of lifting stock {{at the end of the}} growing season when physiological processes are invoking natural dormancy. Time of fall lifting was investigated by Mullin and Parker (1976) along with overwinter storage temperature to determine their effects on the performance of spring-planted 3+0 white spruce. There were 5 lifts, weekly from 19 October through 16 November, after which frozen ground put a stop to lifting. Two storage temperatures were used, -18 °C and -4 °C. Nearly all of the trees stored at -18 °C died. The other stock was planted in shallow furrows in sparsely sodded field of loamy sand on 12 April, 17 May, and 14 June along with fresh-lifted stock on each <b>date.</b> <b>Fresh</b> and stored white spruce gave comparable results in plantings extended into mid-June in the Midhurst area of Ontario.|$|R

Since launch, the optimal dose for treatment of schizophrenia of risperidone has been established at 4 - 6 mg/day and that of olanzapine at around 15 mg/day. We have applied these more realistic dosing assumptions to the published economic comparisons between the various atypical agents and conclude that there are economic and efficacy arguments for risperidone to be considered as the first choice for treatment of patients with schizophrenia. The other atypicals, such as olanzapine and clozapine, should be used as second-line therapy in preference to conventional agents such as haloperidol. Funding arguments support this approach and reinforce the need to reconsider therapy for patients whose current treatment may not be optimal. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
