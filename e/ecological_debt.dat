5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled Payback, Atwood {{examines}} <b>ecological</b> <b>debt.</b> She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of Earth Day. In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, over-fishing and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} proposes {{an approach}} to energy that transcends the focus on energy as a mere technical economic or engineering problem, is connected to sociological theory as a whole, and takes issues of equality and ecology as theoretical starting points. In doing so, the work presented here puts ecological and environmental sociological theory, {{and the work of}} environmental justice scholars, feminist ecologists, and energy scholars, in a context in which they may complement one another to broaden the theoretical basis of the current sociology of energy. This theoretical integration provides {{an approach to}} energy focused on energy justice. Understanding energy and society in the terms outlined here makes visible energy injustice, or the interface between social inequalities and ecological depredations accumulating as the social and <b>ecological</b> <b>debts</b> of the modern energy regime. Systems ecology is brought into this framework as a means for understanding unequal exchange, energy injustice more generally, and the requirements for long-term social and ecological reproduction in ecological terms. Energy developments in Ecuador and Cuba are used here as case studies in order to further develop the idea of energy justice and the theory of unequal ecological exchange. The point is to broaden the framework of the contemporary critical sociology of energy, putting energy justice at its heart. This dissertation contains previously published and unpublished co-authored material...|$|R
40|$|Afterimage {{is a set}} {{of works}} which we made by {{removing}} and destroying our photographs, which had previously been conservation mounted onto aluminium substrates by John Jones of London. For example, Afterimage I is produced from a photograph which we had mounted and exhibited at Artefiera Bologna, Italy, in 2004, then returned to London and placed in storage. By 2012, speculation on London property had made the pressure on space intolerable, and at last we decided to dispose of the work. Meaning to recycle the aluminium, we tore off the photograph, but when we saw the exposed metal we began an unexpected enquiry, {{at the level of the}} substrate under the picture plane. Afterimage embodies the process of its own (un) making: our removal and destruction of the photograph transforms the work from image to object, exposing the substrate as part of a wider support structure. With its high strength to weight ratio, aluminium is essential to aviation and aerospace, yet its production demands vast quantities of energy that result in high levels of CO 2 emissions. So using aluminium as a substrate for artworks links contemporary art as a form of conspicuous consumerism with the corporate infrastructure of military-industrial globalisation. The relationship between value and scarcity is socially produced. The number of our photographs that we could remove and destroy was limited by the moment in time when we recognised the idea. As an element, aluminium signifies a certain purity. But its over-use has made it banal, and so dispersed attention from its nature as a profligate material, loaded with <b>ecological</b> and social <b>debt.</b> Afterimage is complicit in destruction-as-production. Yet the work also proposes that by accepting material limits and the irreversible nature of certain decisions, the possibilities increase for transformation from one state to another...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Ecological</b> <b>Debt</b> {{has been}} used to {{describe}} the consumption of resources from within an ecosystem that exceeds the system's regenerative capacity. [...] This is seen in particular in non-renewable resources wherein consumption outstrips production. In a general sense, {{it can be used to}} refer to the overall depletion of global resources beyond the Earth's ability to regenerate them. The concept in this sense is based on the bio-physical carrying capacity of an ecosystem; through measuring ecological footprints human society can determine the rate at which it is depleting natural resources. Ultimately, the imperative of sustainability requires human society to live within the means of the ecological system to support life over the long term. <b>Ecological</b> <b>debt</b> is a feature of unsustainable economic systems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> {{manifested}} {{in the destruction of}} the environment and associated climate change the North has created is made possible through the process of modernization and capitalism. There is a disassociation between the wealthy capitalists in the North and the environment. Men in particular through industrialization have viewed themselves as separate from nature, and further, they view nature as a tool to profit from, and continually use and abuse without consequences. The notion of humans being embedded in the ecosystem that they live in is crucial to the discipline of political ecology. In political ecology, which reconnects nature and the economy, <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> is crucial because it recognizes that colonialisation has not only resulted in a loss of culture, way of life, and language for Indigenous peoples, but it has shaped the world economy into one that monetizes and commodifies the environment. For example, when the colonialisation of South America occurred over 500 years ago, Western Europeans brought with them their eurocentric values, seeing themselves as better than and therefore entitled to the indigenous people's knowledge and the land they lived on. In a perceived post colonial world, large corporations and Western governments tend to present solutions to global warming by commodifying nature and hoping to make a profit. This better-than-thou attitude has created the conditions for global warming to occur, making the North’s ecological footprint soar, while also constructing an <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> so large as to completely rid the entire global South of their financial debt.|$|E

50|$|Feminist environmentalists, {{indigenous}} activists, and peasants {{from the}} global South, primarily in Ecuador, exposed how the global North is much more indebted to the global South. Salleh justifies this by explaining how the 500-year-long colonialisation process involving the extraction of resources has caused immense damage and destruction to the ecosystem of the global South. In fact, scientists at the US National Academy for Sciences state that in the time period of 1961 - 2000, analyzing the cost of greenhouse gas emissions created by the rich (the global North) alone, it has become apparent that the rich have imposed climate changes on the poor that greatly outweigh the poor’s foreign debt. All of this environmental degradation amounts to <b>ecological</b> <b>debt,</b> seizing the people’s livelihood resources in the global South.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> concept {{emerged in}} the early 1990 s from within social {{movements}} driven by rising environmental awareness, emerging Western consciousness of responsibility for past colonial subjugations, and a general sense of unease during the debt crisis. First developed organically, mainly in locally-scaled, civil contexts, <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> has since gained attention in academia and international environmental negotiations. Now, the concept of <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> requires further elucidation and elaboration, {{especially in light of}} its historical interconnection with environmental justice. In this paper, the development of the concept of <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> in both activist and academic circles is described, proposed theoretical building blocks for its operationalization are discussed and three brief cases illustrating its recent utilization are presented. <b>Ecological</b> <b>debt</b> is built upon a theoretical foundation that draws on biophysical accounting systems, ecological economics, environmental justice and human rights, historical injustices and restitution, and an ecologically-oriented world-system analysis framework. Drawing on these building blocks, the concept of <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> {{has been used as a}} biophysical measure, a legal instrument and a distributional principle. In theory and in practice, it has much to offer the environmental justice movement. We conclude by reflecting on some of the pros and cons of the <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> concept as a tool to be used in fulfilling some of the goals of environmental justice movements in the world today.

A particular challenge is presented by emissions of substances that have global consequences, most importantly carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.

40|$|This paper takes <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> as {{a measure}} of {{environmental}} injustice, and appraises this idea as a driving force for change in the international legal system. Environmental justice is understood here as a fair distribution of charges and benefits derived from using natural resources, in order to provide minimal welfare standards to all human beings, including future generations. <b>Ecological</b> <b>debt</b> measures this injustice, as an unfair and illegitimate distribution of benefits and burdens within the social metabolism, including ecologically unequal exchange, as a disproportionate appropriation and impairment of common goods, such as the atmosphere. Structural features of the international system promote a lack of transparency, control and accountability of power, through a pro-growth and pro-freedom language. In theory, this discourse comes with the promise of compensation for ordinary people, but in fact it benefits only a few. <b>Ecological</b> <b>debt,</b> as a symptom of the pervasive injustice of the current balance of power, demands an equivalent response, unravelling and deconstructing real power behind the imagery of equally sovereign states. It claims a counterhegemonic agenda aiming at rebuilding international law from a pluralist, 'third world' or Southern perspective and improving the balance of power. <b>Ecological</b> <b>debt</b> should not only serve as a means of compensation, but as a conceptual definition of an unfair system of human relations, which needs change. It may also help to define the burdens to be assumed as costs for the change required in international relations, i. e. by promoting the constitutionalization of international law and providing appropriate protection to human beings under the paradigms of sustainability (not sustainable development) and equity...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} its strong appeal to NGOs, to certain governments and to some scholars, {{the concept of an}} <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> {{accumulated}} by developed countries due to their historical responsibility deserve a serious critical assessment. The paper provides this assessment in the context of climate change. It first shows how the rhetoric of <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> exploits confusion between a pre-modern concept of social debt and the modern one based on the contract figure. Two components of the climate debt are examined: a presumed duty of compensation of the damage imposed by climate change and rules of sharing out of atmospheric services when developed countries are presumed to have emitted GHGs in the past in excess of their fair share. The discussion considers successively the legal and the moral viewpoint. A review of arguments shows that both concepts of <b>ecological</b> <b>debt</b> and historical responsibility disintegrate under scrutiny in the case of climate change, as ill-founded backward-looking reparative concepts as well as additional obstacles to a forward-looking agreement in which responsibilities could legitimately be differentiated according to various variables referring to current states (emissions levels, needs, capacities, etc.).
