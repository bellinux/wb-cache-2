5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to everyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela {{should be the one}} to break the news. Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the office already knew about it.|$|E

5|$|A {{concurrent}} use registration {{can be very}} detailed in the geographic divisions laid down. It may, for example, allow one party to own {{the right to use}} a mark within a fifty-mile radius around a handful of selected cities or counties, while the other party owns the right to use the same mark everywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the country. It may even divide the rights to use a mark within a particular city by reference to roads or other landmarks in that city.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} of this period was the appearance of stellate (star-shaped) shrines in a few temples built of the traditional sandstone, such as the Trimurti Temple at Savadi, the Paramesvara Temple at Konnur and the Gauramma Temple at Hire Singgangutti. In all three cases, the shrine is a 16-pointed uninterrupted star, a ground-plan not found anywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> India and which entirely differentiates these temples from the 32-pointed interrupted star plans of bhumija shrines in northern India.|$|E

The latter remark attracted as much criticism as anything <b>else</b> <b>in</b> his career.|$|E

5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No one <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public political life or coordinated economic development.|$|E

5|$|Roman troops, however, {{penetrated}} {{far into}} the north of modern Scotland several more times. Indeed, {{there is a greater}} density of Roman marching camps in Scotland than anywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> Europe, as a result of at least four major attempts to subdue the area. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus, claiming to be provoked by the belligerence of the Maeatae, campaigned against the Caledonian Confederacy. Severus invaded Caledonia with an army perhaps over 40,000 strong.|$|E
5|$|Sebum, {{secreted}} by the {{sebaceous gland}} in humans, is primarily composed of triglycerides (~41%), wax esters (~26%), squalene (~12%), and {{free fatty acids}} (~16%). The composition of sebum varies across species. Wax esters and squalene are unique to sebum and not produced as final products anywhere <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the body. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans, and is implicated {{in the development of}} acne. Sebum is odorless, but its breakdown by bacteria can produce strong odors.|$|E

Hurricane Dean, the most intense storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season, formed in the Atlantic Ocean west of Cape Verde on August 14, 2007. The Cape Verde-type hurricane sped through the Caribbean Sea, rapidly intensifying before making landfall on Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula. Accurate forecasts of the storm's location and intensity enabled thorough preparations; nevertheless when the massive storm made landfall on the Yucatán Peninsula as a catastrophic Category5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale it damaged thousands of homes.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Scott and {{his party}} overshadowed all <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the British public's mind, {{including}} Amundsen's feat in being first at the Pole. For many years the image of Scott as a tragic hero, beyond reproach, remained virtually unchallenged, for although there were rifts among some who were close to the expedition, including relatives of those who died, this disharmony was not public. There was no real change in public perceptions until the 1970s, by which time nearly all those directly concerned with the expedition were dead.|$|E

For these reasons, it is protected by numerous wildlife and wetland conventions, and is of great national and international importance in these areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{selection}} of Leech and Morgan for the 6 December final generated controversy, {{as they were}} the two youngest swimmers in the squad and lacked experience at open level competition. Both had competed only once at senior Australian level; Morgan had twice false started at the 1956 Australian Championships, while Leech had been too ill to compete. Australia was the favourite for the relay, having swept the medals in the individual 100-metre event; Fraser, Crapp and Leech finished first, second and third. The favouritism was even more marked because Fraser and Crapp were three seconds faster than everyone <b>else</b> <b>in</b> the world.|$|E

Ratings continued to decline on the Thursday evening shows, with both shows being viewed by fewer than four million viewers for the first time, 3.81m and 3.86m respectively, seeing the first show being beaten by BBC One's Watchdog which gained 5.23m in the 8pm slot.|$|E
