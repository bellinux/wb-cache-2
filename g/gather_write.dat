Not only did papal record-keeping remove decision-making from local hands, but it also enabled review of correct belief, structured community responses to the sacred, and provided an effective display of papal rights. During the process of St. Gilbert of Sempringham in 1201 – 1203, Pope Innocent III articulated new record-keeping requirements.

We suggest another method that reallocates data pages that tend to be simultaneously written to contiguous blocks. Our method <b>gathers</b> <b>write</b> operations during a period of time and generates write traces.

Experiments using TPC-C workload demonstrated that our method successfully reduce 6 % of total logical block access...|$|R

Duncan Cooper of The Fader magazine wrote that the song is [...] "lyrically inspired, tough as hell and easily the best thing" [...] on 4.
