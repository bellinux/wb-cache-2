40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{role of the}} Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 chaperone {{system in}} mediating maturation of protein kinase clients and supporting kinase functional activity {{is essential for the}} integrity and viability of signaling pathways involved in cell cycle control and organism development. Despite significant advances in understanding structure and function of molecular chaperones, the molecular mechanisms and guiding principles of kinase recruitment to the chaperone system are lacking quantitative characterization. Structural and thermodynamic characterization of Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 binding with protein kinase clients by modern experimental techniques is highly challenging, owing to a transient nature of chaperone-mediated interactions. In this work, we used experimentally-guided protein <b>docking</b> to <b>probe</b> the allosteric nature of the Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 binding with the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk 4) kinase clients. The results of docking simulations suggest that the kinase recognition and recruitment to the chaperone system may be primarily determined by Cdc 37 targeting of the N-terminal kinase lobe. The interactions of Hsp 90 with the C-terminal kinase lobe may provide additional “molecular brakes” that can lock (or unlock) kinase from the system during client loading (release) stages. The results of this study support a central role of the Cdc 37 chaperone in recognition and recruitment of the kinase clients. Structural analysis may have useful implications in developing strategies for allosteric inhibition of protein kinases by targeting the Hsp 90 -Cdc 37 chaperone machinery...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Protein–small {{molecule}} docking algorithms {{provide a}} means to model the struc-ture of protein–small molecule complexes in struc-tural detail and {{play an important role}} in drug development. In recent years the necessity of sim-ulating protein side-chain flexibility for an accu-rate prediction of the protein–small molecule inter-faces has become apparent, and an increasing number of <b>docking</b> algorithms <b>probe</b> different ap-proaches to include protein flexibility. Here we de-scribe a new method for docking small molecules into protein binding sites employing a Monte Carlo minimization procedure in which the rigid body position and orientation of the small mole-cule and the protein side-chain conformations are optimized simultaneously. The energy function comprises van der Waals (VDW) interactions, an implicit solvation model, an explicit orientation hydrogen bonding potential, and an electrostatics model. In an evaluation of the scoring function the computed energy correlated with experimen-tal small molecule binding energy with a correla-tion coefficient of 0. 63 across a diverse set of 229 protein – small molecule complexes. The docking method produced lowest energy models with a root mean square deviation (RMSD) smaller than 2 A ̊ in 71 out of 100 protein–small molecule crystal structure complexes (self-docking). In cross-docking calculations in which both protein side-chain and small molecule internal degrees of freedom were varied the lowest energy predictions had RMSDs less than 2 A ̊ in 14 of 20 test cases.

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the November-December meeting, the {{two teams}} had signed a set of minutes {{outlining}} the basic concept for a universal androgynous docking system.

[...] Basic information on shapes and dimensions of the guides were also included in the minutes. They were to be solid and not rodlike; as first proposed by the Soviets, and three in number. As long as the requirement for absorbing docking forces was met, each side was free to execute the actual attenuator design as it best saw fit. The Soviets planned to use an electromechanical approach designed for the Soyuz <b>docking</b> <b>probe,</b> and the Americans proposed to stick with hydraulic shock absorbers similar to those used on the Apollo probe.

50|$|Following the {{completion}} of the transfer, the crew resealed the hatches between the crafts and prepared to jettison the LM. This was different from the undocking that took place before landing. In this case it would be an explosive jettison as much of the <b>docking</b> <b>probe</b> structure was now unneeded and will stay in the LM. There was some difficulty in getting the tunnel between the crafts to depressurize. This suggested that there was an improperly sealed hatch, delaying the separation by one orbit. After checking the hatches the crew could not find a cause for the improper seal, but the tunnel now vented successfully. In his 2001 memoir, Flight Director Christopher Kraft wrote that some of these difficulties may have been the result of crew fatigue. Because of the longer lunar stay time, by this point Scott and Irwin had gone an arduous 22 hours without sleep, and both men had experienced some heart irregularities on the lunar surface after their EVAs. Kraft wrote that coordination between ground controllers and the crew broke down several times {{at this point in the}} mission, and he recalled this as one of the most stressful experiences during his career in mission control.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the keys}} to the success of aerial {{refueling}} for probe-drogue aerial refueling system (PDARS) is the successful <b>docking</b> between the <b>probe</b> and drogue. The study of probe-drogue docking success probability offers an important support to achieving successful docking. During the docking phase of PDARS, based on prior information and reasonable assumptions for the movements of the drogue under atmospheric disturbance, the probe-drogue docking success probability is converted to the probability of the drogue center located in a specific area. A model of the probe-drogue docking success probability is established with and without actuation error, respectively. The curves of the probe-drogue docking success probability with the standard deviation of the drogue central position, the maximum distance from the drogue center position to the equilibrium position, the actuation error, and the standard deviation of the actuation error are obtained through simulations. The study has referential value for the docking maneuver decision of aerial refueling for PDARS...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStudying complex {{molecular}} assemblies interactively {{is becoming}} an increasingly appealing approach to molecular modeling. Here we focus on interactive molecular dynamics (IMD) as a textbook example for interactive simulation methods. Such simulations {{can be useful in}} exploring and generating hypotheses about the structural and mechanical aspects of biomolecular interactions. For the first time, we carry out low-resolution coarse-grain IMD simulations. Such simplified modeling methods currently appear to be more suitable for interactive experiments and represent a well-balanced compromise between an important gain in computational speed versus a moderate loss in modeling accuracy compared to higher resolution all-atom simulations. This is particularly useful for initial exploration and hypothesis development for rare molecular interaction events. We evaluate which applications are currently feasible using molecular assemblies from 1900 to over 300, 000 particles. Three biochemical systems are discussed: the guanylate kinase (GK) enzyme, the outer membrane protease T and the soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors complex involved in membrane fusion. We induce large conformational changes, carry out interactive <b>docking</b> experiments, <b>probe</b> lipid-protein interactions and are able to sense the mechanical properties of a molecular model. Furthermore, such interactive simulations facilitate exploration of modeling parameters for method improvement. For the purpose of these simulations, we have developed a freely available software library called MDDriver. It uses the IMD protocol from NAMD and facilitates the implementation and application of interactive simulations. With MDDriver it becomes very easy to render any particle-based molecular simulation engine interactive. Here we use its implementation in the Gromacs software as an example...|$|R
40|$|The Toll-like {{receptor}} 4 (TLR 4) is a class I transmembrane receptor expressed on {{the surface}} of immune system cells. TLR 4 is activated by exposure to lipopolysaccharides derived from the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria and forms part of the innate immune response in mammals. Like other class 1 receptors, TLR 4 is activated by ligand induced dimerization, and recent studies suggest that this causes concerted conformational changes in the receptor leading to self association of the cytoplasmic Toll/Interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) signalling domain. This homodimerization event is proposed to provide a new scaffold that is able to bind downstream signalling adaptor proteins. TLR 4 uses two different sets of adaptors; TRAM and TRIF, and Mal and MyD 88. These adaptor pairs couple two distinct signalling pathways leading to the activation of interferon response factor 3 (IRF- 3) and nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) respectively. In this paper we have generated a structural model of the TLR 4 TIR dimer and used molecular <b>docking</b> to <b>probe</b> for potential sites of interaction between the receptor homodimer and the adaptor molecules. Remarkably, both the Mal and TRAM adaptors are strongly predicted to bind at two symmetry-related sites at the homodimer interface. This model of TLR 4 activation is supported by extensive functional studies involving site directed mutagenesis, inhibition by cell permeable peptides and stable protein phosphorylation of receptor and adaptor TIR domains. Our results also suggest a molecular mechanism for two recent findings, the caspase 1 dependence of Mal signalling and the protective effects conferred by the Mal polymorphism Ser 180 Leu...|$|R

Before vehicle separation in lunar orbit, manual cocking of the twelve ring latches was accomplished. The separating force from the internal pressure in the tunnel area was then transmitted from the ring latches to the probe and drogue.In undocking, {{the release of the}} capture latches was accomplished by electrically energizing tandem-mounted DC rotary solenoids located in the center piston. In a temperature degraded condition, a single motor release operation was done manually in the Lunar Module by depressing the locking spool through an open hole in the probe heads, while release from the CSM was done by rotating a release handle {{at the back of the}} probe to rotate the motor torque shaft manually.When the Command and Lunar Modules separated for the last time just before re-entry, the <b>probe</b> and forward <b>docking</b> ring were pyrotechnically separated, leaving all docking equipment {{attached to the}} lunar module.
