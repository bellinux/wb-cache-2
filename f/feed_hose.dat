50|$|During {{a routine}} pit stop, the tires {{are laid out}} beforehand, {{and three of the}} four tire changers are pre-positioned before the car enters its pit stall. The fourth tire changer, whose {{responsibility}} is the rear tire {{on the far side of}} pit road from the pit wall, does not take his position until after the car arrives, due to a rule against having the car run over the <b>feed</b> <b>hose</b> for the impact wrench used to change the tires, and a prohibition of using an overhead boom to support air hoses.|$|E
5000|$|Grade‑D {{air supply}} (or {{self-contained}} oil-less air pump) - The air <b>feed</b> <b>hose</b> is typically {{attached to a}} grade‑D pressurized air supply. Grade‑D air is mandated by OSHA to protect the worker from hazardous gases. It includes a pressure regulator, air filtration and a carbon monoxide monitor/alarm. An alternative method is a self-contained, oil-less air pump to feed pressurized air to the blast hood/helmet. An oil-less air pump does not require an air filter or carbon monoxide monitor/alarm, because the pressurized air is coming from a source that cannot generate carbon monoxide.|$|E
50|$|In May 2014, Holden {{recalled}} nearly 42,000 VF and WN Caprice models after {{a potential}} problem with the front seatbelts was identified. It {{was found that the}} pretensioner wiring harness for the seatbelts could make contact with part of the buckle assembly, leading to premature wearing of the wiring harness which could disable the pretensioner system {{in the event of an}} accident. The VF was recalled again a month later, when it was found that the drive gear for the windscreen wiper motor could fail. LPG models were recalled in July after it was identified that the <b>feed</b> <b>hose</b> could develop a slow leak at the end of the vehicle's lifetime, creating a low risk of fire.|$|E
6000|$|While {{the fireman}} was {{lowering}} the <b>feeding</b> <b>hose,</b> Bob Tidball, [...] "Shark" [...] Dodson and a quarter-bred Creek Indian called John Big Dog climbed {{on the engine}} and showed the engineer three round orifices in pieces of ordnance that they carried. These orifices so impressed the engineer with their possibilities that he raised both hands in a gesture such as accompanies the ejaculation [...] "Do tell!" ...|$|R
50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser <b>feeding</b> first-aid <b>hose</b> reels as well as fire extinguishers. For <b>feeding</b> the <b>hose</b> reels, there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roof—one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the side ducts in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air. The plenum as well as supply air ducts connected with vertical shafts are provided with inspection doors made of timber which open out directly to the staircase landings on each floor. At each end, a staircase is provided. The lift shafts are adjoining the vertical air shafts at one end.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} pump {{is of the}} vaned rotor type, typically of Saginaw manufacture, and {{is connected to the}} steering box via flexible <b>feed</b> and return <b>hoses.</b> The fluid reservoir is incorporated in the pump's end cover. Typical system operating pressures are in the range 7.8 - 8.8 MPa, the operating medium being automatic transmission fluid.|$|R
40|$|DE 19941154 C UPAB: 20010711 NOVELTY - The {{hand-held}} shower has a rotary-symmetrical grip {{connected to}} shower head and water <b>feed</b> <b>hose,</b> which {{passes through the}} grip to the head. The outer contour of the hand grip varies along its length, dependent upon the average anthropometric dimensions of a target group of users. The hand grip has rotary-symmetrical finger recesses extending in peripheral direction. USE - Hand-held shower. ADVANTAGE - Can be held over longer periods without discomfort...|$|E
25|$|The reach method, (or hose trace method), is {{the most}} {{reliable}} as it will work in all cases where the DV is not snagged somewhere. The diver reaches back over the right shoulder to the low pressure <b>hose</b> <b>feeding</b> the DV, and loops thumb and fingers round the hose, then slides the hand along the hose, pulling it forward and over the shoulder until the DV is in the right hand, at which stage it can be turned the right way round and replaced in the mouth.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the night}} of the auction arrives, Lars discovers the mouse's box in the snow {{returned}} due to insufficient postage and with a big hole gnawed through it. Lars and Ernie panic upon seeing the mouse return, but attempt to maintain their composure as the auction continues. The mouse also devours Rudolf's [...] "lucky string," [...] which he gave to the brothers before his death, making their vendetta even more personal. The brothers desperately attempt to flush out the mouse by <b>feeding</b> a <b>hose</b> into the wall. As the auction reaches a record $25 million bid, the house rapidly floods through the walls and the floors, causing everyone to be washed out of the house as it promptly collapses. The brothers' only consolation {{is the fact that the}} mouse must finally be dead as their father's [...] "lucky string" [...] is found in the wreckage.|$|R
40|$|Trickle {{feeding and}} {{irrigation}} of spring and autumn crop tomatoes grown in peat gave a lower soil pH and higher soil specific conductivity (SC) and K content than did <b>feeding</b> by <b>hose</b> or low-level sprayline methods. The use of hard water for making up feed and for irrigating gave a higher soil pH and SC than did moderately soft water. The trickle system gave the tallest {{plants in the}} autumn crop. In the spring crop plants were taller initially with the trickle system but the sprayline system gave the tallest plants later on. Hard water decreased height in both crops. Plants fed and irrigated with hard water yielded more marketable fruit in the spring crop than those treated with moderately soft water. The trickle system gave highest yields in both crops, and reduced the incidence of blossom-end rot in the spring crop. Values for fruit acidity, percentage soluble solids and K were lower in trickle-fed tomatoes, but water type {{had little effect on}} fruit composition...|$|R
30|$|We {{consider}} the water-jet {{as a good}} option to be implemented as propulsion source for a probe since a water-jet can be generated via the transfer of water through a long hose with constant and relatively small diameter from a water source to an output nozzle. Additionally, such a water-jet generates a thrust force that can be controlled by the regulation of the flow rate. Taking into account that this system requires control in open areas, three different configurations are suggested. The first one is a configuration similar to the tendril from NASA with the difference that only one actuated section is required at the tip; in this way, {{it is possible to}} position the tip in the desired place in the three-dimensional space. The water-jet is directed partially backwards to the longitudinal axis of the hose, {{in the same way as}} in the piping inspection devices, and via the regulation of the flow rate, the magnitude of the thrust force can be controlled. The second option is by regulating the water-jet through servo-valves. Similar to continuum robots, at least three actuation elements are necessary to control the motion in three-dimensional space. Thus, it requires independent control of each water-jet. This necessitates at least three servo valves which should be placed at the tip of the probe in order to regulate the opening of the orifices of each water-jet, thereby controlling the flow rate and thrust force. However, the need of servo valves at the tip will increase the diameter of the device and the complexity of the manufacture. Finally, the last proposal is a device with no mobile element at the tip. Instead, it has three nozzles in circular arrangement directed partially backward. Each water-jet is generated independently, which means that each nozzle has its own <b>feeding</b> <b>hose</b> and independent pump. By regulating the speed of each pump, the flow and thrust force are controlled. Because the last option is the easiest to implement, we chose the three hose configuration to test the concept. A more detailed study of the generation of water-jet thrust force is presented next.|$|R
50|$|The Mark I cannon {{was made}} out {{of a set of}} valves, a hose, and a freon tank. Iron pipe {{fittings}} were affixed to the freon 22 tank, which provided the pressure that powered the gun. Small water valves were used to fill the tank, and to supply pressure to an O-ring spool valve. When the gun was not in the fire position, the O-ring separated the pressure source from the magazine hose; however, when the radio control unit was activated the servo moved the spool valve into position, allowing freon to flow from the pressurized tank to the magazine hose. As the magazine was pressurized, BBs flowed into the restrictor tube until the pressure built high enough to force the BBs through the restrictor and out of the barrel. The exit velocity of the BBs was high enough to punch holes in the model ship’s 1/32 inch balsa wood skin. However, this linear magazine and barrel assembly was too bulky to be fit to a small model ship’s gun turret. To improve scale appearance, a brass elbow fitting was added to reduce the above deck size of the gun. This enabled the magazine to exit the deck vertically, with the BBs running into the base leg of the elbow before entering the restrictor. This {{led to the development of}} the new Mk II breach/barrel assembly. The first Mk II was installed on Stan Watkins' model of the USS Arizona (l/144 scale). The BBs (about 100) were loaded into a clear hose which, when pressurised, would feed the BBs into a smaller clear plastic tubing behind the barrel brass tubing. The pressure would build until the force pushed the BBs through the restrictor tubing and out the barrel. The force of this design had adequate power to penetrate the 1/32 balsa hull skin. The design of the restrictor caused a number of BBs to “spurt” out each time the pressure was great enough, however to have sufficient pressure to get more than one spurt, the warship combatant had to rapidly close the spool valve after the start of the spurt. This was made possible as the freon <b>feed</b> <b>hoses</b> were very thin, and had low flow.|$|R
2500|$|Hudson {{resorted to}} a variety of {{marketing}} ploys to get consumers interested in the Jet, including the [...] "Tea Cup Test". This Fuel economy test utilized special kits comprising a glass cylinder, valves and rubber hoses that Hudson dealers attached to test cars. The glass cylinder was mounted {{to the inside of the}} front passenger door, with the <b>hoses</b> <b>feeding</b> into the engine's fuel line. An amount of gasoline equal to the amount held in a tea cup was added to the glass cylinder, and the car was driven away by a potential customer while a salesperson monitored the cylinder in an effort to prove how far a Jet could travel on that small amount of gasoline.|$|R
5000|$|The Sigmund F.N.5 {{main pump}} has a {{capacity}} of 1000 imp gal per minute (900 imp gal) on 4x4 versions). Normal fire hoses could be used either from the main pump, which had four outlets, or from normal fire hydrants for which an assortment of connecting branches were carried. In addition, the machines carried a small Coventry Climax (350 imp gal per minute pump, with its own petrol engine, which could also draw water from a river or other source, again <b>feeding</b> normal fire <b>hoses,</b> and which provided a separate and self-contained fire fighting capability. A 400-gallon water tank (300 gallons on 4x4) was installed, which fed small diameter hoses {{on each side of}} the vehicle to give an immediate [...] "first aid" [...] capacity to fight a fire while the main hoses were connected and brought into use. A stirrup pump was also carried, together with a full range of other suitable tools and equipment.|$|R
50|$|Nicole {{is able to}} {{drag the}} officer to the rest room, where the two seek refuge from the psychopath. The cop {{eventually}} realizes that the situation they are in is hopeless. He tries to calm Nicole down, and tells her about his family. Eventually, {{the driver of the}} truck returns and locks Nicole and the officer in the restroom. Nicole, thinking the man has left, attempts to open the lock. The driver appears out of seemingly nowhere, and bites Nicole's finger off. The officer realizes that Nicole is going into shock and commands Nicole to shoot the driver when he returns. She fires four shots out of the officer's revolver into the door but is unable to see if she has struck the driver. The driver then drops a camera into the restroom via the open window. The video is of Jess being tortured with a knife; Jess then says he loves Nicole. The last shot of Jess shows him having his tongue cut out. The driver <b>feeds</b> a <b>hose</b> through the window and starts pouring gasoline into the room. Nicole tries to find an escape and is able to open a hatch in the ceiling. Realizing there is no way for her {{to get him out of}} the building the officer tells Nicole to use the two remaining bullets in his gun to kill him because he would rather die that way than be burned alive. She fails at first but eventually succeeds in the grisly task. The driver lights the gasoline and Nicole hurries to get out of the building. As Nicole is escaping she notices that the officer's body has mysteriously disappeared. Nicole is able to jump from the roof before the building explodes.|$|R
