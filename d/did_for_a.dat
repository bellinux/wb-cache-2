5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|On December 17, 1955, viewers {{were able}} to see {{first-hand}} what Perry <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> living before he was a professional singer. Actor Kirk Douglas was one of Como's television guests; Douglas had grown a beard for his Vincent van Gogh role in Lust For Life, which finished filming that week. Como shaved Douglas' movie beard live on national television. On September 15, 1956, the season premiere of The Perry Como Show was broadcast from NBC's new color television studios at the New York Ziegfeld Theatre, {{making it one of the}} first weekly color TV shows. In addition to this season premiere as a color television show, there was also a royal visit from Prince Rainier of Monaco and his bride of six months, Grace Kelly.|$|E

25|$|During World War I he {{had been}} elected Librarian at King's College, but never took up the appointment. After the war Knox {{intended}} to resume his research at King’s, but was persuaded by his wife to remain at his secret work; indeed, so secret was this work that his own children had no idea, until many years after his death, what he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> living, and his contribution to the war effort.|$|E
25|$|The Chrysotriklinos thus {{became the}} central part of the new Boukoleon Palace, formed when Emperor Nikephoros II (r. 963–969) {{enclosed}} the southern, seaward part of the Great Palace with a wall. From the late 11th century however, the Byzantine emperors began to prefer the Blachernae Palace, in the northwestern corner of the city, as their residence. The Latin emperors (1204–1261) chiefly used the Boukoleon, and so <b>did,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> time after the recovery of the city in 1261, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) while the Blachernae Palace was being restored. Subsequently the Great Palace was rarely used and gradually fell into decay. The Chrysotriklinos is mentioned for the last time in 1308, although the still-impressive ruins of the Great Palace remained in place until the end of the Byzantine Empire.|$|E
25|$|Rusk had {{received}} a public school education and in 1888, when he was 17, he began his career, teaching school at Camas Prairie in the Glenwood Valley. Later, he taught at the Crossroads School outside Goldendale until 1892 when he became {{the editor of the}} Goldendale Courier. This he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year and went back to teaching the next year. He also began studying law in the office of Nelson B. Brooks and Snover at about the same time. On October 30, 1898, Rusk married Rachel N. Gilmore, also the child of pioneers. In 1902, Rusk completed his law training and was admitted to the Washington State Bar Association. Also in 1902, Rusk became one of the founding members of the American Alpine Club. Rusk and his wife moved to Hamilton, Washington in 1903, but only stayed there for about a year before they moved to Lake Chelan and bought a home along a remote portion of the lake. Rusk {{became a member of the}} Mazamas club in 1904. Rusk practiced law in the town of Chelan until 1910. While they were living on Lake Chelan, on June 10, 1905, their only son, Rodney L. Rusk, was born.|$|E

500|$|Barnes went to England in 1947. In his autobiography, {{he claimed}} that he went as a {{representative}} for a wine and spirits company, although after the initial mention of {{that there is no}} further word and he appears also to have dealt in commodities that were in short supply because of rationing in England. Once in England, he was approached by Burnley to play as a professional in Lancashire League cricket, which he <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while before finding it [...] "too much of a drag" [...] and resigning.|$|E
500|$|The {{end of the}} gas boom was {{especially}} difficult for the smaller communities in the county, since {{the loss of a}} single business had more of an impact on undersized communities than it <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> town with many businesses. [...] In the case of Millgrove, the community's major manufacturer (a glass factory) closed. [...] For other communities, such as Mollie, the loss of the gas and oil workers meant that the local post office was a [...] "waste of time", and consumer demand at the general store was significantly diminished.|$|E
500|$|The idea {{to create}} a story {{involving}} the 731 unit came from series creator Chris Carter.

500|$|Later {{commentators}} have praised the coin. Taxay deemed the obverse [...] "undoubtedly the finest work Morgan ever {{did in his}} forty-eight years with the Mint. The head is not merely well drawn, there is in it a depth of feeling, and introspective mood that almost makes the observer feel he is intruding on the great man." [...] Writers on commemorative coins, including Arlie Slabaugh and David M. Bullowa, also admired the Illinois piece. Q. David Bowers deemed Sinnock's reverse [...] "the finest work he ever <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> legal tender coin", not excluding the Roosevelt dime (1946) and Franklin half dollar (1948, posthumous). Bowers noted that the border of {{both sides of the}} coin consists of beads and pellets, [...] "an attractive substitute for denticles".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} shares many similarities with Marsters's Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel character, Spike, with Marsters commenting [...] "In {{a lot of}} ways, {{this role}} {{is very much like}} Spike was in my first three episodes of Buffy." [...] The Torchwood writers conceived John as a classical nemesis for Captain Jack, with Chibnall commenting, [...] "In seeing John you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably <b>did,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while." [...] James Marsters further discussed ways in which John is a doppelgänger or foil to Captain Jack: both are pansexual time travellers, with their key difference being that John never reformed. The character exaggerates many of Jack's qualities, for example displaying zoophilic attraction to non-humanoids such as poodles, in addition to men and women. John and Jack's intentional similarities extend to their penchant for period war clothing: ...|$|E

[...] The second clip features 100 seconds of extended banquet sequences, including Ann's reaction to Leslie's haircut, Ann's awkward attempts to make small talk with April and more of Tom's speech to Marlene. In the third, a 30-second clip, set at the bar, Tom describes to Mark his strategy in picking up a girl: he {{asked her what she}} <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> living, then, [...] "I just yawned, gave her the middle finger and left. Pretty risky but I feel good about it."

500|$|How I Met Your Mother was {{inspired}} by creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas's idea to [...] "write about our friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York," [...] where they previously worked as writers for Late Show with David Letterman. The two drew from their friendship in creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely on Thomas and his wife. Thomas's wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on her, but agreed {{if they could get}} Hannigan to play her. Radnor and Segel were relative unknowns, but Smulders, another relatively little-known actress, was cast as Robin after [...] Jennifer Love Hewitt turned down the role in favor of Ghost Whisperer. Bays and Thomas commented on her casting by saying, [...] "thank God we <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> million reasons... when Ted’s seeing {{her for the first time}}, America’s seeing her for the first time — the intriguingness of that propelled the show going forward and kept the show alive".|$|E
500|$|Discussing {{whether his}} {{character}} could ever find [...] "The One", John Barrowman asserts that Jack [...] "likes everybody, {{and his love}} for each person is different". Barrowman believes that Jack does harbour romantic feelings toward the Doctor, but [...] "would never take that beyond infatuation" [...] and [...] "would never let the Doctor know". Barrowman claims that Jack also [...] "" [...] fellow companion Martha Jones, admiring her [...] "tenacity" [...] and willingness to [...] "spat with him", and describes Jack's love for Toshiko and Owen as [...] "fatherly", stating [...] "He was guiding them. That's {{why it was so}} devastating for him to lose them." [...] The second series of Torchwood also introduced Jack's ex-lover, Captain John. Head writer Chris Chibnall introduced John to act as a [...] "proper nemesis, somebody to really test , to push him, and to reveal something about Jack's character". In the use of Captain John as a literary foil, Chibnall comments [...] "you see the way Jack could have gone, and probably <b>did,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little while" [...] which underlines how [...] "Jack, in his experiences with the Doctor and Torchwood, made a very conscious decision to move away from that behaviour." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Germans began bombing London {{during the}} Blitz in 1940, {{her family had}} a number of narrow escapes as bombs dropped close to their home. She and her brother John were sent to safety in the country, and then to the United States, where she spent a year living with an uncle. She recalls, [...] "It was 1941; I was ten, John was nearly six. We were to sail from Glasgow in a convoy, on a ship that was {{evacuating}} children." [...] During her year stay in Florida, she was asked by the British War Relief Society to help raise money by entertaining at various benefits, which she then <b>did</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> number of weeks.
