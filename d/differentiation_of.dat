5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. Glucocorticoids produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that glucocorticoids only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} aimed {{to explain the}} <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the {{educational}} programs at Mekelle University Ethiopia, and the SPSU was taken as an example. The SPSU was an academic unit, which in the meantime differentiated into four educational programs namely psychology, institute of pedagogical sciences, history and cultural studies and civics and ethics. Particularly, it aimed to address the following questions: What were the factors that explained the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> SPSU; were there some challenges during the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the SPSU, If so, how are these challenges explained? And, {{what are the consequences}} <b>of</b> the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the SPSU to the relationship between teaching and research? Semi-structured interview and document analysis were used to collect the data. The semi-structured interview was carried out with four participants, one from each differentiated educational program. All of the participants were academic staff in the respective educational programs. And, three of the participants were interviewed face-to-face, while the one was interviewed on Skype. A narrative qualitative data analysis technique was used to analyze the data collected through the interviews and documents. The study found that, the national and institutional factors explained the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the SPSU. The national factors were: the increase in the numbers of the higher education students, the ‘seventy’ versus ‘thirty’ programs mix in students’ enrollment, the introductions of the ‘added-on’ teacher education policy and business processes reengineering. In addition, institutional factors such as, the Mekelle University’s twenty years strategic plan and demand of the academic staff to establish an independent educational program had explained the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the SPSU. Further, during the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the SPSU, there were challenges related with divisions of the academic staff and courses were challenging. These problems were seemingly resulted from the overlapped knowledge territories of the differentiated subunits. Finally, the academic staff perceived that, even though the relationship between teaching and research is practically determined by the time, fund and teachers’ commitment, the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> their educational programs has paved a way to development of some conditions that enhance the relationship between teaching and research. Among which are, with differentiations, the teachers have got the possibility to develop and update their teaching methods, course contents. Moreover, the differentiation has also enabled them to have students and to be represented as independent educational programs in the share for the institutional and national budgets for teaching and research...|$|R

40|$|The article derives multivariate Generalized Gram-Charlier (GGC) {{series that}} expands an unknown joint {{probability}} density function (pdf) of a random vector in terms <b>of</b> the <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> the joint pdf of a reference random vector. Conventionally, the higher order <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> a multivariate pdf in GGC series will require multi-element array or tensor representations. But, the current article derives the GGC series in vector notations. The required higher order <b>differentiations</b> <b>of</b> a multivariate pdf in vector notations are achieved through {{application of a}} specific Kronecker product based differentiation operator. Overall, the article uses only elementary calculus of several variables; instead Tensor calculus; to achieve the extension of an existing specific derivation for GGC series in univariate to multivariate. The derived multivariate GGC expression is more elementary as using vector notations compare to the coordinatewise tensor notations and more comprehensive as apparently more nearer to its counterpart for univariate. The same advantages are shared by the other expressions obtained in the article; such as the mutual relations between cumulants and moments of a random vector, integral form of a multivariate pdf, integral form of the multivariate Hermite polynomials, the multivariate Gram-Charlier A (GCA) series and others.

Such a prolonged accretion stage would allow cooling to largely keep up with the heat accumulation caused by impacts, radioactive decay and contraction, thereby preventing melting and fast differentiation. The allowable timescale of formation of Callisto lies then in the range 0.1million10million years.|$|E
