5|$|In 1641, Harvard University sent three preachers to England {{to raise}} money for missionary {{activities}} among the Indians. To support the fund-raising, the University produced one of the earliest fund-raising brochures, New England's First Fruits. An early version of the press release was used when King's College (now Columbia University), sent out an announcement of its 1758 <b>graduation</b> <b>ceremonies</b> and several newspapers printed the information. Princeton was the first university to make it a routine practice of supplying newspapers with information about activities at the college.|$|E

5|$|When {{the crisis}} abated, Arizona {{was ordered to}} Constantinople (now Istanbul) before she sailed for home on 15 June. She put into the New York Navy Yard on 30 June for an overhaul, where six 5-inch guns were removed and the fire control system was modernized. Work was {{completed}} in January 1920 and the battleship sailed south to Guantanamo Bay for crew training. During this time, Arizona was fitted with a flying-off platform {{similar to the one}} given to Texas in March 1919. In April, Arizona lost the Battenberg Cup to Nevada, and in June she was present for the Naval Academy's <b>graduation</b> <b>ceremonies.</b> In August she became the flagship of Battleship Division Seven, although it was only later in 1920 that the battleship was refitted to be an admiral's flagship.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of the University College in 1876, Government support began in 1889. After mergers with the Bristol Medical School in 1893 and the Merchant Venturers' Technical College in 1909, this funding allowed the opening of a new medical school and an engineering school—two subjects that remain among the university's greatest strengths. In 1908, gifts from the Fry and Wills families, particularly £100,000 from Henry Overton Wills III (£6m in today's money), were provided to endow a University for Bristol and the West of England, provided that a royal charter could be obtained within two years. In December 1909, the King granted such a charter and erected the University of Bristol. Henry Wills became its first chancellor and Conwy Lloyd Morgan the first vice-chancellor. Wills died in 1911 and in tribute his sons George and Harry built the Wills Memorial Building, starting in 1913 and finally finishing in 1925. Today, it houses parts of the academic provision for earth sciences and law, and <b>graduation</b> <b>ceremonies</b> are held in its Great Hall. The Wills Memorial Building is a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|The statue was {{donated to}} Rutgers by Dr. Fenton B. Turck {{to commemorate the}} university's Dutch heritage. Turck, with the {{assistance}} of railroad executive and Rutgers alumnus Leonor F. Loree, collaborated to arrange the anonymous donation of the statue through the Holland Society of New York. It is a statue of William I, Prince of Orange (1533-1584), an early leader of the Dutch revolt against Habsburg Spain which led to the independence of the Netherlands in 1648. The statue has continued to be included in student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, including <b>graduation</b> <b>ceremonies,</b> pep rallies, festivals, and protests. Occasionally, the statue is a target of vandalism in an ongoing historical rivalry between students of Rutgers and Princeton University. The statue was restored in 2006 in an effort funded by alumni donations.|$|E
