5000|$|Although the Australian [...] {{ships were}} not {{originally}} planned to operate fixed-wing aircraft, in May 2014, the Minister for Defence David Johnston stated in media interviews {{that the government}} was considering acquiring F-35B fighters for Canberras, and Prime Minister Tony Abbott instructed 2015 Defence White Paper planners to consider the option of embarking F-35B squadrons aboard the two ships. Supporters of the idea stated that providing <b>fixed-wing</b> <b>support</b> to amphibious operations would maximize aircraft capability, and the presence of a ski-jump ramp, inherited from the original design, meant that the vessels were better suited to STOVL operations than equivalent ships with flat flight decks. Opponents to the idea countered that embarking enough F-35Bs to be effective required abandoning the ships' amphibious capability and would make the pseudo-carriers more valuable targets, modifications would be required to make the flight deck capable of handling vertical-landing thrust and to increase fuel and ordnance capacity for sustained operations, and that the F-35B project itself has been the most expensive and most problematic of the Joint Strike Fighter variants. In July 2015 Australia ended consideration of buying the F-35B for its two largest assault ships, as the ship modifications were projected to cost more than AUS$5 billion (US$4.4 billion). The plan was opposed by the Royal Australian Air Force, as an F-35B order could have diminished the number of F-35As purchased.|$|E

50|$|A {{subordinate}} {{unit of the}} 15th Air Base Wing, the 15 ABS {{served as}} the host organization at Wheeler AFB, which consisted of approximately 1,389 acres of land and facilities valued at over $37 million. Responsibilities of the 15 ABS included providing munitions service and support to all Air Force activities within the Hawaiian area, in addition to operating a small arms firing range where personnel of the Air Force, U.S. Customs {{and local law enforcement}} agencies were certified. During the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, the installation hosted a number of Army and Air Force activities, including Army rotary-wing and fixed-wing aviation units and USAF <b>fixed-wing</b> air <b>support</b> / forward air control units flying the O-2 Skymaster and OV-10 Bronco.|$|R
50|$|The largest fire {{during the}} Victorian season ignited on 16 January {{as a number}} of {{separate}} fires—the 'Goongerah complex' and 'Club Terrace' fires being the most serious—in mountainous terrain of the Snowy River and Errinundra National Parks in the East Gippsland region. A significant commitment of aircraft, including 9 helicopters and 5 <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, <b>supported</b> by an additional 6 RFS aircraft provided during February, were deployed to the fires in the remote region. During a 70-day period, the smaller fires merged and burned 165806 ha of scrub, forest and pasture and impacted the communities of Bonang, Goongerah and Tubbut; 9 houses, a number of sheds and 1250 ha of crops and pasture were destroyed, and 100 head of livestock died.|$|R
25|$|Opponents to {{operating}} F-35s {{from the}} Canberra-class state that embarking enough aircraft {{to be an}} effective force would require abandoning their capability as amphibious warfare vessels, operating as an aircraft carrier would make the ships higher profile targets and need greater escorting forces, existing fuel and ordnance storage {{would not be able to}} sustain fixed-wing operations, structural modifications were needed to reinforce and heat-treat the flight deck to withstand F-35B vertical thrust, and the F-35B project itself has been the most expensive and most problematic of the three Joint Strike Fighter variants. Supporters counter that providing <b>fixed-wing</b> air <b>support</b> close to amphibious operations maximises aircraft capability, other nations are already working on solutions to structural and thrust problems for other Harrier-era ships, and the presence of a ski-jump makes the vessels already more suitable for STOVL operations than equivalent amphibious ships with flat flight decks.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fixed-wing</b> {{aircraft}} is <b>supported</b> {{in flight}} only by its wing(s). For an aircraft to become and remain airborne, the wing must {{move through the}} air at a specified [...] "angle of attack". To assure that the wing moves through the air at the proper angle of attack, the aircraft's center of gravity must fall within a range specified by the aircraft's designers. An aircraft that is too nose-heavy or too tail-heavy will not fly properly, because the angle of attack is affected adversely. This can destroy lift, and cause a stall in certain maneuvers.|$|R

50|$|An army {{aviation}} unit is an aviation-related unit of a nation's army, {{often described}} as an air corps. These units are generally separate from a nation's dedicated air force, and usually comprise helicopters and light <b>support</b> <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft. Prior {{to the establishment of}} separate national air forces, many armies had military aviation units, which as the importance of aviation increased, were spun off into independent services. As the separation between a nation's army and air force led to a divergence of priorities, many armies re-established their own organic aviation branches to best serve their own needs.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{a lengthy}} design contest that pitted the design against the similar but smaller French , the Prime Minister of Australia {{announced}} on 20 June 2007, that Australia would purchase and build two ships {{of the same}} design to become the s. Navantia was responsible for construction of the ships from the keel to the flight deck in Spain, after which the hulls were transported to Australia for completion by BAE Systems Australia. The first of these ships [...] was commissioned on 28 November 2014, the second ship [...] was commissioned on 4 December 2015. Both commissioning ceremonies {{took place at the}} Garden Island naval base in Sydney.

25|$|In August 2014, the Chinese-language Shanghai Morning Post listed that Liaoning {{would carry}} 36 aircraft: 24 Shenyang J-15 fighters, six Changhe Z-18F anti-submarine warfare (ASW) helicopters, four Changhe Z-18J {{airborne}} early warning helicopters and two Harbin Z-9C rescue helicopters. The Chinese carrier aircraft inventory {{is similar to a}} balanced combat and support aircraft approach intended for Soviet aircraft carriers, which supported nuclear submarines, large surface combatants, and land-based strike bombers performing anti-access roles. The air wing lacks long-range radar and anti-submarine <b>fixed-wing</b> aircraft, needing <b>support</b> from shore-based aircraft such as Tupolev Tu-154 ASW and Shaanxi Y-8 AWACS aircraft. The U.S. Department of Defense noted that J-15s will have below normal range and armament when operating from the carrier, due to limits imposed by the ski-jump takeoff system. The lack of a carrier onboard delivery aircraft like the United States Navy (USN) Grumman C-2 Greyhound also limits logistics capabilities. Liaoning would need extensive land-based support to oppose a USN carrier strike group; however, it would be potent against the Vietnam People's Navy and the Philippine Navy. Deficiencies will likely be corrected with future aircraft carriers, which are expected to be larger with conventional takeoff decks and catapult launching for heavier fighters, plus fixed-wing radar and anti-submarine patrol aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|When the National Security Act of 1947 {{removed the}} Air Corps from the US Army it {{effectively}} disrupted {{the development of}} doctrine <b>supporting</b> <b>fixed-wing</b> close air <b>support</b> (CAS) and deep strike coordination as capabilities improved. As aircraft capabilities increased, so did the demand by the US Army for additional support for combat and mobility operations. During the Korean War, CAS and Air Interdiction (AI) provided significant contributions {{to the war effort}} in disrupting enemy logistics, but failed to prove decisive according to US and PLA sources. Although the Air and Land Wars were generally aligned, they were not well coordinated. The Vietnam War saw the US Army increase its reliance on helicopter gunships for CAS in addition to the development of Tactical Air Control Parties to provide terminal attack guidance at the tactical levels. Operational planning systems remained undeveloped and Air-Ground Integration continued to perform at sub-optimal levels as helicopter gunship support provided the intermediate solution to the US Army’s Air-Ground Integration dilemma. The 1980s witnessed the development of AirLand Battle Doctrine, which relied heavily on US Air Force capabilities to shape the attack of numerous echelons of Soviet Forces in Europe where US Army Artillery could not reach or provide an accurate means of attack. General Wilbur L. Creech, USAF, assisted in the Airland Battle doctrinal development and saw it as a means to prevent the US Air Force from losing tactical mission aircraft to the US Army. [...] The paradigm shift away from the US Air Force from only supporting CAS missions for the Army to meet the operations needs required close coordination between the components at the operational level. A provisional organization called a Battlefield Coordination Element (BCE) was established and in 1984 a Memorandum of Agreement between the two branches of service continued to codify the support requirements needed to unify efforts. [...] The BCE was first officially employed in combat during Operation Just Cause, Panama, in 1989. Following the Gulf War, COL James Crigger, 9AF DCS Ops/CENTAF, specifically underscored the importance of the incorporation of the BCE into the Tactical Air Control Center for force synchronization.In November 1995, an agreement between the US Air Force and US Army formerly established the requirement for liaison elements between the components to allow better air to ground coordination. The 1995 agreement defined the BCE as an Army liaison team that operated in the US Air Force Tactical Air Control Center (TACC), which was later re-designated the Air Operations Center. The BCE structure remains nearly identical to the BCD of today, although there are now five established BCDs aligned with each US Geographic Combatant Command and the Korean theater of operations and their respective Combined/Joint Air Operations Centers. The development of joint doctrine codifying a comprehensive Theater Air Control System and Army Air Ground System allowed both the US Army and Air Forces to coordinate horizontally and laterally from operational staffs and tactical warfighters. BCEs or BCDs have supported US Army warfighters in every major joint military operation since Operation Just Cause and continues to evolve with the changing information environment. BCDs continue to work with partner Armies and Air Forces to build their capacity and interoperability to support humanitarian assistance/disaster relief operations as well as major combat operations.|$|R
