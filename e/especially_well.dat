5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They are <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
5|$|Escher's artwork is <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> {{liked by}} mathematicians like Doris Schattschneider and {{scientists}} like Roger Penrose, who enjoy {{his use of}} polyhedra and geometric distortions. For example, in Gravitation, animals climb around a stellated dodecahedron.|$|E
50|$|All {{waters in}} contact with the {{atmosphere}} absorb carbon dioxide, and as these waters come into contact with rocks and sediments they acquire metal ions, most commonly calcium and magnesium, so most natural waters that come from streams, lakes, and <b>especially</b> <b>wells,</b> can be regarded as dilute solutions of these bicarbonates. These hard waters tend to form carbonate scale in pipes and boilers and they react with soaps to form an undesirable scum.|$|R
50|$|Attitudes {{and customs}} {{associated}} with the routine of the year's work, religious beliefs and practices survived the coming of Christianity in the conservative rural areas {{of much of the}} Celtic countries. All over these lands there were sacred places which had earned their status in pre-Christian times and which had only been gingerly adopted by the Christian church and given a garnish of Christian names or dedications, hills, stones, and <b>especially</b> <b>wells</b> which can still be seen festooned with rags in observance of an old ritual.|$|R
5000|$|Since {{river sand}} {{is a natural}} aquifer, its {{depletion}} also means recharging of groundwater, <b>especially</b> <b>wells,</b> fall. In January 2014, Union minister of state for Commerce and Industry, stated that due to sand mining in river beds, groundwater level or water table has dropped at an alarming rate, as a result some 18 lakh wells in the southern region have gone dry and water for agriculture purposes has become scarce. In Madurai, as per S Rethinavelu, senior president of CII, [...] "Water table, which was at 50 ft or so, fell to 600 ft.|$|R

Medicine was <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> studied by Islamic scholars working in Greek philosopher traditions, while natural history drew heavily on Aristotelian thought, especially in upholding a fixed hierarchy of life.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|Chaltin's column {{advanced}} north {{with the}} Nile river protecting his right flank and the Azande cavalry contingent on his left. At seven o'clock, Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between the Nile and a parallel river. There was one clear path through the hills, which was <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Boult {{accepted}} {{some international}} guest conductorships, appearing with the Vienna Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, and New York Philharmonic orchestras. In 1936 and 1937 he headed European tours with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, giving concerts in Brussels, Paris, Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, {{where they were}} <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> received. During his BBC years, Boult did not entirely lose contact {{with the world of}} opera and his performances of Die Walküre at Covent Garden in 1931 and Fidelio at Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1930 were considered outstanding.|$|E
5|$|In June, the ZNDH finally {{received}} from Germany the long-promised airdrop containers for aerial resupply of ammunition and other equipment, constantly in need by besieged and encircled garrisons {{all over the}} NDH. They were immediately {{put to good use}} and eased the work of the already overstretched ZNDH. The Dornier Do 17s of the ZNDH proved to be <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> suited for such tasks. June also saw Kren returned to his previous position as head of the ZNDH.|$|E
5|$|La Blanca {{occupied}} a frontier zone between the northeastern and southeastern Petén regions {{and the site}} {{is dominated by the}} acropolis, an <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> built palace complex. The city appears to have been an administrative centre with comparatively little emphasis upon religious or ceremonial activity. It is likely that La Blanca was a subsidiary of a major Maya city such as Yaxha or Naranjo, given the complete absence of hieroglyphic texts and sculpted monuments, and archaeologists presume that La Blanca served as a frontier post or trading centre.|$|E

5|$|Shostakovich's orchestral works include 15 symphonies and six concerti. His chamber output {{includes}} 15 string quartets, a piano quintet, two piano trios, and {{two pieces}} for string octet. His solo piano works include two sonatas, an early set of preludes, and a later set of 24 preludes and fugues. Other works include three operas, several song cycles, ballets, and a substantial quantity of film music; <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> known is The Second Waltz, Op. 99, {{music to the}} film The First Echelon (1955–1956), {{as well as the}} suites of music composed for The Gadfly.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums, and none of the four sold <b>especially</b> <b>well.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{to the use of}} sound for communication, a wide range of insects have evolved chemical means for communication. These chemicals, termed semiochemicals, are often derived from plant metabolites include those meant to attract, repel and provide other kinds of information. Pheromones, a type of semiochemical, are used for attracting mates of the opposite sex, for aggregating conspecific individuals of both sexes, for deterring other individuals from approaching, to mark a trail, and to trigger aggression in nearby individuals. Allomonea benefit their producer by the effect they have upon the receiver. Kairomones benefit their receiver instead of their producer. Synomones benefit the producer and the receiver. While some chemicals are targeted at individuals of the same species, others are used for communication across species. The use of scents is <b>especially</b> <b>well</b> known to have developed in social insects.|$|E

50|$|Cable tool rigs are a {{traditional}} way of drilling water wells. The majority of large diameter water supply <b>wells,</b> <b>especially</b> deep <b>wells</b> completed in bedrock aquifers, were completed using this drilling method. Although this drilling method has largely been supplanted {{in recent years by}} other, faster drilling techniques, it is still the most practicable drilling method for large diameter, deep bedrock wells, and in widespread use for small rural water supply wells. The impact of the drill bit fractures the rock and in many shale rock situations increases the water flow into a well over rotary.|$|R
