40|$|The {{defects in}} atomic {{monopole}} models of molecular charge distribution have been analyzed for several model-blocked peptides and compared with accurate quantum chemical values. The {{results indicate that}} the angular characteristics of the molecular electrostatic potential around functional groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds can be considerably distorted within various models relying upon isotropic atomic charges only. It is shown that these defects can be corrected by augmenting the atomic point charge models by cumulative atomic multipole moments (CAMMs). Alternatively, sets of off-center atomic point charges could be automatically derived from respective multipoles, providing approximately <b>equivalent</b> <b>corrections.</b> For the first time, correlated atomic multipoles have been calculated for N-acetyl, N'-methylamide-blocked derivatives of glycine, alanine, cysteine, threonine, leucine, lysine, and serine using the MP 2 method.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{investigate}} {{the relations between}} age and the optical aberrations of the whole eye. The eye’s optical quality, {{as measured by the}} modulation transfer function (MTF), de-grades with age, but the MTF does not provide a means to assess the contributions of individual aberrations, such as coma, spherical aberration, and other higher order aberrations to changes in optical quality. The method used in this study provides measures of individual aberrations and overall optical quality. METHODS. Wave aberrations in 38 subjects were measured psychophysically using a spatially resolved refractometer. Data were fit with Zernike polynomials up to the seventh order to provide estimates of 35 individual aberration terms. MTFs and root mean square (RMS) wavefront errors were calculated. Subjects ranged in age from 22. 9 to 64. 5 years, with spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>corrections</b> ranging from 10. 5 to 26. 0 D. RESULTS. Overall RMS wavefront error (excluding tilts, astigma-tism, and defocus) was significantly positively correlated with age (r 5 0. 33, P 5 0. 042). RMS error for the highest order aberrations measured (fifth through seventh order) showed a strong positive correlation with age (r 5 0. 57, P 5 0. 0002). Image quality, as quantified by the MTF, also degraded with age. CONCLUSIONS. Wave aberrations of the eye increase with age. This increase is consistent with the loss of contrast sensitivity with age observed by other investigators. (Invest Ophthalmo...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: This was a {{cross-sectional}} {{survey to}} find the prevalence of visual impairment and eye diseases among adults with Down syndrome (DS) in Hong Kong. Methods: 91 DS patients {{over the age of}} 30 were recruited through the Hong Kong Down Syndrome Association. Each patient was provided with a complete ophthalmological assessment including best corrected visual acuity, refraction, slit lamp and fundus examination. Results: In our sample, 56. 6 % had normal vision to mild vision impairment, 33. 7 % and 7. 2 % had moderate and severe vision impairment, respectively, and 2. 4 % were blind. The mean presenting distant LogMAR visual acuity was 0. 66 (Snellen equivalent 20 / 90), and the best corrected LogMAR visual acuity was 0. 48 (Snellen equivalent 20 / 60). Significant refractive errors were found in 86. 3 % of the eyes, with spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>corrections</b> ranging from - 23. 25 D to + 3. 00 D. Myopia and astigmatism were prevalent and found in 59. 3 % and 72. 7 % of the eyes, respectively. Blepharitis and chalazion were found in 44 % of the eyes, while corneal problems were present in 27. 5 %. There were low incidences of infective keratitis (0. 5 %), keratoconus (0. 5 %) and Brushfield spots (1. 1 %). Cataracts were found in 72. 2 % of the eyes; 26. 1 % were congenital and 44. 9 % were age-related. Fundal abnormalities were present in 49. 5 % of the eyes. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of vision impairment among Chinese DS adults. Uncorrected refractive errors, high myopia and cataracts are the main visually debilitating ophthalmological abnormalities. Vision may be improved through the simple use of glasses and early treatment of age-related cataracts. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Methods: An exploratory, noninterventional study was conducted using subjects who had been implanted with an aspheric intraocular lens and had 0. 5 &ndash; 0. 75 diopter postoperative astigmatism. Monocular visual performance using full correction was compared with visual performance using spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction.</b> Testing consisted of high- and low-contrast visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and reading acuity and speed using the Radner Reading Charts. Results: Thirty-eight of 40 subjects completed testing. Visual acuities at three contrast levels (100 %, 25 %, and 9 %) were significantly better using full correction than when using spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction</b> (all P &lt; 0. 001). For contrast sensitivity testing under photopic, mesopic, and mesopic with glare conditions, {{only one out of}} twelve outcomes demonstrated a significant improvement with full correction compared with spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction</b> (at six cycles per degree under mesopic without glare conditions, P = 0. 046). Mean reading speed was numerically faster with full correction across all print sizes, reaching statistical significance at logarithm of the reading acuity determination (logRAD) 0. 2, 0. 7, and 1. 1 (P, 0. 05). Statistically significant differences also favored full correction in logRAD score (P = 0. 0376), corrected maximum reading speed (P &lt; 0. 001), and logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution/logRAD ratio (P &lt; 0. 001). Conclusions: In this study of pseudophakic subjects with low levels of postoperative astigmatism, full correction yielded significantly better reading performance and high- and low-contrast visual acuity than spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction,</b> suggesting that cataractous patients may benefit from surgical correction of low levels of preoperative corneal astigmatism.

40|$|The {{technique}} of Satellite Laser Ranging is today a mature, important tool with applications in many area of geodynamics, geodesy and satellite dynamics. A global network of some 40 stations regularly obtains range observations with sub-cm precision {{to more than}} twelve orbiting spacecraft. At such levels of precision {{it is important to}} minimise potential sources of range bias in the observations, and part of the thesis is a study of subtle effects caused by the extended nature of the arrays of retro-reflectors on the satellites. We develop models that give a precise correction of the range measurements to the centres of mass of the geodetic satellites Lageos and Etalon, appropriate to a variety of different ranging systems, and use the Etalon values, which were not determined during pre-launch tests, in an extended orbital analysis. We have fitted continuous 2. 5 year orbits to range observations of the Etalons from the global network of stations, and analysed the results by mapping the range residuals from these orbits into <b>equivalent</b> <b>corrections</b> to orbital elements over short time intervals. From these residuals we have detected and studied large un-modelled along-track accelerations associated with periods during which the satellites are undergoing eclipse by the Earth's shadow. We also find that the eccentricity residuals are significantly different for the two satellites, with Etalon- 2 undergoing a year-long eccentricity anomaly similar in character to that experienced at intervals by Lageos- 1. The nodal residuals show that the satellites define a very stable reference frame for Earth rotation determination, with very little drift-off during the 2. 5 year period. We show that an analysis of more than about eight years of tracking data would be required to derive a significant value for 2. The reference frame defined by the station coordinates derived from the analyses shows very good agreement with that of ITRF 93...|$|E
40|$|The dose The dose {{distribution}} {{delivered to}} a patient on any given treatment day may substantially deviate from the planned dose distribution because of patient setup errors, organ deformation and organ movement. With the advent of new technologies for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), periodic (interfraction) dose corrections can be implemented in the clinic to correct for differences among delivered and planned dose distributions. Formulas to determine {{the size of the}} biologically-equivalent dose on the n th treatment day needed to correct for systematic as well as random variations in a planned dose distribution on the preceding (n – 1) treatment days are derived using the linear-quadratic (LQ) survival model. The proposed formalism can be used to introduce multiple, periodic inter-fraction corrections or a single post-treatment correction. We show that biologically <b>equivalent</b> <b>corrections</b> for random and systematic deviations from a planned treatment are, under quite general circumstances, always numerically smaller than the difference between the planned and delivered dose to a region of normal or malignant tissue. Also, because of the βGD 2 component of cell killing, random errors in the delivered dose do not tend to cancel. Random dose delivery errors have the potential to increase tumor control but may also increase damage to normal tissue structures. Formulas linking LQ cell survival parameters to double strand break (DSB) induction are derived from the Repair-Misrepair-Fixation (RMF) model for mixed radiation fields. Measured data for several cell lines irradiated by radiations of varying quality are used to examine the impact of proximity effects on intra- and inter-track binary misrepair. With the RMF, estimates of α and β for any particle type are determined by a well-defined physical parameter (frequency-mean specific energy), two or three biological parameters, (2 ̆ 6 thetas; and κ) or (2 ̆ 6 thetas;, κinter, and κintra), that are independent of radiation quality, and a biological parameter (Σ) that depends on radiation quality. To minimize the number of ad hoc adjustable parameters, we used the published Monte Carlo Damage Simulation (MCDS) to estimate Σ. The effects of radiation quality on α and β were examined by performing a regression analysis of survival data of V 79 and CHO cell lines, irradiated with 55 and 250 kVp x-rays and γ-rays from 60 Co and human kidney T- 1 cells irradiated by x-rays, deuterons and alpha particles with an LET up to 200 keV/μm. In CHO, V 79 and T- 1 cells irradiated by widely varying types of radiation, the probability per unit time DSB formed by the same track interact in pairwise fashion (κ intra) is 100 to 300 times larger than the probability per unit time DSB formed by different tracks interact in pairwise fashion (κinter), e. g. the ratio of κ intra and κinter is 235 for CHO. ^ Although the intra-track DSB interaction rate is evidently at least two orders of magnitude larger than the inter-track DSB interaction rate, low LET radiations, such as fast electrons, seldom create more than one DSB per track.

SETTING: School of Optometry, University of Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain. METHODS: In 24 right eyes, pachymetric measurements were taken at the center and 1. 2 mm and 3. 0 mm on the superior and inferior hemimeridians. A 1 -sample t test was applied to assess {{the significance of the}} relationship between Orbscan II and ultrasound methods. The relationship between the 2 was assessed by analyzing regression and plotting the differences against the mean corneal thickness. Orbscan II data were analyzed in 3 ways: (1) without the application of an acoustic <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction</b> factor; (2) with a correction factor of 0. 92, as recommended by the manufacturer; (3) with correction using the equations derived in this study. The data were systematically compared with those of ultrasound pachymetry. RESULTS: Before the correction factor was applied, the Orbscan II overestimated the corneal thickness at all locations, with the mean difference (48. 15 microm +/- 33. 74 [SD]) significantly different from zero (P. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The acoustic <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction</b> factor proposed by the manufacturer to obtain corneal thickness measurements with the Orbscan II compared to those from ultrasound pachymetry was not valid for all corneal topography positions.

40|$|As {{technology}} and medical devices improve, {{there is much}} interest in when and how astigmatism should be corrected with refractive surgery. Astigmatism can be corrected by most forms of refractive surgery, such as using excimer lasers algorithms to ablate the cornea {{to compensate for the}} magnitude of refractive error in different meridians. Correction of astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery is well developed and can be achieved through incision placement, relaxing incisions and toric intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. 1 This was less of an issue in the past when there was less expectation to be spectacle independent after cataract surgery in which case the residual refractive error, including astigmatism, could be compensated for with spectacle lenses. The issue of whether pre-surgical astigmatism should be corrected can be considered separately depending on whether a patient has residual accommodation and the type of refractive surgery under consideration.

Methods: A prospective, randomized trial with paired eye control of 74 eyes from 37 patients who underwent LASIK retreatment was performed. Each patient underwent retreatment using Zyoptix LASIK in 1 eye and Planoscan LASIK in the contralateral eye. A complete ophthalmologic examination was performed, including evaluation {{of high contrast}} visual acuity and manifest refraction, with a follow-up of 6 months. Results: Both Zyoptix and Planoscan groups had similar values of high contrast visual acuity, gain and loss of best spectacle-corrected visual acuity, safety and efficacy indexes, percentage of eyes with spherical equivalent within +/- 0, 50 D and +/- 1, 00 D in the postoperative period of 6 months. in the Zyoptix group, the values of spherical component and spherical equivalent of manifest refraction were more hyperopic than in the Planoscan group in the postoperative periods of 1 week, 1, 3 and 6 months. the predictability of spherical <b>equivalent</b> <b>correction</b> was better for the Zyoptix group than for the Planoscan group at 6 months.

30|$|Here, {{the range}} III {{is used for}} the case 3, even when the <b>equivalent</b> N-value (after <b>{{correction}})</b> with (N 65)/ 0.5 is in the range I or II, because the results from the fines content correction are too conservative. The reason that the range IV is not used for the case 3, even when range IV is given by a correction N[*]+[*]∆N, is that the reliability of the plasticity index in the equation is low when the value is 10 ~ 20. Therefore, judging the subsoil as the range IV “possibility of liquefaction is very low” is considered as risky.|$|R
40|$|A spin-flavor {{symmetry}} emerges for baryons in the large-N_c limit. Large-N_c baryons form irreducible {{representations of}} the spin-flavor algebra, and their static properties can be computed in a systematic expansion in 1 /N_c. Symmetry relations for static baryon matrix elements are obtained at various orders in the 1 /N_c expansion by neglecting subleading 1 /N_c <b>corrections.</b> <b>Equivalent</b> relations arise in the quark and Skyrme models, which satisfy the same large-N_c group theory as QCD. The 1 /N_c expansion yields useful results for QCD baryons with N_c= 3. Comment: Latex, 34 pages, review article for Annu. Rev. Nucl. Part. Sc...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{dependence of}} fundamental couplings and mass ratios on the gravitational potential has been bounded by comparing atomic clock frequencies over Earth's elliptical orbit. Here we evaluate bounds on such dependence from E"otv"os-type experiments that test the Weak Equivalence Principle, including previously neglected contributions from nuclear binding energy. We find that variations of fundamental parameters {{correlated with the}} gravitational potential are bounded at 10 ^- 8 [...] 10 ^- 9, an improvement of 2 [...] 3 orders of magnitude over atomic clock bounds.
