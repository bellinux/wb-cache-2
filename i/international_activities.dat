Based on this evidence, we explore the impact of firm internationalization on debt financing. Using a market based sample of U.

Specifically, we find that, contrary to prior research, firm <b>international</b> <b>activity</b> is, on average, associated with a 13 % reduction {{in the cost of}} debt financing and a 30 % increase in firm leverage. © 2002 JIBS.

40|$|This Paper empirically investigates two {{important}} determinants of <b>international</b> <b>activity</b> through wholly owned operations, joint-ventures and licensing, namely country risk and IPRs protection. Using a comprehensive database on investments in chemical plants {{during the period}} 1981 - 96, we show that higher levels of country risk are associated with less activity into recipient economies. The analysis also suggests that <b>international</b> <b>activity</b> with smaller resource commitment tends to be preferred in countries {{with higher levels of}} risk, and that multinational investment is more responsive to changes in risk conditions than indigenous investment. After controlling for several country characteristics, we do not find IPRs protection playing a significant role in fostering <b>international</b> <b>activity</b> or conditioning its mode. chemical industry; country risk; foreign direct investment; IPRs protection; technology licensing...|$|R

25|$|Global University Ranking {{measures}} over 400 universities {{using the}} RatER, an autonomous, non-commercial, Russian rating agency supported by Russia's academic society. The methodology pools universities from ARWU, HEEACT, Times-QS and Webometrics and {{a pool of}} experts formed by project officials and managers to determine the rating scales for indicators in seven areas. It considers academic performance, research performance, faculty expertise, resource availability, socially significant activities of graduates, <b>international</b> <b>activities,</b> and international opinion. Each expert independently evaluates these performance indicators for candidate universities. The rating is {{the average of the}} expert evaluations. This ranking raised questions when it placed Russian Moscow State University in fifth place, ahead of Harvard and Cambridge.|$|E
