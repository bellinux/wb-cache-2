5|$|After {{the ball}} {{rolled into the}} end zone for a touchback, Virginia Tech began its final drive at its 20-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Bryan Randall {{completed}} an 80-yard touchdown pass to Josh Morgan. The score plus the extra point cut Auburn's lead to 16–13. With time in the game almost exhausted, Virginia Tech was forced to attempt an onside kick <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to get another offensive drive. Because the Hokies had used their final timeouts to stop the clock on Auburn's previous drive, Auburn would be free to run out the game's final minutes. Despite the hopes of Virginia Tech for a last-second miracle, the Auburn Tigers recovered the kick, allowing them to run out the clock and clinch a 16–13 victory.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} with Inter, Baggio decided not to renew his expiring {{contract}} due to his conflicts with Marcello Lippi, making him a free agent at age 33. He was linked with smaller Serie A clubs such as Napoli and Reggina, and also several Premier League and La Liga clubs, including Barcelona. Baggio ultimately transferred to Serie A newcomers Brescia, under head coach Carlo Mazzone, aiming to save them from relegation, and staying in Italy <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> greater opportunity of being called up for the 2002 World Cup. He was made captain and was given the number 10 shirt, playing as an attacking midfielder.|$|E
5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> stable orbit.|$|E

5|$|Having stopped Kansas on fourth down, Virginia Tech {{took over}} on offense at its 22-yard line. With just 5:51 {{remaining}} in the game, the Hokies badly needed to score quickly and get a defensive stop <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to win. The Hokies advanced on the first aspect of that requirement as Sean Glennon converted several first downs through the air. Kansas allowed no play over nineyards {{until late in the}} drive, forcing Virginia Tech to use up valuable time. On the last play of the drive, Sean Glennon connected on a 20-yard strike to Justin Harper for a touchdown. The score cut Kansas' lead to just three points, but with just three minutes {{remaining in the}} game, Virginia Tech's comeback would only be complete if the Hokies could recover a difficult onside kick.|$|E
5|$|It {{took the}} Flyers eight weeks <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> game played; they {{accepted}} the Gas City Tigers' challenge {{to play in}} Gas City, Indiana, on November 18. The Tigers were 9–0 and outscored their opponents 443–9 this season. Halfback Mickey Hole scored a 45-yard rushing touchdown three minutes into the game. On the next possession, the Flyers scored again; Kenneth Huffine scored the touchdown, and Cooney Checkaye kicked the point after, which made the score 13–0. Near {{the beginning of the}} second quarter, Checkaye scored, but the extra point was missed. The Tigers scored their only touchdown in the game in the third quarter. The final score of the game was 19–7.|$|E

With the Surfer creating craters around the globe, Reed determines that the next will appear in London. The team arrives too late to stop the crater, which drains the River Thames, but they manage to prevent the London Eye from collapsing after it is damaged by the quake (although Johnny nearly thwarts their attempt when he unwillingly switches powers with Reed). Meanwhile, the Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects their ex-friend Victor Von Doom, freeing him from two years encased in metal. A scarred Doom traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and offers to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer retaliates, blasting Doom through the ice, but the cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{received}} Miami's post-score kickoff {{needing to}} score quickly <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{chance to have}} a second opportunity on offense — needed because Tech was now two scores behind. Tech returned the kickoff to the 24-yard line but were penalized 12 yards for an illegal block. Casey passed for an eight-yard gain and ran for three yards for a first down. After that gain, things went against the Hokies. Casey was penalized 15 yards for intentional grounding, and Tech was unable to gain another first down. The Hokies punted, and Miami took over on offense at its 46-yard line. In possession of the lead, Miami began to run out the clock, executing multiple rushing plays in succession in order to force the game clock to continue to count down. Tech's defense forced a stop, but because Miami punted the ball with just 2:20 remaining in the game, there was little chance that Tech would be able to make up the needed two scores.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{originally}} {{set to be}} released in early 2009 for Microsoft Windows, and later for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The team partnered with Edge of Reality to develop the console versions of the game. However, its release date was pushed to the latter half of that year <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> simultaneous launch. BioWare announced that the game would be released on October 20, 2009, but pushed it back again to November 6, 2009, as the team wanted additional time to finalize some last-minute decisions. The PlayStation 3 version was at one point delayed to November 17, but did end up launching alongside the other versions. A Mac version of the game, developed by TransGaming, was released on December 21, 2009.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{built as a}} joint venture by the NLR and the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> station serving freight closer to the City. It was {{immediately}} successful for both goods and passenger services and saw {{a significant increase in}} NLR traffic. Usage peaked in the early 20th century, after which it suffered from competition of London trams, buses, and particularly the London Underground network. Patronage gradually fell and services decreased, while the station building became increasingly dilapidated. By the 1980s, all freight services had been cancelled, and the station closed in 1986. The station building was replaced by Broadgate, an office and retail space, while part of the connecting line to the station was re-used as part of the London Overground.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 20-yard line needing to score quickly <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance at {{making up the}} 10-point deficit, which would require two {{separate}} scores to make good. Mike Cox completed a seven-yard pass, then Maurice Williams broke free for a 15-yard rush that gave Tech a first down and drove the Hokies to the 42-yard line. Cox completed a long pass into the Air Force red zone, but the completion was negated by an offensive pass interference penalty against Tech that cost the Hokies the long completion, a loss of down, and an additional 15yards. While scrambling for extra time in which to throw the ball, Cox was sacked by Air Force defender Chris Funk and fumbled the ball. Air Force recovered the loose football, and the Falcons' offense returned to the field with just over four minutes left to play.|$|E
5|$|Bruce {{invites the}} {{orphaned}} Dick {{to stay at}} Wayne Manor. Dick, still troubled by {{the murder of his}} family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma turns himself into a criminal called the Riddler and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device. At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman, but she soon discovers that they are one and the same. Bruce decides to stop being Batman <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> normal life with Chase and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick angrily runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler destroys the Batcave.

5|$|Pursuant to dynastic imperatives and {{the ethos}} of the time, the nobles {{required}} Tamar to marry <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> leader for the army and to provide an heir to the throne. Their choice fell on Yuri, son of the murdered prince Andrei I Bogolyubsky of Vladimir-Suzdal, who then lived as a refugee among the Kipchaks of the North Caucasus. The choice was approved by Tamar's aunt Rusudan and the prince was brought to Georgia to marry the queen in 1185. Yuri {{proved to be an}} able soldier, but a difficult person and he soon ran afoul of his wife. The strained spousal relations paralleled a factional struggle at the royal court in which Tamar was becoming more and more assertive of her rights as a queen regnant. The turning point in Tamar's fortunes came with the death of the powerful Catholicos-Patriarch Michael whom the queen replaced, as a chancellor, with her supporter, Anton Gnolistavisdze. Tamar gradually expanded her own power-base and elevated her loyal nobles to high positions at the court, most notably the Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli.|$|E
5|$|Rachel, who is {{spending}} {{most of her time}} in her hotel room on account of her pregnancy, receives a visit from her expatriated lesbian sister Lucy (Susannah Doyle). Lucy tells Rachel that she has been sleeping around with men <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> child. When Adam learns of this, he suggests to Lucy that she use some of his banked sperm. They broach the idea to Rachel, who is disgusted at the thought of her husband having a baby with her sister and forbids it from going ahead. Meanwhile, Karen finally assures David that the animosity between them caused by his extramarital affair is in the past. She emails Mark Cubitt (Sean Pertwee), a man she has been having an affair with in England, to tell him their fling is over. Mark arrives at her apartment the next morning and spends the day with her after David cancels a visit to an art gallery with her. He convinces her that David is still the same insensitive man that he has always been. The next day, Karen tells Rachel that she will leave David to be with Mark.|$|E
5|$|The kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 27-yard line, and the Hokies began the final drive of the second quarter. Antonio Freeman caught a six-yard pass from DeShazo, then DeShazo completed a five-yard pass to Shawn Scales. DeShazo completed a four-yard pass, then Ken Oxendine had a seven-yard catch from DeShazo at the Tech 49-yard line. On the next play, Oxendine caught a short pass that pushed the Hokies to the Tennessee 45-yard line, then DeShazo threw his first incomplete pass of the drive. The incompletion stopped the clock with 37 seconds remaining, allowing time for DeShazo to complete a 26-yard pass to Bryan Still on the next play. Now inside the Tennessee red zone, the Hokies continued to move the ball via short passes. Tech gained a first down at the Tennessee six-yard line, and used a timeout to stop the clock <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> chance to earn a touchdown before halftime. On a subsequent play, however, Tech committed a five-yard penalty, and Tech head coach Frank Beamer ordered kicker Ryan Williams into the game. Williams' 27-yard field goal attempt was good, and Tech cut Tennessee's lead to 3510 {{at the end of}} the first half.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} built on a site of the medieval steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It was built by the South Eastern Railway <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> railway {{terminal}} in the City and compete with their rivals, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The City location of the station necessitated a new bridge across the River Thames, which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the West End, until {{the construction of the}} District Railway. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by John Poulson, while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City's 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as part of a general renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the Thameslink Programme development in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.|$|E
