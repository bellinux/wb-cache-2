25|$|The initial attack {{focused on}} {{extinguishing}} {{the fire in}} the loading dock area, with a secondary effort to search for and evacuate people inside, and prevent the fire from spreading to the showroom and warehouse. Crews entering the showroom reportedly initially encountered clear visibility with only very light puffs of smoke visible near the ceiling {{at the back of the}} showroom. Shortly thereafter, an exterior door was opened near where the fire was raging. Efforts to close the door failed, allowing the fire to enter the showroom. Firefighters were ordered to stretch two hose lines into the showroom to attack the spreading fire; however, the pre-connected <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> from one of the units was too short. This required some firefighters to again exit the building to add additional sections of hose, and left only one small handline to hold back the growing fire. At about this time, fire dispatchers advised the crews on-scene that they had received a 9-1-1 call from an employee who was trapped in the warehouse, which required some firefighters to direct their attention to the rescue. The trapped employee was eventually rescued by firefighters who breached an exterior wall to reach him.|$|E

50|$|The firefighters {{died after}} the fire, aided by strong winds, trapped {{them in the}} {{basement}} of the brownstone and prevented their colleagues from rescuing them. It has also been suggested that the 45-mile-per-hour winds which helped fuel the fire also triggered an explosion, which also trapped them in the basement. The precise reason the firefighters died after getting trapped remains unknown, but one proposed scenario involves the fire burning through their <b>hose</b> <b>line,</b> cutting off their ability to fight the fire around them.|$|E

5000|$|A Mattydale lay, {{also called}} [...] "cross-lay", [...] "speedlay", and [...] "transverse lay", {{is a method}} of storing hose on a fire engine. This method of storing hose is {{designed}} for rapid deployment of a <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> to attack a fire. In this manner, the hose is stored perpendicularly across the fire apparatus, usually above or adjacent to the pump panel, {{instead of the usual}} parallel storage in the rear. This allows the firefighter to pull the hose {{in the direction of the}} fire instead of having to make a turn.|$|E

Quartered with Engine 33 is Ladder Company 49. On Engine 33, Jack learns the ropes of firefighting. He quickly becomes close friends with his fellow firefighters, {{including}} Mike, his Captain at the time. Jack's first fire takes place at a burning vacant rowhouse. Engine 33 and Ladder 49 respond and are the first companies on the scene. Jack and Mike enter the building with a <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> and tackle the blaze, with Jack on the nozzle of the hose. They quickly and triumphantly extinguish it.|$|E
5000|$|Engine - The engine {{company is}} the {{backbone}} of the fire suppression operation. Every BCFD engine is manufactured by Pierce, and has a 500-gallon water tank. Engine companies carry a basic assortment of hose lines, appliances and adapters, forced entry tools, basic and advanced life support medical equipment, five-gas air monitoring, and a hand-held thermal imager. Most first line engine companies have a 1250GPM single stage pump. Basic <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> compliment is 1,200' of 4" [...] 'Stortz' supply hose, 250' of 2.5" [...] attack line, 300' of 3" [...] setback/standpipe hose, 500' of 1.75" [...] attack line, and 20' of hard suction hose. Engine companies have a daily minimum staffing of four; one Pump Operator or Acting Pump Operator, one officer (Captain, Lieutenant, or Acting Lieutenant), and two firefighters. Occasionally, when extra staffing exists, certain engine companies may be assigned a third firefighter.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{efforts to}} confine and {{extinguish}} the fire, {{it continued to}} spread into the structure and ignited furniture in the showroom, growing more quickly than the few operating <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> could control. Meanwhile, efforts to stretch and begin operating additional <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> continued. At 7:41p.m. the showroom area of the store experienced a flashover while at least sixteen firefighters were working inside. The flashover contributed to the rapid deterioration of the structural integrity of the building, leading to a near-complete collapse of the roof minutes later. Many of the firefighters caught in the flashover were unable to escape and were trapped under the collapsed roof and shelving weakened by the fast-spreading fire. Several calls for help were made by trapped firefighters and efforts to rescue them were commenced. These efforts proved unsuccessful. By the time the fire was brought under control, nine Charleston firefighters had been killed.|$|R
5000|$|Fire hoses come in {{a variety}} of {{diameter}}s. Lightweight, single-jacket construction, , 1, and [...] inch diameter <b>hose</b> <b>lines</b> are commonly used in wildfire suppression applications. Heavy duty double, double-jacket, , , 2, , and on occasion 3 inch lines are used for structural applications. Supply lines, used to supply firefighting apparatus with water, are frequently found in , 4, , 5 and 6 inch diameters.|$|R
5000|$|Wildland {{engines are}} {{traditionally}} smaller than standard fire engines and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They also respond to emergencies {{in the back}} country where traditional engines cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel drive capability and can thus climb hills and make it through rough terrain. One of the features that makes these engines ideal for vegetation fires {{is that they can}} pump water while driving, whereas most, but not all traditional engines must be put into park to flow water, it depends on the specifications to which the Fire Department wants the vehicle to be built. This pump-and-roll feature allows the engines to make [...] "running attacks" [...] on vegetation fires, a tactic that can help minimize the rate of spread by having a firefighter walk the edge of a fire with a <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> and the engine trailing close behind.|$|E
5000|$|The Type 3 Engines {{are smaller}} than the Type 1’s and are {{primarily}} used for vegetation fires {{as well as any}} type of emergency in the back country where the Type 1's cannot respond.

50|$|The Blackwater {{fire was}} started by a {{lightning}} strike on August 18, 1937, but it remained undetected until early August 20, at which time it {{was estimated to be}} about 2 acre in size. By the evening, it had expanded to 200 acre, and 65 firefighters from the United States Forest Service (USFS), which included CCC company 1852 from the Wapiti Ranger District of Shoshone National Forest and employees of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR), were constructing fire lines along two flanks of the fire. A gas-powered portable pump was delivered and set up using water from Blackwater Creek by midnight. Another pump arrived after that and firefighters installed 2000 ft of <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> on the north flank of the fire and another 5000 ft on the west flank. CCC workers from the National Park Service arrived at 2:30 am on August 21 and started construction of fire line along the north flank of the fire.

5000|$|The user {{attaches}} a hose to {{the fire}} hydrant, then opens a valve on the hydrant to provide a powerful flow of water, {{on the order of}} 350 kPa (50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig)) (this pressure varies according to region and depends on various factors including the size and location of the attached water main). This user can attach this hose to a fire engine, which can use a powerful pump to boost the water pressure and possibly split it into multiple streams. One may connect the hose with a threaded connection, instantaneous [...] "quick connector" [...] or a Storz connector. A user should take care not to open or close a fire hydrant too quickly, as this can cause a water hammer, which can damage nearby pipes and equipment. The water inside a charged <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> causes it to be very heavy and high water pressure causes it to be stiff and unable to make a tight turn while pressurized. When a fire hydrant is unobstructed, this is not a problem, as there is enough room to adequately position the hose.|$|E
50|$|Williams was {{assigned}} to Engine Company 55, located at 363 Broome Street, Manhattan, in a predominantly Italian section. When Williams reported for duty on January 10, 1919, the Captain retired to avoid the stigma of being the Captain of a Company where a black fireman was to perform duty. In addition, each man in the company submitted a request for transfer stating {{that they did not}} wish to work and sleep in the same firehouse with a black man; none was permitted to transfer for one year. The Department felt that, if transfers were permitted, it would have been impossible to keep any fireman in the Company. Fireman Williams was both ignored and ostracised and was given no direct instructions as to his duties or responsibilities. The Company was now without a Captain and five or six months passed before a replacement {{was assigned}}. When attending his first major emergency, Fireman Williams was ordered to take the nozzle of the <b>hose</b> <b>line</b> down into the cellar. The rest of the Company was behind him to assist in moving the hose and to back him up. After the Company had moved into place in the smoky cellar a series of explosions occurred and flames rolled over the probationary fireman's head in waves as he operated the nozzle and directed the stream. The Company, including the officer, retreated to the street, leaving the probationary fireman in the cellar to extinguish the fire alone. Battalion Chief Ben Parker, on discovering that the probationary man was still in the cellar, chastised the Company and the officer for their actions. Fireman Williams established a reputation as a courageous fireman who would not back out in the face of adverse conditions.|$|E

The water spray damage was composed of many elongated streaks, less than 1 -inch in length and were grouped and oriented so that they resembled a spray pattern. This study also noted that it was evident that the water did not wash all of the deposited material away from the wall or ceiling surface because “the patterns had a color which was lighter than the surrounding area but not as light as a clean burn or protected area” (Shanley et al. 1997).|$|E
