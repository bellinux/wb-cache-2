40|$|Drawing on {{the social}} {{interaction}} model, we examine the mediating role that the customer’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions plays {{on the relationship between}} the employee’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions and the employee’s positive mood. We also examine the moderating role that the customer’s personality traits—agreeableness, extraversion, and emotional stability—play on the relationship between the employee’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions and the customer’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions. The results show that the customer’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions mediates the relation-ship between the employee’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions and the employee’s positive mood. In addition, the customer’s personality traits moderate the relationship between the employee’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions and the customer’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions. The customer’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions depends less on the employee’s <b>display</b> <b>of</b> positive emotions when the customer has high levels of agreeableness and emotional stability than when the customer has low levels of agreeableness and emotional stability...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this retrospective study is {{to follow up on}} a previous Dynamic Smile Analysis and videographically analyze and develop averages for soft tissue norms with respect to the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> dentition during speech. These values would then be compared cross-sectionally across different age groups to see whether changes attributable to the aging process could be seen. A secondary objective was to compare averages for soft tissue norms in the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> dentition during speech to averages for soft tissue norms in the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> dentition during the smile. Materials and Method: Records from a previous study in which video equipment was used to capture video for 26 1 subjects were re-evaluated to find appropriate frames to analyze for speech. Two frames for each subject were selected; one frame representing the maximal <b>display</b> <b>of</b> maxillary incisors during speech and the second representing the widest transverse <b>display</b> <b>of</b> dentition during speech. After excluding 40 subjects the data for the remaining 221 subjects was analyzed.

40|$|The thesis {{discusses}} the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena for the settlements of Zgornja and Spodnja Sorica, {{the two of}} which have been merged into one sensible rounded off unit for the purpose of the thesis. The <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena is executed by regulations stipulated by The spatial planning law from 2007, and detailed by Rules on the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena from 2008 (hereinafter the Rules). The thesis consists of the theoretical and the practical part. The legal basis is presented in the first part, continued by an example <b>of</b> the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena for the settlement of Sorica (both Zgornja and Spodnja Sorica). After that Sorica and its municipality Železniki are presented. The <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena is composed of textual and graphical part. In the textual part there is mostly the town description and the interpretation of the graphical charts, in the graphical part there is a <b>display</b> <b>of</b> the discussed area, a <b>display</b> <b>of</b> the intended as well as the actual land use including restrictions and protection regimes like cultural heritage, forests, waters, natural values, etc. Graphical attachments are in the 1 : 25. 000 scale, which allows the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> the whole discussed area to be put on a A 3 -sized paper. But according to the Rules it is necessary to make the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena in the scale of 1 : 5. 000 or less, that is why we created displays for a part of the settlement in the regulated scale. In the final part we have summed up our findings about the <b>display</b> <b>of</b> existing spatial phenomena and discussed about its usefulness in spatial planning. ...|$|R
