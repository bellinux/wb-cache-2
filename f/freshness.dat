5|$|Contemporary ancient food experts, noting Strabo's {{commentaries on}} Britain have {{proposed}} that the early Britons would probably have clotted cream to preserve its <b>freshness.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, bagged salad {{products}} {{increased in the}} lettuce market, especially in the US where innovative packaging and shipping methods prolonged <b>freshness.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a {{modified}} atmosphere, pure or mixed with carbon dioxide, to nitrogenate {{and preserve the}} <b>freshness</b> of packaged or bulk foods (by delaying rancidity {{and other forms of}} oxidative damage). Pure nitrogen as food additive is labeled in the European Union with the E number E941.|$|E
5|$|Australian Rieslings {{are noted}} for their oily texture and citrus fruit flavors in their youth and a smooth balance of <b>freshness</b> and acid as they age. The botrytized Rieslings have immense levels of flavor {{concentrations}} {{that have been}} favorably compared to lemon marmalade.|$|E
5|$|Big Money Rustlas was {{released}} on August 17, 2010. Insane Clown Posse returned to Europe for a tour. The group released a three-disc compilation of their guest appearances with other artists called Featuring <b>Freshness</b> in November 2011. The compilation also included new songs with artists Paris, Cold 187um, and Tone Tone.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century Agrippina was revived in Germany and premiered in Britain and America. Performances of {{the work}} have become more ever common, with {{innovative}} stagings at the New York City Opera and the London Coliseum in 2007. Modern critical opinion is that Agrippina is Handel's first operatic masterpiece, full of <b>freshness</b> and musical invention which have made {{it one of the}} most popular operas of the ongoing Handel revival.|$|E
5|$|Milan's {{products}} include imported and Greek processed meats, {{cheese and}} spices. The Kourounlians have also signed agreements with similar enterprises in Europe {{under which the}} foreign enterprises will tailor their recipes according to the Miran product specifications so that their products will appeal to Greek consumers. The company's products can now be found in major Greek supermarket chains. A postal-delivery system for their products has been established to reach the internal Greek market. The delivery is free inside Greece and the meat is packed in special polystyrene packaging with dry ice to preserve <b>freshness.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the mafic capping stage, basanite, alkali olivine basalt and hawaiite erupted {{mainly from}} small {{parasitic}} cones, tuff rings and fissures {{in the eastern}} half of the shield. Eruptions occurred subglacially, subaqueously and/or subaerially as shown by a wide range in the degree of vesicularity, <b>freshness</b> and glass content of the lavas. In most cases, each parasitic cone produced three or four lava flows from breaches in the cone walls. These were erupted as pāhoehoe and ʻaʻā, but the tops of the lava flows are commonly missing due to erosion. Hawaiite was the most extensively erupted lava of the mafic capping stage, occurring mostly {{at the southern end of}} the Itcha Range but also in its interior.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} anniversary of Dookudu (2011), its {{producers}} Ram Achanta, Gopi Achanta and Anil Sunkara announced on 23 September 2012 that they would bankroll a film featuring Mahesh Babu as the protagonist and directed by Srinu Vaitla under their banner 14 Reels Entertainment. Though initial reports stated that Vaitla would write the film's script with assistance from Gopimohan, he chose to work with new writers for developing the film's script further. Mahesh supported his decision, stating that this change would make the audience experience <b>freshness</b> and discover something new. Vaitla wanted to narrate a character-driven story with entertainment as priority. Aagadu was confirmed as the film's title in July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Sectors of {{the food}} {{industry}} (manufacturing and retail) have pledged {{to reduce the amount}} of food they directly waste, and additionally what they cause households to waste indirectly. This is planned to happen through a combination of: effective labeling, pack size range, storage advice and packaging that extends the duration of food <b>freshness.</b> The latest initiative in May 2009, rather than a new policy, is seen as an expansion to ongoing attempts to reduce the wider food packaging. The aim is to cut UK household food waste by 155,000 tonnes (2.5% of total waste) before the end of 2010 by helping UK households prevent food going to waste.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong-route {{was officially}} opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its {{operative}} base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, {{as well as}} having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. Cabin crew had no training, and learned the job as they worked. Chicken {{was the most common}} lunch meal, and the cabin crew had to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its <b>freshness.</b> In 1949, sixty-seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} districts produce {{grapes of}} varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses {{to create their}} distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that are planted on northern facing slopes {{are known for their}} high levels of acid and the delicacy they add to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add more power and character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the <b>freshness</b> they add to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, Eastwood {{was cast}} as Rowdy Yates for the CBS hour-long western series Rawhide, the {{breakthrough}} {{in his career}} he had long been searching for. However, Eastwood was not especially happy with his character; Eastwood was almost 30, and Rowdy was too young and too cloddish for Clint to feel comfortable with the part. Filming began in Arizona {{in the summer of}} 1958. It took just three weeks for Rawhide to reach the top 20 in TV ratings and although it never won an Emmy, it was a major success for several years, and reached its peak at number six in the ratings between October 1960 and April 1961. The Rawhide years (1959–65) were some of the most grueling of Eastwood's career, often filming six days a week for an average of twelve hours a day, yet he still received criticism by some directors for not working hard enough. By late 1963 Rawhide was beginning to decline in popularity and lacked <b>freshness</b> in the script; it was canceled {{in the middle of the}} 1965–66 television season. Eastwood made his first attempt at directing when he filmed several trailers for the show, although he was unable to convince producers to let him direct an episode. In the show's first season Eastwood earned $750 an episode. At the time of Rawhides cancellation, he received $119,000 an episode as severance pay.|$|E
5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish in olive oil, and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the <b>freshness</b> of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E
25|$|The {{glory and}} the <b>freshness</b> of a dream.|$|E
25|$|Cho and Garcia-Molina {{proved the}} {{surprising}} result that, {{in terms of}} average <b>freshness,</b> the uniform policy outperforms the proportional policy in both a simulated Web and a real Web crawl. Intuitively, the reasoning is that, as web crawlers have {{a limit to how}} many pages they can crawl in a given time frame, (1) they will allocate too many new crawls to rapidly changing pages at the expense of less frequently updating pages, and (2) the <b>freshness</b> of rapidly changing pages lasts for shorter period than that of less frequently changing pages. In other words, a proportional policy allocates more resources to crawling frequently updating pages, but experiences less overall <b>freshness</b> time from them.|$|E
25|$|In general, {{failure to}} meet the <b>freshness</b> {{condition}} can be remedied by alpha-renaming with a suitable fresh variable.|$|E
25|$|A <b>freshness</b> date is {{the date}} {{used in the}} American brewing {{industry}} to indicate either the date the beer was bottled or the date before which the beer should be consumed.|$|E
25|$|After packaging, {{the bottles}} are {{immediately}} sealed {{to retain the}} <b>freshness</b> and preserve the shelf-life of the product. The final step is cooling the product via cold air or water to maintain its flavour.|$|E
25|$|From {{the search}} engine's point of view, {{there is a}} cost {{associated}} with not detecting an event, and thus having an outdated copy of a resource. The most-used cost functions are <b>freshness</b> and age.|$|E
25|$|Cool {{temperature}} {{has been}} the main method by which milk <b>freshness</b> has been extended. When windmills and well pumps were invented, one of their first uses on the farm, besides providing water for animals themselves, was for cooling milk, to extend its storage life, until it would be transported to the town market.|$|E
25|$|Gamma {{radiation}} {{is often used}} to kill living organisms, in a process called irradiation. Applications of this include the sterilization of medical equipment (as an alternative to autoclaves or chemical means), the removal of decay-causing bacteria from many foods and the prevention of the sprouting of fruit and vegetables to maintain <b>freshness</b> and flavor.|$|E
25|$|Edward H. W. Cooke {{attempted}} a revival and from 1937 introduced saloons with a <b>freshness</b> of design new to Daimler. The new products had successes in competitions and rallies. His policy was proved sound but another war, post-war austerity and yet more boardroom battles, {{this time in}} public, seemed {{to put an end}} to Daimler's once-proud business.|$|E
25|$|The wines of the Muscadet-Sèvre et Maine and Muscadet-Côtes de Grand Lieu {{appellation}} {{are often}} bottled sur lie {{straight from the}} tank that they are fermented in without any racking or filtering. This create wines {{that can be very}} cloudy and require decanting to remove sediments but also produces wines that can be fuller bodied and show extra dimensions of <b>freshness.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1926, {{near the}} corner of Atlantic and Garvey Avenue, Laura Scudder invented the first sealed bag of potato chips. In an effort to {{maintain}} quality and <b>freshness,</b> Laura's team would iron sheets of wax paper {{together to form a}} bag. They would fill these bags with potato chips; iron the top closed, and then deliver them to various retailers.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s, Clayton and Bell’s work {{went through}} {{something}} of a revival. Remarkably, many windows produced in the 1880s and 90s have the recaptured something of the <b>freshness</b> and brightness of the earlier works. They are in strong contrast to those of their pupils, Burlison and Grylls, who specialised in silvery backgrounds with ornate canopies under which stand solidly three-dimensional figures in vast cloaks of wine red and indigo blue.|$|E
25|$|The {{objective}} of the crawler {{is to keep the}} average <b>freshness</b> of pages in its collection as high as possible, or to keep the average age of pages as low as possible. These objectives are not equivalent: in the first case, the crawler is just concerned with how many pages are out-dated, while in the second case, the crawler is concerned with how old the local copies of pages are.|$|E
25|$|Newar {{artists were}} the most sought after among the foreign artists living in Tibet. French missionary {{traveller}} Évariste Régis Huc has written that it is they who construct for the Buddhist temples those fine roofs of gilt plates, which resist all the inclemencies of the seasons and always retain a marvellous <b>freshness</b> and glitter. They are so skilful at this class of work that they are sent to the very interior of Tartary to decorate the Lamaseries.|$|E
25|$|If at first, from 1873, {{the young}} Paul Biva was {{influenced}} by the zeitgeist for genre scenes and landscapes—electing to paint landscapes that evoke those of Jean-Baptiste Corot—he subsequently explored other paths and other subjects. His flowers became more expressive, vigorous yet delicate and full of <b>freshness,</b> while Henri Biva's landscapes offered an intimate glimpse of a specific locale, characterized by intricate strokes and a pure palette bathed with warm natural light. Both Biva's devoted great attention to light effects.|$|E
25|$|As a {{means to}} balance the fat white wine is {{involved}} in the preparation of sauces such as ravigote sauce, béarnaise sauce, marinara sauce, etc. The drippings of cooking juices is also a role that white wine can be used in; made with a sweet white wine and giving a sour-sweet or sweet-salt sauce. In cheese fondue the liveliness of dry white wine is balanced with the fat of the cheese. The <b>freshness</b> of the wine as a table drink contrasts the heat of the fondue.|$|E
25|$|Sernik - Sernik (cheesecake) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular desserts in Poland. It is a cake made {{primarily}} of twaróg, a type of fresh cheese. It might be flavoured with vanilla, lemon peel or orange peel. sometimes raisins or various fresh fruits are added for additional flavour and <b>freshness.</b> It is also common to top it with a chocolate topping, at times, sprinkled with coconut-flakes or nuts. It is very popular to garnish it with a sweet jelly topping with a variety of fresh fruits.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} of {{service is a}} criterion to put wine in the best condition for drinking. The wine must be chilled but not be served with ice. Between 8 and 9°C, the chill will accentuate the liveliness of the bubbles and reduce the sweetness of a sweet or Fortified wine. For an aromatic dry wine service between 10 and 12°C stimulates vivacity and gives <b>freshness</b> to the flavours. Finally, the great white wines are best at a temperature between 12 and 14°C which allows the flavours and the structure to be revealed.|$|E
25|$|Like the Ruwer region, {{wine from}} the Saar {{district}} (along the lower {{course of the}} Saar River, in Rhineland-Palatinate) is particularly dependent on {{the overall quality of}} the vintage typically only 4 years out of every 10 producing a worthwhile set of wines. The wines that do come out of these warm vintages are noted for their apple-like <b>freshness</b> and steely mineral notes. The most ideal vintages allow harvest to take place between late October and mid November when the grapes can develop enough sugar to produce floral and honeyed notes.|$|E
25|$|The {{tea leaves}} are {{packaged}} loosely in a canister, paper bag, or other container {{such as a}} tea chest. Some whole teas, such as rolled gunpowder tea leaves, which resist crumbling, are sometimes vacuum packed for <b>freshness</b> in aluminised packaging for storage and retail. The loose tea must be individually measured for use, allowing for flexibility and flavor control {{at the expense of}} convenience. Strainers, tea balls, tea presses, filtered teapots, and infusion bags prevent loose leaves from floating in the tea and over-brewing. A traditional method uses a three-piece lidded teacup called a gaiwan, the lid of which is tilted to decant the tea into a different cup for consumption.|$|E
25|$|Most Japanese use suihanki (rice cookers) {{to which}} {{measured}} amounts of washed rice and water are added. The rice is first washed to release excess starch. Then, before cooking {{it is usually}} soaked in water for between half an hour in summer, and two hours in winter. Soaking times also depend on the quality and <b>freshness</b> of the rice. The rice is then boiled using a ratio of about five parts of water to four parts of rice – though with fresher rice, the ratio can go down to 1-to-1. After this, it is steamed until {{the centre of the}} rice becomes soft. Salt is not added to the rice.|$|E
25|$|Coffman et al. {{worked with}} a {{definition}} of the objective of a Web crawler that is equivalent to <b>freshness,</b> but use a different wording: they propose that a crawler must minimize the fraction of time pages remain outdated. They {{also noted that the}} problem of Web crawling can be modeled as a multiple-queue, single-server polling system, on which the Web crawler is the server and the Web sites are the queues. Page modifications are the arrival of the customers, and switch-over times are the interval between page accesses to a single Web site. Under this model, mean waiting time for a customer in the polling system is equivalent to the average age for the Web crawler.|$|E
