500|$|After auditions {{for three}} new members in late 2008, the new cast began work in January 2009. Lauren Brant, Fely Irvine and Tim Maddren were {{announced}} to be joining Nicholson and Burgess, forming the line-up {{known as the}} [...] "new generation". Burgess said, [...] "It's a new generation for a new generation. To be honest, it doesn't really matter who's up there in pigtails singing and dancing, <b>kids</b> <b>just</b> love Hi-5." [...] Hi-5 toured Australia in early 2010, establishing a connection with more regional locations throughout the country. The group also celebrated the 500th episode of the television series in 2010, and in 2011 recognised the group's rich musical history by reintroducing classic songs {{to a new generation}} of fans.|$|E
500|$|Collections of {{original}} music {{featured in the}} series have been released on the albums [...] (2001), SpongeBob's Greatest Hits (2009), and [...] (2005). The first two charted on the US Billboard 200, reaching number 171 and 122, respectively. Several songs have been recorded {{with the purpose of}} a single or album release, and have not been featured on the show. For example, the song [...] "My Tidy Whities" [...] written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only for the album The Best Day Ever (2006). Kenny's inspiration for the song was [...] "underwear humor". Kenny said, [...] "Underwear humor is always a surefire laugh-getter with <b>kids</b> ... <b>Just</b> seeing a character that odd wearing really prosaic, normal, Kmart, three-to-a-pack underwear is a funny drawing ... We thought it was funny to make a really lush, beautiful love song to his underwear". The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie – Music from the Movie and More..., a soundtrack album featuring the score of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was released along with the feature-length film in November 2004. Various artists including the Flaming Lips, Wilco, Ween, Motörhead, the Shins, and Avril Lavigne contributed to the soundtrack that reached number 76 on the US Billboard 200.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "highlight" [...] for Lynch was {{the scene}} where Kurt, Mercedes and Rachel were {{watching}} Twilight together, {{not only because the}} [...] "friendship between Kurt and Mercedes" [...] has been [...] "sadly downplayed", but because it was [...] "nice to see the Glee <b>kids</b> <b>just</b> being kids sometimes". The subsequent conversation between Kurt and Finn in the locker room was described by Canning as [...] "one of the truest moments of the season so far". Votta wrote, [...] "Chris Colfer and Cory Monteith often shine together in scenes, especially one-on-one, and this is no exception." [...] Another duo that reviewers complimented was Mercedes and Sam. Futterman, while she criticized the episode for setting [...] "its scope too wide", credited their storyline as the [...] "only one played out strongly enough through dialogue and song". Votta stated that [...] "Glee is getting more romantic tension mileage out of this duo than you can shake a stick at, and it's delicious, especially with Valentine's around the corner", and Canning noted that their week-long verbal silence [...] "helped build their relationship into something we care more about". Chaney, however, could not see the sense in Mercedes bringing Sam with her [...] "to see Miss Pillsbury to sort out her conflicted feelings for Sam and Shane".|$|E

500|$|... "Grift of the Magi" [...] {{was written}} by Tom Martin and {{directed}} by Matthew Nastuk {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the first episode that Martin wrote on his own, having previously co-written the season ten episode [...] "Sunday, Cruddy Sunday" [...] with George Meyer, Brian Scully, and The Simpsons showrunner Mike Scully. Martin got the inspiration for [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] after reading a magazine article about how major companies were receiving permission to advertise their products in school students' textbooks. He thought it [...] "seemed like a gigantic conflict that could lead to big problems", and therefore believed an episode based on {{it would be a good}} idea. According to DVD Talk reviewer Adam Tyner, the episode is a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. A writer for Newsday has commented that episode skewers [...] "the annual craze for that one 'hot' toy." [...] This has also been pointed out by Mike Scully, who said in 2008 that [...] "Grift of the Magi" [...] was produced around the time when [...] "every year there seemed to be a hot toy. Like the Furbies, or whatever – some toy that <b>kids</b> <b>just</b> had to have that year." [...] In response to Scully's comment, Martin added that every year [...] "the media would create this gigantic rush at the toy store for various things. This [...] was coming on the heels of, yeah, the Furby." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} storylines for the character of Bridget was when she discovered that she was pregnant with Declan's child. As the storyline progressed, Bridget was seen considering abortion or adoption, before ultimately deciding to have the child with Declan's support. This caused controversy among conservative family groups in Australia who accused the Neighbours of using their characters to normalise teenage pregnancy. Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said: [...] " [...] is not something that should be considered the norm, programmes like Neighbours can make the behaviours that lead to teenage pregnancy seem normal and acceptable. A lot of <b>kids</b> <b>just</b> aren't ready to get their head around details of explicit sexuality." [...] Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower defended her character's storyline stating: [...] "I am quite sure {{a lot of people are}} not happy with this storyline. We decided we would show the ramifications on the teenagers' lives." [...] Mignon said that the storyline between Declan and Bridget was not shallow, trite or vulgar, further adding she would not have liked to film the storyline if it was and branded it as showing emotional spectrum of pregnancy justice. Critics also slammed the show, noting that Neighbours has a G-rating and the storyline could lead to more promiscuity and teenage pregnancies among young viewers. The storyline continued despite the controversy it caused and Declan and Bridget became parents to a daughter, India.|$|E
500|$|Scar {{became the}} first Disney villain to {{successfully}} explicitly kill someone. Like Disney's Bambi before it, The Lion King – dubbed the studio's [...] "darkest" [...] film {{at the time of}} its release – was unprecedented in terms of its serious themes, namely guilt, murder, treachery, revenge and death, specifically the on-screen assassination of one of the film's heroes. According to IGN, [...] "The film's story concepts of morality and mortality... was new for Disney," [...] with The Washington Post predicting that [...] "the death of the heroic Mufasa will be the most widely debated aspect of The Lion King, with people taking sides as to whether such things are good or bad for <b>kids</b> <b>just</b> as they did over the killing of Bambi's mother." [...] Similarly, Variety opined, [...] "a generation that remembers the death of Bambi's mother as traumatizing should bear that experience in mind when deciding who goes to The Lion King." [...] Film critics and parents alike expressed concern that Scar's violent ways would frighten and disturb younger viewers. Referring to Scar's murdering of Mufasa, The New York Times questioned [...] "whether this film really warranted a G rating." [...] Critics also cautioned Scar's death; Movieline warned audiences that the film [...] "shows a fairy tale's dark sense of justice," [...] for example when [...] "Scar was eaten by his hyena allies after betraying them."
