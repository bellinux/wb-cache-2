40|$|This study {{investigated}} the different personality characteristics and components of adolescent NSSI, and those personality components found to differentiate between the different subgroups of these adolescents. The study sought to examine whether we can develop more homogenous groups within the adolescent population engaging in NSSI behaviors, and if membership in these clusters have empirical relationships with NSSI behavior, {{as evidenced by the}} chart review, PAI-A, and Rorschach variables. Archival data from a sample of 181 adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17 were utilized. A combination of hierarchical cluster analysis and k-means partitioning procedures revealed the presence of four clusters of homogeneous groups of adolescents. Meaningful relationships between cluster membership and the external criterion variables were explored. The clinical utility of these clusters indicates that cluster 1 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> adolescents who <b>were</b> cognitively, affectively, and physiologically depressed, as well as suicidal. Cluster 2 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> adolescents who demonstrated more borderline features of affective instability, negative relationships, and self-harming behaviors, as well as being cognitively, affectively, and physiologically depressed, and suicidal. Cluster 3 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> adolescents who <b>were</b> affectively unstable, and verbally and physically aggressive, with self-harming tendencies. Lastly, cluster 4 <b>was</b> <b>comprised</b> <b>of</b> adolescents with no significant elevations and 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 personality patterns. The Borderline Self-Harm scale on the PAI-A did not significantly predict NSSI behaviors, suggesting that clinicians in inpatient settings cannot reliably use the PAI-A self-harm (SH) scale to assess the likelihood of such behaviors. ...|$|R
