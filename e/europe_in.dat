5|$|Spanish conquistadors brought {{potatoes}} and tomatoes from the Americas to <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> the 16th century, but these vegetables only became commonly grown and consumed in Eastern <b>Europe</b> <b>in</b> the 19th century. Eventually, both became staples of peasant diet and essential ingredients of Ukrainian and Russian borscht. Potatoes replaced turnips in borscht recipes, and tomatoes – fresh, canned or paste – took over from beet sour {{as the source}} of tartness. The turnip is rarely found in modern recipes, and even then, together with potatoes. In Ukraine, beet sour and tomatoes were both used for some time until the latter ultimately prevailed during the last third of the 19th century.|$|E
