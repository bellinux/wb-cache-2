5|$|In The Simpsons twentieth {{episode of}} the twentieth season, Four Great Women and a Manicure is loosely based on Macbeth. In the third act of the episode, Marge embodies Lady Macbeth, an ambitious wife who is {{frustrated}} by everything around her. She not only has to clean the costumes worn by other actors, but is also frustrated {{over the fact that}} Homer doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> auditioning for lead roles and would rather play a tree. She convinces him to kill Sideshow Mel and he does to assume the lead role of Macbeth. When Marge learns that no one cares for Homer's lack of acting skills over Hibbert's and those with no lines, she forces him to kill off everyone else until he's the only actor left. The angry spirits visit her that night and she tries to pin the blame on Homer. They refuse to believe Marge by pointing out that they knew he was a victim in her devious plans and get their revenge on her by killing her in a fright induced heart attack. Even though Homer gives Marge's ghost a promising performance, he eventually frustrates her more by killing himself so he doesn't have to audition for more Shakespearean plays. This forces Marge to learn her lesson the hard way when she must spend eternity with a lazy and happy Homer.|$|E

25|$|After the autopsies were performed, {{the bodies}} of the Romanovs were washed, dressed in white shrouds, and placed in wooden coffins. There was a funeral service for them on 19 October when the coffins were placed in the crypt of the cathedral of the Holy Trinity in Alapayevsk where they {{remained}} until July 1919. Then, as Alapayevsk, was about to be retaken by the Red Army, the coffins were moved to Irkutsk. There the coffins rested for less than six months, before the advance of the Red army forced their removal eastward. Early in 1920, the coffins with the remains of Grand Duke Sergei and those killed with him, were taken out of Russia by train through Harbin. By April 1920 the coffins were in Beijing, where they were placed in the crypt of the chapel attached to the Russian Mission. They remained there until 1957 when they were buried at the Russian Orthodox cemetery as the chapel was demolished. The government of the USSR did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the preservation of the Russian cemetery in Beijing and in the late 1980s the Chinese authorities converted it into a park. It is believed that the coffins are still in place, now buried beneath a parking area. After the Communist regime collapsed the mineshaft, where the Grand Duke was killed with his relatives, became a site of religious pilgrimage, and an orthodox chapel was built there.|$|E

However, the manager {{got in touch with}} my agent and discussed the offer and when I thought I had the chance of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage".

500|$|In September 2009 the Maple Leafs and Marlies {{opened their}} new hockey {{practice}} facility, the MasterCard Centre. The arena was {{a joint venture}} between MLSE, the City of Toronto and the Lakeshore Lions Club to replace the nearby Lakeshore Lions Arena, and was built at a cost of $44 million, after cost overruns drove up the cost from $33.65 million. [...] The Lions Club contributed $40 million to the project, with the city providing a $35.5 million loan guarantee. [...] The Toronto District School Board leased the land for the arena to the Lakeshore Lions for a 50-year term. MLSE spent a further $5 million on training and medical facilities, and pays $600,000 annually to rent the building. [...] The arena was originally operated by the Lakeshore Lions Club, but in June 2011, with the arena on the verge of defaulting on its rising debt, the City of Toronto took control and assumed its $43.4 million debt with the intention to return it to private management within 2–3 years. [...] A city councillor has suggested that MLSE, which operates BMO Field and Ricoh Coliseum on behalf of the city, would be [...] "the logical party" [...] to take over the arena, and a spokesperson for the company said [...] "while we don't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> purchasing the facility, we are open to discussing the possibility of managing the facility on behalf of the City".

2500|$|In a {{televised}} plenary {{debate in the}} Senate on September 2012, Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile publicly accused Trillanes of working for Chinese interest, {{in reference to the}} territorial dispute between the Philippines and China. Posing as an informal emissary of the government of Benigno Aquino III, Trillanes allegedly wanted to rein in then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario and prevent the United States from being involved in the regional dispute. Enrile then proceeded to read what he said were notes of Philippine Ambassador to China Sonia Brady about a meeting with Trillanes in Beijing, in which Trillanes allegedly told the Chinese that the Philippines cannot enforce its coastal protection, and that the Philippines does not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Scarborough Shoal. Senator Trillanes confirmed that he had been acting as [...] "backchannel negotiator" [...] with China for months, keeping then Foreign Affairs Secretary Albert del Rosario out of the loop.

[...] Olson and Meisel not only state that this assertion is without any historical basis, but question why Solomon's kingship would have any purpose or meaning today that would motivate a large-scale conspiracy. The authors also question why if Jesus were merely a [...] "mortal prophet", as the novel suggests, a royal goddess would not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> him. Olson and Meisel quote Chicago archbishop Francis Cardinal George, who remarked, [...] "Jesus isn't God but Mary Magdalene is a goddess? I mean, what does that mean? If he's not God, why is he married to a goddess?" [...] Olson and Meisel also argued that having Davidic blood in Jesus' time would not have been unique, since all of his stepfather Joseph's relatives, which included twenty generations of kings of Judah, had it as well. The authors also state that the Benjamites were not considered [...] "rightful" [...] heirs to the throne, and that the New Testament does not mention Mary Magdalene's tribal affiliation, and that she was likely not from the tribe of Benjamin, and that her connection with that tribe is traced to the 1982 book Holy Blood, Holy Grail, which does not substantiate the idea.|$|E
