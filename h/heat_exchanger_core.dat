50|$|Cooling {{efficiency}} {{is a measure}} of heat rejection from a given space by a heat exchanger. The overall thermal efficiency of a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core</b> depends on many factors, such as thermal conductivity of fins and tubes; strength and weight of the fins and tubes; spacing, size, thickness and shape of fins and tubes; velocity of the air passing through the core; and other factors.|$|E
50|$|Air {{pressure}} drop {{is a good}} evaluator of heat exchanger design. A <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core</b> with a smaller air {{pressure drop}} from the front {{to the back of}} the core (i.e. from the windward to the leeward side in a wind tunnel test) is more efficient. Air pressure drops typically are 24% less for CuproBraze versus aluminium heat exchangers. This advantage, responsible for a 6% increase in heat rejection, contributes to CuproBraze’s overall greater efficiency.|$|E

40|$|Three-dimensional {{simulations}} of four louver-tube junction geometries are performed {{to investigate the}} effect on louver and tube friction and heat transfer characteristics. Three Reynolds numbers, 300, 600 and 1100, based on bulk velocity and louver pitch are calculated. Strong three-dimensionality exists in the flow structure in the region where the angled louver transitions to a flat landing adjoining the tube surface, whereas the flow on the angled louver far from the tube surface is essentially two-dimensional. Due to the small spatial extent of the transition region, its overall impact on louver heat transfer is limited, but the strong flow acceleration on the louver top surface augments the heat transfer coefficient on the tube surface by over 50 %. In spite of the augmentation, {{the presence of the}} tube lowers the overall Nusselt number of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> by over 30 %.

40|$|AbstractQuantification of heat {{exchanger}} performance in its operative environment {{is in many}} engineering applications an essential task, and the air flow rate through the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core</b> is an important optimizing parameter. This paper explores an alternative method for quantifying the air flow rate through compact {{heat exchanger}}s positioned in the underhood of a passenger car. Unlike conventional methods, typically relying on measurements of direct flow characteristics at discrete probe locations, the proposed method {{is based on the}} use of load-cells for direct measurement of the total force acting on the heat exchanger. The air flow rate is then calculated from the force measurement. A direct comparison with a conventional pressure based method is presented as both methods are applied on a passenger car’s radiator tested in a full scale wind tunnel using six different grill configurations. The measured air flow rates are presented and discussed over a wide range of test velocities. The advantages and draw backs of both approaches are compared and discussed in detail. The proposed method is non-intrusive, leaving the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core</b> intact, with no need for integration of measurement points over the core region. Due to the measuring principle, the load-cell method will inherently over-predict the air-flow rate. This error is quantified and an empirical correction function is investigated. This paper shows that the corrected force based method determines the air flow rate through a heat exchanger with an accuracy similar to that of traditional pressure/velocity methods while offering a considerable number of advantages...|$|E

40|$|Improved thermal {{management}} {{is needed to}} increase the power density of electronic and more effectively cool electronic enclosures that are envisioned in future aircraft, spacecraft and surface ships. Typically, <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cores</b> must increase in size to more effectively dissipate increased heat loads, this would be impossible in many cases, thus improved <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cores</b> will be required. In this Phase I investigation, MRi aimed to demonstrate improved {{thermal management}} using graphite foam (Gr-foam) <b>core</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The proposed design was to combine Gr-foams from POCO with MRi's innovative low temperature, active metal joining process (S-Bond{trademark}) to bond Gr-foam to aluminum, copper and aluminum/SiC composite faceplates. The results were very favorable, so a Phase II SBIR with the MDA was initiated. This had primarily 5 tasks: (1) bonding, (2) thermal modeling, (3) cooling chip scale packages, (4) evaporative cooling techniques and (5) IGBT cold plate development. The bonding tests showed that the ''reflow'' technique with S-Bond{reg_sign}- 220 resulted in {{the best and most}} consistent bond. Then, thermal modeling was used to design different chip scale packages and IGBT cold plates. These designs were used to fabricate many finned graphite foam heat sinks specifically for two standard type IC packages, the 423 and 478 pin chips. These results demonstrated several advantages with the foam. First, the heat sinks with the foam were lighter than the copper/aluminum sinks used as standards. The sinks for the 423 design made from foam were not as good as the standard sinks. However, the sinks made from foam for the 478 pin chips were better than the standard heat sinks used today. However, this improvement was marginal (in the 10 - 20 % better regime). However, another important note was that the epoxy bonding technique resulted in heat sinks with similar results as that with the S-bond{reg_sign}, slightly worse than the S-bond{reg_sign}, but still better than the standard heat sinks. Next, work with evaporative cooling techniques, such as heat pipes, demonstrated some unique behavior with the foam that is not seen with standard wick materials. This was that as the thickness of the foam increased, the performance got better, where with standard wick materials, as the thickness increases, the performance decreases. This is yet to be completely explained. Last, the designs from the thermal model were used to fabricate a series of cold plates with the graphite foam and compare them to similar designs using high performance folded fin aluminum sinks (considered standard in the industry). It was shown that by corrugating the foam parallel to fluid flow, the pressure drop can be reduced significantly while maintaining the same heat transfer as that in the folded fin heat sink. In fact, the results show that the graphite foam heat sink can utilized 5 % the pumping power as that required with the folded fin aluminum heat sink, yet remove the same amount of heat...|$|R

In addition, by varying fibre dimensions and processing conditions, the porosity and scale of fibrous materials can be varied over a wide range.

The permeability and orientation dependent thermal conductivity of fibrous materials manufactured from copper and 446 steel are experimentally measured. The dependence of permeability on fibre volume fraction is described using the Carman Kozeny equation. An analytical model is proposed to describe thermal conductivity in short fibre porous materials, taking the effect of fibre orientation and fibre-fibre contact area into account. An analytical model for heat exchange in the steady state is proposed, and validated by comparison with experiment. Consideration is given to the effect of material and system parameters on heat exchange rate.

40|$|AbstractUsing a heat {{exchanger}} with several parallel channels in boiling services, static instabilities like the Ledinegg instabilities can occur, {{resulting from a}} combination of unfortunate operating conditions and the {{heat exchanger}} design. Ledinegg instability is characterized by different flow rates in parallel channels that share common inlet and outlet manifolds. Oscillations between different conditions may also occur. In a thermodynamic system like liquefaction of natural gas, the fluids can exhibit a large temperature glide during condensation and evaporation and the actual local fluid temperature inside a heat exchanger will then be directly dependent of the local mass-flow. This means that mass-flow oscillations also imply thermal oscillations. This study shows how this type of non-ideal behavior can be predicted for a plate-fin heat exchanger by requiring all channels for each stream to have equal pressure drop.

The previous research and development of MCHXs has reached a plateau, in that, the optimum designs cannot be further improved with the limited number of geometry related design variables currently available. The ever-evolving simulation and manufacturing capabilities have given engineers new opportunities in pursuing complex and cost-efficient novel heat exchanger designs. Recently, microchannel heat exchanger designs with variable tubes, ports and fins have been proposed. Such designs adopt adaptive tube and fin geometry within the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core.</b> Adaptive geometry refers to the changes in tube and port dimensions, changes in fin type and fin density in various sections of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core.</b> The locations of individual tubes and fins can also vary, especially in multi-slab configurations.

This paper presents studies on the design optimization of variable geometry MCHXs based on a validated simulation tool. The optimization study investigates an R 134 a condenser in an air-conditioning system. The objective of the study is to evaluate the potential cost and performance benefits of variable geometry microchannel heat exchangers compared to traditional fixed geometry microchannel heat exchangers used today. The optimization objectives are performance enhancement and cost reduction. Condenser designs generally consist of two sections, a main section and a sub-cooler section. The majority of the condensing capacity is contributed by the main section whereas the sub-cooler section is present to ensure that the outlet refrigerant is fully sub-cooled. Conventional sub-cooler section has excess tube and fins due to pressure drop constraint and manufacturing limitation. The new variable geometry design can significantly lower the material cost in the sub-cooler section while maintaining certain refrigerant pressure drop. Preliminary optimization study shows a 12 percent material reduction for a variable geometry condenser for the same performance compared to a baseline standard geometry condenser.

In addition, they create a necessary structural support for <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> tubes and thanks to them a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cores</b> have a required structural resistance. The current <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> structural designs were developed based on ground of many years’ developments having regard to field failures and complex manufacturing processes.

The goal of this paper is to show importance of the post-buckling resistance of the air-centres on the overall structural integrity of the heat-exchanger core. The work is focused on the post-buckling behaviour of the air-centres taking into consideration different material properties in an elasto-plastic range and the different thickness. Both parameters have influence on stress level in the heat-exchangers tubes. The varying stresses in the tubes are main roots of field failure of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The buckled shapes of the air centres cause the reduction of the tube stiffness supports. Thus, they causes high tube stresses, which in turn reduce significantly field lifetime of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers.</b> The problem is very much practical due to continuous trend on nowadays-automotive market to decrease the thickness of components of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> in order to cut cost of final products.

The objective {{of this study is}} to determine the heat transfer, pressure drop and inhomogeneous flow behaviour for distinct heat exchangers to identify an optimum configuration for the charge air cooler, water and oil radiators placed in the sidepods of a formula one (F 1) car. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of various heat exchanger configurations has been carried out in this work. In order to assess the reliability of the obtained results, a mesh sensitivity study along with additional parametric investigations have been performed to provide numerical parameters predicting accurately (a) the heat transfer rate at the fluid-solid interface and (b) the sporadic separation. As a result of the performed validation procedure in this study, the aerodynamic- and thermal boundary layer development along with the convective characteristics of the air flow have been captured accurately near to the heated surface. The characterization of a <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core</b> and a core configuration in a closed domain is also possible with this procedure. The presented three-dimensional CFD approach could overcome the difficulties of macroscopic heat exchanger and porous media methods for F 1 applications, because it can be used to predict the heat transfer and pressure drop related to the mass flow rate correlation curves. The contribution of fins to the total heat transfer rate has been predicted theoretically, and application benchmark test cases have been presented to analyze five different heat exchanger configurations in accordance with the 2014 formula one technical regulations. The numerical data extracted directly from three-dimensional CFD simulations can be used in the sidepod design process of the external cooling system of F 1 engines...|$|E
40|$|Air-to-air heat {{recovery}} system {{is widely used}} in building applications to reduce the energy used for conditioning the fresh air. The <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>core</b> geometry {{is one of the}} key factors that affect the overall performance of a {{heat recovery}} system. To better guide the development of high performance heat exchangers in building applications, a new analysis method is proposed in this work from the practical application point of view. The objective of the new optimization method is: at any given mass flow rate, temperature difference and desired heat recovery effectiveness, to minimize the material cost at a specified fan energy use, or alternatively, to minimize the fan energy use at a given material cost. Different duct geometries are analyzed together with the classical j/f factor method: equilateral triangle (Tri), circular (Cyl), square (Squ), rectangle with aspect ratio 1 / 2 (Rec(1 / 2)), 1 / 4 (Rec(1 / 4)), and 1 / 8 (Rec(1 / 8)). A novel channel structure named cross-corrugated triangular (CCT) duct is also considered for comparison. From the energy saving point of view, under the same hydraulic diameter, the pumping power requirements for Rec(1 / 8) are the lowest when compared with the other shapes in the laminar flow region, while the pumping power requirements for CCT duct are the highest, indicating larger energy consumptions when using such structure. Conversely, with a specified fan power consumption, the required total surface area of Rec(1 / 8) are the smallest, which means that a parallel plate channel is the best geometry from the material saving point of view. By employing this method, the manufacturing and operating cost can be considered synthetically for achieving an optimal design. The proposed method can be used to select target-oriented high performance heat recovery core geometry for desired heat recovery performance, resulting in reduced space, weight, support structure, energy requirement and lifetime cost.

40|$|Plate fin <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> {{because of}} their compactness, low weight and high {{effectiveness}} are widely used in aerospace and cryogenic applications. This device is made of a stack of corrugated fins alternating with nearly equal number of flat separators known as parting sheets, bonded {{together to form a}} monolithic block. Appropriate headers are welded to provide the necessary interface with the inlet and the exit streams. While aluminum is the most commonly used material, stainless steel construction is employed in high pressure and high temperature applications. The performance of a plate fin <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> is determined, among other things, by the geometry of the fins. The most common fin configurations are - (1) plain (straight and uninterrupted) rectangular or trapezoidal fins (2) uninterrupted wavy fins and (3) interrupted fins such as offset strip, louver and perforated fins. The interrupted surfaces provide greater heat transfer at the cost of higher flow impedance. The heat transfer and flow friction characteristics of plate fin surfaces are presented in terms of the Colburn factor j and the Fanning friction factor f vs. Reynolds number Re, the relationships being different for different surfaces. One of the earliest and the most authoritative sources for j and f data on plate fin surfaces is the monograph Compact <b>Heat</b> <b>Exchangers</b> by Kays and London [1984]. Although nearly two decades have passed after the latest edition, there has not been any significant addition to this database in open literature. Unlike simpler geometries, the thermal performance of plate fin surfaces is not uniquely determined by the hydraulic diameter; other geometric variables such as fin spacing (s), fin height (h), fin thickness (t), offset strip length (l), wave length (Λ), and wave amplitude (a) have significant effect. It will be prohibitively expensive and time consuming to fabricate <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cores</b> and carry out experiments over reasonable ranges of so many geometric variables. In contrast, it is reasonably easy and cost effective to conduct a parametric study in numerical simulation and derive correlations for use by the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> designer. But, because numerical solution is based on certain simplifying assumptions, the computed results are, in general, different from experimentally observed values. To alleviate this problem, we have evolved a procedure where some of the constants in the correlations are estimated from numerical simulation, the rest being determined by fitting experimental data We have used the finite volume based CFD software, FLUENT 6. 1 as the numerical tool. Three-dimensional, steady, Navier-Stokes equations and the Energy equation have been solved with appropriate boundary conditions for plain, offset strip and wavy fin surfaces. We have observed that the laminar flow model under predicts j and f values at high Reynolds number, while the 2 -Layer k-e turbulence model over predicts the data throughout the range of interest. Because most industrial <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operate with Re less than 3000, and because the j and f data predicted by the laminar and the 2 -layer k-e turbulence model differ little from each other at low Reynolds numbers, we have used the laminar flow model up to Reynolds number of 10, 000, which is considered to be the limit for plate fin <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> operating with gases. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields have been computed and j and f factors determined over appropriate range of Reynolds number and geometric dimensions. The j and f data have been expressed in the form: j or f = F (Re, geometry) = A RebF(dimensionless geometric) parameters The function F is also a power law expression in the geometric parameters such as h/s, t/s, λ/s etc. We have determined the indices of F by multiple regression from numerically computed results, and the constants A and b by fitting experimental data of Kays and London. Because the j or f vs. Re curves show significant non-linearity, we have expressed the correlations in terms of two separate equations over the low and the high Re regimes. The transition Reynolds number has also been correlated with dimensionless geometric parameters. We have thus carried out an exhaustive numerical study on the heat transfer and flow friction phenomena in plate fin <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> surfaces with plain, wavy and offset strip fins. While the data for plain and offset-strip fins have been correlated successfully by pure power law expressions, those for wavy fins have demanded more complex relations. The indices of the dimensionless geometrical factors in wavy fin geometry have been expressed as simple polynomials of Reynolds number. A practical approach has evolved for determining the dependence of j and f factors on Re and dimensionless geometrical features. A set of correlations has been generated for use in <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> design. These correlations are expected to extend the range and accuracy of available correlations, particularly for offset strip fin and wavy fin surfaces...|$|R
