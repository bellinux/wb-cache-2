5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent neurological damage across all {{high school sports}} in the United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic {{injuries are}} rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> has remained low since {{the introduction of the}} modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent neurological damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of <b>head</b> <b>injuries,</b> 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting neurological symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} at Muhimbili National hospital neurosurgery department from May 2008 to September 2008. The study population included 212 patients who were diagnosed of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> during the study period. Main objective was to determine ocular trauma in <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> patient. Patients {{of all ages and}} sex were included in this study. Study design. This was a crossection study involving <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> patients. Case note reports were studied regarding causes of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and severity of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> graded on Glascows coma scale as reported by the neurosurgeon. Patients were then thoroughly examined for the presence of eye trauma associated with the <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Data were then analysed for age, sex, causes of <b>injury,</b> severity of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> on admission and associated ocular trauma. Result; Most of the <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> patients were in the middle ages in which 85. 6 % of the patient were less than 46 years of age. Motor traffic accidents caused highest incidence of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> (74. 1 %). Majority of the patients had mild <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> accounting to 66 %. Incidence of the ocular trauma in the patients was found to be 65. 6 %. There was an increased incidence of ocular trauma with increasing severity of <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Significant statistical association was found between ocular trauma and severity of <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> (X 2 = 8. 38, P value = 0. 004). Lid laceration and lid tear were seen in 31. 2 % of all <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> patients. Subconjunctiva hemorrhage was found in 25. 6 % of the patients. Defective ocular motility was seen in 4. 2 %. Occulomotor nerve palsy was seen in 3. 3 %, abducent nerve in 0. 9 % and troclear nerve palsy was in 0. 5 % of the study population. Traumatic optic neuropathy was seen in 1. 4 % of the study population. 	 VI Conclusion; Ocular trauma are commonly associated with <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> There is increased risk of ocular trauma with increased severity of <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Trauma of lid and conjunctiva are frequently seen in <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> than other ocular structures. Recommendations; Patients with severe <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> needs to be reviewed by an Ophthalmologist and study on visual outcome following <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> need to be done...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Head</b> <b>injury</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} to correlate with meningioma. However, results of studies investigating the relationship between <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and meningioma were inconsistent. Therefore, we conducted this study to assess the association between <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and meningioma, and to determine the possible risk factors. Methods: <b>Head</b> <b>injury</b> patients aged 18 years and older, without antecedent diagnosis of brain tumor, and who were followed up for more than 30 days between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2010, were recruited from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. Hazard ratios (HRs) of meningioma risk for <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> patients compared with an age- and sex-matched cohort were calculated by Cox proportional regression analysis. The difference in cumulative incidence between <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> patients and the matched cohort was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and tested with the log-rank test. Results: Each cohort (i. e., the <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> cohort and the matched cohort) consisted of 75, 292 individuals {{with a mean age}} of 44. 7 years, and 52. 3 % of these patients were male. The incidence rates of meningioma were 3. 99 / 105 person-years and 3. 23 / 105 person-years in the <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> cohort and the comparison cohort, respectively, with a Charlson Comorbidity Index score-adjusted HR of 1. 27 (p =  0. 514). There were no associations between <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> and risk of meningioma, neither overall nor in stratified analyses according to severity of <b>head</b> <b>injury,</b> age, and sex of patients. Conclusion: <b>Head</b> <b>injury,</b> regardless of severity, patient sex, or age, is unlikely to be a cause of meningioma...|$|R

5|$|NFL {{commissioner}} Roger Goodell {{addressed the}} issue of <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> in professional football during a talk held on November 15, 2012 at the Harvard School of Public Health. In the talk, he highlighted the NFL's efforts to reduce <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> by enacting measures such as penalizing hits to the head, better assessing concussions on the sideline, and removing players from the game after they have been diagnosed or suspected of having sustained a concussion. He also discussed the need for increased research on brain injuries and long-term disorders, and called for a culture change in the league, saying that players need to be more willing to acknowledge their injuries to medical staff. In September 2012 the league pledged a $30 million donation to the National Institutes of Health to research the connection between brain injuries and long-term mental health issues. Beginning in 2012 the NFL was the subject of several lawsuits initiated by former players who alleged that the league withheld information and misled players about the potential long-term impacts of <b>head</b> <b>injuries.</b> Six of the lawsuits were approved to be tried together. In August 2013 the NFL reached a settlement with more than 4,500 former players, agreeing to pay $765 million to be used to pay for medical examinations for former NFL players and for research and education purposes. Additionally, the funds will also be used to compensate former players who are determined to have significant cognitive impairment.|$|E
40|$|Background <b>Head</b> <b>injury</b> is common, and {{the risk}} of {{subsequent}} disability and death is high. Increased risk of death years after injury might be explained by factors associated with, but not a consequence of, the <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> This unique prospective study investigates mortality over 13 years after injury. Methods A cohort of n= 767 with <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> was compared with two case control groups, matched for age, gender and deprivation, and in one control group, matched for duration of hospital admission following (non-head) injury. Results Two-fifths of the <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> cohort had died. The death rate (30. 99 per 1000 per year) was much higher than in community controls (13. 72 per 1000 per year). More than 1 year after injury, the death rate in younger (15 – 54 years) adults was much higher than in community controls (17. 36 vs 2. 36 per 1000 per year) whereas in older adults the difference was more marginal (61. 47 vs 42. 36). Death rate was elevated after mild and after more severe <b>head</b> <b>injury,</b> including in younger adults after mild <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> (14. 82 per 1000 per year mild <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> vs 2. 21 community). Female gender and greater deprivation were not associated with increased death rates after <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Late after injury, deaths occurred from the same main causes as for the general population. Conclusion <b>Head</b> <b>injury</b> is associated with increased vulnerability to death from a variety of causes for at least 13 years after hospital admission. There is a need to understand how <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> influences mortality, particularly in younger adults and after mild <b>head</b> <b>injury...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether children who sought care for a <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> were at greater risk of having a subsequent <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> within the following 6 and 12 months compared with children who sought care for an injury other than to the head. DESIGN/SETTING. This was a longitudinal cohort study conducted in the emergency departments of 2 Montreal (Quebec, Canada) pediatric hospitals. PARTICIPANTS. The parents of 11867 injured children aged 1 to 18 years were interviewed by telephone at 6 (n = 3 D 10315) and 12 (n = 3 D 9486) months after their child's injury to ascertain outcome (ie, subsequent <b>head</b> <b>injury)</b> and to provide information on potential risk factors (age, gender, chronic medical condition, activity level, and socioeconomic status). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. The outcome of interest was a <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> requiring medical attention within the following year ascertained by parental recall or physician claims data. RESULTS. A total of 245 and 386 previously head-injured children sustained a subsequent <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> within 6 and 12 months, respectively. Children who sought care for an initial <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> (n = 3 D 3599) were at higher risk of having a subsequent <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> within 6 months than children who sought care for an injury not to the head (n = 3 D 6716). The adjusted odds ratio suggested weak confounding by age, gender, and history of previous <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Results were consistent on the basis of physician claims data and 12 -month follow-up interview data. CONCLUSIONS. These results provide evidence that having a <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> increases a child's risk of having a subsequent <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> Although age, gender, and history of previous <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> confound the relationship, the effect remains substantial...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundInjuries are {{the ninth}} {{leading cause of}} death in the world and disproportionately affect low- and middle-income countries. <b>Head</b> <b>injury</b> {{is the leading cause of}} trauma death. This study {{examines}} the epidemiology and outcomes of traumatic <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> presenting to a tertiary hospital in Malawi, in order to determine effective triage in a resource limited setting. MethodsThe study was conducted at Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) in Lilongwe Malawi during a three-month period. Vital signs and Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) were prospectively collected for all patients that presented to the casualty department secondary to <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> All <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> admissions were followed until death or discharge. ResultsDuring the three-month study period, 4411 patients presented to KCH secondary to trauma and 841 (19 %) had a <b>head</b> <b>injury.</b> A multivariate logistic regression model revealed that GCS and heart rate changes correlated strongly with mortality. There is a four-fold increase in the odds of mortality in moderate versus mild <b>head</b> <b>injury</b> based on GCS.

5|$|The {{most common}} serious {{injuries}} were multiple lower leg fractures and dislocations, spinal fractures, hip fractures, <b>head</b> <b>injuries,</b> and multiple lacerations and contusions. The NTSB investigators found severe {{damage on the}} floor of the cabin, leading many of the passengers' seats to fracture where the legs met the floor track. This fracturing permitted many of the seats to come loose during the impact and aggravated the passengers' injuries. The report posits that the passengers' legs hit the lower seat frames in front of them. At the same time, the seats collapsed and twisted downward and to the left, likely causing hip and spinal fractures. As the impact progressed, the seats, now separated, flung passengers forward into each other as well as into other wreckage, causing <b>head</b> <b>injuries</b> and lacerations. Passengers holding onto infants reported being unable to either prevent their children from being ejected from their grasp in the impact or locate their children in the darkness afterward. The NTSB held that, had the children been in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)-approved child seats, many injuries might have been mitigated. Rescuers remarked that some infants were found smiling or seemingly unharmed. The NTSB was unable to accurately chart where individual passengers were seated because Avianca only assigned seats to a few passengers and many who were assigned reported moving after takeoff.|$|E
