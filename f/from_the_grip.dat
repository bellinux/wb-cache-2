5|$|To African Americans, {{the story}} of the Exodus was perhaps the central story, the most {{powerful}} image about emerging <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> of bondage to reach for liberty and human dignity – a tale that was carried from slavery through the Civil Rights Movement into today. For me, personally, growing up in far-flung parts of the world and without firm roots, the story spoke to a yearning within every human being for a home.|$|E

Whatever the case, Domnall died within the year, and Toirdelbach placed his own son, Muirchertach, upon the throne.|$|E

2500|$|The Nile {{crocodile}} (Crocodylus niloticus) possesses unusual {{predatory behaviour}} {{as it has}} the ability to hunt both within its natural habitat and out of it, which often results in unpredicted attacks on almost any other animal up to twice its size. Nile crocodiles are apex predators throughout their range. In the water, they are an agile and rapid hunter, using both movement and pressure sensors to catch any prey unfortunate enough to place themselves inside or near the waterfront. [...] Most terrestrial prey are caught by ambush attacks when the animal approaches water to drink. The crocodile slowly comes closer, most of its body underwater, sometimes only its eyes and nostrils visible. On other occasions more of its head and upper body visible. The attack is sudden and unpredictable. The crocodile lunges its body {{out of the water and}} grasps its prey. The teeth of a crocodile are not for tearing up flesh but to bite deep into the prey and hold on to it. The immense bite force, which may be as high as 22,000 N in large adults, ensures the prey item can't escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grip.</b> The prey is usually killed by drowning or being torn apart by [...] "death rolls". [...] On land, the Nile crocodile can gallop to chase prey. Most hunting on land is done at night by lying in ambush near forest trails or roadsides, up to 50 m from the water's edge.|$|E
