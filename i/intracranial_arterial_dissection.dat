40|$|An {{early and}} {{reliable}} diagnosis of <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection</b> {{is important to}} reduce the risk of neurological complication. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical usefulness of three-dimensional high-resolution MRI (3 D-HR-MRI) including pre- and post-contrast T 1 -weighted volumetric isotropic turbo spin echo acquisition with improved motion-sensitized driven equilibrium preparation (3 D-iMSDE-T 1) and proton-density weighted image (3 D-PD) in detecting dissection and to evaluate the added value of 3 D-PD in diagnosing <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection.</b> We retrospectively recruited patients who underwent 3 D-HR-MRI with clinical suspicion of arterial dissection. Among them, we selected patients who were diagnosed with definite dissection according to the Spontaneous Cervicocephalic Arterial Dissections Study criteria. For each patient, the presence of intimal flap, intramural hematoma, and vessel dilatation were evaluated independently by two neuroradiologists on each sequence. Interobserver agreement was assessed. Seventeen patients (mean age: 41 ± 10 [SD] years; 13 men) were diagnosed with definite dissection. The intimal flaps were more frequently detected on 3 D-PD (88. 2 %, 15 / 17) than on 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 (29. 4 %, 5 / 17), and post-contrast 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 (35. 3 %, 6 / 17; P = 0. 006 and P = 0. 004, respectively). No significant difference was found in the detection rate of intramural hematomas (59 - 71 %) and vascular dilatations (47 %) on each sequence. Interobserver agreement for detection of dissection findings showed almost perfect agreement (k = 0. 84 - 1. 00), except for detection of intimal flaps on pre-contrast 3 D-iMSDE-T 1 (k = 0. 62). After addition of 3 D-PD to pre- and post-contrast 3 D-iMSDE-T 1, more patients were diagnosed with definite dissection with the initial MRI (88. 2 % vs. 47. 1 %; P = 0. 039).

40|$|Background and Purpose—Our {{goal was}} to {{investigate}} whether initial ischemic lesion pattern can predict stroke recurrence in patients with symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> stenosis. Methods—Of the Trial of Cilostazol in Symptomatic <b>Intracranial</b> <b>Arterial</b> Stenosis (TOSS) - 2 trial participants, we included patients who underwent diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid attenuation inversion recovery imaging at baseline with a follow-up fluid attenuation inversion recovery imaging at 7 months. Based on the diffusion-weighted imaging findings, we classified the initial ischemic lesion patterns according to location (subcortical versus cortical versus subcorticocortical) and multiplicity (single versus multiple). We also evaluated the occurrence of new ischemic lesions on follow-up fluid attenuation inversion recovery as well as clinical stroke in the symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> stenosis territory. Results—Of 353 patients included in this study, 44 (12. 5 %) and 13 (3. 7 %) patients had new ischemic lesions and clinical recurrent stroke in the initial symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> stenosis territory, respectively. On multivariable analysis, the initial lesion patterns of subcorticocortical and multiple lesions were independent predictors of new ischemic lesions in the symptomatic <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> stenosis territory (OR, 3. 01; 95 % CI, 1. 33 – 7. 01; P 0. 03; OR, 2. 81; 95 % CI, 1. 34 – 5. 9; P 0. 006).

Intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA; alteplase) has recently been approved in Japan to use in patients with ischemic stroke within 3 hours of onset. In order to improve the efficacy and maximize the safety, attempts have recently been made to select patients on the basis of perfusion/diffusion mismatch on magnetic resonance imaging, use of third generation t-PAs, and concomitant use of transcranial Doppler or clot retrieval device. Neither unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, or heparinoid has been proven to improve long-term outcome, while anticoagulant therapy appears to be indicated for the treatment of patients with atherothrombotic stroke, progressing stroke, basilar artery thrombosis, cardioembolic stroke at high risk of early recurrence, coagulopathy including antiphospholipid antibody and Trousseau 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome, and <b>intracranial</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>dissection.</b> The thrombin inhibitor argatroban is recommended for the treatment of atherothrombotic stroke within 48 hours of onset.
