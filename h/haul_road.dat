5|$|In {{the first}} years of the project, workers were {{regularly}} treated to prime rib, steak dinners, and other exotic fare due to a cost-plus contract between the food preparers and the subcontractors. In later years, these cost-plus contracts were replaced, and institutional cooking and box lunches became common, but the food on the project was prized by many workers. As soon as the <b>haul</b> <b>road,</b> later named the Dalton Highway, was built, the food and the overtime for some unions changed. The highway construction was charged to the federal and state governments and was supposed to be cost plus. There were no more steak nights one to two times a week and the Australian rock lobster tails disappeared. The International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) LU 1547 was one union that had overtime on Sundays changed from double time to time-and-one-half upon completion of the <b>haul</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
5|$|The second-place bidder, Lane Construction Corporation, sued OCX {{after an}} {{appeal of the}} {{decision}} {{was rejected by the}} OCX board. Lane alleged that scoring of the bids were improperly skewed in Jr. Davis' favor and that the latter was not properly licensed. Lane's bid was cheaper, at $62million, but OCX determined that the Jr. Davis bridge design was superior. Lane did not succeed with the lawsuit and a notice to proceed, authorizing construction to begin, was issued in December 2013. To construct the bridge, a temporary <b>haul</b> <b>road</b> was constructed across the RCMB.

It is generally agreed that years of operation of tarp-top haul trucks (one every 15 minutes) carrying lead-zinc concentrate resulted in lead and cadmium-bearing dust contamination {{along the edges of}} the <b>haul</b> <b>road.</b> Fortunately this poor practice has not resulted in a threat to human safety.

Mine workers from remote villages {{in the region are}} ferried to the mine on small aircraft. Alaska Airlines is contracted by the mine to fly other mine workers out of Anchorage. Until 2007, gravel-strip capable Boeing 737-200 Combi aircraft were used. These ships have a cargo door in the front part of the aircraft and a separate rear passenger cabin.

The possible changes in the longitudinal gradient can also affect the technology of forest road surfacing and the selection of the appropriate surface type.

40|$|Ten {{temporary}} <b>haul</b> <b>roads</b> and landings in west-central Alberta were tilled with a winged subsoiler {{specifically designed}} for tilling compacted forest soils. Surface soil {{had been removed from}} all sites during construction, and spread over three of the four landings prior to tillage. Soil bulk density at the 0 – 10, 10 – 20, and 20 – 30 cm depths, and clod size distribution at the 0 – 30 cm depth were measured immediately after tillage. Bulk density of undisturbed and compacted (untilled) soil was also measured. Mean bulk density of compacted soil in <b>haul</b> <b>roads</b> was significantly greater than the bulk density of undisturbed soil, but not for landings. Tillage significantly reduced mean bulk density on three <b>haul</b> <b>roads</b> and two landings; subsurface soil was relatively dry at these sites. Most soils were difficult to fracture into small clods because these weakly aggregated soils were severely remoulded and compacted by equipment, particularly logging trucks operating on the <b>haul</b> <b>roads.</b> The degraded soil was massive and the strenght of the surface soil layers was generally much higher than was the strength of lower soil layers; this resulted in the subsoil deforming around the wings of the subsoiler rather than fracturing the surface soil. Fracturing of compacted soil into small clods was apparently enhanced by at least 2 years of frost action. The winged subsoiler was only moderately effective at fracturing recently compacted soil because of an often high soil water content, but it was observed that sites where soil was broken into large clods was loosened by frost action the following winter. Alternative methods of tilling compacted soil that insure soil fracturing over a wider range of soil water contents are needed for loosening compacted soil in northern boreal forests...|$|R
