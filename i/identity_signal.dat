40|$|The {{prediction}} that histocompatibility loci {{would prove to}} be concerned in chemosensory communication whereby animals recognize one another as individuals (1) was supported by a study in which selective mating was observed among congenic mice differing only at the major histoeompatibility complex (MHC) l (2). Alternative interpretations have been excluded by observations of MHC-associated mating preference among H- 2 -typed F 2 segregants of crosses between MHC congenic strains (3). The evidence suggests that polymorphism of genes in the MHC region determines the character of the <b>identity</b> <b>signal</b> or signals, and that polymorphism of other genes in the MHC region influences the response that manifests itself in mating preference (4, 5). Further investigation of MHC-associated sensory recognition was hampered by the arduous technicalities of the mating preference test.

It {{is based on the}} match/mismatch of an <b>identity</b> <b>signal</b> carried by members of the society with that of the perceiving individual. While the behavioral response, amicable or aggressive, is very clear, the neural systems underlying recognition are not fully understood. Here we contrast two alternative hypotheses for the neural mechanisms that are responsible for the perception and information processing in recognition. We focus on recognition via chemical signals, as the common modality in social insects. The first, classical, hypothesis states that upon perception of recognition cues by the sensory system the information is passed as is to the antennal lobes and to higher brain centers where the information is deciphered and compared to a neural template. Match or mismatch information is then transferred to some behavior-generating centers where the appropriate response is elicited. An alternative hypothesis, that of “pre-filter mechanism”, posits that the decision as to whether to pass on the information to the central nervous system takes place in the peripheral sensory system. We suggest that, through sensory adaptation, only alien signals are passed on to the brain, specifically to an “aggressive-behavior-switching center”, where the response is generated if the signal is above a certain threshold...|$|E
40|$|Economists have {{proposed}} that <b>signaling</b> one’s social <b>identity</b> can increase a person’s subjective utility or happiness. However, there is little cross-cultural research on this relationship. The present research fills this knowledge gap. Using relational <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> as an illustration, in two studies, the authors showed that relative to European Americans, Asians (Chinese and Indians) value the relational self more and have relatively high intention to <b>signal</b> their relational <b>identities</b> publicly. Furthermore, for Asians, relational <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> is accompanied by higher life satisfaction (the cognitive component of happiness) only when the assimilation motive is salient. In contrast, for European Americans, {{a positive relationship between}} relational <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> and life satisfaction emerges only when the differentiation motive is salient. These findings suggest that relational <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> can confer utility to both Asians and European Americans. Moreover, whether relational <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> would increase life satisfaction in a certain culture is a joint function of what the normative practice is in the culture and the motivation to seek social connection of the self to or differentiation of it from others...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates group-identity {{signalling}} among violent extremists in Italy between 1969 and 1980 —with particular {{focus on}} the left-wing urban guerrilla organisation known as Brigate Rosse. Other groups both from {{the left and right}} end of the political spectrum will be taken into account for comparative purposes. Starting from the definition of political violence as propaganda by the deed this paper focuses on how underground groups manage their communicative purposes. It addresses how groups designed their claiming signature, the threat posed by unauthorized use of those signatures, and the strategies to protect them from deceptive mimics of various sorts (criminals, political adversaries and competitors). Drawing theoretical insights from the concept of mimicry in evolutionary biology and signalling theory the paper analyses equivalent strategic behaviour among the actors of the Italian political struggle and identify who mimics what model and to the damage of whom. The analysis is based on a mixed method approach (Creswell 2003) using both quantitative and qualitative sources. Quantitative data -based on a collation of the START-GTD and an original collection of data from Italian newspapers and biographical sources - are used to present a substantive picture of detected mimic behaviour and available signature designs. Qualitative data are analyzed thematically to offer contextual depth to the quantitative patterns identified.

40|$|Developmental {{stability}} {{is the ability}} of organisms to buffer development against perturbations. Different classes of traits typically have different levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA), a measure of developmental instability. In particular, elevated FA in sexually selected quality signals has attracted a great deal of attention. There are 3 main hypotheses to explain elevated developmental instability in quality signals. Developmental instability {{may be related to the}} cost of trait production, a trait's condition dependence, or the levels of interindividual trait variation. Here we test these 3 hypotheses by comparing FA in structural traits, nonsignaling color traits, and 2 signaling color traits: a condition-dependent quality signal in Polistes dominulus wasps and noncondition-dependent identity signals in P. fuscatus wasps. Overall, color traits have higher FA than structural traits, though FA differs among the 3 classes of color traits. The clypeal <b>identity</b> <b>signal</b> in P. fuscatus has the highest interindividual trait variation, yet shows relatively low FA, indicating that interindividual trait variation does not explain heightened FA. The quality signal in P. dominulus has the highest FA, though it is not costly to produce. Therefore, the elevated FA in quality signals cannot be attributed to costs of signal production. The quality signal in P. dominulus is condition dependent, however, so our results indicate that increased developmental instability in quality signaling traits can be attributed to their condition-dependent development. A link between developmental stability and condition dependence provides a mechanism through which quality signals may integrate information about overall condition in the absence of costly trait development.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are {{synthetic}} chemical pollutants with demonstrated detrimental toxic {{and developmental}} effects on humans and wildlife. Laboratory {{studies suggest that}} PCBs influence behavior due to their effects on endocrine and neurological systems, yet {{little is known about}} the behavioral consequences of sublethal PCB exposure in the field. Additionally, specific PCB congener data (in contrast to total PCB load) is necessary to understand the possible effects of PCBs in living organisms since number and position of chlorine substitution in a PCB molecule dictates the toxicity and chemical fate of individual PCB congeners. We non-lethally investigated total PCB loads, congener specific PCB profiles, and songs of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) along a historical PCB gradient at the Hudson River in New York State. Our results indicate that black-capped chickadees and song sparrows have higher total blood PCBs in regions with higher historic PCB contamination. The two bird species varied substantially in their congener-specific PCB profiles; within sites, song sparrows showed a significantly higher proportion of lower chlorinated PCBs, while black-capped chickadees had higher proportions of highly chlorinated PCBs. In areas of PCB pollution, the species-specific <b>identity</b> <b>signal</b> in black-capped chickadee song varied significantly, while variation in song sparrow trill performance was best predicted by the mono-ortho PCB load. Thus, PCBs may affect song production, an important component of communication in birds. In conclusion, we suggest that the ramifications of changes in song quality for bird populations may extend the toxic effects of environmental PCB pollution...|$|E
40|$|Individual {{recognition}} (IR) requires {{individuals to}} uniquely identify their social partners based on phenotypic variation. Because IR is so specific, distinctive phenotypes that {{stand out from}} the crowd facilitate efficient recognition. Over time, the benefits of unique appearances are predicted to produce a correlation between IR and phenotypic variation. Here, we test whether there is an association between elevated phenotypic polymorphism and IR in paper wasps. Previous work has shown that Polistes fuscatus use variable colour patterns for IR. We test whether two less variable wasp species, Polistes dominulus and Polistes metricus, are capable of IR. As predicted, neither species is capable of IR, suggesting that highly variable colour patterns are confined to Polistes species with IR. This association suggests that elevated phenotypic variation in taxa with IR {{may be the result of}} selection for <b>identity</b> <b>signals</b> rather than neutral processes. Given that IR is widespread among social taxa, selection for <b>identity</b> <b>signalling</b> may be an underappreciated mechanism for the origin and maintenance of polymorphism...|$|R

40|$|Given the {{diversity}} of animal signals, there has been recent interest in categorizing signals into probable functions according to their properties. For example, models predict that signals of quality should be costly and condition dependent, whereas <b>signals</b> of individual <b>identity</b> should be cheap and expressed independently of condition. Here, we test these predictions by comparing the condition dependence of <b>signals</b> of individual <b>identity</b> and quality in Polistes wasps. Polistes fuscatus wasps have black and yellow patterns on the face and abdomen that <b>signal</b> individual <b>identity,</b> whereas Polistes dominulus wasps have black and yellow facial patterns that signal aspects of quality related to dominance. We reared both species with and without supplemental food and examined the facial patterns of the resulting offspring. As predicted, food availability did not influence the development of <b>identity</b> <b>signals</b> in P. fuscatus. In strong contrast, P. dominulus wasps reared with supplemental food had facial patterns that signaled higher levels of quality than P. dominulus reared without supplemental food. Interestingly, the <b>identity</b> and quality <b>signals</b> have different condition dependence, despite being composed of similar pigments, suggesting that signal function has a stronger influence on signal properties than pigmentation. Because body size is often correlated with quality signal elaboration, we also tested how food supplementation influenced offspring size. In both species, supplemented colonies produced smaller offspring than nonsupplemented colonies, suggesting that queens may invest in producing fewer, larger offspring in stressful environments.

Skilful politicians can creatively combine conventional discourses with rhetorical strategies of concession, springboarding, and co-optation to align with multiple constituencies, including ones on opposing sides of an issue.

Major determinants are conserved in evolution; however, the mechanisms by which they are expressed are species dependent. Recent studies show that alternate identity sets can be recognized by a single synthetase, and emphasize the importance of tRNA architecture and anti-determinants preventing false recognition. Identity rules apply to tRNA-like molecules and to minimalist tRNAs. Knowledge of these rules allows the manipulation of identity elements and engineering of tRNAs with switched, altered or multiple specificities...|$|R

Ideas pertaining to the artifacts made of stone, bone-antler and shell seem to have been shared widely, whereas ideas associated with the artifacts made of basketry were not. There are several possible explanations for this difference, but ethnographic evidence suggests that it is probably primarily a result of the basketry artifacts playing a role in ethnic <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> in a way that the stone, bone-antler and shell artifacts did not...|$|R
40|$|Social {{identities are}} among the key factors driving {{behavior}} in complex societies. <b>Signals</b> of social <b>identity</b> are known to influence individual behaviors in the adoption of innovations. Yet the population-level consequences of <b>identity</b> <b>signaling</b> on the diffusion of innovations are largely unknown. Here we use both analytical and agent-based modeling to consider the spread of a beneficial innovation in a structured population in which there exist two groups who are averse to being mistaken for each other. We investigate the dynamics of adoption and consider the role of structural factors such as demographic skew and communication scale on population-level outcomes. We find that outgroup aversion can lead to adoption being delayed or suppressed in one group, and that population-wide underadoption is common. Comparing the two models, we find that differential adoption can arise due to structural constraints on information flow {{even in the absence}} of intrinsic between-group differences in adoption rates. Further, we find that patterns of polarization in adoption at both local and global scales depend on the details of demographic organization and the scale of communication. This research has particular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products and behaviors, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption determine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large.
