500|$|Listed at five-foot-eight {{inches tall}} during his playing days, St. Louis found {{himself to be}} one of the {{smallest}} players in the NHL. Hockey Hall of Fame coach Scotty Bowman credited St. Louis' desire to succeed as being his primary attribute: [...] "His long suit is his passion. Small players <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> special attribute that makes them stand out. He's got great acceleration and hockey sense." [...] St. Louis was also a durable player throughout his career, missing only seven games between 2002 and 2012.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} {{intended to}} depict Karnaca as grounded environment {{to help the}} city seem as though it could exist in reality. Arkane wished to avoid what one member dubbed [...] "the Deus Ex effect"—wherein man-sized vents were placed wherever the game designers felt, often in nonsensical places. The team tried to reflect practicalities of everyday life; for instance, a building would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> kind of toilet and a guard's placement should make in-world sense. Colonies {{in places such as}} Australia, India and Africa were investigated to comprehend the transition of people adapting from the cold climate of Dunwall to areas with a warmer constitution like Karnaca.|$|E
500|$|Lopez, {{who also}} served as {{producer}} on the film, chose a fellow Latino actor Guzman to cast in the film, and for which she stated that [...] "two Latinos opening in a mainstream movie, if it does well, that's gonna change things. I would love for the Latino community {{to come out and}} support this movie because it would give us the freedom." [...] She also stated that [...] "We [...] don't have to be close-minded, where two Latinos have to be speaking Spanish or they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> Latin reference in the movie... That's what I love about this film. We're breaking down the walls and stereotypes." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "We {{need to have}} a {{discussion}} and not just appoint him in ten minutes or less," [...] said Senator Dan Brady, a Democrat from Cleveland. [...] Brady said on the Senate floor [...] "The majority party is playing musical chairs with statewide offices in this state. [...] We <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> type of process." [...] The Beacon-Journal was also skeptical of [...] "the latest round of musical chairs among Republican officeholders in Columbus." [...] Nevertheless, the General Assembly passed House Joint Resolution 1, which confirmed Johnson, on January 4, 2005, by 97–0 in the House and 22-11 in the Senate. Taft told the crowd at the swearing on January 5, [...] "Bruce has been actively engaged in designing our program for jobs creation, tax reform and economic development. [...] It is primarily because of his leadership on the economy that I have chosen Bruce." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott Miller {{chose to}} name his new band [...] "Game Theory" [...] as {{an allusion to}} the {{mathematical}} field of game theory, which he described as [...] "the study of calculating the most appropriate action given an adversary, ... someone who was thinking against you, {{and you had to}} organize what his moves could be, and what your moves should be, to give yourself the minimum amount of failure." [...] In a 1988 interview, Miller stated, [...] "It's a theory of probability that's a mathematical discipline that more or less has been applied improperly to real-life situations. It's just that idea of a set of rules that gets misused that intrigued me about it.... kind of a telling comment on life in general—that you just <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> sort of set of rules, but who knows what the set of rules should be." [...] That theme, according to Miller, was what many Game Theory songs were about: [...] "Always be wary of the superstructure of whatever situation you're in. It may just be that the whole game that you're into is something very bogus and you should get out." ...|$|E

50|$|Before the 1885 general election, Schnadhorst {{was invited}} to stand in two Birmingham seats, South and East, {{both of which were}} {{subsequently}} won by the Liberals. However he did not wish to enter Parliament. He said he felt he could better promote the cause of Liberalism through his administrative work for the party. In 1890 he also turned down the offer of a seat in Newcastle-under-Lyme but by this time his health was deteriorating; he <b>had</b> already <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> time off work on medical advice and had undertaken a holiday voyage to Australia a few years earlier.|$|R
50|$|A siege tower or {{breaching}} tower (or in the Middle Ages, a belfry) is {{a specialized}} siege engine, constructed to protect assailants and ladders while approaching the defensive {{walls of a}} fortification. The tower was often rectangular with four wheels with its height roughly {{equal to that of}} the wall or sometimes higher to allow archers to stand on top of the tower and shoot arrows into the fortification. Because the towers were wooden and thus flammable, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> non-flammable covering of iron or fresh animal skins.|$|R

50|$|As {{with all}} {{hesitation}} blowback weapons, the Pedersen rifle <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> means <b>to</b> prevent cartridge cases from becoming {{stuck in the}} chamber due to the relatively high breech pressure and operating velocity existing {{at the moment of}} extraction. The measure adopted by the designer was the sophisticated case coating technique described earlier, which in combination with the taper of the cartridge case sides undoubtedly contributed to the high degree of reliability noted in all Army tests. It should be noted that use of uncoated-case rounds (intentionally done in at least one test) caused the rifle to completely fail to function.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBiomimicry is an {{applied science}} that derives {{inspiration}} for solutions to human problems through {{the study of}} natural designs, processes and systems. The widespread and practical application of biomimicry as a design method remains unrealized; interior architecture commonly use biology as a library of shapes, but this alone is not biomimetics; it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> biology in it. This paper reviews key points and case studies of applications of biomimicry in interior architecture. A critique of the applications shows that biomimetics {{is the way to}} innovation and sustainability and interior architecture must move beyond the formalistic characteristics of nature...|$|R

But when I told her Baxter's business, and that she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>some</b> one come and pack up for her, she flatly declared that no one should do anything of the kind.

I think Michel Gondry is very talented and I had hoped it would work. But I think Seth Rogen and Michel had a different direction for the character totally than the way I wanted to go. ... I wasn't interested in just being straight-up bad guy who was killing people willy-nilly.

"No," [...] said Miriam, [...] "because it is a secret; but it {{is nearly}} finished, and as I shall {{have to tell you}} about it very soon, I may as well do it now: I have been {{altering}} Judith Pacewalk's teaberry gown for Cicely. It was altered once for me, and that makes it all the harder to make it fit her now. I am not very good at that sort of thing, and so it has taken me a long time. I expected to have it ready for her when she came back from the wedding trip, but I could not do it. I shall finish it to-day, however, and to-morrow I am going to invest her with it. She is now the head of the house, and it is she who should wear the teaberry gown.
