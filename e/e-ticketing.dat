5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an <b>e-ticketing</b> solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines to switch over their ticketing systems. <b>E-ticketing</b> has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of <b>e-ticketing,</b> {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E

40|$|<b>E-ticket</b> is an Internet service which, {{similarly}} to real-world tickets, gives their owners permission {{to enter a}} place of entertainment, use a means of transportation, or have access to some other Internet services. <b>E-tickets</b> {{can be stored in}} desktop computers or personal digital assistants for future use. Before being used, <b>e-tickets</b> have to be validated to prevent duplication, and ensure authenticity and integrity. This paper studies the <b>e-ticket</b> validation problem in contexts in which users cannot be trusted and servers may fail. The paper proposes formal de nitions for the <b>e-ticket</b> validation problem, and shows that some intuitive guarantees cannot be implemented when failures may occur.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{operators}} {{of public transportation}} in many countries started to roll out electronic tickets (<b>e-tickets).</b> <b>E-tickets</b> offer several advantages to transit enterprises {{as well as to}} their customers, e. g., they aggravate forgeries by cryptographic means whereas customers benefit from fast and convenient verification of tickets or replacement of lost ones. Existing (proprietary) <b>e-ticket</b> systems deployed in practice are mainly based on RFID technologies where RFID tags prove authorization by releasing spatio-temporal data that discloses customer-related data, in particular their location. Moreover, available literature on privacy-preserving RFID-based protocols lack practicability for real world scenarios. In this paper, we discuss appropriate security and privacy requirements for <b>e-tickets</b> and point out the shortcomings of existing proposals. We then propose solutions for practical privacy-preserving <b>e-tickets</b> based on known cryptographic techniques and RFID technology. Key words: Location Privacy, <b>E-Tickets,</b> RFID...|$|R

50|$|Passengers with <b>e-tickets</b> are {{required}} to check-in at the airport for a flight in the usual manner, except {{that they may be}} required to present an <b>e-ticket</b> itinerary receipt or personal identification, such as a passport, or credit card.

50|$|Another {{critical}} {{limitation is}} that at the time <b>e-tickets</b> were initially designed, most airlines still practiced product bundling. By the time the industry began 100% <b>e-ticket</b> implementation, more and more airlines began to unbundle previously included services (like checked baggage) and add them back in as optional fees (ancillary revenue). However, the <b>e-ticket</b> standard did not anticipate and did not include a standardized mechanism for such optional fees.|$|R

Expansive glass curtain walls will be incorporated to boost the feeling of airiness and spaciousness, as will skylights. The new terminal will have three levels. The departure area will be featured on the top level with the arrivals section on ground level. The arrivals section will form the base for airlines and other offices with the basement reserved for luggage scanners. The domestic terminal covers 67,700sqm and will also have a provision of seven gates, two hard-stand hold rooms and 52 check-in counters, besides eight counters for <b>e-ticketing.</b> The international terminal will cover 59,300sqm with the provision of two gates with multiple hard-stand hold rooms, 52 check-in counters, eight counters for <b>e-ticketing,</b> 18/10 immigration/Custom counters for handling passenger arrival and 18/4 immigration/Custom counters for outgoing passengers.

About the <b>e-ticket</b> system in Thailand, many airlines have already adopted this system and tried to introduce it to their customers. However, the statistic was shown that only 24 % of the internet user has experienced with it, which is pretty low comparing to some other countries. Consequently, the airlines have been trying to improve and enhance their systems in order to encourage the customers to purchase the electronic ticket. Problem: “What are the factors that influence intention to make an online purchase of airline e-ticket?” Purpose: The purpose of this research is to explore the factors influencing the intention to purchase the domestic airline <b>e-ticket</b> in Thailand, and also to investigate whether there are any differences between <b>e-ticket</b> adopters and non-adopters. Method:         The research is based on quantitative research by using online self-administered survey. The list of respondents was from two travel agencies in Thailand. The questionnaires were sent out to 350 respondents and a total of 253 usable respondents were collected in this research. The questionnaires were designed based on Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The model comprises of Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Perceived Ease of use (PEOU). In addition, the theory of Perceived Risk (PR) is also added to be the third construct in the model. Conclusion: The findings indicate that the all three constructs have different impacts on intention to purchase of <b>e-ticket</b> adopter and <b>e-ticket</b> non adopter. Perceived Usefulness (PU) is the only construct that influences <b>e-ticket</b> adopter while all three construct have significant impact on future intention to purchase of <b>e-ticket</b> non adopter. Convenience factor tends to be the most important one in Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) for <b>e-ticket</b> non adopter whereas product information and accessibility is more important to <b>e-ticket</b> adopter in Perceived Usefulness (PU). Security and privacy are the major concern in Perceived Risk (PR) when buying <b>e-ticket.</b> However, there are additional factors which affect the future intention to purchase exclude from the three constructs studied. ...|$|R
