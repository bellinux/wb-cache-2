In his remaining 19 years he created less than 15 pieces, mostly reworking earlier themes, and while his fame grew he withdrew.

During the war, McDonald and other former cadets returned to the Virginia Military Institute to instruct pupils while on parole or recuperating from injuries. In 1864 while McDonald was on parole, one of his students, John Sergeant Wise, recounted of having McDonald as a professor: 'Marshall McDonald <b>hobbles</b> in to point with his crutch at the problems on the black-board, until he can once more point with his sword towards [...] "the looming bastion fringed with fire."' Of the professors at the institute during the war, Wise remarked, [...] "they taught with a zest and freshness as we seldom see." ...|$|E
2500|$|McHenry {{worked with}} Dan Patch {{for two months}} {{before the start of the}} Grand Circuit season. Although Dan Patch had been trained well by Wattles, he still had some gaiting issues {{associated}} with his conformation. McHenry had the toe of Dan Patch's feet trimmed short while using a shoe that was raised in the back, a combination that some observers said made Dan Patch look like he was wearing high heels. Despite the odd appearance, the shoeing improved on the earlier changes made by Wattles to keep Dan Patch's hind legs from interfering with his front legs while reducing the wide action that led to him sometimes striking the wheels of the sulky. Always a natural pacer who required no <b>hobbles</b> or special equipment to keep him on stride, Dan Patch soon attracted interest from observers of the training sessions.|$|E

50|$|A <b>hobble</b> skirt was a {{skirt with}} a narrow enough hem to {{significantly}} impede the wearer's stride, and was a short-lived fashion trend {{around the turn of}} the 19th to the 20th century and the early 1910s. The name was given in reference to the device used to restrain, or <b>hobble,</b> horses. A knee-long corset was also used to achieve this effect. A dress consisting of such skirt was called a <b>hobble</b> dress.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the century, the bulky skirts were replaced by the sheath line silhouette. The first <b>hobble</b> skirts showed up.

60|$|Presently he {{went off}} into the cedars to find Nagger and the mustang {{that he used to}} carry a pack. Nagger was grazing in a little open patch among the trees, but the pack-horse was missing. Slone seemed to know in what {{direction}} to go to find the trail, for he came upon it very soon. The pack-horse wore <b>hobbles,</b> but he belonged to the class that could cover a great deal of ground when hobbled. Slone did not expect the horse to go far, considering that the grass thereabouts was good. But in a wild-horse country it was not safe to give any horse a chance. The call of his wild brethren was irresistible. Slone, however, found the mustang standing quietly in a clump of cedars, and, removing the <b>hobbles,</b> he mounted and rode back to camp. Nagger caught sight of him and came at his call.|$|E
