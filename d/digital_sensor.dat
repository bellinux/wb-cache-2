50|$|Sensors {{are often}} used for {{analytical}} measurements, i.e. the measurement of chemical and physical properties of liquids. Typical measured parameters are pH value, conductivity, oxygen, redox potentials and others. Such measurements {{are used in the}} industrial world and give vital input for process control.Sensors used to be of analogue type, but today more and more <b>digital</b> <b>sensors</b> are used. This article describes the difference and the reason for the development of <b>digital</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|R
5|$|Binary {{logarithms}} (expressed as stops) {{are also}} used in densitometry, to express the dynamic range of light-sensitive materials or <b>digital</b> <b>sensors.</b>|$|R
50|$|Actual {{displays}} do {{not generally}} have non-square pixels, though <b>digital</b> <b>sensors</b> might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.|$|R

50|$|A {{film plane}} {{is the area}} inside any camera or image taking device with a lens and film or <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> upon which the lens creates the focused image. The film plane varies in {{distance}} from the lens focal point in cameras from different manufacturers. Thus each lens used has to be chosen carefully {{to assure that the}} image from the lens is focused on the exact place where the individual frame of film or <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> is positioned during exposure. It is sometimes marked on a camera body with the 'Φ' symbol where the vertical bar represents the exact location.|$|E
50|$|Shutter {{speed is}} {{the length of}} time when the film or <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> inside the camera is exposed to light. Object and image can be shown {{differently}} by shutter speed. Below are the examples.|$|E
5000|$|Sensor {{sizes are}} {{expressed}} in inches notation {{because at the time}} of the popularization of digital image sensors they were used to replace video camera tubes. The common 1" [...] circular video camera tubes had a rectangular photo sensitive area about 16mm diagonal, so a <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> with a 16 mm diagonal size was a 1" [...] video tube equivalent. The name of a 1" [...] <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> should more accurately be read as [...] "one inch video camera tube equivalent" [...] sensor. Current digital image sensor size descriptors are the video camera tube equivalency size, not the actual size of the sensor. For example, a 1" [...] sensor has a diagonal measurement of 16mm.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the years}} since digital cinema cameras became commonplace, {{anamorphic}} has experienced a considerable resurgence of popularity, {{due in large part}} to the higher base [...] ISO sensitivity of <b>digital</b> <b>sensors</b> which allows shooting at deeper stops.|$|R

5000|$|A {{primary goal}} of the NAIP program is to make digital ortho {{photography}} available to governmental agencies and the public {{within a year of}} acquisition. This [...] "leaf-on" [...] imagery is used as a base layer for GIS programs in the FSA's County Service Centers, and is used to maintain the Common Land Unit (CLU) boundaries. Projects are contracted each year based upon available funding and the FSA imagery acquisition cycle. Beginning in 2003, NAIP was acquired on a 5-year cycle. 2008 was a transition year, and a three-year cycle began in 2009. Since the NAIP program began in 2003, vendors have been transitioning to <b>digital</b> <b>sensors</b> in imagery acquisition. In 2009, most NAIP imagery will be acquired with <b>digital</b> <b>sensors</b> rather than film cameras.|$|R

50|$|Most {{industries}} are moving from film based radiography to a <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> based radiography {{much the same}} way that traditional photography has made this move.Since the amount of radiation emerging from the opposite side of the material can be detected and measured, variations in this amount (or intensity) of radiation are used to determine thickness or composition of material.|$|E
5000|$|A 0.7 m Schmidt camera {{has been}} the primary {{telescope}} at OANTON since it was opened. It {{was built in the}} Harvard College Observatory shops with optics provided by Perkin-Elmer. It was installed in 1942, and was used by Haro to study Herbig-Haro objects in detail. The telescope has not been upgraded with a <b>digital</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are two {{varieties}} of wide-angle lens: short-focus lenses and retrofocus lenses.Short-focus lenses are generally {{made up of}} multiple glass elements whose shapes {{are more or less}} symmetrical in front of and behind the diaphragm. As the focal length decreases, the distance of the rear element of the lens from the film plane or <b>digital</b> <b>sensor</b> also decreases.|$|E
50|$|Early analog sensors for {{visible light}} were video camera tubes. Currently, used types are {{semiconductor}} charge-coupled devices (CCD) or active pixel sensors in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) or N-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (NMOS, Live MOS) technologies. Analog sensors for invisible radiation tend to involve vacuum tubes of various kinds. <b>Digital</b> <b>sensors</b> include flat panel detectors.|$|R
50|$|The 631A and 630A plugs {{are also}} used for {{connecting}} sensors to interfaces for computer based measurements in educational environments, the former for connecting analogue sensors and the latter for <b>digital</b> <b>sensors.</b> Companies using these plugs include Vernier, TI and Casio, for interfaces connecting to their graphical calculators, and in the Netherlands CMA.|$|R
5000|$|In analog images such as film {{there is}} no notion of pixel, nor notion of SAR or PAR, and [...] "aspect ratio" [...] refers {{unambiguously}} to DAR. Actual displays do not generally have non-square pixels, though <b>digital</b> <b>sensors</b> might; they are rather a mathematical abstraction used in resampling images to convert between resolutions.|$|R
