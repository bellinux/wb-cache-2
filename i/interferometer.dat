5|$|A common path <b>interferometer</b> is a {{class of}} <b>interferometer</b> in which the {{reference}} beam and sample beam travel along the same path. Fig.4 illustrates the Sagnac <b>interferometer,</b> the fibre optic gyroscope, the point diffraction <b>interferometer,</b> and the lateral shearing <b>interferometer.</b> Other examples of common path <b>interferometer</b> include the Zernike phase contrast microscope, Fresnel's biprism, the zero-area Sagnac, and the scatterplate <b>interferometer.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{wavefront}} splitting <b>interferometer</b> divides a light wavefront {{emerging from}} a point or a narrow slit (i.e. spatially coherent light) and, after allowing the {{two parts of the}} wavefront to travel through different paths, allows them to recombine. Fig.5 illustrates Young's interference experiment and Lloyd's mirror. Other examples of wavefront splitting <b>interferometer</b> include the Fresnel biprism, the Billet Bi-Lens, and the Rayleigh <b>interferometer.</b>|$|E
5|$|An {{amplitude}} splitting <b>interferometer</b> uses {{a partial}} reflector {{to divide the}} amplitude of the incident wave into separate beams which are separated and recombined. Fig.6 illustrates the Fizeau, Mach–Zehnder and Fabry–Pérot interferometers. Other examples of amplitude splitting <b>interferometer</b> include the Michelson, Twyman–Green, Laser Unequal Path, and Linnik <b>interferometer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The wave {{character}} of matter can be exploited to build <b>interferometers.</b> The first examples of matter <b>interferometers</b> were electron <b>interferometers,</b> later followed by neutron <b>interferometers.</b> Around 1990 the first atom <b>interferometers</b> were demonstrated, later followed by <b>interferometers</b> employing molecules.|$|R
40|$|In-line {{fiber optic}} <b>interferometers</b> have {{attracted}} intensive attention for their potential sensing applications in refractive index, temperature, pressure and strain measurement, etc. Typical in-line fiber-optic <b>interferometers</b> are of two types: Fabry-Perot <b>interferometers</b> and core-cladding-mode <b>interferometers.</b> It’s {{known that the}} in-line fiber optic <b>interferometers</b> based on single-mode fibers can exhibit compact structures, easy fabrication and low cost. In this paper, we review two kinds of typical in-line fiber optic <b>interferometers</b> formed in single-mode fibers fabricated with different post-processing techniques. Also, some recently reported specific technologies for fabricating such fiber optic <b>interferometers</b> are presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{calculate}} {{and compare}} the response of light wave <b>interferometers</b> and matter wave <b>interferometers</b> to gravitational waves. We find that metric matter wave <b>interferometers</b> will not challenge kilometric light wave <b>interferometers</b> such as Virgo or LIGO, but {{could be a good}} candidate for the detection of very low frequency gravitational waves...|$|R

5|$|The Twyman–Green <b>interferometer,</b> {{invented by}} Twyman and Green in 1916, is {{a variant of}} the Michelson <b>interferometer</b> widely used to test optical components. The basic {{characteristics}} distinguishing it from the Michelson configuration are the use of a monochromatic point light source and a collimator. It {{is interesting to note that}} Michelson (1918) criticized the Twyman-Green configuration as being unsuitable for the testing of large optical components, since the light sources available at the time had limited coherence length. Michelson pointed out that constraints on geometry forced by limited coherence length required the use of a reference mirror of equal size to the test mirror, making the Twyman-Green impractical for many purposes. Decades later, the advent of laser light sources answered Michelson's objections. (A Twyman-Green <b>interferometer</b> using a laser light source and unequal path length is known as a Laser Unequal Path <b>Interferometer,</b> or LUPI.) Fig.14 illustrates a Twyman-Green <b>interferometer</b> set up to test a lens. Light from a monochromatic point source is expanded by a diverging lens (not shown), then is collimated into a parallel beam. A convex spherical mirror is positioned so that its center of curvature coincides with the focus of the lens being tested. The emergent beam is recorded by an imaging system for analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{took part}} in the first transatlantic <b>interferometer</b> experiment in 1968, with other telescopes being those at Algonquin and Penticton in Canada. It was first used as an <b>interferometer</b> with the Arecibo radio telescope in 1969.|$|E
40|$|The {{requirements}} for optical path compensation on space-based (no atmospheric-induced disturbance) heterodyne <b>interferometers</b> and generalized Michelson stellar <b>interferometers</b> are developed. It is demonstrated that heterodyne <b>interferometers</b> require optical path compensation to {{well within the}} coherence length dictated by its bandwidth, while Michelson stellar <b>interferometers</b> require compensation to a fraction of their utilized wavelength...|$|R

Typical {{applications of the}} vibration insensitive <b>interferometers</b> include the testing of large astronomical primary mirrors with long radii of curvature in a severe vibration environment.

50|$|Lummer-Gehrcke <b>interferometers</b> are now rarely used, {{having been}} largely {{replaced}} by Fabry-Pérot <b>interferometers</b> using modern dielectric reflective coatings.|$|R
5|$|An astronomical <b>interferometer</b> {{achieves}} high-resolution observations {{using the}} technique of aperture synthesis, mixing signals from a cluster of comparatively small telescopes rather than a single very expensive monolithic telescope.|$|E
5|$|Fig.8 {{illustrates}} {{the operation of}} a Fourier transform spectrometer, which is essentially a Michelson <b>interferometer</b> with one mirror movable. (A practical Fourier transform spectrometer would substitute corner cube reflectors for the flat mirrors of the conventional Michelson <b>interferometer,</b> but for simplicity, the illustration does not show this.) An interferogram is generated by making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the moving mirror. A Fourier transform converts the interferogram into an actual spectrum.|$|E
5|$|In {{coherence}} scanning interferometry, interference is only achieved {{when the}} path length delays of the <b>interferometer</b> are matched within the coherence {{time of the}} light source. CSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the phase of the fringes. Fig.17 illustrates a CSI microscope using a Mirau <b>interferometer</b> in the objective; other forms of <b>interferometer</b> used with white light include the Michelson <b>interferometer</b> (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt {{too much of the}} aperture) and the Linnik <b>interferometer</b> (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The sample (or alternatively, the objective) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of coherence scanning interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig.18, which scans a 180μmx140μmx10μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined in part by the coherence length of the light source. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{realization}} of cold 85 Rb atom <b>interferometers</b> and their applications in precision mea-surements {{are reported in}} this paper. Mach–Zehnder and Ramsey–Borde ̀ type <b>interferometers</b> were demonstrated. Detailed descriptions of the <b>interferometers</b> are given including manipulation of cold atoms, Rabi oscillation, stimulated Raman transitions, and optical pumping. As an example of using atom <b>interferometers</b> in precision measurements, the quadratic Zeeman shift of hyperfine sublevels of 85 Rb was determined...|$|R

5|$|When {{used as a}} tunable {{narrow band}} filter, Michelson <b>interferometers</b> exhibit a number of {{advantages}} and disadvantages when compared with competing technologies such as Fabry–Pérot <b>interferometers</b> or Lyot filters. Michelson <b>interferometers</b> have the largest field of view for a specified wavelength, and are relatively simple in operation, since tuning is via mechanical rotation of waveplates rather than via high voltage control of piezoelectric crystals or lithium niobate optical modulators as used in a Fabry–Pérot system. Compared with Lyot filters, which use birefringent elements, Michelson <b>interferometers</b> have a relatively low temperature sensitivity. On the negative side, Michelson <b>interferometers</b> have a relatively restricted wavelength range and require use of prefilters which restrict transmittance.|$|R
5|$|Optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) is {{a medical}} imaging technique using low-coherence interferometry to provide tomographic visualization of internal tissue microstructures. As seen in Fig.22, {{the core of a}} typical OCT system is a Michelson <b>interferometer.</b> One <b>interferometer</b> arm is focused onto the tissue sample and scans the sample in an X-Y longitudinal raster pattern. The other <b>interferometer</b> arm is bounced off a reference mirror. Reflected light from the tissue sample is combined with reflected light from the reference. Because of the low coherence of the light source, interferometric signal is observed only over a limited depth of sample. X-Y scanning therefore records one thin optical slice of the sample at a time. By performing multiple scans, moving the reference mirror between each scan, an entire three-dimensional image of the tissue can be reconstructed. Recent advances have striven to combine the nanometer phase retrieval of coherent interferometry with the ranging capability of low-coherence interferometry.|$|E
5|$|The Mark II {{telescope}} once constructed {{was also}} used as an <b>interferometer</b> with the Lovell telescope. This has a baseline of 425 m (1,394ft) (meaning that it can synthesize a telescope with 425 m diameter), giving it a resolution of around 0.5 arcminutes. This telescope pair {{has been used to}} carry out survey work, and to determine the positions of faint radio objects. Also, one of the drivers behind the construction of the Mark III was to use it as an <b>interferometer</b> with the Mark I to carry out a survey of radio sources.|$|E
5|$|A Coudé {{focus was}} planned as a later addition, to feed an optical <b>interferometer</b> with another telescope, {{but this was}} never built. A {{chopping}} f/35 secondary mirror was planned for infrared observations, but was placed on hold by the cost-saving re-design and never implemented.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Classical {{single-mode}} fiber <b>interferometers,</b> using one fiber per aperture, have very limited imaging capabilities and small field of view.

A study with the Palomar Testbed <b>Interferometer</b> revealed that Altair is not spherical, but is flattened at the poles due to its high rate of rotation.

40|$|Photonic {{interference}} {{is a key}} quantum {{resource for}} optical quantum computation, and in particular for so-called boson sampling machines. In <b>interferometers</b> with certain symmetries, genuine multiphoton quantum interference effectively suppresses certain sets of events, as in the original Hong-Ou-Mandel effect. Recently, it was shown that some classical and semi-classical models could be ruled out by identifying such suppressions in Fourier <b>interferometers.</b> Here we propose a suppression law suitable for random-input experiments in multimode Sylvester <b>interferometers,</b> and verify it experimentally using 4 - and 8 -mode integrated <b>interferometers.</b> The observed suppression is stronger than what is observed in Fourier <b>interferometers</b> of the same size, and could be relevant to certification of boson sampling machines and other experiments relying on bosonic interference.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a class of}} proposed gravitational wave detectors based on multiple atomic <b>interferometers</b> separated by large baselines and referenced by common laser systems. We compute the sensitivity limits of these detectors due to intrinsic phase noise of the light sources, non-inertial motion of the light sources, and atomic shot noise and compare them to sensitivity limits for traditional light <b>interferometers.</b> We find that atom <b>interferometers</b> and light <b>interferometers</b> are limited in a nearly identical way by intrinsic phase noise and that both require similar mitigation strategies (e. g. multiple arm instruments) to reach interesting sensitivities. The sensitivity limit from motion of the light sources is slightly different and favors the atom <b>interferometers</b> in the low-frequency limit, although the limit in both cases is severe.

40|$|Fourier {{transform}} spectrometers {{developed in}} three distinct spectral {{regions in the}} early 1960 s. Pierre Connes and his coworkers in France developed remarkably sophisticated step-scan <b>interferometers</b> that permitted near-infrared spectra to be measured with a resolution of better than 0. 0 1 cm{sup {minus} 1 }. These instruments may be considered the forerunners of the step-scan <b>interferometers</b> made by Bruker, Bio-Rad (Cambridge, MA, USA) and Nicolet although their principal application was {{in the field of}} astronomy. Low-resolution rapid-scanning <b>interferometers</b> were developed by Larry Mertz and his colleagues at Block Engineering (Cambridge, MA, USA) for remote sensing. Nonetheless, the FT-IR spectrometers that are so prevalent in chemical laboratories today are direct descendants of these instruments. The <b>interferometers</b> that were developed for far-infrared spectrometry in Gebbie's laboratory,have had no commercial counterparts for at least 15 years. However, {{it could be argued that}} these instruments did as much to demonstrate the power of Fourier transform spectroscopy to the chemical community as any of the instruments developed for mid- and near-infrared spectrometry. Their performance was every bit as good as today's rapid-scanning <b>interferometers.</b> However, the market for these instruments is so small today that it has proved more lucrative to modify rapid-scanning <b>interferometers</b> that were originally designed for mid-infrared spectrometry than to compete with these instruments with slow continuous scan or step-scan <b>interferometers...</b>|$|R
