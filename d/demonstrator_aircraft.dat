5|$|With the {{prospect}} of no operational aircraft being available to fulfill the RAF's strike role, BAC decided to revamp the AFVG design, eliminating the carrier capabilities that were no longer necessary, into a larger, more strike-oriented variable geometry aircraft. Holding contracts were issued to BAC to support the project, which had been re-designated as the United Kingdom Variable Geometry (UKVG) aircraft. In November 1967, BAC issued a brochure on the UKVG proposal; various proposals would be issued to cover {{the use of multiple}} different engines. The quick production of a <b>demonstrator</b> <b>aircraft,</b> powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/MAN Turbo RB153 turbofan engines, was also mooted.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, British Aerospace (now BAE Systems) {{decided to}} pursue {{development}} of a combat-orientated variant of the Hawk aircraft, designated as Hawk 200; {{up to this point}} the Hawk family had been typically employed by operators as an advanced trainer with secondary combat capabilities.

The RNAS also used Sopwith Tractor Biplanes for patrol duties from Great Yarmouth, one remaining in use until November 1915.|$|E
25|$|In May 1974, an {{airworthiness}} certificate for the Corvette was awarded by French authorities. However, deliveries were delayed until early 1974, partially {{as a result}} of industrial action at engine manufacturer United Aircraft of Canada. In response to the lack of deliveries, Air Center Inc. sued Aérospatiale for non-performance, having only received a single non-certified <b>demonstrator</b> <b>aircraft</b> out of a contracted fleet of 70 production Corvettes which had been due to be delivered by May 1974. Ultimately, only six new Corvettes would be dispatched to Oklahoma, {{and there would be no}} sales of the type during or after 1975; in March 1976, the U.S. marketing programme was terminated by Aérospatiale.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the EC135 Active Control Technology demonstrator/Flying Helicopter Simulator (ACT/FHS), a {{research}} aircraft designed to test fibre optic-based flight control systems, undertook its first flight.

25|$|The Armed Scout 645 (EC645) was a {{proposed}} armed {{version of the}} UH-72 for the US Army's Armed Aerial Scout (AAS) program for an OH-58D replacement. On 4 May 2009, EADS and Lockheed Martin announced a teaming agreement for the 645. Three <b>demonstrator</b> AAS-72X <b>aircraft</b> were built and began flight testing in late 2010. In September 2012, EADS began voluntary flight demonstrations of both an AAS-72X and an EC145 T2 at high altitudes, reportedly meeting with performance requirements. Two versions were offered: the AAS-72X, an armed version of the UH-72; and the AAS-72X+, an armed militarized version of the EC-145T2. In late 2013, the US Army announced the termination of the AAS program.|$|R
25|$|The program {{aimed at}} {{producing}} a technology <b>demonstrator</b> <b>aircraft</b> to explore the various challenges which the radical design entails. The proposed aircraft would be a purely flying wing (an aircraft with no other auxiliary surfaces such as tails, canards or a fuselage) where the wing is swept with {{one side of the}} aircraft forward, and one backwards in an asymmetric fashion. This aircraft configuration is believed to give it a combination of high speed, long range and long endurance. The program entailed two phases. Phase I explored the theory and result in a conceptual design, while Phase II would have resulted in the design, manufacture and flight test of an aircraft. The outcome of the program would have resulted in a dataset that could then be used when considering future military aircraft designs.|$|E

500|$|Based on the Have Blue <b>demonstrators,</b> Senior Trend <b>aircraft</b> were {{different}} from their predecessors in several aspects. The wings exhibited less sweep to resolve a center-of-gravity problem discovered during tests. The front fuselage was shortened to give the pilot a better view.

Additionally, provisions were made to include two weapons bays, each of which would accommodate a single [...] laser-guided bomb, or the B61 tactical nuclear bomb.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the hybrid {{supervisory}} control architecture developed by Famularo et al. (2011) for constrained control systems is adopted {{with the aim}} to improve safety in aircraft operations when critical events like command saturations or unpredicted anomalies occur. The capabilities of a low-computational demanding predictive scheme for the supervision of non-linear dynamical systems subject to sudden switchings amongst operating conditions and time-varying constraints are exploited in the flight control systems framework. The strategy is based on command governor ideas and is tailored to jointly take into account time-varying set-points/constraints. Unpredictable anomalies in the nominal plant behaviour, whose models fall {{in the category of}} time-varying constraints, can also be tolerated by the control scheme. In order to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, simulations both on a high altitude performance <b>demonstrator</b> unmanned <b>aircraft</b> with redundant control surfaces and the P 92 general aviation aircraft are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} impact {{experiments}} are conducted, to characterize a first high-speed gas gun projectile launcher. Tests with carbon composite sandwich shell material <b>demonstrators,</b> for <b>aircraft</b> fuselages are performed with typical projectiles (steel and ice) at impact velocities {{of up to}} 250 m/s. The specimens are subjected to non-destructive testing following the impact events. First impact tests are conducted with a new gas gun system with three barrels, having calibers of 25, 60 and 200 mm, respectively. A novel device, the instrumented impact test rig, which records dynamic forces during an impact, is mounted on the largest caliber barrel. A finite element model of this device is generated and numerical simulations are conducted using steel and rubber projectiles. These projectiles have masses of up to 1. 5 kg and impact velocities reach 250 km/h. The simulations with the numerical model focus on the core element of dynamic force measurements, the Hopkinson bar. The measurement techniques used {{are based on the}} propagation of elastic longitudinal tension waves within the rod...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{an effort}} to improve emissions, noise, and {{performance}} of next generation aircraft, it is expected that future aircraft will use distributed, multi-objective control effectors in a closed-loop flight control system.
