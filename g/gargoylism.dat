50|$|Hurler syndrome, {{also known}} as {{mucopolysaccharidosis}} type I (MPS I), Hurler's disease, also <b>gargoylism,</b> is a genetic disorder that results in the buildup of glycosaminoglycans (formerly known as mucopolysaccharides) due to a deficiency of alpha-L iduronidase, an enzyme responsible for the degradation of mucopolysaccharides in lysosomes. Without this enzyme, a buildup of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate occurs in the body. Symptoms appear during childhood and early death can occur due to organ damage.|$|E
40|$|The sugars {{present in}} hydrolyzed {{extracts}} of human liver and brain {{were analyzed by}} gasliquid chromatography after conversion to their alditol acetates. The samples analyzed were obtained from control subjects, patients with <b>gargoylism,</b> and patients with a few other kinds of storage disorders. Accumulation of galactose was demonstrated in the liver and the brain of two patients with <b>gargoylism,</b> and in the liver samples, high levels of mannose were found too. We also studied the hydrolysis {{of a number of}} galactosides by homogenates from different tissues in the control subjects and in the patients. Separation methods and kinetic studies demonstrated the presence in normal human tissues of two different β-galactosidases, which we call enzyme A and enzyme B, respectively. Enzyme A hydrolyzed all the β-galactosides tested. Enzyme B hydrolyzed the synthetic substrates tested (4 -methylumbelliferyl-, p-nitrophenyl-, o-nitrophenyl-, and phenyl-β-galactoside) but not the natural substrates tested (ceramide-β-galactoside, ceramide lactoside, transferrin glycopeptide, and keratan sulfate). Enzyme B also exerted β-glucosidase activity. In various tissues from patients with <b>gargoylism,</b> deficiency of β-galactosidase A could be demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|Thompson, the Scottish {{physician}} who {{did so much}} for the advancement of the study of children's diseases, first described the condition of <b>gargoylism</b> in 1900. His cases were not published until much later (Henderson and Ellis, 1940) and the first recorded description was by Hunter in 1917. Two years later Gertrude Hurler gave an account that appeared in America as Hurler's syndrome. Later Ellis et al. (1936) described further examples and gave it the name of <b>gargoylism</b> because of the particularly ugly appearance of the well-marked case. Other names for the condition, such as dysostosis multiplex and lipochondrodystrophy have no special extra advantage, the latter being possibly misleading as it is controversial whether it should be regarded any longer as a disorder of lipoid metabolism. The term <b>gargoylism,</b> though picturesque and memorable, is rather a wounding one, especially when applied to the formes frustes which show a more normal appearance. It is hoped that in the future the condition will more and more be referred to as Hunter's polydystrophy. The disease has a genetic origin and two distinct types have been described, one due to a single autosomal recessive gene, the other occurring in males only without corneal involvement and due to a sex-linked recessive gene.

Possible mechanisms for the formation of these swellings are briefly discussed. <b>Gargoylism</b> is one form of generalized neuronal storage disorder. The term gargoyle was sug-gested by Ellis et al (1936) to describe the gro-tesque facial appearance associated with this abnormality. Since then other forms of the dis-order have been described, presenting less dis-tinctive clinical appearances but nevertheless manifesting defective mucopolysaccharide meta-bolism, and it is now recognized that typical bio-chemical changes may be present without any appreciable alteration in the facial appearance. The rapid advances in biochemical knowledge which have been made in recent years have per-mitted further classification of the disorder, notably by Hoof and Hers (1968) into three variants and by McKusick (1969) into six variants, three of which are associated with severe mental subnormality. This emphasis on the biochemical changes has led to relative neglect of the morphological aspect, though Gree...|$|E

40|$|Extract: Liver biopsies {{from two}} {{children}} with Morquio’s disease were studied by electron microscopy. The diagnosis {{was based upon}} typical clinical findings and x-ray examination. Urinary excretion of keratosulfate was abnormally high in both cases. The Kupffer cells contained large relatively electron-lucid inclusions (0. 3 to 4. 3 μ in diameter) bounded by a single membrane and containing a finely arranged protein-like precipitate. These inclusions occasionally appeared as compact bodies (figs. 2 and 3). Membranous 'myelin-like' round bodies were infrequently seen in the vacuoles. Hepatocytes were usually normal, but some contained a few electron-lucid inclusions that resembled those seen in the Kupffer cells, although they were smaller in size (0. 4 to 1. 9 μ) (fig. 5). Peribiliary dense bodies were numerous and rarely contained myelin-like figures (fig. 4). In some atypical groups of cells, discontinuous limiting membranes were observed. These cells also contained electron-lucid vacuoles bounded by single membranes of varying sizes (0. 3 to 4. 0 μ) (fig. 6). The inclusions were {{very similar to those}} previously described in different forms of <b>gargoylism,</b> although the site was different. The rupture of some Kupffer and/or parenchymal cell membranes, secondary to technical manipulations, apparently caused the peculiar aspect of the atypical groups of cells. Speculation: This study supplies new evidence linking Morquio’s disease and <b>gargoylism.</b> Some pathogenic mechanisms appear to be similar in these diseases, both of which affect mucopolysaccharides of the liver in a similar way. © International Pediatrics Research Foundation, Inc. 1969.

40|$|The first {{clinical}} {{description of}} this syndrome by Hunter (1917) was quickly followed {{by that of}} Hurler (1919). Later, Ellis, Sheldon, and Capon (1936) coined the name " <b>gargoylism</b> " because of the cephalic, facial, and thoracic grotesqueness reminiscent of the figures on the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. The fundamental defect, as stated by Jackson (1951), is twofold, namely, a chondro-osseous dystrophy together with the storage of an abnormal macro-molecular substance. Involvement of the skull, spine, ribs, and long bones, storage deposition in the reticulo-endothelial system and in widespread parenchymatous and connective tissue, lead to the clinical picture most characteristic of <b>gargoylism.</b> Since this picture {{is important in the}} diagnosis of cases by inference, it will be briefly described here. Most authors agree that the head is enlarged with well marked supra-orbital ridges, a squat nose with depressed bridge, thick lips, strong teeth, a large tongue, apparently low-set ears, and a short neck. The eyes {{may or may not have}} corneal opacities. The hair is thick, especially on the scalp and eye-brows. The lower part of the thorax tends to flare and the spine is kyphotic. The abdomen appears large and is often herniated. There is hepato-splenomegaly but sometimes the liver, alone, is palpable. The genitalia are infantile in type. The long bones are stunted, with a variety of orthopaedic defects, the most noticeable of which is restriction of extension at the joints, particularly the fingers, elbows, and knees. A predisposition to infections of the respiratory tract is a noteworthy feature. The mode of genetic inheritance is a matter of controversy, and some pedigrees indicate that a single, recessive, autosomal gene is responsible, whereas others implicate a gene which is a sex-linked recessive.

40|$|METHOD for {{collection}} of urine from infants onto squares of filter paper {{was described as}} part of a program for early detection of phenylketonuria (1). These urine papers have proved extremely versatile as an aid to testing urine for a number of substances that are excreted as a result of certain metabolic defects, all easily detect-able by simple means. Phenylpyruvic acid, phenylalanine, and o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid are excretory products characteristic of phenylketonuria (2, 3). A reducing sugar, galactose, is a significant finding in urine of patients with galactose disease (4). Sucrose has been reported in urine of several mentally retarded children (5) -apparently the result of a defect in the enzyamtic system responsible for hydrolysis of the disaccharide.

40|$|Among {{the many}} new {{diseases}} {{which have been}} described during the present century, there are a remarkable number of disea§es of the osseous system. In some instances {{this is due to}} the necessity of x-ray examination and biochemical investigation for their diagnosis, but in others, such as osteopetrosis (Albers-Schonberg disease), osteochondrodystrophy (Morquio's disease), <b>gargoylism</b> (dysostosis multiplex), and hypertelorism, these aids were not essential, and it is perhaps surprising that the conditions escaped recognition until relatively late. The rarity of the conditions and the reluctance of writers of textbooks to list them as distinct diseases will also have militated against their general recognition. In the case of fenestrae parietales symmetricae both causes have been operative. Probably this heredo-familial condition occurs more frequently than is generally supposed, but has received little attention. It is, however, entirely comparable to such a disease as cleidocranial dysostosis, which is widely known, not from personal experience but from its established place in textbooks.

40|$|Hurler's {{syndrome}} (<b>gargoylism)</b> {{is a rare}} {{inborn error}} of mucopolysaccharide metabolism which results in an accumulation of mucopolysaccharides in various tissues of the body (1 - 3).

40|$|BackgroundGeleophysic {{dysplasia}} is {{an extremely}} rare autosomal recessive acromelic skeletal dysplasia characterized by short stature and short limbs, joint contracture and cardiac involvement. It has been described worldwide in less than 40 patients. We describe the cardiac involvement in three girls of a Saudi family who showed different severity of the cardiac involvement. Clinical descriptionThree sisters referred from general pediatrics over a period 5 years, because of dysmorphic features and heart murmur. The parents are first degree cousins, they have a boy who is now 3 years old and is quite normal in regard of his growth and development. The older sister is 8 years old, the next is six years, {{and the third is}} two years old. All three girls were born full term spontanous delivery and had history of respiratory problems with frequent hospital admissions. They are all short for their ages (less than 3 rd centile). Furthermore they share dysmorphic features in a form of small hands and feet, hypertelorism, depressed nasal bridge and anteverted narse. They all have contracture at both elbows and knees with inability to flex all to full range of flexion. They are happy and very friendly children, mentally normal and seem to be intellectually appropriate for their age. Genetic studies were done which confirmed the heterogenicity of the ADAMTSL 2 gene in the older child. The three girls have associated cardiac lesions with different expression. The older has a mild pulmonary and aortic valve stenosis, the second has thicking of mitral valve and the youngest moderate to severe aortic and pulmonary valve stenosis. DiscussionGeleophysics dysplasia (GD) has been described in 1960 as a form of atypical <b>gargoylism</b> by Vanace et al. and described by Spranger et al 1971 as a focal mucopolysacchriodosis. The disease is now considered as a severe form of acromelic skeletal dysplasia which is a rare form of dysplasia including three disorders: geleophysic dysplasia, Weill-Marchesani and acromicric dysplasia. Up to date there are less than 40 reported cases with GD. All of these patients have a combination of cardiac valve involvement. The most frequent cardiac lesions described being the mitral valve, then the aortic valve followed by pulmonary valve and the least is tricuspid valve. Spranger described one girl with atrial septal defect(ASD) and patent arterial duct (PDA) without valvular involvement. Pontz and Santolaya seperately described 5 cases with normal cardiac structure. Until todate there is a believe that the valve involvement show progression over time. ConclusionsThere are very few case reports describing the cardiac involvement in this condition but none is from the Middle East. Almost most of the cardiac conditions affect the cardiac valves in a form of thickening leading to stenosis in {{one or more of the}} cardiac valves. Most of the cases suggest progression of the disease. In our three cases the younger has the most severe form of valve involvement. This suggests that the expression of the gene could determine the severity of the disease, rather than the suggested progression with age...|$|E
