5|$|A {{charter of}} 799 records a wife of Coenwulf named Cynegyth; the charter is forged, but this detail is {{possibly}} accurate. Ælfthryth is more reliably established as Coenwulf's wife, again from charter evidence; she is recorded on charters dated between 804 and 817. Coenwulf's daughter, Cwoenthryth, survived him and inherited the monastery at Winchcombe which Coenwulf had established {{as part of}} the patrimony of his family. Cwoenthryth subsequently was engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> dispute with Archbishop Wulfred over her rights to the monastery. Coenwulf also had a son, Cynehelm, who later became known as a saint, with a cult dating from at least the 970s.

5|$|Cinematographer Russell Boyd largely {{utilized}} available {{light to}} give the movie a natural feel, which Beresford said was crucial to its sense of authenticity.

Beresford and Boyd filmed the scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> take and long shot so it could flow uninterrupted, with the lonely Texas landscape captured in the background. When studio executives received the footage, they contacted Beresford and requested close-up shots be intercut, but he insisted on keeping the long take intact.
