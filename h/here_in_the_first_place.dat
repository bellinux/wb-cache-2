6000|$|...

"I am very glad," [...] he said, looking {{about him}} at the company, and then glancing with a {{friendly}} air towards the two guides, who stood a little back of Mr. Archibald, [...] "to have this opportunity to explain my appearance <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> I {{must tell you that}} I am a bishop whose diocese has been inundated, and who consequently has been obliged to leave it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, but he's dashed {{sorry about}} all that now. Wishes {{he had never been}} such a mug, and all that sort of thing. As a matter of fact, that's why I shot over <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place.</b> As an ambassador, don't you know. I told Jill all about it {{directly}} I saw her, but she seemed inclined to give it a miss rather, so I cabled old Derek to pop here in person. Seemed to me, don't you know, that Jill might be more likely to make it up and all that if she saw old Derek." ...|$|E

"As to what I {{have done}} for you, so far as I see I have done nothing beyond {{bringing}} you <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> and coming to have a pleasant chat with you every evening. Nor, with the best will in the world, have I been able {{to be of the}} slightest assistance to Marie.

We have thrown in our lot together, and we shall swim or sink in company.|$|E

6000|$|... “You {{had better}} leave your pistols here, Master Steve, {{and take your}} cutlass. A pistol-shot now would bring the whole village down on us, {{and we should have}} no chance of getting through the swamp with a hundred of those fellows after us. You had better draw your sword, and leave the {{scabbard}} and belt <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> it is handier to have the sword ready; and it is not so likely to knock against anything when you have got it in your hand as it would be trailing behind you as you crawl along.

6000|$|... "It {{has been}} useful work, Zaki, and I {{consider}} myself very fortunate in being so constantly employed. I was desperately afraid that Colonel Wingate would leave me there, and I was greatly relieved {{when he told}} me that I was to come with him. It is a fortunate thing that we have beaten our old enemy, Fadil, <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> because, if the three or four thousand men he had with him had joined the Khalifa, it would have given us harder work in tomorrow's fight; and in the next place his arrival, with his followers who have escaped, at the Khalifa's camp, is not likely to inspirit the Dervishes there." ...|$|E
6000|$|Query 1. The first query that I propounded is, If thou sayest {{that every}} man hath {{a measure of}} the Spirit of Christ within him, why say the scriptures, [...] "Some are sensual, having not the Spirit." [...] And when Christ telleth his disciples, of sending them the Spirit, he saith, the world cannot receive it. <b>Here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> thou hast not only {{answered}} deceitfully, but hast also corrupted my words in laying down the query, in that thou didst leave out some words, for thou didst lay it down thus: [...] "If thou sayest that every man hath {{a measure of the}} Sprit of Christ within him, why say the scriptures, some are sensual, having not the Spirit:" [...] and Christ saith, [...] "The world cannot receive it."

6000|$|... (1.) <b>Here,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> we {{perceive}} love, {{in that the}} human nature, the nature of man, not of angels, is taken into union with God. Who so could consider this, as {{it is possible for}} it to be considered, would stand amazed till he died with wonder. By this very act of the heavenly wisdom, we have an inconceivable pledge of the love of Christ to man: for in that he hath taken into union with himself our nature, what doth it signify, but that he intendeth to take into union with himself our person. For, for this very purpose did he assume our nature. Wherefore we read that in the flesh he took upon him, in that flesh, he died for us, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God (1 Peter 3:18).|$|E

He has sent him <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place</b> to assure you fully of the prince's intentions on your behalf. He will especially represent the prince during the siege, and from his knowledge of the methods of defence at Haarlem, of the arrangements for portioning out the food and other matters, {{he will be able to}} give you valuable advice and assistance. As you are aware, I ride in an hour to Enkhuizen in order to superintend the general arrangement for the defence of the province, and especially for affording you aid, and I am glad to leave behind me an officer who is so completely in the confidence of the prince. He will first deliver the messages with which he is charged to you, and then we will hear what he says as to this matter which is in dispute between us." ...|$|E

It is a fine city Lima, and I {{hope that it will}} not be very long before we shall be able to enjoy it without the presence of the Spaniards; we think they cannot remain here much longer. If the Chilian army would but move from the sea-coast the whole country would be up in arms. We would rather have done without the Chilians if we could, for there has never been any great friendship between them and the Peruvians. I do not say between them and us, for I am almost as much Chilian as Peruvian, seeing that I was born within half a mile of the frontier and high up in the hills. But there is more money to be made <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> the Peruvians have more towns beyond the passes, and there is more traffic; and in the next place, in Chili most men are ready to work if there is money to be made, whereas most of the Peruvians are too lazy to pick up gold if it lay at their feet. Most men in our business come from the hills.” ...|$|E

"I sha'n't {{be sorry}} for that, Harry; {{certainly}} {{not as long}} as I am out <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>place,</b> he is really a very handy fellow, and ready to make himself useful, in any way; then {{there is no doubt that}} he is greatly attached to me, and would go through fire and water for me. A man of that sort is invaluable to anyone knocking about as I shall be, when the war is over and I take up trading again. His only fault is that he is really too anxious to do things for me. Of course, when I am on duty there is nothing much he can do; but if I am sitting in a room, he will squat for hours in the corner and watch me. If my cheroot gets low, there he is with a fresh one and a light, in a moment. If I drop my handkerchief, or a pen, there he is with it, before I have time to stoop. Sometimes I have really to invent errands to send him on, so as to give him something to do for me. I own that I have not contemplated what position he would occupy, if I go trading; but I quite recognize that he will go with me, and that he would become a portion of my establishment, even if that establishment consisted only of himself.|$|E
