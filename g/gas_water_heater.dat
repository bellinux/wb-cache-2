We propose a wireless and batteryless intelligent CO sensor for improving the safety of operating natural <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters.</b> A micro-hydropower generator supplies power to a CO sensor without battery (COSWOB) (2. 5 W at a flow rate of 4. 2 L/min), and the power consumption of the COSWOB is only ~ 13 mW. The COSWOB monitors the CO concentration in ambient conditions around natural <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> and transmits it to an intelligent gateway. When the CO level reaches a dangerous level, the COSWOB alarm sounds loudly.

40|$|Heat pump {{water heaters}} (HPWHs) have {{recently}} reemerged in the U. S. residential water heating market {{and have the}} potential to provide homeowners with significant energy savings. However, there are questions as to the actual performance and energy savings potential of these units, in particular in regards to the heat pump's performance in unconditioned space and the impact of the heat pump on space heating and cooling loads when it is located in conditioned space. To help answer these questions, simulations were performed of a HPWH in both conditioned and unconditioned space at over 900 locations across the continental United States and Hawaii. Simulations included a Building America benchmark home so that any interaction between the HPWH and the home's HVAC equipment could be captured. Comparisons were performed to typical gas and electric water heaters to determine the energy savings potential and cost effectiveness of a HPWH relative to these technologies. HPWHs were found to have a significant source energy savings potential when replacing typical electric water heaters, but only saved source energy relative to <b>gas</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> in the most favorable installation locations in the southern US. When replacing an electric water heater, the HPWH is likely to break even in California, the southern US, and parts of the northeast in most situations.

Emission of fuel-rich flame is CO whereas emission of fuel-lean is NOx, and fuel rich-lean ratio {{is the most important}} factor for NOx and CO emission. If fuel-rich flame α 1 is changed with constant fuel-lean flame α 2, NOx emission decreases and CO emission increases evidently. If α 2 is changed with constant α 1, NOx decreases slightly and CO increases initially and then decreases. Depressing fuel-lean flame can strengthen excess O 2 diffusion to fuel-rich flame, and then reduces NOx and CO emissions...|$|R
