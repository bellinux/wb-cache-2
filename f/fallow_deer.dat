5|$|Herds {{of red and}} <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> also roam freely within much of Richmond and Bushy Park. A cull {{takes place}} each November and February to ensure numbers can be sustained. Epping Forest is also known for its <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> which can {{frequently}} be seen in herds {{to the north of}} the Forest. A rare population of melanistic, black <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> is also maintained at the Deer Sanctuary near Theydon Bois. Muntjac deer, which escaped from deer parks at the turn of the twentieth century, are also found in the forest. While Londoners are accustomed to wildlife such as birds and foxes sharing the city, more recently urban deer have started becoming a regular feature, and whole herds of fallow and white-tailed deer come into residential areas at night to take advantage of London's green spaces.|$|E
5|$|Between 1833 and 1842 the Petersham Lodge estate, {{and then}} part of Sudbrook Park, were {{incorporated}} into Richmond Park. Terrace Walk was created from Richmond Gate to Pembroke Lodge. The Russell School was built near Petersham Gate in 1851. Between 1855 and 1861, new drainage improvements were constructed, including drinking points for deer. In 1867 and 1876 <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> from the park were sent to New Zealand to help build up stocks – the first <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> introduced to that country In or around 1870, the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers were using an area near Bog Gate as a drill ground. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Italian general and politician, visited Lord John Russell at Pembroke Lodge in 1864, as did the Shah of Persia, Naser al-Din Shah Qajar in 1873. He was the first modern Iranian monarch to visit Europe.|$|E

He established a winding path, known as Capability Brown path, through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. The deer park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and <b>fallow</b> <b>deer.</b> A small garden behind the house, overlooking the deer park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory.

5|$|In Eurasia, many {{gray wolf}} populations {{are forced to}} subsist largely on {{livestock}} and garbage in areas with dense human activity, though wild ungulates such as moose, red deer, roe deer and wild boar are still the most important food sources in Russia and the more mountainous regions of Eastern Europe. Other prey species include reindeer, argali, mouflon, wisent, saiga, ibex, chamois, wild goats, <b>fallow</b> <b>deer</b> and musk deer. The prey animals of North American wolves have largely continued to occupy suitable habitats with low human density, and cases of wolves subsisting largely on garbage or livestock are exceptional. Animals preferred as prey by North American wolves include moose, white-tailed deer, elk, mule deer, bighorn sheep, Dall's sheep, American bison, muskox and caribou.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four hyenas killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted hyenas primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted hyenas are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for hyenas, especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted hyenas may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted hyenas attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E
5|$|The main food staples in {{the diet}} of the lower classes {{remained}} rice, pork, and salted fish.

They could choose {{from a wide variety}} of meats and seafood, including shrimp, geese, duck, mussel, shellfish, <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> hare, partridge, pheasant, francolin, quail, fox, badger, clam, crab, and many others. Dairy products were rare in Chinese cuisine at this time. Beef was rarely consumed since the bull was a valuable draft animal, and dog meat was absent from the diet of the wealthy, although the poor could choose to eat dog meat if necessary (yet it was not part of their regular diet). People also consumed dates, raisins, jujubes, pears, plums, apricots, pear juice, lychee-fruit juice, honey and ginger drinks, pawpaw juice, spices and seasonings of Sichuan pepper, ginger, soy sauce, oil, sesame oil, salt, and vinegar.|$|E
5|$|In 1603, {{he painted}} a double {{portrait}}, {{now in the}} Metropolitan Museum, New York, of the prince and his boyhood friend John Harington, son of Lord Harington of Exton (see above). The double portrait is set outdoors, a style introduced by Gheeraerts in the 1590s, and Peake's combination of figures with animals and landscape also foreshadows the genre of the sporting picture. The country location and recreational subject lend the painting an air of informality. The action is natural to the setting, a fenced deer-park with a castle and town in the distance. Harington holds a wounded stag by the antlers as Henry draws his sword to deliver the coup de grâce. The prince wears at his belt a jewel of St George slaying the dragon, an allusion to his role as defender of the realm. His sword is an attribute of kingship, and the young noble kneels in his service.• Strong English Icon, 234. The stag is a <b>fallow</b> <b>deer,</b> a non-native species kept {{at that time in}} royal parks for hunting. A variant of this painting in the Royal Collection, painted c. 1605, features Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, in the place of John Harington and displays the Devereux arms.|$|E

40|$|Fasioloides magna is a {{trematode}} parasitizing in {{the liver}} parenchyma of ruminants. Its life cycle {{is associated with the}} humid environment and includes intermediate freshwater snail hosts from family Lymnaeidae. According to the ability of host to form a certain type of a pseudocyst during fascioloidosis, they can be,divided in three groups, specific definitive hosts (red <b>deers,</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deers,</b> roe deers), nonspecific definitive hosts (cattle, wild boars and elks) and atypical hosts (sheeps and goats). Beside the natural infections also the experimental infections of other potential host species has been realized (chamois, llama and bighorn sheep and traditional laboratory animals such as mice, guinea pigs, rats and rabbits). In the context of different diseases, many changes in infected organism can occur. These can be qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Similarly, during fascioloidosis the changes associated with the presence of the parasite in the host's body is possible to monitor, e. g. antibody production, {{increase in the number of}} eosinophils, release of eggs in faeces, internal bleeding, or the level liver damage.

50|$|While {{the use of}} {{multiple}} release sites for reintroducing captive-bred deer into the wild could improve the outlook of reintroduction by reducing competition among the individuals of the reintroduced species, several risks are associated with multiple sites of release, including the increased monetary cost of the reintroduction project, the reduced genetic diversity of the subpopulations, and the Allee effect, which involves a reduced proliferation rate in small populations. Data from the Persian <b>fallow</b> <b>deer’s</b> reintroduction, including the reproduction rates, survival rates, and movement patterns of released individuals, were used for simulations that compared whether the use {{of multiple}} release sites would {{have an effect on the}} survivorship and growth of a reintroduced population. The results of computer simulations comparing the use of one to nine release sites suggested, while two sites were significantly better than one with regards to the survivorship of the reintroduced species, any additional sites did not greatly improve the outlook of the species. The optimal distance between release sites was determined to be about 11 km, allowing the sites to be separated enough to reduce intraspecific competition immediately after release, yet close enough to allow the subpopulations to merge once they had begun to proliferate.|$|R
40|$|Wildlife {{parasitic}} diseases represent an important field of investigation {{as they may}} {{have a significant impact on}} wild animals’ health and fitness, and may also have zoonotic implications. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of endoparasites in wild mammals admitted to wildlife hospitals and rehabilitation centres in Greece. Sixty-five animals belonging to 17 species and originated from various areas of continental and insular Greece were included in the survey. The most numerous animal species examined were hedgehogs (n[*]=[*] 19), red foxes (n[*]=[*] 16), and European roe deer (n[*]=[*] 6). Faecal samples were collected individually and examined by floatation and sedimentation method. Parasites were found in 46 (70. 7 %) of the animals. Most parasites found in canids, felids, and ruminants are of great relevance to the domestic animals’ health and some of them are also of zoonotic importance. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the first report of endoparasites in hedgehogs, roe <b>deers,</b> <b>fallow</b> <b>deers,</b> badgers, and bats, and the first report of the pulmonary nematode Troglostrongylus brevior in a wild cat in Greece.
