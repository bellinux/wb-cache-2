40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of environmental, cost, and performance requirements on the design and management of automotive components through a case study involving instrument panels. To {{address the question of}} whether the environmental improvement of an instrument <b>panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> is highly constrained, a lifecycle inventory analysis is used to characterize the major environmental burdens associated with a generic IP defined from an average of three midsized vehicle models. A life-cycle cost analysis is also conducted to understand the market forces operating in the domains of the original equipment manufacturer; consumer; and end-of-life (EOL) vehicle managen. This study indicates that the existing set of environmental requirements, in conjunction with current cost drivers and the large set of manufacturing and use phase functional performance requirements, highly constrain opportunities for environmental improvement Specific improvement strategies-lightweighting, elimination of the painting operation, and reduction in material complexity-are examined in the context of existing system requirements. The near-term forecast for improvements is not optimistic.

40|$|The elder {{population}} is rising worldwide; in the US, {{no longer being}} able to drive is a significant marker of loss of independence. One of the approaches to helping elders drive more safely is to investigate the use of automotive user interface technology, and specifically, to explore the instrument <b>panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> display design to help attract and manage attention and make information easier to interpret. In this paper, we explore the premise that dashboard displays can be better designed to support elder drivers, their information needs, and their cognitive capabilities. We conducted a study to understand which display design features are critically linked to issues of divided attention and driving performance. We found that contrast of size and reduced clutter are instrumental in enhancing driving performance, particularly for the {{elder population}}. Surprisingly, our results showed that color elements {{have a negative effect}} on driving performance for elders, while color elements and fills slightly improve performance.

40|$|Non-fatal tibia {{and ankle}} {{injuries}} without proper {{protection from the}} restraint system has gotten wide attention from researchers. This study aimed to investigate occupant tibia and ankle injuries under realistic frontal impact environment that is rarely considered in previous experimental and simulant studies. An integrated occupant-vehicle model was established by coupling an isolated car cab model and a hybrid occupant model with a biofidelic pelvis-lower limb model, while its loading conditions were extracted from the realistic full-frontal impact test. A parametric study was implemented concerning instrument <b>panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> design and pedal intrusion/rotation parameters. The significant influences of the IP angle, pedal intrusion and pedal rotation on tibia axial force, tibia bending moment and ankle dorsiflexion angle are noted. By coupling their effects, a new evaluation index named CAIEI (Combined Ankle Injury Evaluation Index) is established to evaluate ankle injury (including tibia fractures in ankle region) risk and severity in robustness. Overall results and analysis indicate that ankle dorsiflexion angle should be considered when judging the injury in lower limb under frontal impact. Meanwhile, the current index with coupling effects of tibia axial force, bending moment and ankle dorsiflexion angle is in a good correlation with the simulation injury outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The project combined, {{for the first}} time, survey data from the Innovation <b>Panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> of Understanding Society (USoc) with new experimental data on risk preferences (the desire for taking a gamble) and time preferences (the {{degree to which the}} present is valued more than the future). It explored the links between individual risk and time preferences and behaviour, with a focus on health and wellbeing. A representative sample of about half the respondents within the IP took part into two experimental sessions, taking place at an interval of 12 months: IP wave 6 (IP 6) and IP wave 7 (IP 7). In each session, risk and time preferences were measured through experimental tests from behavioural economics involving real monetary stakes. Combined survey and experimental data have been used to empirically test three specific research questions related to the “validity” of experimental measures, namely: (1) to which extent the survey and the experimental measures relate to each other and capture the same underlying attitudes, (2) the links between risk and time preferences and health-related behaviour and (3) the stability over time of risk and time preferences and their response to events and life changes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{presents}} the automotive instrument <b>panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> design {{in order to}} improve the quality, cost, and safety of the existing design. A few conceptual designs were generated based on safety aspect and ergonomic design. The most suitable design was selected using concepts scoring. The IP head impact simulation was conducted using finite element analysis (FEA) to predict the head injury criterion (HIC) value of the front passenger in vehicle according to ECE-R 21 regulation. The finite element (FE) model, which consist of upper IP, lower IP, carrier structure and head-form, was built-up to carry out head impact analysis of the IP assembly. The optimum IP design was proposed by analysis of different materials, which are 20 % talc filled rubber modified polypropylene (PP+EPDM-TD 20), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer, and polypropylene (PP) copolymer. The HIC value for all IP was compared using simulation result and theoretical calculation. The lowest HIC value will reduce the head occupant injury. In this study, only the raw material cost was considered in cost evaluation. The IP from ABS polymer performed the lowest HIC value, which were 179. 7 but very costly compare to other materials...|$|R
40|$|An {{ergonomic}} {{evaluation of}} the Instrument <b>Panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> installation station at the Michigan Truck Plant of the Ford Motor Company provided justification for the design, build and installation of a novel ergonomic tool called, the Intelligent Assist Device (IAD). The evaluation involved the collection of pertinent historical injury data, videotaping tasks for analysis, performing a risk factor checklist review, examination of the existing and next generation IP, and collecting subjective assessments from operators. The information received from the risk factor checklist and subjective assessments were then compiled and correlated against previous injury location and prevalence. This comprehensive examination indicated both the desire and ergonomic evidence to initiate change at the IP install operation. The application of the Intelligent Assist Device at this location {{is an example of}} a technology-based solution which has effectively addressed and eliminated many inherent ergonomic issues associated with the original design.

40|$|Background :High field {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) provides higher lesion load measurements in patients presenting with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of demyelination and has impact upon the classification of these syndromes and potentially, the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Purpose :To investigate whether high field MRI can provide an earlier diagnosis of definite MS within the International <b>Panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> and Swanton criteria. Methods :Forty patients presenting with CIS suggestive of MS were included. All patients received multi-sequence MRI at 1. 5 Tesla (T) and 3 T {{as well as a}} neurological assessment at baseline. Follow-up visits including MRI at both field strengths and neurological examinations were scheduled 3 - 4 and 6 - 7 months after the first clinical event. Based on MRI and clinical findings, fulfilled IP criteria as well as Swanton criteria were analysed. Results :At baseline, the higher detection rate of inflammatory lesions using high field MRI leads to higher classifications according to the Swanton criteria in 15 % of the patients. One additional patient was diagnosed with dissemination in space according to Swanton and IP criteria. During follow-up, an earlier diagnosis of definite MS could not be accomplished, neither according to the IP nor to the Swanton criteria. Conclusion :Although high field MRI shows a higher detection rate of inflammatory brain lesion in CIS and MS patients with an influence according to MRI criteria, this influence does not lead to an earlier diagnosis of lesion dissemination in time and therefore definite MS. © 2008 Springer...|$|R
40|$|We {{conduct an}} “artefactual” field {{experiment}} to incorporate three different risk preferences measures within the Innovation <b>Panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> of the UK Household Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS). We randomly allocate to an experimental module a nationally {{representative sample of}} 661 adult respondents to the IP Wave 6 (IP 6). These subjects respond to the incentive-compatible tasks by Holt and Laury (2002) (HL), and by Binswanger (1980, 1981) and Eckel and Grossman (2008) (B-EG), and to the SOEP survey questions by Dohmen et al. (2011) for self-reported willingness to take risks in general (SOEP-G), in finance (SOEP-F), and in health (SOEP-H). One year later (IP 7) the same measures are repeated for 413 of these respondents. This design allows us to systematically test, for a UK representative sample, {{the validity of the}} three measures along three dimensions. First, we look at cross-validity by testing how responses at one point in time correlate across the three tasks, assuming a Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility function. Second, we look at temporal stability by comparing the responses across IP 6 and IP 7. Third, we look at external validity by considering a range of risky health and financial behaviors in the UKHLS. We have three main findings. First, concerning cross-validity, we find evidence that the different measures generally correlate and map into each other, although their associations are not perfect. Second, concerning temporal stability, there are significant and positive correlations of the B-EG, HL, and SOEP measures across IP 6 and IP 7.

40|$|Objectives: To {{define the}} extent of overall brain damage in {{patients}} with clinically isolated syndromes (CIS) suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) and to identify non-conventional magnetic resonance (MR) metrics predictive of evolution to definite MS. Methods: Brain conventional and magnetization transfer (MT) MRI scans were obtained from 208 CIS patients and 55 matched healthy controls, recruited in four centres. Patients were assessed clinically {{at the time of}} MRI acquisition and after a median period of 3. 1 years from disease onset. The following measures were derived: T 2, T 1 and gadolinium (Gd) - enhancing lesion volumes (LV), normalized brain volume (NBV), MTR histogram-derived quantities of the normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and grey matter (GM). Results: During the follow-up, 43 % of the patients converted to definite MS. At baseline, a significant inter-centre heterogeneity was detected for T 2 LV (p = 0. 003), T 1 LV (p = 0. 006), NBV (p < 0. 001) and MTR histogram-derived metrics (p < 0. 001). Pooled average MTR values differed between CIS patients and controls for NAWM (p = 0. 003) and GM (p = 0. 01). Gdactivity and positivity of International <b>Panel</b> (<b>IP)</b> criteria for disease dissemination in space (DIS), but not NAWM and GM MTR and NBV, were associated with evolution to definite MS. The final multivariable model retained only MRI IP criteria for DIS (p = 0. 05; HR = 1. 66, 95 % CI = 1. 00 - 2. 77) as an independent predictor of evolution to definite MS. Conclusions: Although irreversible tissue injury is present from the earliest clinical stages of MS, macroscopic focal lesions but not "diffuse" brain damage measured by MTR are associated to an increased risk of subsequent development of definite MS in CIS patients. © 2008 Steinkopff-Verlag...|$|R
