5|$|AMD chose a {{different}} direction, designing the less radical x86-64, a 64-bit extension {{to the existing}} x86 architecture, which Microsoft then supported, forcing Intel to introduce the same extensions in its own x86-based processors.

5|$|A {{junior and}} infant {{department}} opened in September 1997 after {{the closure of}} St Audrey's Convent school. St Audrey's was a feeder school, and its closure allowed the then headmaster, Robert Repper, to transfer most of the teaching staff to the new junior school. The junior and infant school <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> a preparatory school for the senior school. It was retitled as Magdalene House in 2005, {{a reference to a}} 17th-century scholarship which allowed two Wisbech Grammar School pupils to study at Magdalene College, Cambridge. There were 177 pupils registered in 2008, of whom 23 were in reception and the rest in years 1 to 6.|$|E

5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken {{the place of a}} surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact that}} both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s {{and early}} 1990s, Martin's novels had slowly {{earned him a}} {{reputation}} in science fiction circles, although he said to only have received a few fans' letters {{a year in the}} pre-internet days. The publication of A Game of Thrones caused Martin's following to grow, with fan sites springing up and a Trekkie-like society of followers evolving that meet regularly. Westeros.org, one of the main Ice and Fire fansites with about seventeen thousand registered members as of 2011, was established in 1999 by a Swedish-based fan of Cuban-American descent, Elio M. García, Jr., and his girlfriend; their involvement with Martin's work <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> semi-professional. The Brotherhood Without Banners, an unofficial fan club operating globally, was formed in 2001. Their founders and other longtime members are among Martin's good friends.|$|E
5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to impute to him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the Young Turk Revolution deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II {{and a series}} of wars plagued the ailing empire's capital. The last of these, World War I, {{resulted}} in the British, French, and Italian occupation of Constantinople. The Armenian population of the city was also affected by the deportation of Armenian intellectuals on 24 April 1915, in which leaders of the Armenian community were arrested and mostly killed as part of the Armenian Genocide. To commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide, 24 April <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> the day of remembrance. The final Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, was exiled in November 1922 by Atatürk; the following year, the occupation of Constantinople ended with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne and the recognition of the Republic of Turkey, declared by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.|$|E
5|$|The North End Halifax {{neighbourhood}} of Richmond {{bore the}} brunt of the explosion. In 1917, Richmond was considered a working-class neighbourhood and had few paved roads. After the explosion, the Halifax Relief Commission approached the reconstruction of Richmond as an opportunity to improve and modernize the city's North End. English town planner Thomas Adams and Montreal architectural firm Ross and Macdonald were recruited to design a new housing plan for Richmond. Adams, inspired by the Victorian garden city movement, aimed to provide public access to green spaces and to create a low-rise, low-density and multifunctional urban neighbourhood. The planners designed 326 large homes that each faced a tree-lined, paved boulevard. They specified that the homes be built with a new and innovative fireproof material, blocks of compressed cement called Hydrostone. The first of these homes was occupied by March 1919. Once finished, the Hydrostone neighbourhood consisted of homes, businesses and parks, which helped create a new sense of community in the North End of Halifax. It <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> an upscale neighbourhood and shopping district. In contrast, the equally poor and underdeveloped area of Africville was not included in reconstruction efforts.|$|E
5|$|Royal emblems {{depicting}} lions {{were first}} {{used by the}} Norman dynasty, later a formal and consistent English heraldry system emerged {{at the end of}} the 12th century. The earliest surviving representation of an escutcheon, or shield, displaying three lions is that on the Great Seal of King Richard I (1189-1199), which initially displayed one or two lions rampant, but in 1198 was permanently altered to depict three lions passant, perhaps representing Richard I's principal three positions as King of the English, Duke of the Normans, and Duke of the Aquitanians. In 1340, Edward III laid claim to the throne of France, and thus adopted the Royal arms of France which he quartered with his paternal arms, the Royal Arms of England. Significantly he placed the French arms in the 1st and 4th quarters of greatest honour, signifying the feudal superiority of France over England (The King of France was the feudal overlord of the Duke of Aquitaine). This quartering was adjusted, abandoned and restored intermittently throughout the Middle Ages as the relationship between England and France changed. When the French king altered his arms from semée of fleur-de-lys, to only three, the English quartering eventually followed suit. After the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland entered a personal union, the arms of England and Scotland were marshalled (combined) in what <b>has</b> <b>now</b> <b>become</b> the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. It appears in a similar capacity to represent England in the Arms of Canada and on the Queen's Personal Canadian Flag. The coat of three lions continues to represent England on several coins of the pound sterling, forms the basis of several emblems of English national sports teams (although with altered tinctures) and endures as one of the most recognisable national symbols of England.|$|E
