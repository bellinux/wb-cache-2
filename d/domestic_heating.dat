5|$|Since the 17th century, peat {{has been}} cut for fuel for <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> and cooking and it is called turf when so used. The process {{accelerated}} as commercial exploitation of bogs grew. In the 1940s, machines for cutting turf were introduced and larger-scale exploitation became possible. In the Republic, this became the responsibility of a semi-state company called Bord na Móna. In addition to domestic uses, commercially extracted turf is used {{in a number of}} industries, especially electricity generation though peat is being combined with biomass for dual-firing electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|The {{coal mining}} {{industry}} of the Rhondda was artificially buoyed {{throughout the war}} years, though there were expectations {{of a return to}} the pre-1939 industrial collapse {{after the end of the}} Second World War. There was a sense of salvation when the government announced the nationalisation of the British Coalmines in 1947; but the following decades saw a continual reduction in the output from the Rhondda mines. From 15,000 miners in 1947, Rhondda had just a single pit within the valleys producing coal in 1984, located at Maerdy. The decline in the mining of coal after World War II was a country wide issue, but South Wales and Rhondda were affected to a higher degree than other areas of Britain. Oil had superseded coal as the fuel of choice in many industries and there was political pressure influencing the supply of oil. Of the few industries that were still reliant on coal, the demand was for quality coals, especially coking coal which was required by the steel industry. Fifty percent of Glamorgan coal was now supplied to steelworks, with the second biggest market being <b>domestic</b> <b>heating,</b> which the 'smokeless' coal of the Rhondda became once again fashionable after the publication of the Clean Air Act. These two markets now controlled the fate of the mines in the Rhondda, and as demand fell from both sectors the knock-on effect on the mining industry was further contraction. In addition exports to other areas of Europe, traditionally France, Italy and the Low Countries, experienced a massive decline; from 33 per cent around the start of the 20th century to roughly 5 per cent by 1980.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—We {{consider}} {{a portfolio of}} <b>domestic</b> <b>heat</b> pumps controlled by an aggregator. The aggregator is able to adjust the consumption of the heat pumps without affecting the comfort in the houses and uses this ability to shift the main consumption to hours with low electricity prices.

A simulation is carried out {{based on data from}} a Danish <b>domestic</b> <b>heat</b> pump project, historical spot prices, regulating power prices, and spot price predictions.

At the same time, the expansion of road haulage reduced the demand for rail transportation of other bulk loads and the line closed completely between Edgware and Mill Hill East in 1964 with equipment and track removed by the following year.|$|E
25|$|Methane is {{important}} for electricity generation by burning it as a fuel in a gas turbine or steam generator. Compared to other hydrocarbon fuels, methane produces less carbon dioxide for each unit of heat released. At about 891 kJ/mol, methane's heat of combustion is lower than any other hydrocarbon but {{the ratio of the}} heat of combustion (891 kJ/mol) to the molecular mass (16.0 g/mol, of which 12.0 g/mol is carbon) shows that methane, being the simplest hydrocarbon, produces more heat per mass unit (55.7 kJ/g) than other complex hydrocarbons. In many cities, methane is piped into homes for <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> and cooking. In this context it is usually known as natural gas, which is considered to have an energy content of 39 megajoules per cubic meter, or 1,000 BTU per standard cubic foot.|$|E

BS 2869 Class C1 is the lightest grade used for lanterns, camping stoves, wick heaters, and mixed with {{gasoline}} in some vintage combustion engines {{as a substitute}} for tractor vaporising oil. BS 2869 Class C2 is a heavier distillate, which is used as <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> oil.

2500|$|In Ireland, {{large-scale}} {{domestic and}} industrial peat usage is widespread.

2500|$|Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) {{refers to}} a number of technologies, the {{objective}} of which is the large-scale removal of carbon dioxide [...] from the atmosphere. Among such technologies are bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, ocean fertilization, enhanced weathering, and direct air capture when combined with storage. CDR is a different approach than removing CO2 from the stack emissions of large fossil fuel point sources, such as power stations. The latter reduces emission to the atmosphere but cannot reduce the amount of carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. As CDR removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it creates negative emissions, offsetting emissions from small and dispersed point sources such as <b>domestic</b> <b>heating</b> systems, airplanes and vehicle exhausts. [...] It is regarded by some as a form of climate engineering, while other commentators describe it as a form of carbon capture and storage or extreme mitigation. Whether CDR would satisfy common definitions of [...] "climate engineering" [...] or [...] "geoengineering" [...] usually depends upon the scale on which it would be undertaken.|$|E

2500|$|Wood burning {{creates more}} {{atmospheric}} CO2 than biodegradation of wood {{in a forest}} (in a given period of time) because {{by the time the}} bark of a dead tree has rotted, the log has already been occupied by other plants and micro-organisms which continue to sequester the CO2 by integrating the hydrocarbons of the wood into their own life cycle. Wood harvesting and transport operations produce varying degrees of greenhouse gas pollution.

The model's output is kilogram of CO2 produced per Megawatt hour of delivered energy. Scenario 33 for example, which concerns the production of heat from wood chips produced from UK small roundwood produced from bringing neglected broadleaf forests back into production, shows that burning oil releases 377kg of CO2 while burning woodchip releases 1501kg of CO2 per MW h delivered energy.|$|E
