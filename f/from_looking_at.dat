5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} <b>from</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, {{and changes in the}} angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham {{was allowed}} back onto operations. He was given command of No. 85 Squadron RAF, {{equipped}} with the de Havilland Mosquito NF.II based at Hunsdon. He selected Jimmy Rawnsley as his operator. The radar set displayed the entire picture. A small cathode-ray tube set {{on the left side}} of the instrument panel gave Cunningham a composite image. The duo decided Rawnsley should control the interception in the initial stages until they reached a point where the enemy could take evasive action. Then Cunningham would take over while Rawnsley would call out the ranges and free the pilot <b>from</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> his ray-tube.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in {{electron}} configuration, unbiunium {{is not expected to}} behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the electron configuration 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected <b>from</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E

5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain <b>from</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to the retina, slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on the retina after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E

25|$|Each STR is polymorphic, but {{the number}} of alleles is very small. Typically each STR allele will be shared by around 5 - 20% of individuals.

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of its colonization, many of Pennsylvania’s settlers occupied the land not through acquiring the legal rights, but by building on any unclaimed land they found, or squatting. The squatters came to the Palmyra area between 1717 and 1740. Because the squatters had no official documents stating {{when they came to}} the land, it is difficult to precisely trace family migrations to and from the area. <b>From</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> what records do exist, and by the people still living in the Palmyra area, {{it is clear that the}} first settlers to live near Palmyra came from two distinct nationalities, the Scotch-Irish and the German Palatinates.|$|E

25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} have been keeping track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn <b>from</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.|$|E

Goodridge sent her portrait to Webster {{when he was a}} new widower, and, based on its miniature format, it was likely intended for his eyes alone. The American art critic John Updike suggests that the artist intended it to offer herself to Webster; he writes that the bared breasts appear to say [...] "We are yours for the taking, in all our ivory loveliness, with our tenderly stippled nipples".

Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis [...] "followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages: newspapers and journalism, books and advertising. In other words, <b>from</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a natural resource-based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information, and ultimately knowledge, was a commodity that circulated, had value, and empowered those who controlled it." ...|$|E
