5000|$|Cheyenne verbs take {{different}} object agreement endings <b>depending</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> animacy of {{the subject}} and the transitivity of the verb itself. Intransitive verbs take endings <b>depending</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> animacy of their subject, whereas transitive verbs take endings that <b>depend</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> animacy of their object. All verbs can therefore be broadly categorized into one of four classes: Animate Intransitive (AI), Inanimate Instransitive (II), Transitive Animate (TA) and Transitive Inanimate (TI). [...] Following {{are the most common}} object agreement markers for each verb class.|$|R
60|$|It was {{the most}} {{critical}} time I had yet experienced in my career as a baseball manager. And {{there was more than}} the usual reason why I must pull the team out. A chance for a business deal <b>depended</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> good-will of the stockholders of the Worcester club. On the outskirts of the town was a little cottage that I wanted to buy, and this <b>depended</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> business deal.

5|$|The {{accounting}} basis {{applied to}} fiduciary funds <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> {{needs of a}} specific fund. If the trust involves a business-like operation, accrual basis accounting would be appropriate to show the fund's profitability. Accrual basis is also appropriate for trust funds using interest and dividends from invested principle amounts to pay for supported programs, because the profitability of those investments would be important.|$|E
5|$|The {{complexity}} of an appropriation <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> city council's preferences; real-world appropriations can list hundreds of line item amounts. An appropriation {{is the legal}} authority for spending given by the city council to the various agencies of the city government. In the example above, the city can {{spend as much as}} $34 million, but smaller appropriation limits have also been established for individual programs and departments.|$|E

5|$|According to Jain texts, {{the fruits}} of himsā (violence) <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> {{severity}} of passions {{at the time of}} commencement of such an act. One may be responsible for the sinful act of himsā without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not be responsible for the act. Also, when two persons commit the act of himsā jointly, its consequences on fruition (of karma), may be grave for one person and mild for the other.|$|E
5|$|Gregarious animals, {{hartebeest}} form {{herds of}} 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place {{throughout the year}} {{with one or two}} peaks, and <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} organisms, {{increasing}} ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation due to stratospheric ozone depletion {{and other factors}} may harm the DNA of amphibians, particularly their eggs. The amount of damage <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> life stage, the species type and other environmental parameters. Salamanders and frogs that produce less photolyase, an enzyme that counteracts DNA damage from UVB, {{are more susceptible to}} the effects of loss of the ozone layer. Exposure to ultraviolet radiation may not kill a particular species or life stage but may cause sublethal damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. This method of forecasting strongly <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, this method of forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects have a system of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E

5|$|For Steiner, all of offers, {{threats and}} throffers affect the {{practical}} deliberations of their recipient {{in the same}} way. What is significant for {{the subject of the}} intervention is not {{the extent to which the}} consequences of compliance or noncompliance differ in desirability from the norm, but the extent to which they differ in desirability from each other. Thus, an offer does not necessarily exert less influence on its recipient than a threat. The strength of the force exerted by an intervention <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> difference in desirability between compliance and noncompliance alone, regardless of the manner of the intervention.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an inspection system. The choice <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundant}} inorganic elements act as ionic electrolytes. The {{most important}} ions are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, phosphate and the organic ion bicarbonate. The maintenance of precise ion gradients across cell membranes maintains osmotic pressure and pH. Ions are also critical for nerve and muscle function, as action potentials in these tissues {{are produced by}} the exchange of electrolytes between the extracellular fluid and the cell's fluid, the cytosol. Electrolytes enter and leave cells through proteins in the cell membrane called ion channels. For example, muscle contraction <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> movement of calcium, sodium and potassium through ion channels in the cell membrane and T-tubules.|$|E

5|$|The actual {{benefit of}} the TRIM command <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> free user space on the SSD. If the user {{capacity}} on the SSD was 100GB and the user actually saved 95GB of data to the drive, any TRIM operation would not add more than 5GB of free space for garbage collection and wear leveling. In those situations, {{increasing the amount of}} over-provisioning by 5GB would allow the SSD to have more consistent performance because it would always have the additional 5GB of additional free space without having to wait for the TRIM command to come from the OS.|$|E
5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other remedial action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs <b>depends</b> <b>upon</b> <b>the</b> item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E
