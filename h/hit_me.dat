It's not a full-blown epilepsy attack, but more of a dizzy spell, sort of a blackout type. Only in the last 12 months has this been identified. Medication has fixed it up.|$|E

500|$|Claudia Mitchell and Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, {{authors of}} Girl Culture: Studying girl culture : a readers' guide (2008), noted {{the lyrics of}} the song [...] "gesture toward [...] longing {{for the return of}} an ex-boyfriend." [...] Spears said [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] is a song [...] "every girl can relate to. She regrets it. She wants him back." [...] The lyrics, however, caused {{controversy}} in the United States, because the line [...] "Hit me baby one more time" [...] supposedly has sadomasochistic connotations. As a response, the singer said the line [...] "doesn't mean physically <b>hit</b> <b>me.</b> [...] It means just give me a sign, basically. I think it's kind of funny that people would actually think that's what it meant." [...] Contemporary author Ben Shapiro deemed the song's lyrics as suggestive, mostly [...] "Oh baby, baby / The reason I breathe is you / Boy, you got me blinded / Oh pretty baby / There's nothing that I wouldn't do" [...] and [...] "When I'm not with you I lose my mind / Give me a sign / <b>Hit</b> <b>me</b> baby one more time".|$|E

[...] "No human being could have taken the punishment he got today." [...] Taylor described the contest in the locker room after the game, saying, [...] "I never took a worse beating on a football field. The Giants <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> hard, and then I hit the ground hard. I got it both ways. This was the toughest game I've ever played ... I just rammed it down their throats by letting my running do my talking. They couldn't rattle me ... I think Huff <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> with his elbow after a tackle. Anyway, I cut my tongue of all things." [...] Additionally, Taylor was playing while sick; two weeks later, he learned he had hepatitis, which contributed to his 15-pound weight loss prior to the game.|$|E

That's something great from a songwriter's perspective. I'm just trying to make hits and classic records that people can vibe to and live their life." [...] In an interview with BallerStatus, Songz commented on his thoughts of making a remix of the song, stating, [...] "I think there's going to be a remix for that song, because a lot of people dig it. A lot of people have <b>hit</b> <b>me</b> up actually about it. That song is blowing up real fast man." [...] He also stated the possibility of American rapper Nicki Minaj appearing on a remix, saying, [...] "She wanted to do more of a commercial record, a cuter sex record.

[...] However no remix was seen to be in the works nor did it come to fruition.|$|E
