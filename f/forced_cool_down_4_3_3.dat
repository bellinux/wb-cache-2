For perpendicular field, of defined sign, we can induce surface transitions from one twisted state to the other one. These observations can be explained by a simple polar model: the order electric polarization close to SiO is almost parallel to the substrate, since the molecular tilt is around the “magic” angle. Surface undulations create an anisotropic surface depolarizing field, which forces the polarization to rotate. We estimate a strong flexoelectric coefficient for 4 -n octyloxybenzoic acid e ∼+ 10 - 3  cgs.

Tests have been performed with a dipstick <b>cooling</b> <b>down</b> to <b>4</b> K. In the first period of this master thesis assignment, several possible designs were discussed with regard to the most performance dipstick unit which allows experiments to be performed at 20 mK level. However, during the study of several design options, a dipstick provision for cryogenic detector development was designed and manufactured by Leiden Cryogenics. As a consequence the assignment in SRON changed, and the second phase of this master thesis was to adapt the dipstick purchased by SRON to the TES requirements. To achieve the goals of the thesis it was first necessary to have the CAD models of the dipstick. The software used was Pro/Engineer wildfire 4. 0 and some visits to Leiden Cryogenics BV were done in order to finish the models of the dipstick and know exactly the operation of it.
