5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E

5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter {{the state as a}} tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E
5|$|As {{currently}} defined, the Atlantic {{hurricane season}} lasts from June1 to November30, {{the period in}} which tropical cyclones are most likely to develop across the basin. Occasionally, systems develop outside the season, most frequently in May or December. Activity in January is considered extremely rare, with only five other known instances since 1851: an unnamed hurricane in 1938, an unnamed tropical storm in 1951, Hurricane Alice in 1954–55, an unnamed storm in 1978, and Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005–06. Since Alice originated in December1954, Alex <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second hurricane to develop solely within January, after the 1938 storm. When Alex made landfall on Terceira as a strong tropical storm this marked only the second time that an Atlantic tropical cyclone has made landfall in January, with the other being Hurricane Alice of 1955 which made landfall on Saint Martin and Saba. In addition to forming well outside of hurricane season, Alex developed unusually far north and east, becoming only the second hurricane to form north of 30°N and east of 30°W.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{presided over}} the longest period of peacetime {{economic}} expansion in American history and signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of the Congress {{for the first time}} in 40 years. In 1996, Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to be elected to a second full term. Clinton passed welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000. In 1998, Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives for matters related to a scandal that involved White House employee Monica Lewinsky. Clinton was acquitted by the Senate in 1999 and proceeded to complete his term in office. Clinton <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second U.S. president to ever be impeached. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus, the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, and participated in the 2000 Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process.|$|E

Unlike the report of 918, on this {{occasion}} the title mormaer {{is attached to a}} geographical area, but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom. The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.|$|E

He {{is the youngest}} player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the youngest and fastest to win 50 tournaments on tour. Additionally, Woods <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> second golfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times.

5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which {{is comparable to}} the abundance of cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), but it is the 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
