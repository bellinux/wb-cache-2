5|$|Toshack's {{knee injury}} flared {{again in the}} Fourth Test at Headingley after England elected to bat. On the first morning, England opener Len Hutton edged Toshack through the slips and was then dropped on 25. Hutton {{eventually}} reached 81 as the opening pair put on 168. Toshack was wicketless as the hosts closed the <b>first</b> <b>day</b> <b>at</b> 2/268. The following morning, he {{was removed from the}} attack after night-watchman Bedser hit him for three consecutive fours. After the lunch break, Toshack bowled Jack Crapp with an inside-edged half volley for five to leave England at 5/447. Toshack ended with an ineffective 1/112 from 35 overs as England made 496. He was the most expensive and uneconomical of the frontline bowlers and it was his most uneconomical performance in the Tests. He aggravated his knee injury and was later taken to London for cartilage surgery, ending his bowling duties for the match and his Test career.|$|E
