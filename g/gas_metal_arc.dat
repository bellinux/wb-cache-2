5|$|To perform <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding, {{the basic}} {{necessary}} equipment is a welding gun, a wire feed unit, a welding power supply, a welding electrode wire, and a shielding gas supply.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding (GMAW) – {{commonly}} termed MIG (metal, inert gas), uses a wire feeding {{gun that}} feeds wire at an adjustable speed and flows an argon-based shielding gas or {{a mix of}} argon and carbon dioxide (CO2) over the weld puddle {{to protect it from}} atmospheric contamination.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{numerical}} model of time-dependent <b>gas</b> shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> is described, which {{was developed in}} order to make clear the kinetics of arc plasma together with metal transfer. It is possible to calculate and visualize time-dependent temperature and fluid flow field of argon shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> plasma with the grow-up and the subsequent detachment of the liquid metal drop at the wire tip. Numerical calculation shows that the arc shape in globular transfer abruptly changes at the moment of metal drop detachment. Whereas, the spray transfer arc seems to be stable and almost does not fluctuate with metal transfer...|$|R

50|$|AWS publishes codes on {{multiple}} aspects of welding and materials joining. The code books are assigned specific letters and numbers for easy reference, and many welders will {{refer to a}} specific code letter/number combination when referring to the code book. Different welding methodologies, inspection methods, and metals are published under different codes. For example, AWS B1.11 explains how to visually examine welds; AWS B2.1-1-004 explains welding carbon steel of thickness range of 18 through 10 gauge with semiautomatic <b>metal</b> <b>gas</b> <b>arc</b> welding; and AWS C2.20/C2.20M explains metalized zinc cathodic protection systems. Some codes also describe the standards used by AWS to certify welders, inspectors, and welding educators.

5|$|For some {{of these}} processes, the {{presence}} of nitrogen or oxygen gases might cause defects within the material. Argon is used in some types of arc welding such as <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding and gas tungsten arc welding, {{as well as in}} the processing of titanium and other reactive elements. An argon atmosphere is also used for growing crystals of silicon and germanium.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding (GMAW), {{also known}} as metal inert gas or MIG welding, is a {{semi-automatic}} or automatic process that uses a continuous wire feed as an electrode and an inert or semi-inert gas mixture to protect the weld from contamination.

5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding (GMAW), {{sometimes}} referred to by its subtypes metal inert gas (MIG) welding or metal active gas (MAG) welding, is a welding process in which an electric arc forms between a consumable wire electrode and the workpiece metal(s), which heats the workpiece metal(s), causing them to melt and join.|$|E

The paper examines business operational sector and size, technology currently in use, customer/supplier relationships, and technical knowledge levels, skills in use {{on the shop floor}} level, training, safety standards implementation and quality control aspects in the SMEs. The companies are evaluated on their use of Oxygen and Acetylene <b>gas</b> welding, Manual <b>Metal</b> <b>Arc</b> Welding (MMA), <b>Metal</b> Inert Gas Welding (MIG) and Tungsten Inert Gas Welding (TIG) for maintenance and productive purposes.

5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} {{applications}} <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding is {{a fairly}} simple welding process to learn requiring {{no more than a}} week or two to master basic welding technique. Even when welding is performed by well-trained operators weld quality can fluctuate since it depends on a number of external factors. All GMAW is dangerous, though perhaps less so than some other welding methods, such as shielded metal arc welding.|$|E
5|$|GTAW is most {{commonly}} used to weld thin sections of stainless steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum, magnesium, and copper alloys. The process grants the operator greater control over the weld than competing processes such as shielded metal arc welding and <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding, allowing for stronger, higher quality welds. However, GTAW is comparatively more complex and difficult to master, and furthermore, it is significantly slower than most other welding techniques. A related process, plasma arc welding, uses a slightly different welding torch {{to create a more}} focused welding arc and as a result is often automated.|$|E

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} is {{most commonly used}} to weld stainless steel and nonferrous materials, such as aluminum and magnesium, {{but it can be}} applied to nearly all metals, with a notable exception being zinc and its alloys. Its applications involving carbon steels are limited not because of process restrictions, but because of the existence of more economical steel welding techniques, such as <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding and shielded metal arc welding. Furthermore, GTAW can be performed in a variety of other-than-flat positions, depending on the skill of the welder and the materials being welded.|$|E
5|$|Shielded metal {{arc welding}} {{is one of the}} world's most popular welding processes, {{accounting}} for over half of all welding in some countries. Because of its versatility and simplicity, it is particularly dominant in the maintenance and repair industry, and is heavily used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication. In recent years its use has declined as flux-cored arc welding has expanded in the construction industry and <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding has become more popular in industrial environments. However, because of the low equipment cost and wide applicability, the process will likely remain popular, especially among amateurs and small businesses where specialized welding processes are uneconomical and unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid exposure to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged exposure, possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this exposure. Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon exposure to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from exposure to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

Experimental work focused on optimisation of process parameters to produce joint with desired properties. Hardness of the weld heat affected zone produced by both processes has been measured. Productivity and cost effectiveness of both processes were compared. It was concluded that hybrid laser-gas <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding process is suitable for welding high strength quenched and tempered steel...|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} common types of arc welding is {{shielded}} <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding (SMAW); it is also known as manual <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding (MMA) or stick welding. Electric current is used to strike an arc between the base material and consumable electrode rod, which is made of filler material (typically steel) and is covered with a flux that protects the weld area from oxidation and contamination by producing carbon dioxide (CO2) gas during the welding process. The electrode core itself acts as filler material, making a separate filler unnecessary.|$|R
50|$|The {{company was}} founded by Oscar Kjellberg. In 1904 he pioneered the {{development}} of manual <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding electrodes in Gothenburg, Sweden. The company sells equipment used in welding and cutting.|$|R
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding to protect the welding area from atmospheric gases such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|During {{the middle}} of the century, many new welding methods were invented. In 1930, Kyle Taylor was {{responsible}} for the release of stud welding, which soon became popular in shipbuilding and construction. Submerged arc welding was invented the same year and continues to be popular today. In 1932 a Russian, Konstantin Khrenov successfully implemented the first underwater electric arc welding. Gas tungsten arc welding, after decades of development, was finally perfected in 1941, and <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding followed in 1948, allowing for fast welding of non-ferrous materials but requiring expensive shielding gases. Shielded metal arc welding was developed during the 1950s, using a flux-coated consumable electrode, and it quickly became the most popular metal arc welding process. In 1957, the flux-cored arc welding process debuted, in which the self-shielded wire electrode could be used with automatic equipment, resulting in greatly increased welding speeds, and that same year, plasma arc welding was invented. Electroslag welding was introduced in 1958, and it was followed by its cousin, electrogas welding, in 1961. In 1953, the Soviet scientist N. F. Kazakov proposed the diffusion bonding method.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding {{began to be}} understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It {{was not until the}} 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been invented by Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was invented by P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E

5|$|Shielded <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding {{equipment}} typically {{consists of a}} constant current welding power supply and an electrode, with an electrode holder, a 'ground' clamp, and welding cables (also known as welding leads) connecting the two.|$|R
5|$|The type {{of current}} used plays an {{important}} role in arc welding. Consumable electrode processes such as shielded metal arc welding and <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding generally use direct current, but the electrode can be charged either positively or negatively. In welding, the positively charged anode will have a greater heat concentration, and as a result, changing the polarity of the electrode affects weld properties. If the electrode is positively charged, the base metal will be hotter, increasing weld penetration and welding speed. Alternatively, a negatively charged electrode results in more shallow welds. Nonconsumable electrode processes, such as gas tungsten arc welding, can use either type of direct current, as well as alternating current. However, with direct current, because the electrode only creates the arc and does not provide filler material, a positively charged electrode causes shallow welds, while a negatively charged electrode makes deeper welds. Alternating current rapidly moves between these two, resulting in medium-penetration welds. One disadvantage of AC, the fact that the arc must be re-ignited after every zero crossing, has been addressed with the invention of special power units that produce a square wave pattern instead of the normal sine wave, making rapid zero crossings possible and minimizing the effects of the problem.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} power necessary for arc welding processes, {{a variety of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common welding power supplies are constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In arc welding, the length of the arc {{is directly related to the}} voltage, and the amount of heat input is related to the current. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten arc welding and shielded metal arc welding, because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as <b>gas</b> <b>metal</b> <b>arc</b> welding, flux cored arc welding, and submerged arc welding. In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|E
