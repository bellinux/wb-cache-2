40|$|The paper surveys {{articles}} {{examining the}} economic impacts of a livestock disease outbreak {{and focuses on}} modeling issues. One set of papers considers setting an <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> {{when there is a}} livestock disease risk. They show that the level of a risk-based <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> is sensitive to the impact of disease on economic welfare. The remaining articles focus on estimates of the economic impacts. An outbreak is modeled in a U. S. agricultural sector model and shows the importance of lost exports and consumer response to the magnitude of losses. The final paper argues for de-composition of the welfare impacts. Lessons for future research include improved links to epidemiological research, improved inclusion of trade, extension to non-agricultural sectors, and knowledge of consumer response.

40|$|This is the {{companion}} volume to Gary Clyde Hufbauer and Kimberly Ann Elliott's Measuring the Costs of Protection in the United States (1994). It assesses Japanese trade barriers by identifying price differentials between imports and their (imperfect) domestic substitutes and then calculating the welfare {{effects of the}} implied trade barriers. The authors find that <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> in place in 1989 cost Japanese consumers $ 105 billion, about 3. 6 percent of GNP. If all such barriers were removed, Japanese imports could increase by $ 47 billion. The authors believe {{that the cost of}} import protection has increased in recent years. The book contains an overview chapter which describes parallels and differences in the US and Japanese structures of protection and compares the aggregate results. ...|$|E
40|$|International {{economics}} has overwhelmingly {{relied on}} Samuelson’s (1954) assumption that trade costs are proportional to value. We build a general equilibrium heterogeneous …rms model of trade {{that allows for}} both ad valorem and per-unit costs. Using a novel minimum distance estimator we identify per-unit trade costs from the distribution of foreign sales across …rms within markets. Estimated average per-unit costs are substantial being, on average, between 35 and 45 percent of the average consumer price. This leads us to reject the pure ad valorem cost assumption. An important theoretical …nding is that a per-unit <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> is more harmful than an equal yield ad valorem barrier, since per-unit barriers distort relative prices both across and within markets. Since a non-negligible share of existing trade barriers are per-unit, standard welfare assessments of trade liberalization may be understated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the essential similarity between "modern" commercial policy, with its rent-like revenues, and capital transfers. <b>Import</b> <b>barriers</b> are {{shown to have}} consequently ambiguous effects on nominal and real exchange rates. The paper also examines some important supply-side welfare Costs and consequences of <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> through their influence on current asset prices and future capital formation. The model on which the observations are based is an aggregated fixed-endowment, full-employment, general-equilibrium model {{similar to those used}} in the pure theory of international trade, with financial capital and foreign exchange markets that are integrated {{in a manner consistent with}} the asset/portfolio-balance approach to exchange rates. The model is empirically calibrated to reflect the U. S. and the rest of the world in the early 1980 's. In this empirical stylization, U. S. <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> are shown (1) to reduce national consumption possibilities more significantly than is usually thought to be the case; (ii) to discourage U. S. physical capital formation; and (iii) to have significant yet variable effects on exchange rates, where the variability depends on the distribution between the U. S. and the rest of the world of the rent-like revenues implicit in the <b>import</b> <b>barriers.</b> It is notable that the more favorable this distribution to the U. S. the larger is the dollar depreciation caused by <b>import</b> <b>barriers.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Despite trends towards growing {{globalization}} {{of the world}} economy, the further development of import trade is still hindered {{by a number of}} barriers. Based on a sample of 100 Cypriot importers, an attempt is made {{to assess the impact of}} these barriers on import behaviour. Overall, these barriers were found to have only a modest effect, with greatest concern expressed for those hindering competitiveness in buying from abroad. In analyzing barriers according to the principal origin of imports, with a few exceptions, no significant differences were observed. A factor analysis combined import barriers into six dimensions, with 'competition-related problems' being the most influential. In investigating the relevance of firm characteristics on <b>import</b> <b>barrier</b> dimensions, the latter were highly but inversely associated with business experience and company size. Of the six dimensions, 'adverse foreign conditions' exhibited a strong link with most of the firm attributes examined. International business Import barriers Firm characteristics Cyprus...|$|E

A fall in export barriers is positively correlated with plant productivity in traded sectors.

Our contribution is to disentangle {{the impact of}} export and <b>import</b> <b>barriers.</b> Firstly, we estimate the production functions to obtain plant TFP. Secondly, we estimate trade barriers (border effects) between Chile and its trading partners at the industry level and over time. Finally, we test the impact of trade barriers by regressing productivity on border effect estimates.

40|$|A tariff-rate quota (TRQ) is a two-tier tariff. The Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture {{provides}} for the transformation of remaining import quotas into TRQs in order to eliminate quantity restricting <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> to trade. However, {{more often than not}} are TRQs de-facto-quotas. The profit-maximizing condition for an importer confronted with two differentiated goods under a common quota is derived. The main focus of the present article is the US import regime for cheese which was transformed according to the tariffication process into a TRQ system. Analysis of cheese import quantities shows that this transformation has indeed little changed.

40|$|The Uruguay Round {{involved}} a grand North-South bargain: The North reduced <b>import</b> <b>barriers,</b> particularly in textiles and agriculture.

Finger and Nogués argue that while the North’s reduction of <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> benefits both the North and the South, the new domestic regulations adopted by countries of the South could prove costly to those countries. To begin with, the regulations will be expensive to implement.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} impacts of {{removing}} export subsidies with or without reforms to domestic support and tariffs using a multi-country trade model. Model simulations are designed to assess both the magnitude and the direction of trade {{in the absence of}} export subsidies in connection with other domestic distortions and <b>import</b> <b>barriers.</b> Results show that {{the impacts of}} export subsidy removal, while significant for some countries and products, are comparatively smaller and are dominated by the much larger trade and welfare distortions imposed by <b>import</b> <b>barriers.</b> Hence, the removal of domestic subsidies, including export subsidies, by themselves may not be sufficient to improve global welfare and expand trade since the welfare gains by the net exporters are far outweighed by the losses of net importers. One implication from these simulations is that export subsidy reform must be combined with market access liberalization in order to benefit exporters and importers and to attract the widest support among WTO members.

50|$|A {{third factor}} {{affecting}} imports was trade liberalization. Reduced tariff rates and a weakening of other overt trade <b>barriers</b> meant that <b>imports</b> {{should have been}} able to compete more fully in Japan's markets.

The share of manufactured imports in GNP changed very little from 1970 to 1985, suggesting that falling <b>import</b> <b>barriers</b> had little impact on the propensity to purchase foreign products. Falling trade barriers might become more significant in the 1990s as liberalization continues.|$|R
