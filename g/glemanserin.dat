50|$|<b>Glemanserin</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} MDL-11,939) {{is a drug}} which acts as a potent and {{selective}} 5-HT2A receptor antagonist. The first truly selective 5-HT2A ligand to be discovered, <b>glemanserin</b> resulted {{in the development of}} the widely used and even more potent and selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist volinanserin (MDL-100,907), which is a fluorinated analogue. Though it was largely superseded in scientific research by volinanserin, <b>glemanserin</b> was investigated clinically for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder. However, it was ultimately found to be ineffective and was not marketed.|$|E
