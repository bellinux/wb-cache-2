5|$|Plymouth railway station, {{which opened}} in 1877, is managed by Great Western Railway and also sees trains on the CrossCountry network. Smaller {{stations}} are served by local trains on the Tamar Valley Line and Cornish Main Line. First Great Western have come under fire recently, due to widespread rail service cuts across the south-west, which affect Plymouth greatly. Three MPs from the three main political parties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> lobbied that the train services are vital to its economy.|$|E
5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} 20th century and afterward, {{many of the}} {{communities}} and businesses in the area began cooperative efforts, including the Clear Lake Area Chamber of Commerce, the Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership, and the Bay Area Houston Transportation Partnership, to create a distinct economic and civic identity for the region and to plan regional development. Though most of the communities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> been incorporated into municipalities, a few unincorporated communities remain under the extra-territorial jurisdiction of neighboring towns. These include San Leon, Bacliff, and Smith Point. The communities of San Leon and Bacliff, despite their seaside location, their proximity to the relatively prosperous Clear Lake Area, {{and the development of}} summer resort communities there in the early 20th century, have suffered economic decline since the mid-20th century and are among the least affluent parts of the Bay Area today.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} affluence of Zagori's past {{is still}} {{reflected in the}} architecture of the villages, while today the preservation of the local architectural legacy is enshrined in a law which dictates that all buildings in the area must be constructed with local traditional materials and in compliance with local architecture. One of the characteristic features of the National Park are its stone bridges, which were the only connection to the outside world until roads were built in the 1950s. Sixteen of these stone bridges and seven churches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> been listed as protected historical monuments.|$|E
5|$|The road {{has long}} {{served as a}} de facto {{cultural}} dividing line between the predominantly poor black city and its wealthier, predominantly white northern suburbs. The perception of 8Mile as the chief dividing line between racial groups and classes persists, {{in part because the}} suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb remain, on the whole, significantly whiter and more prosperous than the city of Detroit. However, in recent years increasing numbers of whites have moved into Detroit, especially around the downtown area, and other neighborhoods <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> become more ethnically diverse as well.|$|E
5|$|The Kowalewko {{cemetery}} in Greater Poland {{is one of}} the largest in Poland and is distinguished by a great number of beautiful relics, made locally or imported from the Empire. The total number of burials is estimated at over 500, most of which have been excavated. 60 percent of the bodies were not cremated and typically placed in wooden coffins constructed of board or plank pieces. The burial ground was in use from the mid-1st century AD to about 220, which gives approximately 80 area inhabitants per generation. Remnants of settlements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> also been investigated. At Rogowo near Chełmno a Wielbark settlement, an industrial production site and a 2nd to 3rd century bi-ritual cemetery with very richly furnished graves have been discovered. In the area of Ulkowy, Gdańsk County a settlement consisting of both sunken floor and post construction dwellings, as well as a burial ground in use from the mid-1st century to the second half of the 3rd century were found. Only a part of the cemetery was excavated on the occasion of a motorway construction, but it yielded 110 inhumations (11 in hollowed-out log coffins) and 15 cremations (8 of them in urns) and a rich collection of decorative objects, mostly from the graves of women. Those include fancy jewelry and accessories made of gold, silver, bronze, amber, glass and enameled plates. Ceramics, utility items and tools including weaving equipment were recovered from the settlement site. Other significant Wielbark settlements in the area were encountered in Swarożyn and Stanisławie, both in Tczew County.|$|E

50|$|A most {{important}} change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> been <b>the</b> {{building of the}} Wairakei Power Station (150 MW) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, about 2 km. north of the field. This reduced <b>the</b> pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hot water systems below the earth surface. Since then much of <b>the</b> geothermal activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>has</b> dramatically changed, as did the geothermal activity at Craters of the Moon. The geysers at Wairakei Geyser Valley totally disappeared, but the heat output at Craters of the Moon increased. A lot of hydrothermal eruptions occurred, which formed the craters.|$|R

25|$|Around {{fifty years}} {{after the fall of}} the city to the Ottomans, Atık Ali Paşa, the Grand Vizier of Sultan Bayezid II, ordered the Chora Church to be {{converted}} into a mosque — Kariye Camii. Due to the prohibition against iconic images in Islam, the mosaics and frescoes were covered behind a layer of plaster. This and frequent earthquakes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> taken their toll on the artwork.|$|E

25|$|Like most {{regions in}} the Sinosphere, most of Lingnan's medieval {{literature}} was composed in classical Chinese (grammatically), rather than the people's spoken language. However, poets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> started composing poems using grammatically vernacular Cantonese since the 19th century, {{with the work of}} Cantonese poet Liu Yan-tou (Jyutping: Liu6 jan1 tou4; Traditional Chinese: 廖恩燾) being the most prominent. Many of his works require Cantonese characters (characters specifically invented to write Cantonese) to write down.|$|E
25|$|The {{numerous}} limestone and sandstone {{layers of}} the Israeli mountains serve as aquifers through which water flows from the west flank to the east. Several springs have formed along the Dead Sea, each an oasis, most notably the oases at Ein Gedi and Ein Bokek (Neve Zohar) where settlements have developed. Israel also {{has a number of}} areas of karst topography. Caves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> <b>have</b> been used for thousands of years as shelter, storage rooms, barns and as places of public gatherings.|$|E
25|$|Collectively, {{the region}} {{is best known for}} {{producing}} and exporting oil.
