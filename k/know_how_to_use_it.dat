500|$|Hirst {{gave the}} {{impression}} of enjoying every game he played, and many of the captains under whom he played praised both his personality and his contribution to the team. Lord Hawke said that Hirst's smile [...] "went right round his head and met at the back." [...] Warner noted his wit helped the team in difficult situations during the tour of Australia in 1903–04. Hirst's Times obituary said: [...] "No why or wherefore, no explanation of his great ability, not even his record which adorns the pages of Wisden can adequately describe to those who had not the fortune to see him play the rich quality of George Hirst, the type of professional cricketer to which all would like to aspire. He played during the golden age of cricket, {{and he was one of}} the most illustrious of his time." [...] Hirst was noted for his honesty, sportsmanship, and enthusiasm. Known as [...] "George Herbert", he was admired and affectionately regarded by his contemporaries and by spectators. The public worshipped him in a way never replicated for his contemporary and fellow Kirkheaton-born all-rounder Wilfred Rhodes, a much more dour character. The two men were never good friends; there may have been [...] a degree of jealousy between them, and Rhodes did not appreciate Hirst's jovial attitude. Rhodes was more tactically astute than Hirst, but Hirst's enthusiasm and personality were more inspirational to the team. Rhodes, when asked about Hirst's ability to swing the ball, replied: [...] "He was very good. But he didn't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it,</b> you know. I had to set the field for him so that he got the best out of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it,</b> how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in {{ten percent of the}} audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe I crossed the line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E

The study, by ACER Research Fellow Ms Catherine Underwood, examined the extent <b>to</b> which knowing <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone is correlated with children’s physical activity and ability to move through their neighbourhood without adult supervision, also known as independent mobility. More than 800 Victorian primary school children aged between 8 and 12 years participated in the research, of which 84 per cent reported they <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone. The study revealed that 70 per cent of children who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone reported that they are allowed to go outside and play with other children, compared to only 51 per cent of children who do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a mobile phone...|$|R
2500|$|Napoleon {{considered}} Eugene one of {{the seven}} greatest commanders of history. Although later military critics have disagreed with that assessment, Eugene was undoubtedly the greatest Austrian general. He was no military innovator, but he had the ability to make an inadequate system work. He was equally adept as an organizer, strategist, and tactician, believing in the primacy of battle and his ability to seize the opportune moment to launch a successful attack. [...] "The important thing," [...] wrote Maurice de Saxe in his Reveries, [...] "is to see the opportunity and to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>it.</b> Prince Eugene possessed this quality which is the greatest in the art of war and which is the test of the most elevated genius." [...] This fluidity was key to his battlefield successes in Italy and in his wars against the Turks. Nevertheless, in the Low Countries, particularly after the battle of Oudenarde in 1708, Eugene, like his cousin Louis of Baden, tended to play safe and become bogged down in a conservative strategy of sieges and defending supply lines. After the attempt on Toulon in 1707, he also became very wary of combined land/sea operations. To historian Derek McKay, however, the main criticism of him as a general is his legacy—he left no school of officers nor an army able to function without him.|$|E

50|$|Socrates {{points out}} that those who {{exercise}} the body are caring only for the part that is ruled, while neglecting the soul, which is what rules (407e5-e8).

Rather than using it incorrectly, it should be left alone (407e8-e9). The same concept pertains to the soul.
