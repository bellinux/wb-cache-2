Construction was started in June 2008 and the hall opened in August 2009. The four story hall houses up to 328 students in the traditional dormitory style with suites of single and <b>double</b> <b>occupancy</b> rooms with their own shared suite bathroom. Johnson Hall has gender-segregated by floor housing. Common areas include music practice rooms, a computer lab, laundry rooms, and outdoor green space.

Additionally, Osprey Hall offers more of a traditional, dorm-like environment with <b>double</b> <b>occupancy</b> along with communal bathrooms and showers. Osprey Village offers an apartment-like feel with either double or quadruple occupancy. Osprey Hall, The Crossings, Osprey Landing, and Osprey Cove are designated for freshmen although upperclassmen live there as well, while Osprey Village is an upperclassmen residence.|$|E

2500|$|From 1964 to 1972, {{developer}} Louis Lesser built six off-campus, 10-story high-rise residential halls {{to house}} 3,600 students. The [...] campus lacked space for horizontal expansion, following the California State University expansion plan started in 1959. This doubled the university's housing capacity, making Cal State LA {{the largest in}} the California State University system. Maxwell Starkman & Associates, AIA, of Beverly Hills, designed the development plan. Unlike other components of the Cal State University system being developed in the 1960s, the residence halls were privately financed by Louis Lesser Enterprises, Inc. The first on-campus housing was opened in June 1984, and three years later, a second residential life complex was opened. Cal State LA has a student-housing complex where students can rent a house at <b>double</b> <b>occupancy</b> for $655.00 per month (as of November 2009). During 1984 Summer Olympics that took place in Los Angeles, Cal State LA student houses were upgraded and expanded because it housed the athletics of the 1984 Summer Olympics.

At high temperatures, incoherent holes lead to a broad response peaked at the Hubbard repulsion $U$. At low temperatures, antiferromagnetic order leads to a coherent peak for the hole along with broad features representing spin wave shake-off processes. This is manifested in the doublon creation rate as a sharp absorption edge and oscillations {{as a function of}} modulating frequency.

It is shown that for ferromagnetic exchange coupling (F> 0) ground states with maximum spin are stable already at finite Hubbard interaction U>U_c. For non-bipartite lattices this requires a hopping amplitude t≤ 0. For vanishing F one obtains U_c→∞ as in Nagaoka's theorem. This shows that the exchange interaction F is important for stabilizing ferromagnetism at finite U. Only in the special case X=t the ferromagnetic state is stable even for F= 0, provided the lattice allows the hole to move around loops.
