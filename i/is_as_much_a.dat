For him it was an absolute standard. He spoke of a “Presence” or “daimon” that “renewed his courage” and “indicated direction” in everything he did.|$|E

25|$|In {{drafting}} this prose scenario, Wagner drew upon numerous {{works of}} German and Scandinavian mythology, both primary texts (usually in contemporary German translations, though Wagner had {{some knowledge of}} Old Norse and Middle German) and commentaries on them. The most important of the former were the Völsunga Saga, the Poetic Edda, the Prose Edda, the Nibelungenlied and Thidriks saga af Bern, while {{the most important of}} the latter were Jacob Grimm's German Mythology and Wilhelm Grimm's The German Hero-Saga. In addition to these, however, Wagner picked up various details from at least twenty-two other , including a number of key philosophical texts that informed the symbolism of the Ring. Wagner contradicts his sources on various points – necessarily so as the sources don’t always agree with one another – conflates disparate stories into continuous narratives, creates some new, memorable characters by combining minor characters from different sources, etc. The final scenario <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> unique recreation of the original myths as the Nibelungenlied was in its day.|$|E
25|$|However, the state’s {{most famous}} dance <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>a</b> ritual and daredevil act as {{movements}} performed to music. The Danza de los Voladores (Dance of the Flyers) is a ceremony/ritual {{which has its}} roots in the pre-Hispanic period and presently best known as associated with the town of Papantla, Veracruz. It is believed to have originated with the Nahua, Huastec and Otomi peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica. The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum. According to myth, the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought. Although the ritual did not originate with the Totonac people, today it is most strongly associated with them, especially those in and around Papantla, as the ceremony has died off in most other places. The ceremony was named an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in order to help the ritual survive and thrive in the modern world.|$|E
