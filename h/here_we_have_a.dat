It is difficult to minimized rater errors, since we are humans and we are not objective. Moreover, sometimes, we are not aware of our behavior of having preferences towards people but there are some tools {{in order to have a}} more objective information as using available technology to track performances and record it which enables manager to have some objective information about the process.|$|E
25|$|Around 1917-1920 social outsiders, the nostalgic loners {{who spend}} their lives in saloons or {{interiors}} with scanty furniture, replaced the earlier fishermen and their families, sailors, and merchants. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> clear connection with the “miserable” trend of the young Picasso, such as his Saltimbanques of the blue period. At the same time, these sad themes are counterbalanced by representations of happy families in various configurations: a mother playing with a smiling child, a family playing with a puppet-theatre, etc. The paintings from his last period gain more light and life, while the artist does not eschew dissonances. Contours dissolve {{on the edges of}} bordering color areas and spot-lighting melts the surfaces of stylized forms.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the message of The Green Room, Truffaut said [...] "I am for the woman and against the man. As this century {{approaches}} its end, people are becoming more stupid and suicidal, and we must fight against this. The Green Room is not a fable, not a psychological picture. The moral is: One must deal with the living! This man has neglected life. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> breakdown {{of the idea of}} survival." ...|$|E
60|$|And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{excellent}} frontispiece, {{of a party}} {{playing on}} a P. W. to a little ring of dancing children.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{proof of}} our victory, and the strongest {{instance}} yet of my lord's incredible indulgence; for what must he do but interfere {{to save his}} favourite from exposure! ...|$|R
6000|$|... [169] [...] "We have <b>had</b> Maréchal Macdonald <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{capital account}} of Glengarry visiting the {{interior}} of a convent in the ancient Highland garb, and the effect of such an apparition on the nuns, who fled in all directions."--Scott to Skene, Edinburgh, 24th June 1825.|$|R
2500|$|The show {{underwent}} further tightening, namely {{with improved}} sewer lighting and {{the incorporation of}} the Javert suicide scene effect. Boublil explained: [...] "The transfer from London to the United States has prompted further modifications. 'We are taking this opportunity to rethink and perfect, to rewrite some details which probably {{no one else will}} see, but which for us are still long nights of work,' Mr. Boublil says. 'There are things that nobody had time to do in London, and <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wonderful opportunity to fix a few things. No one will notice, perhaps, but for us, it will make us so happy if we can better this show. We would like this to be the final version.'" [...] Two songs were deleted—the complete version of Gavroche's song [...] "Little People" [...] and the adult Cosette's [...] "I Saw Him Once". A short section at the beginning of [...] "In My Life" [...] replaced [...] "I Saw Him Once". The lyrics in Javert's [...] "Stars" [...] were changed. It now ended with the line, [...] "This I swear by the stars!", while the London production and cast recording ended with the repeated line, [...] "Keeping watch in the night".|$|E

60|$|W.A.--Ay, ay, there {{began our}} dialogue. I {{asked her if}} she would be married to me our way. She asked me what way that was; I told her {{marriage}} was appointed by God; and <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> strange talk together, indeed, as ever man and wife had, I believe.|$|R
5000|$|Access {{is vital}} in lobbying. If you can't {{get in your}} door, you can't make your case. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> hostile senator, whose staff was hostile, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to get in. So that's the {{lobbyist}} safe-cracker method: throw fundraisers, raise money, and become a big donor. — Lobbyist Jack Abramoff in 2011 ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{economy with}} zero {{marginal}} taxes and zero transfer payments. If these figures were substituted into the multiplier formula, the resulting figure would be 2.5. This figure {{would give us}} the instance where a (for instance) $1 billion change in expenditure {{would lead to a}} $2.5 billion change in equilibrium real GDP.|$|R

6000|$|... [Footnote 12: <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{reminder}} of Emerson's pantheism. He means the inexplicable continuity [...] "of what I call God, and fools nature," [...] as Browning expressed it.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... 3 is {{a window}} from Carnarvon Castle, and very {{primitive}} and interesting in manner,--one of its arches being of one stone, the other of two. And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> instance of a form of arch which would be barbarous enough on a large scale, and of many pieces; but quaint and agreeable thus massively built.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps I {{had better}} not say, Leslie. I {{have been doing}} some {{scouting}} across the desert, with my boy <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> long ride. In the first place, my arm wants attending to. I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bullet in the shoulder. The next thing we need is something to eat; {{for the last three}} days <b>we</b> <b>have</b> had nothing but dates, and not too many of them.|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, I {{believe that}} fish are {{extremely}} plentiful <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good supply of fishing lines on board, for we generally fish {{when we are}} at anchor." ...|$|E
6000|$|He came nearer. [...] "Come, you and I {{have gone}} by rule and reason long enough. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{magnificent}} impulse; let us follow. Don't ask me to wait, that would spoil it all; considerations would come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] {{continued}} Jack, [...] "I {{have a great}} {{desire to}} visit {{some of the other}} islands of the South Seas. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> first-rate schooner at our disposal, so I don't see what should hinder us." ...|$|E
3000|$|... f To {{simplify the}} presentation, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> used <b>a</b> slight abuse of notation, i.e., <b>we</b> <b>have</b> {{considered}} that the sets in (12) are ordered.|$|R
3000|$|So, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> email prank {{call that}} evolves into an entity that hopes to {{establish}} {{itself as a}} self-sustainable company. This company, in turn, is meant to fund and act like a front organisation for ongoing relations with North Korea. However, it fails to attract {{the interest of the}} fashion scene and instead ends up fuelling political debates. One Swedish commentator has likened it to an art project. Would the founders agree? [...]...|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{most horrible}} sight; for, riding {{up to the}} {{entrance}} where the horse came out, we found the carcass of another horse, and of two men devoured by these ravenous creatures, and of one the man was no doubt the same whom we heard fire a gun, for there lay a gun just by him fired off; but as to the man, his head, and {{the upper part of}} his body, were eaten up.|$|R
6000|$|... "The man {{lived and}} he got off with a year. I have no doubt he is out now, {{but he has not}} dared to show his nose <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cousin of his here, and I daresay he could tell you where he is." ...|$|E
60|$|AMERICAN. [Addressing the OFFICIAL] Now, see here. 'Pears to me {{you don't}} {{suspicion}} just how beautiful this is. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> man giving his life for that old baby that's got no claim on him. This is not a baby of his own making. No, sir, {{this is a very}} Christ-like proposition in the gentleman.|$|E
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{picture of}} the whole story,--Lady Byron within a month of her confinement; her money being used to settle debts; her husband out at a dinner-party, going through the usual course of such parties, able to keep his legs and help Sheridan downstairs, and going home 'gloomy, and savage to ferocity,' to his wife.|$|E
60|$|The day {{is delicious}} <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> blow on the Mersey this morning, and exulted over the American steamers. With kind regard to Sir William and Lady Humphery.|$|R
60|$|It {{was near}} sunset {{when we reached}} the margin of the upper terrace, where we began to descend {{to the level of the}} borders of the Rhine. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> view of the towers of Cologne, and of the broad plain that environs its walls. It was getting to be dark as we drove through the winding entrance, among bastions and half-moons, and across bridges, up to the gates of the place, which we reached just in season to be {{admitted}} without the extra formalities.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Reuben," [...] Mr. Hudson said, [...] "sit {{yourself}} down <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> must <b>have</b> <b>a</b> talk together. Now {{we want to}} {{know exactly}} what you are thinking of doing." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{picture of}} true savage life; of small {{isolated}} communities {{at war with}} all around them, subject to the wants and miseries of such a condition, drawing a precarious existence from the luxuriant soil, and living on, from generation to generation, with no desire for physical amelioration, and no prospect of moral advancement.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> third wonder," [...] went on Pepper, {{pointing}} to the football captain. [...] "Commodore Daleo, the leather-ball juggler. The most renowned juggler of the spheroid in the world! You think it is here, but it is not, for lo! he has juggled it over the line and kicked it as high as an airship. He will show you----" ...|$|E
6000|$|This tale {{was told}} to Kohl by 'an old {{insignificant}} squaw among the Ojibways.' {80a} <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> precise parallel to the tale of Bheki, the frog-bride, and here the reason of the prohibition to touch water is made perfectly unmistakable. The touch magically revived the bride's old animal life with the beavers. Or was the Indian name for beaver (temakse) once {{a name for the}} sun? {80b} ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed,' Mrs. Thompson said, smiling; 'this was {{considered}} a very lonely place when <b>we</b> first settled <b>here.</b> <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> little hut with two rooms, and {{it was more than}} six months before I could get a woman servant to come out, and then it was only one of our shepherds' wives, who knew nothing of cooking, and who was only useful in drawing the water and sweeping the floors. In time the country became more settled, and there are stations now sixty or seventy miles beyond us.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That may be {{all very}} well in New York," [...] he said, [...] "but here in London one doesn't do such things. One keeps the law <b>here,</b> for <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> incorruptible police." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Three score {{years and}} ten, baldness, and spectacles, have their {{advantages}} after all!", I said to myself. [...] "Instead of a bashful youth and maiden, gasping out monosyllables at awful intervals, <b>here</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{old man and}} a child, quite at their ease, talking {{as if they had}} known each other for years! Then you think," [...] I continued aloud, [...] "that we ought sometimes to ask a Ghost to sit down? But <b>have</b> <b>we</b> any authority for it? In Shakespeare, for instance--there are plenty of ghosts there--does Shakespeare ever give the stage-direction 'hands chair to Ghost'?" ...|$|R
