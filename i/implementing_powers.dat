40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{importance}} of comitology in the EU law-making process. The main reason for choosing this topic was the {{need to consider the}} importance of comitology in the EU decision-making process from a legal perspective. Until now the importance of comitology has been largely viewed through the lens of political science. Given that comitology is connected to the implementing phase of the EU law-making process, {{it was not possible to}} ignore the issue of <b>implementing</b> <b>powers</b> and, on the contrary, it was proper to study the comitology in this context. I addressed comitology as a multi-faceted phenomenon, with historical, institutional, substantive and procedural dimensions. I studied these elements also in their mutual interaction. Considering comitology as a complex issue was a necessary precondition to achieving objectives I set in the thesis. Given the absence of specialized literature capturing recent legal developments, I had to rely largely on primary sources. The main objective of my thesis was to clarify if and to what extent the current shape and functioning of comitology complies with the principle legal certainty and respects the limits of <b>implementing</b> <b>powers.</b> I also focused on the associated question of the judicial review of legal acts adopted by comitology procedures [...] . ...|$|E
30|$|Actually the Commission {{is working}} on {{establishing}} end-of-waste criteria {{for a number of}} specific recyclable materials including metal scrap of copper, aluminium and iron, waste paper, waste glass, compost, and plastics. Based on the results of two frontrunner studies on ferrous scrap and aluminium scrap in 2010, the first End-of-Waste Regulation (333 / 2011 /EC) has been adopted [18]. It applies to the EU since October 9, 2011. Following JRC/SUSPROC, based on a second round of technical studies on waste paper, copper and copper alloy scrap, as well as waste glass (glass cullet), regulations for end-of-waste on these materials are currently being prepared in the “comitology” procedure [i.e. assistance of the Commission in exercising its <b>implementing</b> <b>powers</b> by representatives of the Member States through committees [19]]. Further studies are performed on biodegradable waste and waste plastics, and the development of end-of-waste criteria on aggregates and waste-derived fuels is in discussion [20].|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{questions to be}} addressed by this subproject should contribute to a constructive solution to this important issue of the institutional balance by first establishing criteria for an operational demarcation between legislative and implementing measures, and secondly by assessing a large number of EC implementing acts to determine whether and in which cases implementing measures have in fact violated the prerogatives of the legislators Council and Parliament. The subproject therefore concentrates on the following questions, divided into a theoretical and an empirical approach: How can the line that separates implementing measures from those with legislative implications be drawn? How can that differentiation between legislative and implementing legal acts be made operational? How could an effective system of control be established that limits the <b>implementing</b> <b>powers</b> of the Commission and safeguards the prerogatives of the legislators, especially Parliament? Have the prerogatives of the legislative authorities been generally respected in implementing decisions {{in the course of the}} past years or have decisions with important legislative implications been decided upon according to comitology procedures? In which policy arenas has this primarily occurred? In what way have these possible "transgressions" affected the institutional balance...|$|E
40|$|Some 300 {{legislative}} acts are adopted every {{year by the}} European Parliament and the Council, or by the Council alone. Based on these acts, the European Commission adopts around 3, 000 implementing acts each year, after consulting one of the 250 so-called ‘Comitology committees’ made up of representatives of the Member States. Only about 0. 2 % of these delegated acts are referred back to the Council because of non-agreement between the Commission and the Committee. Since the entry into force of the second Comitology decision in 1999, Parliament also has a right of scrutiny over such acts, but it has used this right in order to question the Commission’s proposals in only three cases. This paper asks whether this right of scrutiny is an appropriate way of controlling delegated rule-making. It starts with a short historical overview of Parliament’s role, before describing the current legal regulation of Parliament’s involvement in comitology procedures. It then looks in detail at the three cases in which Parliament has to date adopted a ‘Resolution’. Finally, a general assessment is made of parliamentarian control over <b>implementing</b> <b>powers,</b> {{with a view to}} contributing to the present discussion about an adequate system of delegated rule-making under the Constitutional Treaty...|$|E

40|$|The {{history of}} {{comitology}} – {{the system of}} committees in charge of controlling the Commission’s <b>implementing</b> <b>powers</b> – has often been characterised by institutional tensions. 1 The crux of these tensions {{is the role of}} the European Parliament (EP) and its quest to be granted powers equal to those of the Council. Over time these tensions have been resolved through a series of inter-institutional agreements and Comitology Decisions, essentially giving the Parliament incremental increases in power. The latest step, which came in 2006, was the modification of the Comitology Decision of 19992 and the introduction of the new Regulatory Procedure with Scrutiny (RPS), also known in English by its French acronym – Procédure de Réglementation avec Contrôle (PRAC). This is unlikely to be the last word because it still fails to grant the Parliament an equal footing and because the Treaty of Lisbon promises more change. However, the new procedure has been in use for over two years and evaluating the early experiences of the European Parliament with RPS is now possible. This article offers a preliminary assessment of how the RPS is working in practise, highlighting the unforeseen developments that have arisen in the course of its implementation and answering some of the questions that were posed regarding the way the RPS would work in the Parliament...|$|E
40|$|With each {{legislative}} issue, {{legislators have}} to decide whether to delegate decision-making to the executive and/or to expert bodies in order to flesh out the details of this legislation, or, alternatively, to spell out all aspects of this decision in legislation proper. The reasons why to delegate have been of prime interest to political science. The debate has concentrated on principal-agent theory to explain why politicians delegate decision-making to bureaucrats, to independent regulatory agencies, and to others actors and how to control these agents. By contrast, Changing Rules of Delegation focuses on these questions: Which actors are empowered by delegation? Are executive actors empowered over legislative actors? How do legislative actors react to the loss of power? What opportunities are there to change the institutional rules governing delegation in order to (re) gain institutional power and, with it influence over policy outcomes? The authors analyze the conditions and processes of change of the rules that delegate decision-making power to the Commission's <b>implementing</b> <b>powers</b> under comitology. Focusing {{on the role of the}} European Parliament the authors explain why the Commission, the Council, and increasingly the Parliament, delegated decision-making to the Commission. If they chose delegation, they still have to determine under which institutional rule comitology should operate. These rules, too, distribute power unequally among actors and therefore raise the question of how they came about in the first place and whether and how the "losers" of a rule change seek to alter the rules at a later point in time.
