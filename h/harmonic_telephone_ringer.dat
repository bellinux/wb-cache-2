50|$|Buzzers {{were not}} usually {{designed}} to accommodate the 90-110 volt, 20-30Hz ringing signal used by <b>telephone</b> <b>ringers.</b> Instead, they usually operated on low-voltage AC (10-18 volts) supplied by the power supply.|$|R
50|$|Extension bells may be {{louder than}} {{ordinary}} <b>telephone</b> <b>ringers.</b> As such {{they may be}} used by persons with moderate hearing impairment to help them detect incoming telephone calls, especially when they are outside the telephone's room.|$|R
50|$|Following a 1975 FCC ruling which {{permitted}} third-party {{devices to}} be connected to phone lines, manufacturers began to produce accessory <b>telephone</b> <b>ringers</b> which rang with electronic tones or melodies rather than mechanically. People also made their own ringers which used the chip from a musical greeting card to play a melody on the arrival of a call. One such ringer, described in a 1989 book, even features a toy dog which barks and wags its tail when a call arrives. Eventually, electronic <b>telephone</b> <b>ringers</b> became the norm. Some of these ringers produced a single tone, but others produced a sequence of two or three tones or a musical melody. Some novelty phones have a ringer to match, such as a duck that quacks or a car that honks its horn.|$|R
50|$|A closed system, {{such as an}} {{intercom}} {{or private}} branch exchange, need not comply with standards for ringing {{if it does not}} use standards-compliant telephone extensions. Some office telephones replace the bells with separately-wired low-voltage DC buzzers or use entirely custom-designed extensions which only work with one manufacturer's switchboard. These avoid the need to generate 20Hz 90V sinusoidal AC, but are not compatible with standard <b>telephone</b> <b>ringers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The ringer {{equivalence}} number (REN) is {{a telecommunications}} measure {{that represents the}} electrical loading effect of a <b>telephone</b> <b>ringer</b> on a <b>telephone</b> line. In the United States, the REN was first defined by U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 47, Part 68, based on the load that a standard Bell System model 500 telephone represented, and was later determined in accordance with ANSI/TIA-968-B (August 2009).|$|R
50|$|Unlike most later {{electronic}} key systems or PBXs, 1A2 systems remain partially functional {{in the event}} of a local power failure. The telephones may still be used to make and receive calls when the central office is available, but the system is unable to provide visual or audible supervision, as well as hold functions and intercom services during power outages. Central-office powered ringers continue to function and by designating one <b>telephone</b> <b>ringer</b> per line it is possible to identify the line that is ringing.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{built-in}} pickups: two are contact mics {{mounted in the}} bridges {{at one end of}} each neck, and two are guitar-style electromagnetic pickups which are placed under the strings toward the opposite end. In addition, there are four bells - a fire bell, a door bell, and two brass <b>telephone</b> <b>ringer</b> bells - mounted {{at the end of one}} of the necks. The pencilina is played by striking its strings and bells with sticks. The strings may also be plucked or bowed.|$|R

50|$|Field {{telephones}} are telephones {{used for}} military communications. They can draw power {{from their own}} battery, from a telephone exchange (via a central battery known as CB), or from an external power source. Some need no battery, being sound-powered telephones.Field telephones replaced flag signals and the telegraph as an efficient means of communication. The first field telephones had a wind-up generator, used to power the <b>telephone's</b> <b>ringer</b> & batteries to send the call, and call the manually operated telephone central. This technology was used from the 1910s to the 1960s. Later the ring signal has been made electronically operated by a pushbutton, or automatic as on domestic telephones. The manual systems are still widely used, and are often compatible with the older equipment.|$|R

5000|$|Scott {{developed}} {{some of the}} first devices capable of producing a series of electronic tones automatically in sequence. He later credited himself as being the inventor of the polyphonic sequencer. (It should be noted that his electromechanical devices, some with motors moving photocells past lights, bore little resemblance to the all-electronic sequencers of the late sixties.) He began working on a machine he said composed using artificial intelligence. The Electronium, as Scott called it, with its vast array of knobs, buttons and patch panels is considered the first self-composing synthesizer.Some of Raymond Scott's projects were less complex, but still ambitious.

50|$|<b>Telephones</b> with {{electromagnetic}} <b>ringers</b> {{are still}} in widespread use. The ringing signal in North America is normally specified at ca. 90 volts AC with a frequency of 20 hertz. In Europe it is around 60-90 VAC with a frequency of 25 Hz. Some non-Bell Company system party lines in the US used multiple frequencies for selective ringing.|$|R
50|$|Typically, a lineman {{tests the}} {{terminal}} equipment (<b>telephone</b> set) <b>ringer</b> by calling a ringback telephone number or a vertical service code, and then hanging up {{and waiting for}} the telephone to ring. When answering, the switch may play a low frequency signal tone, at which point the technician flashes the line (hangs up briefly) one or more times. A higher pitched tone then indicates ringback is engaged, and the technician hangs up. The phone will then ring, answering only with a verification tone when picked up. The verification tone is added so that telephone subscribers cannot easily use the ringback system as an intercom, to call other extensions of their own phone line by simply initiating a ringback test {{and waiting for the}} phone to stop ringing and converse when someone else on their own line has answered the extension.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{a single}} {{landline}} or party line shared {{with several of}} their Tennessee neighbors was available for outside telephone calls, with a waiting list for any calls. Spurred mainly by the need for prompt childbirth assistance and emergency medical response, a field-phone style party line system was installed by The Farm's telephone crew in 1971. Telephone lines were expanded to widely cover even the most remote areas over the following year. Instead of common <b>telephone</b> bell <b>ringers,</b> the first <b>telephones</b> used Morse Code beeps to signal a call. The party line, affectionately known as Beatnik Bell, was eventually enabled in 1974 to route calls via a manual operator interconnect link patch to the outside line. Later, a 500 line Kellogg-ITT Relaymatic rotary dial phone system was installed in PBX configuration, with multiple outside trunk lines gated through a plug-style manual switchboard operator. Basic community CATV cables were later run to some areas along the telephone line paths.|$|R
50|$|The {{essential}} elements of a telephone are a microphone (transmitter) to speak into and an earphone (receiver) which reproduces the voice in a distant location. In addition, most <b>telephones</b> contain a <b>ringer</b> which produces a sound to announce an incoming telephone call, and a dial or keypad used to enter a telephone number when initiating a call to another telephone. Until approximately the 1970s most telephones used a rotary dial, which was superseded by the modern DTMF push-button dial, first introduced to the public by AT&T in 1963. The receiver and transmitter are usually built into a handset which is held up to the ear and mouth during conversation. The dial may be located either on the handset, or on a base unit to which the handset is connected. The transmitter converts the sound waves to electrical signals which are sent through the telephone network to the receiving phone. The receiving telephone converts the signals into audible sound in the receiver, or sometimes a loudspeaker. Telephones permit duplex communication, meaning they allow the people on both ends to talk simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|Phase-wise {{unbalanced}} {{reactive power}} compensations are required in distribution systems for dynamic {{power factor correction}} and terminal voltage stabilization. Shunt compensators are generally used to reduce or cancel the phase-wise unbalanced reactive power (VAR) demand and to minimize the reactive power drawn from the AC supply lines. Static VAR compensators are preferred over traditional VAR compensators for this purpose. The operation of thyristor-controlled compensators at various conduction angles can be used advantageously to meet the unbalanced reactive power demands in a system. However such an operation introduces harmonic currents in to the AC system. In such cases it becomes necessary either to minimize harmonic generation internally or provide external harmonic filters.

30|$|PQ {{measurements}} {{have recently}} {{become an important}} topic {{that has resulted in}} different regulatory documents. An example is the differences between the EN 50160 standard for supply quality and national regulations. The standard requires e.g. RMS voltage within[*]±[*] 10 % limits in relation to the nominal (or declared) value for low voltage networks. However, in some countries, the limits are different, e.g. in France, the admissible change is from − 10 % to + 6 %, and in Spain, it is[*]±[*] 7 %. In addition, the statistical measure differs: the standard requires computation of the 95 and 100 percentiles. The grid codes in Poland for a transmission system require a 99 percentile for flicker and voltage distortion when a wind farm connection is considered. There are also parameters not required in the standard but required in the grid codes, e.g. the THFF (<b>telephone</b> <b>harmonic</b> form factor). The metering interval is also subject to change, e.g. in Norway, a 1  minute interval is used. On the other hand, there is the possibility of change of the limit values, percentile, or even metering interval in the future. This requires additional work in the software of a PQ meter to make the change possible. The real problem arises when non-standard algorithms are required, e.g. the localization of a PQ disturbance source. This functionality is very useful when the introduction of PQ contracts is considered. However, the existing algorithms are not ready for implementation because of lack of efficiency.|$|R
