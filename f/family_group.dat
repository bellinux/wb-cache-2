40|$|The Norwegian Environment Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency have {{developed}} joint Scandinavian guidelines and {{instructions for the}} monitoring of lynx, which have been in use since the winter of 2013 / 2014. Monitoring of the lynx population size and population trends in Scandinavia is primarily conducted through a survey of <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> (adult female lynx with dependent kittens). The number of <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> is estimated every year based on confirmed observations of <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> (tracks in snow, sightingts, pictures or dead kittens). The monitoring is largely based on local participation. Observations such as snow tracks are often found by locals who in turn report these to the State Nature Inspectorate (SNO) in Norway and the county administrative boards in Sweden, which {{are responsible for the}} follow-up and confirmation of observations in the field. The number of <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> is estimated using a set of distance rules derived from radio-telemetry data on home range size and movement rates collected from lynx in Scandinavia, or by distinguishing different <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> in the field. In 2015 / 2016, 273. 5 <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> of lynx were found in Scandinavia (274 different <b>family</b> <b>groups,</b> but 1 of these was found close to the Finnish border and is therefore shared with Finland). 52 <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> were registered in Norway and 221. 5 <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> were registered in Sweden. Based on these numbers the Norwegian population is estimated to be about 310 lynx (95 % CI = 255 – 365). 221. 5 <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> in Sweden corresponds to a population of about 1314 lynx (95 % CI = 1111 – 1516).

40|$|International {{audience}} 1. Understanding {{the evolution}} of subsocial behaviour and parental care requires experimental tests of the functional significance of such behaviours {{and the role of}} tending parents in the maintenance of <b>family</b> <b>groups.</b> Studies in subsocial insects addressing these issues experimentally and in the field are still relatively rare. 2. In such a field experiment, it is demonstrated here that the presence of tending females enhances the maintenance of <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> in common earwigs, Forficula auricularia (Dermaptera; Forficulidae). Experimental removal of tending mothers resulted in substantially decreased recovery of occupied nest burrows and larvae. This effect may have been because of decreased survival among experimental larvae, although a possible role for enhanced larval dispersal could not be fully ruled out. 3. Experimental (motherless) larvae were partly observed in <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> with a tending female, in both experimental and control nest burrows, suggesting that these larvae had been adopted by <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> moving to new nest burrows, and/or that experimental larvae may have actively joined other <b>family</b> <b>groups.</b> 4. This study demonstrates under field conditions the functional importance of maternal attendance for the maintenance of <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> in common earwigs, and suggests that adoption and clutch-joining are factors affecting the social structure of this species...|$|R
5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small <b>family</b> <b>group,</b> or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter. It flies straight or with a slightly undulating pattern, alternating between gliding and flapping its wings with quick shallow beats, at or slightly above {{the level of the}} tree canopy. The red wattlebird moves on the ground by hopping, cocking its tail upwards slightly.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} two years living under {{strained}} conditions in the autumn of 1919 Victoria and Kirill left Finland and went to Germany. In Munich they were reunited with Victoria's mother and the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> moved to Zurich in September 1919. With the death of Victoria's mother, she inherited her villa, Chateau Fabron in Nice and her residence in Coburg, the Edinburg Palais. In the following years the exiled family divided their time between these two places.|$|E
5|$|As {{with local}} Tamils, the {{preferred}} marriage pattern {{is based on}} cross cousin preference. Parallel cousins are considered {{brothers and sisters and}} are ineligible as partners. As most marriages take place between first and second cousins, clan endogamy even it is present is of no value. Within a village, most of the residents are related and this carries on over to villages that are three to five miles away as well. The longer the distance the more distantly are the villagers related to each other. Related lineages also maintain places of worship that are the private property of the <b>family</b> <b>group.</b>|$|E
50|$|Woodland voles live in <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> in burrow {{systems in}} home ranges around 14.75-17.75 in (40-45 cm). The burrows are {{exclusive}} to the <b>family</b> <b>groups,</b> however a group usually {{does not need}} to defend its burrows as other voles usually will not invade them. The size and location of the home range and dispersal of groups are limited by neighboring <b>family</b> <b>groups.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>groups</b> of the vole are made of a breeding female, a breeding male, their 1-4 offspring and sometimes a few other members that serve as helpers. Helpers are immigrants from other groups. Group emigration is uncommon and dependant on whether there are available positions in other groups. Staying in a group as a non-breeding individual is beneficial as burrow systems are major investments and a limited resource.|$|R

5|$|Brolgas are gregarious creatures; {{the basic}} social unit {{is a pair}} or small <b>family</b> <b>group</b> of {{about three or four}} birds, usually parents {{together}} with juvenile offspring, though some of such groups are unrelated. In the non-breeding season, they gather into large flocks, which appear to be many self-contained individual groups rather than a single social unit. Within the flock, families tend to remain separate and to coordinate their activities with one another rather than with the flock as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow forages {{slowly on}} or near the ground by walking or hopping under shrubs or dense grasses. Though it {{occasionally}} forages in weedy areas, it is almost never observed foraging in the open. It has occasionally been observed feeding in branches and low shrubs. During the breeding season, it gleans its food from grasses and low shrubs. However, normally the species obtains its food by either pecking or less frequently scratching at leaf litter. This bird tends to forage in a small <b>family</b> <b>group</b> and in a limited area.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this central}} motif are {{arranged}} elements of eight other stories, {{all of them}} represented {{at least in part}} by sets of footprints. Human footprints include a set left by dancing women from a place called Aileron; another shows a <b>family</b> <b>group</b> travelling to a place called Ngama, and a third trail is that of a Tjungurrayi man, which lead to his skeleton, representing his death after committing the crime of trying to steal sacred items. Animal representations include tracks of a cluster of emus from a place called Napperby, on the artist's country, as well as those left by the rock wallaby, or Mala, men journeying north from Port Augusta in South Australia, as well as, on the left hand edge of the picture, those of two groups of dingoes going to a place called Warrabri. A little closer to the centre of the painting are marks representing a dreaming called the Chase of the Goanna Men.

5|$|Baleen whales, {{primarily}} juveniles and calves, are preyed on by killer whales. It {{is thought}} that annual whale migration occurs to protect the calves from the killer whales. There have also been reports of a pod of killer whales attacking and killing an adult bowhead whale, by holding down its flippers, covering the blowhole, and ramming and biting until death. Generally, a mother and calf pair, {{when faced with the}} threat of a killer whale pod, will either fight or flee. Fleeing only occurs in species that can swim away quickly, the rorquals. Slower whales must fight the pod alone or with a small <b>family</b> <b>group.</b> There has been one report of a shark attacking and killing a whale calf. This occurred in 2014 during the sardine run when a shiver of dusky sharks attacked a humpback whale calf. Usually, the only shark that will attack a whale is the cookie cutter shark, which leaves a small, non-fatal bite mark.|$|E
5|$|Breeding occurs {{from late}} August through to January, though heavy rain in August may delay this. The nest is {{built by the}} female; it is a round or domed {{structure}} made of loosely woven grasses and spider webs, with an entrance in one side {{close to the ground}} and well-concealed in thick and often thorny vegetation, such as Acacia pulchella or a species of Hakea. One or two broods may be laid during the breeding season. A clutch of two to four dull white eggs with reddish-brown splotches and spots, measuring 12 × 16mm (½×⅝in), are laid. Incubation takes about two weeks. The female incubates the eggs for 14 or 15days; after hatching, nestlings are fed and their fecal sacs removed by all group members for 10–13days, by which time they are fledged. Young birds remain in the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> as helpers {{for a year or more}} before moving to another group, usually an adjacent one, or assuming a dominant position in the original group. In this role they feed and care for subsequent broods.|$|E
5|$|During battle, {{the player}} can {{converse}} with enemies, {{though they are}} restricted to a single set of dialogue options instead of four as in the original Persona. If the player succeeds in talking with the enemy using the right character, it both causes the enemy to leave the battlefield and gains a spell card (a Tarot card linked {{to one of the}} Arcanum or family of Personas), which can be used to create Personas in a location called the Velvet Room. In the Velvet Room, the player can summon a new Persona that belongs to a spell card's particular Persona <b>family</b> <b>group.</b> As a character gains experience levels, more powerful Personas from a spell card's group become available. In addition to pre-set spell cards, the player can also obtain blank skill cards by forming contracts with enemies through the right conversation. These blank skill cards can be tailored to fit a chosen Persona family.|$|E
5|$|Elephants have a fission–fusion {{society in}} which {{multiple}} <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> come together to socialise. Males ("bulls") leave their <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> when they reach puberty and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased testosterone and aggression known as musth, which helps them gain dominance and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their <b>family</b> <b>groups</b> and rely on their mothers {{for as long as}} three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell, and sound; elephants use infrasound, and seismic communication over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of primates and cetaceans. They appear to have self-awareness and show empathy for dying or dead individuals of their kind.|$|R

5|$|In December 1831 Yagan and {{his father}} led the first {{significant}} Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's <b>family</b> <b>group.</b> A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began {{to break through the}} mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees {{to be part of the}} settlers' groups. Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law. Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.|$|E
5|$|On 27 August 1997, a {{delegation}} of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, Robert Bropho, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation {{was to have been}} larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the Supreme Court of Western Australia for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his <b>family</b> <b>group</b> has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.|$|E
5|$|Stephen had {{at least}} four {{brothers}} and one sister, along with two probable half-sisters. Stephen's eldest brother was William, who under normal circumstances would have ruled the county. William was probably intellectually disabled, and Adela instead had the title passed over him to her second son, Theobald, who went on later to acquire the county of Champagne as well as Blois and Chartres. Stephen's remaining older brother, Odo, died young, probably in his early teens. His younger brother, Henry of Blois, was probably born four years after him. The brothers formed a close-knit <b>family</b> <b>group,</b> and Adela encouraged Stephen {{to take up the}} role of a feudal knight, whilst steering Henry towards a career in the church, possibly so that their personal career interests would not overlap. Unusually, Stephen was raised in his mother's household rather than being sent to a close relative; he was taught Latin and riding, and was educated in recent history and Biblical stories by his tutor, William the Norman.|$|E

Muhammad Sharif and the Mahdi's two sons were found guilty by a court martial trial and were shot.|$|E
5|$|The red-backed fairywren mainly eats insects, and {{supplements}} its {{diet with}} seed and small fruit. The preferred habitat is heathland and savannah, particularly where low shrubs and tall grasses provide cover. It can be nomadic {{in areas where}} there are frequent bushfires, although pairs or small groups of birds maintain and defend territories year-round {{in other parts of}} its range. Groups consist of a socially monogamous pair with one or more helper birds who assist in raising the young. These helpers are progeny that have attained sexual maturity yet remain with the <b>family</b> <b>group</b> for one or more years after fledging. The red-backed fairywren is sexually promiscuous, and each partner may mate with other individuals and even assist in raising the young from such pairings.
