2500|$|The Zn-world {{theory has}} been further filled out with {{experimental}} and theoretical evidence for the ionic constitution of {{the interior of the}} first proto-cells before archaea, bacteria and proto-eukaryotes evolved. Archibald Macallum noted the resemblance of body fluids such as blood and lymph to seawater; however, the inorganic composition of all cells differ from that of modern seawater, which led Mulkidjanian and colleagues to reconstruct the [...] "hatcheries" [...] of the first cells combining geochemical analysis with phylogenomic scrutiny of the inorganic ion requirements of universal components of modern cells. The authors conclude that ubiquitous, and by inference primordial, proteins and functional systems show affinity to and <b>functional</b> <b>requirement</b> for K+, Zn2+, Mn2+, and phosphate. Geochemical reconstruction shows that the ionic composition conducive to the origin of cells could not have existed in what we today call marine settings but is compatible with emissions of vapour-dominated zones of what we today call inland geothermal systems. Under the oxygen depleted, CO2-dominated primordial atmosphere, the chemistry of water condensates and exhalations near geothermal fields would resemble the internal milieu of modern cells. Therefore, the precellular stages of evolution may have taken place in shallow [...] "Darwin ponds" [...] lined with porous silicate minerals mixed with metal sulfides and enriched in K+, Zn2+, and phosphorus compounds.|$|E

50|$|As {{defined in}} <b>requirements</b> engineering, <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> specify {{particular}} {{results of a}} system. This should be contrasted with non-functional requirements which specify overall characteristics such as cost and reliability. <b>Functional</b> <b>requirements</b> drive the application architecture of a system, while non-functional requirements drive the technical architecture of a system. In some cases a requirements analyst generates use cases after gathering and validating a set of <b>functional</b> <b>requirements.</b> The hierarchy of <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> is: user/stakeholder request → feature → use case → business rule. Each use case illustrates behavioral scenarios through one or more <b>functional</b> <b>requirements.</b> Often, though, an analyst will begin by eliciting a set of use cases, from which the analyst can derive the <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> that must be implemented to allow a user to perform each use case.|$|R

2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and they know where to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them wondering what the apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the <b>functional</b> <b>requirement</b> (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E
