40|$|Mountain {{landscape}} is {{the environment of}} agriculture in Trentino. Most of the hectarage is of high quality products like apples (11, 500 hectares), grapes (10, 000 hectares) and lesser extent small fruits and vegetables. There is a strong co-operative spirit, and many activities are conducted in partnership form. APOT (Association of Fruit and Vegetable Producers in Trentino) is a second degree Producers’ Organization of about 10, 000 farms. Average size of farms is 1. 5 hectares and, {{as a form of}} income integration, part-time model characterizes about 50 % of them. Many housing districts are placed in sparsely among apple orchards and vineyards. Due to this condition the rural population has become more and more sensitive to issues related to spray drift. About 8, 000 sprayers are in use on orchards and vineyards. To achieve a better efficacy of treatments and rationalize use of chemicals, APOT in accordance with the local Government has decided to start the <b>inspection</b> <b>activity</b> since 1997.

Using two mobile test stations until now nearly 10, 000 checks have been carried out (many sprayers have been checked twice or more). In compliance with Directive 2009 / 128 /CE will also be organized activities for the control of sprayers used for weed control on localized application and for those in minor crops.

40|$|In this article, {{we measure}} {{the impact of}} on-site safety {{inspections}} on the frequency of work-related injury and death in the Alberta construction sector, 1987 - 92. The data are disaggregated by subindustry allowing different risk levels {{to be associated with}} different work activities. In our sample, there is a dramatic decrease in <b>inspection</b> <b>activity</b> which allows us to assess the necessity for continuing with current levels of inspection effort. We find that on-site safety inspections have no effect on the risk of accident and injury but do have a positive effect in reducing the number of work-related fatalities.

30|$|In summary, {{we found}} that the use of the perspective-based ERP {{heuristics}} (HPERP) to evaluate the usability of medium-fidelity prototypes can improve the performance of novice-inspectors (RQ 4), and can identify effectively the major usability issues in ERP systems (RQ 5). And, in the case of functional modules, both methods – HPERP and HN – can be considered similar in their efficiency and effectiveness. Further, upon concluding of the <b>inspection</b> <b>activity,</b> the participants were invited to answer a questionnaire based on model called TAM (Davis 1989), aiming to identify factors involved in satisfaction of individuals regarding the acceptance and use of the inspection technique. From this questionnaire, {{we found that}} no participant had doubts about the usefulness of the technique, and though some difficulties encountered, the majority of participants agrees that the technique was easy to use and understand.|$|R

40|$|In {{software}} product lines (SPL), scoping is a phase responsible for capturing, specifying and modeling features, and also their constraints, interactions and variations. The feature specification task, performed in this phase, is usually based on natural language, which {{may lead to}} lack of clarity, non-conformities and defects. Consequently, scoping analysts may introduce ambiguity, inconsistency, omissions and non-conformities. In this sense, this paper aims at gathering evidence {{about the effects of}} applying an inspection approach to feature specification for SPL. Data from a SPL reengineering project were analyzed in this work and the analysis indicated that the correction activity demanded more effort. Also, Pareto's principle showed that incompleteness and ambiguity reported higher non-conformity occurrences. Finally, the Poisson regression analysis showed that sub-domain risk information can be a good indicator for prioritization of sub-domains in the <b>inspection</b> <b>activity...</b>|$|R

40|$|The final thesis {{describes}} legislative {{development of}} the Czech Republic defining the state fire supervision. Next, it presents working aids which are used to unify the process of performing <b>inspection</b> <b>activity</b> within the state fire supervision. In addition, it presents individual steps involved in performing the fire inspection. There were set two hypotheses which correspond to {{the objective of the}} thesis. The aim of the thesis was to examine whether the number of performed fire inspections is sufficient considering the number of legal entities and natural persons conducting business activity in the Czech Republic. The practical part was elaborated in the form of qualitative research. The study group included the number of performed fire inspections within the state fire supervision of legal entities and natural persons conducting business activity, the number of members performing <b>inspection</b> <b>activity</b> and the number of legal entities and natural persons conducting business activity registered in registers of economic entities from 2001 to 2011. The research shows that if we checked all the economic entities in the Czech Republic during the fixed period, the repeated average period between fire inspections would be approximately 206 years. The average period of this enormous cycle has been decreasing since 2001 annually for about 5 years. To increase the efficiency of control activity I would suggest establishing a working group at the General Directorate of Fire Rescue Service of the Czech Republic which would determine according to the risk analysis the risk of performed activities, occurrence of large number of people and activities relevant to the functions of the state or the region, which establishments will be checked, in which periods and what kind of fire inspection will be performed. Therefore, it is necessary to create an integrated information and communication system which enables to store data and documents and follows the procedure of all departments of FRS CR focusing on prevention in similar cases...|$|R
