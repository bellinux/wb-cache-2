Smith, {{the director}} of Princeton University Press, {{about the possibility of}} renting his printing plant to the government during a two-week summer shutdown so that Smyth could produce 5,000 copies of a top secret report. Smith’s response was that he found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> anyone needing to print 5,000 copies of a top secret report. He found it much easier to imagine delays due to unexpected printing problems, and his workers returning from summer vacation to find themselves locked out of a plant filled with top secret material. Under the circumstances, he felt that he could not risk this.|$|E
5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had grown too big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in L.A. but <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> elsewhere back then.|$|E

From the New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale the walker can climb either via Stickle Tarn or up the ravine of White Gill. From Grasmere, Easedale Tarn is the preliminary objective. From here Blea Crag can be outflanked on either side to arrive on the summit ridge to the east or west of the summit.

25|$|Another {{argument}} Al-Khoei {{brings up}} {{in favor of}} the Quran is that by the time ‘Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread {{to such an extent that}} it was impossible for him, or even for anyone more powerful than him, to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered. In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> that they did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it. Uthman could have altered the text, but he would have been unable to remove the Quran from the hearts of the Muslims who had memorized it.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea that}} {{animal and plant}} species were not constant, but changed over time, was {{suggested}} {{as far back as}} the 18th century.

A weakness of Darwin's work, however, was the lack of palaeontological evidence, as pointed out by Darwin himself. While it is easy <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> natural selection producing the variation seen within genera and families, the transmutation between the higher categories was <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine.</b> The dramatic find of the London specimen of Archaeopteryx in 1861, only two years after the publication of Darwin's work, offered for the first time a link between the class of the highly derived birds, and that of the more primitive reptiles.

30|$|Some {{types of}} lexical change are, {{by their very}} definition, much more {{unlikely}} in a language with an alphabetic writing system. Symbolic loans are loanwords in which both the written form and the meaning are borrowed without the pronunciation. This category of lexical development is much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> in languages with an alphabet than in those with a logographic script. Nevertheless, one—admittedly not very recent—example of such a loan in English is the German loan BMW (= Bayerische Motorenwerke).

40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of enzymes display cooperativity in binding ligand molecules, and such effects have an important impact on metabolic regulation. This is easiest to understand {{in the case of}} positive cooperativity. Sharp responses to changes in metabolite concentrations can allow organisms to better respond to environmental changes and maintain metabolic homeostasis. However, despite the fact that negative cooperativity is almost as common as positive, it has been <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> what advantages it provides. Here we use computational models to explore the utility of negative cooperativity in one particular context: that of an inhibitor binding to an enzyme. We identify several factors which may contribute, and show that acting together they can make negative cooperativity advantageous...|$|R

5000|$|Ouroboros and the Trilogy do share {{references}} to one character, this same Lessingham; he {{appears in the}} [...] "Induction" [...] to Ouroboros, and {{as a sort of}} ghost or immaterial astral being in the first chapter, and thereafter discreetly disappears. An apparently identical character appears in Mistress of Mistresses and is much more fully described in A Fish Dinner in Memison. Another character, also called Lessingham, is a main character in Mistress of Mistresses, but the Lessingham of Zimiamvia and the Lessingham of Earth, though connected, are two different people. Judging from Fish Dinner, we should perhaps regard the Lessingham of Zimiamvia as the original, and the Lessingham of Earth as a projection of him.

40|$|Hyperventilation {{is often}} {{conceived}} of {{as part of a}} fight-or-flight response, triggered by situations with high arousal and negative valence. However, a previous study using emotional imagery found hyperventilation responses during imagery of high-arousal scenes regardless of their valence. Those imagery scripts contained suggestions of autonomic activity, which may have partly induced or enhanced the hyperventilatory responsivity. The present study used four emotional scripts [...] depicting relaxing, fearful, depressive, and pleasant situations [...] without suggestions of autonomic or respiratory responses. After each imagery trial, participants rated their imagery for valence, arousal, and vividness. Fractional end-tidal carbon dioxide (FetCO 2), inspiratory and expiratory time, tidal volume, and pulse rate were measured in a non-intrusive way. Results showed significant FetCO 2 drops during the fearful and pleasant scripts. However, this effect was much smaller compared to imagery scripts with autonomic response propositions.

40|$|Bar-Hillel and Neter (1996) {{found that}} {{although}} {{people are willing}} to trade identical objects, they are reluctant to trade identical lottery tickets. Is this simply {{due to the fact that}} these are gambles? It was found that if the value of the tickets is guaranteed to be ex-post, not just ex ante, identical, people are more willing to exchange them. Indeed, just the possibility of ex-post difference between the lottery tickets induces as much reluctance to exchange them as when ex-post difference is guaranteed. In addition, this study examines how the vividness of lottery tickets influences the willingness to trade them. Specifically, it examines whether people are equally reluctant to exchange lottery tickets (when given a bonus for doing so) when they cannot even distinguish between them (e. g., when the tickets are concealed in envelopes). When one cannot see the ticket, it is less vivid and it is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> it winning.

40|$|Conceptual {{features}} {{differ in}} how mentally tranformable they are. A robin {{that does not}} eat is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> than a robin that does not chirp. We argue that features are immutable {{to the extent that}} they are central in a network of dependency relations. The immutability of a feature reflects how much the internal structure of a concept depends on that feature; i. e., how much the feature contributes to the concept's coherence. Complementarily, mutability reflects the aspects in which a concept is flexible. We show that features can be reliably ordered according to their mutability using tasks that require people to conceive of objects missing a feature, and that mutability (conceptual centrality) can be distinguished from category centrality and from diagnosticity and salience. We test a model of mutability based on asymmetric, unlabeled, pairwise dependency relations. With no free parameters, the model provides reasonable fits to data. Qualitative tests of the model show that mutability judgments are unaffected by the type of dependency relation and that dependency structure influences judgments of variability...|$|R
