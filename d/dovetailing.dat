25|$|<b>Dovetailing</b> {{these data}} {{suggests}} Hipparchus extrapolated the 158 B. C. E. June 26 solstice from his 145 solstice 12 years later {{a procedure that}} would cause only minuscule error. The papyrus also confirmed that Hipparchus had used Callippic solar motion in 158 B. C. E., a new finding in 1991 but not attested directly until P. Fouad 267 A. Another table on the papyrus is perhaps for sidereal motion and a third table is for Metonic tropical motion, using a previously unknown year of 365 1/4 – 1/309 days. This was presumably found by dividing the 274 years from 432 to 158 B. C. E., into the corresponding interval of 100077 days and 14 3/4 hours between Meton's sunrise and Hipparchus's sunset solstices.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{initially}} intended that Sam {{would save}} Dean from Hell, possibly even before [...] "No Rest for the Wicked", by {{giving in to}} his demonic powers and becoming [...] "this fully operational dark force" [...] who would then want to go after Lilith. The battle would have been [...] "much more climactic", with the Winchesters [...] "going to war to save Dean's life". By {{the middle of the}} season, however, the writers realized the costs associated with depicting such an engagement and scaled it down. To make matters worse, the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike prevented them from fleshing out Sam's evolving abilities throughout the season, and his entire story arc was pushed back into the fourth season. With Sam's storyline no longer <b>dovetailing</b> with Dean's, the writers [...] " [...] any doubt in [...] minds" [...] to send Dean to Hell. Kripke disliked that the second-season finale [...] "just ended", and he felt that this episode provided a cliffhanger ending that had people [...] "biting their nails". Although the viewers' expectations that Dean would be saved was [...] "reason enough", his imprisonment in Hell also served as a [...] "turning point" [...] for both the character and the series. Kripke commented, [...] "You need huge moves to happen that can cause radical shifts in the characters, that set them off in a new direction.

50|$|Since <b>dovetail</b> slides {{have such}} a large surface contact area, a greater force is {{required}} to move the saddle than other linear slides, which results in slower acceleration rates. Additionally, <b>dovetail</b> slides have difficulties with high-friction but are advantageous {{when it comes to}} load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, <b>dovetail</b> slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and dirt contamination. <b>Dovetail</b> slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric <b>dovetail</b> slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as ball screws, belts and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. <b>Dovetail</b> slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC machines, shuttle devices, special machines and work holding devices.

[...] King Carol I himself was ridiculed, and aware of it, but took no measure to suppress Ranetti. Some of Furnicas most noted collaborators were visual artists: Ion Theodorescu-Sion, Camil Ressu, Iosif Iser, Francisc Șirato, Nicolae Petrescu Găină, and Ary Murnu—the latter remembered especially for his routine mockery of Ioan Kalinderu, administrator of the crown domains. The articles and caricatures were more lenient toward actor Ion Brezeanu, who was the other stock character in Furnica humor.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, as {{relates to}} the {{placement}} of this sura within the Quran as a whole, Neal Robinson notes what {{he refers to as}} the [...] "dovetailing" [...] of suras. Based on this idea of structure, one sura ends with a topic that is immediately picked up in the next sura. The Family of 'Imran, sura 3, includes a discussion of male and female {{near the end of the}} sura (3.195). This theme continues at the beginning of sura 4: [...] "People, be mindful of your Lord, who created you from a single soul, and from it created its mate, and from the pair of them spread countless men and women far and wide; be mindful of God, in whose name you make requests of one another."

2500|$|The civil engineer, John Smeaton, {{rebuilt the}} {{lighthouse}} from 1756–59; his tower marked {{a major step}} forward in the design of lighthouses and remained in use until 1877. He modelled the shape of his lighthouse on that of an oak tree, using granite blocks. He rediscovered and used [...] "hydraulic lime," [...] a form of concrete that will set under water used by the Romans, and developed a technique of securing the granite blocks together using dovetail joints and marble dowels. The <b>dovetailing</b> feature served to improve the structural stability, although Smeaton also had to taper the thickness of the tower towards the top, for which he curved the tower inwards on a gentle gradient. This profile had the added advantage of allowing some of the energy of the waves to dissipate on impact with the walls. His lighthouse was the prototype for the modern lighthouse and influenced all subsequent engineers.|$|E

2500|$|Art therapy {{can take}} place in a variety of {{different}} settings.

After an assessment of the client's strengths and needs, art therapy may be offered in either an individual or group format, according to which is better suited to the person. [...] Art therapist Dr. Ellen G. Horovitz wrote, [...] "My responsibilities vary from job to job. It is wholly different when one works as a consultant or in an agency as opposed to private practice. In private practice, it becomes more complex and far reaching.

2500|$|Eingreif is {{generally}} translated as counter-attack but the term had other connotations. In German military thinking, it included {{a sense of}} intervening and is better understood as interlocking or <b>dovetailing,</b> in which the Eingreifdivision came {{under the command of}} the Stellungsdivision and joined with the defensive garrison and its fortifications. The term was adopted during the Battle of Arras (9 April – 16 May 1917) to replace [...] (relief division), to end confusion over the purpose of divisions held in readiness. There were also calls for each Stellungsdivision to have the support of an Eingreifdivision but Ludendorff could not find sufficient divisions for this. J. E. Edmonds, the British official historian, called the divisions special reserve or super counter-attack divisions. Such methods required large numbers of reserve divisions, ready to counter-attack, which were obtained by creating [...] divisions, moving some divisions from the eastern front and Operation Alberich (Unternehmen Alberich) in March 1917, which shortened the front.

At Arras similarly obsolete defences over-manned by infantry, were devastated by artillery and swiftly overrun, leaving the local reserves with little choice but to try to contain further British advances and wait for the relief divisions, which were too far away to counter-attack. Seven German divisions were defeated, losing [...] and [...] on 9 April. Given the two failures and the imminence of the French offensive on the Aisne, the term [...] was dropped in favour of Eingreif division, a term with connotations of interlocking and <b>dovetailing,</b> to avoid the impression that they were replacement divisions standing by, rather than reinforcements fundamental to the defence of the battle zones, by operating support of the local garrisons of the [...] A more practical change, was the despatch of Loßberg from his post as Chief of Staff of the German 1st Army, (due to move south to join the armies on the Aisne) to the 6th Army, replacing Nagel on 11 April.
