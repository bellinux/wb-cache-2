The need to improve and optimize the finished product made it essential to gain more knowledge about the process, types of defects that may occur and the reasons for them. Moreover, the solutions for reducing the shortcomings in continuous casting process have been an intriguing subject to study. Many attempts have been done in order to reach this goal.

The significant content of magnesium as the alloying element with low boiling point and high vapor pressure inside the AA 5083 matrix can induce the spatter formation and depression on surface of the weld beads upon laser beam absorption and temperature growth which can deteriorate the mechanical properties and appearance of the joints. To reduce these defects, a variety of single and multi-components activating fluxes including oxide-based TiO 2 and halide-based CaF 2 <b>flux</b> <b>powders</b> were pre-placed on the surface of welding material prior to laser welding. The EDX and XRD analyses in addition to microhardness and shear tests were carried out to characterize the joints.

It was deduced that the simultaneous effect of significant decrease in joints' surface depression leading to welds' geometry improvement in addition to less formation of interfacial Fe-Al intermetallics, were the major causes for considerable strength improvements.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{in this work}} were to develop, calibrate, and apply a model to predict ideal taper profiles down the narrow faces of the SIDERAR slab casting mold for several different casting speeds, steel grades, <b>flux</b> <b>powder</b> compositions, and widths. A significant amount of original research was undertaken for this challenging problem. A finite difference model of transient 1 -D heat conduction and solidification in the slab casting mold and shell was developed: CON 1 D. The model has been enhanced to make shell shrinkage and ideal taper predictions in slab molds, including narrow-face distortion and wide-face expansion. The CON 1 D model was calibrated to match the heat extraction rates for the wide face of the SIDERAR slab-casting mold under several casting conditions.

40|$|Abstract The recent {{trend in}} low {{temperature}} co-fired ceramic (LTCC) technology is to integrate more elements into multilayer modules. This thesis describes work specifically aimed at developing ferroelectric barium strontium titanate (BST) for integration into such modules. In particular, an objective was {{the development of}} a novel, electric field controlled, tunable component to be used at microwave frequencies (2 – 26 GHz). For the application envisaged, relative permittivity is required to be low (100 – 1000) and adjustable by a suitable applied electric field, the dissipation factor at room temperature must be low (~ 0. 001) at 2 – 26 GHz, and most importantly, the sintering temperature must be suited to the LTCC technology (~ 900  °C) Initial work was focused on sol-gel derived Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 powders with boron oxide addition, which were sintered at 900  °C, the dissipation factor was 0. 006. The dissipation factor was not low enough for the desired microwave application, and attention turned to powders prepared by the mixed-oxide route. The Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 <b>powders,</b> <b>fluxed</b> with the optimum amounts of boron oxide and lithium carbonate, could be sintered at 890  °C to the same density as is achieved with un-fluxed Ba 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 TiO 3 sintered at 1360  °C. The dissipation factor for this <b>fluxed</b> <b>powder</b> was acceptably low, although permittivity was too high for the particular objective. Subsequently, research was on BST modified by magnesia, 0. 4 Ba 0. 55 Sr 0. 45 TiO 3 - 0. 6 MgO (BSTM). With the optimum fluxing additives, the sintering temperature necessary to achieve a dense BSTM-based ceramic was reduced to 950  °C. The developed microstructure was good, and the relative permittivity and dissipation factor values (221, 0. 0012 at 1 kHz) at room temperature indicated good microwave properties. Studies were also undertaken with organic-based tape-casting slurries, laminating procedures and burn-out and sintering schedules. Several kinds of tapes were fabricated and characterized. A test structure for the measurement of dielectric properties at 26 GHz of the optimized BSTM-based ceramic was constructed. The specimen was 50 μm thick layer of BST on an alumina substrate. The relative permittivity and tunability were 130 and > 15 % at 4 V μm- 1 at room temperature. A tunable phase-shifter was fabricated from the same BSTM-based tape using a novel gravure printing technique, and measurements at 26 GHz showed phase shift from 10 to 35 ° when the electric field was increased from 1 V μm- 1 to 2. 5 V μm- 1.

50|$|Unless brazing {{operations}} are contained within an inert or reducing atmosphere environment (i.e. a vacuum furnace), a flux such as borax {{is required to}} prevent oxides from forming while the metal is heated. The flux also serves the purpose of cleaning any contamination left on the brazing surfaces. Flux can be applied {{in any number of}} forms including <b>flux</b> paste, liquid, <b>powder</b> or pre-made brazing pastes that combine flux with filler metal <b>powder.</b> <b>Flux</b> can also be applied using brazing rods with a coating of flux, or a flux core. In either case, the flux flows into the joint when applied to the heated joint and is displaced by the molten filler metal entering the joint. Excess flux should be removed when the cycle is completed because flux left in the joint can lead to corrosion, impede joint inspection, and prevent further surface finishing operations. Phosphorus-containing brazing alloys can be self-fluxing when joining copper to copper.Fluxes are generally selected based on their performance on particular base metals. To be effective, the flux must be chemically compatible with both the base metal and the filler metal being used. Self-fluxing phosphorus filler alloys produce brittle phosphides if used on iron or nickel. As a general rule, longer brazing cycles should use less active fluxes than short brazing operations.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a fluid dynamics {{model of a}} continuous caster mould region, including the transient behaviour of the steel/slag interface. The research {{was carried out in}} collaboration with ArcelorMittal Research (AMR), based in Maizieres-les-Metz in France. The industrial objective of the thesis was to understand the factors affecting the transient behaviour of the liquid slag layer covering the steel and its interaction with the Submerged Entry Nozzle (SEN) jet supplying the steel from the tundish to the Continuous Casting (CC) mould. The study includes the very complex phenomenon of argon bubble transport which also affects the behaviour of the slag layer and SEN jet. The model developed in this study is based on the finite volume method with the liquid regions (steel, slag) solved in an Eulerian scheme on a fixed unstructured mesh. The interface behaviour is modelled using a number of VOF type schemes, including the time-efficient Counter Diffusion Method (CDM). A coupled Lagrangian particle tracking scheme is used to represent the presence of argon bubbles and their influence on the flowfield (mainly due to buoyancy) in conjunction with the fluctuating surface dynamics. The bulk of the research concerns comparisons against flowfield and interface data obtained from an experimental water/oil study of the process. However, the model is extended to include predictions of heat transfer and phase change in the steel and <b>flux</b> <b>powder</b> regions in an industrial CC unit and validation against available data. The three-phase model is developed making use of the unstructured mesh multi-physics finite volume code PHYSICA [1]. As stated, the main goal of this particular work {{has to do with the}} study of the dynamic behaviour of the steel/slag interface, including the effects of casting speed and injected gas. Because of the great difficulty in physical experiments with a real caster, the research is supported with water model experiments and mathematical simulation. Comparisons of observed interface profiles, measured and predicted mean and fluctuating velocities, gave an insight to the degree of coupling between interface behaviour and the fluid dynamics within the mould region. In particular, a spectral analysis of the dominant fluctuation frequencies in the water/oil experiment suggests a strong link between the upper and lower recirculation loops generated by the SEN jet as it splits after contact with the narrow face for the mould. The presence of gas bubbles alters the spectral picture, since the buoyancy induced in the flow affects the behaviour of the jet, leading to the one/two loop behaviour known from experiments. Good qualitative and quantitative agreement was achieved between the numerical results and water-model experimental data. The main observations drawn from the water model simulation and experiment are as follows: - An increase in casting speed, which is equivalent to an increase in SEN velocity leads to an increase in the amplitude of interfacial fluctuations. - At the highest SEN velocities, the oil layer is pushed away from the narrow ends of the mould, exposing the water surface to air. - When there is no oil on top of the water surface, the surface remains for all practical purpose flat. - Air entering through the SEN influences the flowfield in the mould and also disturbs the oil/water interface when it passes through it. - The ratio of water to air flow rate seems to be the most important parameter, with high air/water flow ratios leading to a change in flowfield at the top of the mould as the gas buoyancy lifts the SEN jet towards the surface. To achieve a good correlation between the experiments and the simulations a number of factors in the numerics were found to be important. These are: - The quality of the mesh used, especially in the complex transition from the SEN geometry – essentially a cylinder with two outlets set at a specific angle of 20 o to the vertical, to the thin rectangular geometry of the mould which is designed to cast flat products. - The turbulence model, which was initially found to suppress interface oscillations whenever an oil layer was introduced. Various approaches were followed to overcome this problem, (a) removing the turbulence model from the oil layer, (b) using a low frequency filter to remove resolved turbulence kinetic energy from the k-ε model, (c) opting for the high order SMART numerical scheme in preference to the default Hybrid. - The interface tracking algorithm used as a default in the code PHYSICA is essentially a VOF technique with options for a Van-Leer (TVD) scheme [2] or alternative the popular Donor Acceptor scheme [3, 4], both options work well but they are explicit and therefore extremely expensive computationally. Due to the size of the mesh and the CFL limit for stability, timesteps as small as 10 - 3 s become necessary, meaning a 600 s simulation could take up to 8 weeks! To overcome this, the implicit CDM scheme [5] was used, which allows the interface to spread by diffusion but then pushed back against the gradient to re-sharpen at the end of each timestep. With this scheme, timesteps up to 2 orders of magnitude larger become possible, the limit then governed by the frequency range to be resolved. A non-standard approach to the Lagrangian particle tracking scheme was adopted in the simulation with the following characteristics: - The amount of gas entering was divided into packets of equal bubble diameter and then each packet was further divided into individual tracks. The transport of 1000 and more particles tracks was used to ensure a realistic dispersion. - Tracks were updated at regular time intervals (but not necessarily at each Eulerian timestep) and then followed until they exited the calculation domain. - The residence time of particles in each cell provided information for the gas content of the cell and therefore its density. With this approach, the Navier-Stokes equations then solve for mixture (gas and liquid) and lighter cells are influenced by buoyancy. - The bubble tracks are affected by the mean velocity of the surrounding fluid and also by a stochastic component derived from the turbulence model. However, there is no direct feedback to fluid turbulence from the bubbles. To extend simulations to a real caster, heat transfer and phase change were introduced in the model, in addition to the property changes (water to steel, oil to slag, air to argon). Of importance here was the development of a solidified skin of steel on the water-cooled mould walls and also the melting of <b>flux</b> <b>powder</b> into a liquid layer on the top surface. This last component of the research was introduced to enable comparisons against plant data obtained by AMR. Of particular interest in this study was the transition from a double to a single roll recirculation in the top section of the mould, as a function of the relative quality of argon entering the SEN. The model was able to reproduce this behaviour for the cases studied. Although much has been done in developing this model of the continuous casting process it is evident that much more research is needed, especially in the case of a real caster. For example, the thermophysical property variations in the slag due to temperature, composition and mass transfer were ignored. A very simple approach was used for the phase change in steel and <b>flux</b> <b>powder,</b> although since the PHYSICA framework is modular, more sophisticated alternatives can be easily introduced. The boundary conditions for heat transfer remain uncertain and the values used in this study were obtained from the industrial partner from earlier experiments. In spite the aforementioned limitations, the model is very useful, especially in understanding the dynamic interactions between the SEN jets, and the slag/steel interface and in this respect in advance of other models used by industry...|$|R

40|$|The laser {{cladding}} process is mainly {{determined by the}} applied <b>powder</b> <b>flux,</b> the laser beam intensity, and the feed rate {{as well as by}} the strongly interacting influences of heat flow, free surface shape, and surface tension gradient driven (Marangoni) flow in the melt pool. Convection due to superheating may be responsible for undesired dilution of the bead with the substrate material. A quasi-stationary state temperature field is calculated by means of Rosenthal's solution, assuming some low energy surface shape for the liquid head of a single track bead. This shape is analytically described with free parameters which have to be determined from the <b>powder</b> <b>flux</b> and the feed rate and by fitting iteratively the temperature condition at the border line between the melted part of the bead and the substrate. The Marangoni flow essentially modifies the primary surface heat source density caused by the laser beam and the impinging preheated powder particles and, therefore, has a large influence on heat transfer and temperature gradients in the melt pool, particularly on its surface. Hence the temperature field, the fluid flow velocity at the melt pool surface and the unknown parameters of the bead geometry have to be calculated iteratively in a selfconsistent manner. The simulation is to visualize the origin of various possible failures during the cladding process and of the resulting lacks in the quality of treatment such as insufficient heating of the melt pool, poor bonding between substrate and bead, or too large a dilution of the bead with the substrate material.

The high strength and fracture toughness are attributed to the interaction between the glass and clay residues upon sintering, which allows the development of several different crystalline phases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{analytical}} {{two dimensional}} temperature field for a spherical metal powder particle subjected to Gaussian heat flux is derived. The particle {{is considered to}} be spherical, homogeneous and isotropic with time-independent thermal properties. The heat transfer equation is solved, the temperature distribution in the spherical particle is derived, the 3 -D temperature charts are drawn, the results are compared with available resources and good agreements have been observed. As several conduction heat transfer problems can be modeled by a sphere subjected to Gaussian heat flux, the results are used to approximate the problems and the time consuming complex numerical calculations avoided. Good example for this problem is Rapid prototyping with low frequency Selective Electrical Discharge Sintering (SEDS). In SEDS, electrical plasma arcs provide the thermal energy for initial binding. Binding is a heat transfer process from the energy source to the raw material which cause the separated particles to unify. Heat <b>fluxes</b> entering the <b>powder</b> particle from concentrated energy sources such as electrical plasma arcs or lasers have Gaussian distribution. Metal powder which is used as raw material in SEDS process is considered as spherical particle...|$|R
40|$|This study investigates binder {{distribution}} in wet granulation {{and focuses on}} the nucleation zone, which is {{the area where the}} liquid binder and powder surface come into contact and form the initial nuclei. An equipment independent parameter, dimensionless spray flux Psi (a), is defined to characterise the most important process parameters in the nucleation process: solution flowrate, <b>powder</b> <b>flux,</b> and binder drop size. Ex-granulator experiments are used to study the relationship between dimensionless spray flux, process variables and the coverage of binder fluid on the powder surface. Lactose monohydrate powder on a variable speed riffler passed under a flat spray once only. Water and 7 % HPC solution at two spray pressures were used as binders. Experiments with red dye and image analysis demonstrate that changes in dimensionless spray flux correlate with a measurable difference in powder surface coverage. Nucleation experiments show that spray flux controls {{the size and shape of}} the nuclei size distribution. At low Psi (a), the system operates in the drop controlled regime, where one drop forms one nucleus and the nuclei size distribution is narrow. At higher Psi (a), the powder surface cakes creating a broader size distribution. For controlled nucleation with the narrowest possible size distribution, it is recommended that the dimensionless spray flux be less than 0. 1 to be in the drop-controlled regime.

40|$|The {{additive}} manufacturing technique of laser direct metal deposition (DMD) {{has had an}} impact in rapid prototyping, tooling and small-volume manufacturing applications. Components are built from metallic materials that are deposited by the continuous injection of powder into a moving melt pool, created by a defocused laser beam. The size of the melt pool, the temperature distributions around it and the <b>powder</b> <b>flux</b> are critical in determining process characteristics such as deposition rate. In this paper, the effects that changes in {{the distance between the}} laser deposition head and the melt pool have on these factors as a part is built using a coaxial powder feeding system are considered Via a two-part analytical model. A heat flow model considers three-dimensional temperature distributions due to a moving Gaussian heat source in a finite volume and a simple mass-flow model considers changes in powder concentration with distance from the deposition head. The model demonstrates the effect of adjusting the melt pool standoff in different ways on melt pool and powder flow characteristics as a DMD structure is built, and hence allows the effect on build rate to be predicted. Its validity is verified by comparison with a series of 316 L stainless steel walls, built using different standoff adjustment methods. The model is found to be able to explain the dimensional characteristics found...|$|R

XRD, SEM, thermal expansion technique and oxygen permeation test were utilized to characterize the crystal phase structures, microstructures, sintering behavior and oxygen permeation <b>flux</b> of SCFZ <b>powder</b> and/or hollow fibre membranes. XRD patterns show that the crystal phase of SCFZ hollow fibre membranes are composed of perovskite main phase, SrZrO 3 and Co 3 O 4 impurity phases. The content of SrZrO 3 increases with increasing the sintering temperature. The SEM images demonstrate that fingerlike pores exist adjacent to {{the inner and outer}} skin layer of membrane wall. Meantime, sponge-like pores appear in the middle zone of wall. This kind of morphology is caused by the immersion phase separation process. From the gastight, mechanical strength, sintering behavior, XRD and SEM results, the optimum sintering temperature of the green membranes is considered to be 1240 ¡䬠The SCFZ hollow fibre membranes are obtained under the optimum sintering schedule.

40|$|Dimensionless spray flux Ψa is a {{dimensionless}} group that characterises {{the three most}} important variables in liquid dispersion: flowrate, drop size and <b>powder</b> <b>flux</b> through the spray zone. In this paper, the Poisson distribution was used to generate analytical solutions for the proportion of nuclei formed from single drops (fsingle) and the fraction of the powder surface covered by drops (fcovered) as a function of Ψa. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to simulate the spray zone and investigate how Ψa, fsingle and fcovered are related. The Monte-Carlo data was an excellent match with analytical solutions of fcovered and fsingle as a function of Ψa. At low Ψa, the proportion of the surface covered by drops (fcovered) was equal to Ψa. As Ψa increases, drop overlap becomes more dominant and the powder surface coverage levels off. The proportion of nuclei formed from single drops (fsingle) falls exponentially with increasing Ψa. In the ranges covered, these results were independent of drop size, number of drops, drop size distribution (mono-sized, bimodal and trimodal distributions), and the uniformity of the spray. Experimental data of nuclei size distributions as a function of spray flux were fitted to the analytical solution for fsingle by defining a cutsize for single drop nuclei. The fitted cutsizes followed the spray drop sizes suggesting that the method is robust and that the cutsize does indicate the transition size between single drop and agglomerate nuclei. This demonstrates that the nuclei distribution is determined by the dimensionless spray flux and the fraction of drop controlled nuclei can be calculated analytically in advance...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la VI Reunión de la Sociedad Española de Técnicas Neutrónicas celebrada en Segovia (España) del 24 al 27 de junio de 2012. [...] et al. D 1 B {{is a high}} <b>flux</b> medium {{resolution}} <b>powder</b> diffractometer instrument {{located in}} the hall-guide of the Institute Laue Langevin (Grenoble, France). Its singular geometrical characteristics together with the two monochromators avaible make this instrument suitable for studying a large type of polycrystalline materiales. Since 1998 D 1 B is a CRG (collaborating researching group) instrument, which works {{under the supervision of}} CSIC and CNRS (Centre National de la Récherche Scientifique). The available beam time is sharing between ILL (50 %), CNRS (27. 5 %) and CSIC(22. 5 %). The staff od D 1 B either from the CNRS or CSIC supports technically and scientifically the experiments of both ILL and CRG beam time. In 2008, the Spanish CRG of D 1 B obtained funding for building a new detector for the instrument and a radial oscillating collimator (ROC). The old detector of D 1 B had been running for nearly forty years and the risk of breaking down were high. After years of hard work, finally in 2011 the new detector and ROC have been commissioned and they are now at the disposal of the users of D 1 B. The technical characteristics of the new detector and ROC will be presented, as well as a short review of the different types of experiments.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a structural {{study of the}} ferroelectric materials PbNb_ 2 O_ 6 and PbTa_ 2 O_ 6. This has allowed links between crystalline structure and physical properties to be deduced. Single-crystal samples have been grown via spontaneous nucleation from the melt or by using a <b>flux</b> method. Polycrystalline <b>powders</b> have also been prepared using solid state sintering techniques. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments using synchrotron radiation and an area detector, combined with high resolutions powder neutron diffraction have allowed a detailed structural study to be completed. At room temperature these materials possess an orthorhombic superstructure which {{can be described as}} a distortion of the tetragonal tungsten bronze structure. Occupational and displacement disorder of the Pb atoms {{has been found to be}} present in both compounds. Planes of diffuse scattering in reciprocal space have been observed during the single crystal diffraction experiments and short-range ordering models are presented to explain this observation are discussed. Both compounds are shown to possess sizeable second harmonic generating efficiencies. The origins of the second-harmonic generation and ferroelectric effects in both materials are also examined. In order to study the high-temperature crystal structure and phase-transitions of these materials, a gas-flow furnace has been designed and built. PbNb_ 2 O_ 6 undergoes a transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry. The apparatus has allowed the structure of the paraelectric phases of these materials to be determined. All of the X-ray derived structural refinements are complemented with thermal neutron diffraction studies using polycrystalline samples. The gas furnace has also been successfully used by a number of groups running experiments at the Daresbury synchrotron, notably The Royal Institution of Great Britain, London, researching zeolites. Duplicate apparatus is at present being built for exclusive use on the single-crystal station and the equipment is also being looked at commercially by Oxford Cryosystems.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this research}} project were i) to develop and evaluate methods of characterizing nasal spray products using realistic nasal airway models as more clinically relevant in vitro tools and ii) to develop and evaluate a novel high-efficiency antibiotic nanoparticle dry powder formulation and delivery device. Two physically realistic nasal airway models {{were used to assess}} the effects of patient-use experimental conditions, nasal airway geometry and formulation / device properties on the delivery efficiency of nasal spray products. There was a large variability in drug delivery to the middle passages ranging from 17 – 57 % and 47 – 77 % with respect to patient use conditions for the two nasal airway geometries. The patient use variables of nasal spray position, head angle and nasal inhalation timing with respect to spray actuation were found to be significant in determining nasal valve penetration and middle passage deposition of Nasonex®. The developed test methods were able to reproducibly generate similar nasal deposition profiles for nasal spray products with similar plume and droplet characteristics. Differences in spray plume geometry (smaller plume diameter resulted in higher middle passage drug delivery) were observed to have more influence on regional nasal drug deposition than changes to droplet size for mometasone furoate formulations in the realistic airway models. Ciprofloxacin nanoparticles with a mean (SD) volume diameter of 120 (10) nm suitable for penetration through mucus and biofilm layers were prepared using sonocrystallization technique. These ciprofloxacin nanoparticles were then spray dried in a PVP K 30 matrix to form nanocomposite particles with a mean (SD) volume diameter of 5. 6 (0. 1) µm. High efficiency targeted delivery of the nanocomposite nasal powder formulation was achieved using a modified low flow VCU DPI in combination with a novel breathing maneuver; delivering 73 % of the delivered dose to the middle passages. A modified version of the nasal airway model accommodating Transwell® inserts and a Calu- 3 monolayer was developed to allow realistic deposition and evaluation of the nasal powder. The nanocomposite formulation was observed to demonstrate improved dissolution and transepithelial transport (flux = 725 ng/h/cm 2) compared to unprocessed ciprofloxacin <b>powder</b> (<b>flux</b> = 321 ng/h/cm 2) ...|$|R
