5|$|It was {{believed}} in southern Poland that clouds and hail were produced by creatures named płanetnik, chmurnik, or obłocznik: they compressed fog into clouds, and fragmented ice with iron flails into hailstones. They {{were considered to}} be the spirits of infants who had died without baptism, or the spirits of drowned and hanged people. Such spirits were seen in Serbia as bringers of hail clouds; they were addressed in folk spells, with which they were made to lead the clouds away from the village. According to other notions, płanetniks were persons who flew into the sky during storms. They could <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> spirit, while they were in deep sleep, or they could <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> body and soul. The płanetniks were friendly toward humans, often warning them about the approach of a storm or hail. They could direct the movement of clouds.|$|E

5|$|A {{participant}} in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.|$|E
5|$|Agreements between Norwegian and Russian {{authorities}} {{were made on}} 31 August, where Norway resumed full responsibility for the recovery and investigation, but Russian help was accepted. To allow the Russian workers access from the morning of 1 September, the crew was allowed to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> and establish a base camp, but no work was to be done until Norwegian supervisors arrived in the morning. However, two people were observed at the wreck at about 20:00 CEST, who {{were brought to the}} Governor's offices for questioning. As they were both members of the Russian team, it was decided that the base would be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Born to a {{military}} family, Newall studied at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before taking a commission as a junior officer in the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in 1905.

In Australia, along with <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> the genera Leia, Mycetophila, Mycoma and Phthinia, they are important pollinators of native greenhood orchids which employ the <b>flies</b> <b>in</b> pseudocopulation.

5|$|Commerce {{provides}} pilot reports along aircraft routes, {{and ship}} reports along shipping routes. Research flights using reconnaissance aircraft <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> and around weather systems of interest such as tropical cyclones. Reconnaissance aircraft are also flown over the open oceans {{during the cold}} season into systems that cause significant uncertainty in forecast guidance, or {{are expected to be}} of high impact 3–7 days into the future over the downstream continent.|$|E
5|$|Flies tend to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> a {{straight}} line then make a rapid change in direction before continuing on a different straight path. The directional changes are called saccades and typically involve an angle of 90°, being achieved in 50 milliseconds. They are initiated by visual stimuli as the fly observes an object, nerves then activate steering muscles in the thorax that cause a small change in wing stroke which generate sufficient torque to turn. Detecting this within four or five wingbeats, the halteres trigger a counter-turn and the fly heads off in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|From 1925 {{until early}} 1928, the Bells lived in Britain while John {{attended}} RAF Staff College, Andover and acted as RAAF liaison officer to the Royal Air Force.

Most were attempting to fly from New York to Paris, but a number of French aviators planned an attempt to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> the opposite direction, from Paris to New York.|$|E
5|$|In late May 1988, amid rising {{nationalist}} tensions from glasnost and perestroika, Armenia's new Communist {{party leader}} allowed the banned tricolour of the DRA to <b>fly</b> <b>in</b> Yerevan {{for the first}} time in over sixty years. A year later, following a Nagorno-Karabakh-themed mass demonstration where the tricolour was flown, he urged its official recognition. This came on August 24, 1990, a day after the Armenian Supreme Soviet declared the republic's sovereignty and renamed the country the Republic of Armenia. At that point, just over a year before Armenia declared its formal independence from the USSR, the tricolour replaced the 1952 flag.|$|E
