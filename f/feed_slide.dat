The guide ways were found cracked at the counter bore bottom end. The cracking was observed in all the 11 nos fixing holes {{in one of the}} guides and in 8 nos fixing holes in the other. In all the cases, the crack was found to have initiated at the fillet of the change of cross section of the fixing holes and propagated {{to the surface of the}} guide containing the counter bore top end. Fractographic study revealed that both the guide ways have failed by fatigue. Fatigue cracks have initiated at the fillet of the change of cross section of the fixing holes. The reason for fatigue crack initiation was found to be due to stress concentration at the fillet of change of cross section of the fixing holes...|$|E

50|$|The weapon feeds {{from the}} left side from open-link, metal {{ammunition}} belts: either the American disintegrating M13 belt (NATO standard) or the segmented German DM1 belt, whose 50-round sections can be linked through a cartridge. In order to adapt the weapon to feed from one belt type to the other, several components of the feed mechanism need to be reconfigured since the position of the feed tray's cartridge stop and pawl angles in the top cover are different. The MAG features a pawl-type feeding mechanism that continues to move the feed link during both the rearward and forward cycles of the reciprocating bolt carrier, producing a smooth belt flow. The feeding mechanism's three pawls are actuated by a roller connected to the bolt carrier. The feed channel rail, feed link, both <b>feed</b> <b>slides</b> and the <b>feed</b> tray are chrome plated. The top cover body is an anodized aluminum casting. In the infantry assault role, the weapon can be fitted with a sheet metal container that houses a 50-round belt and is attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{world health}} {{organization}} in 2001 established the policy that neonates must be exclusively breastfed for six months,but {{studies have shown that}} fewer women upper than three months to give their babies milk. Although, education and management for a logical continuation of breast feeding is crucial. The present study compared the effectiveness of multimedia and routine educations on exclusive breast feeding in children less than six months of exclusive breast feeding was done. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 169 Gravid 1 women covered by health care systems were chosen via random sampling casually in the control and case groups (77 and 92 individuals, respectively). The intervention group completed 32 weeks of gestation to 6 months after delivery through the implementation of multimedia training programs about breast <b>feeding</b> (<b>slide,</b> educational videos, lecturing and pamphlets) were used for training and advice. While the control group was taught by conventional health centers (providing user instruction). Information required by valid and reliable questionnaires were collected. The data collected by SPSS 11. 5 software using descriptive statistics (mean, SD) and analytical statistics (mann Whitney and χ 2) were analyzed. In all cases p< 0. 05 was considered significant. Results: The results showed in {{no significant differences between the}} two groups in terms of duration of exclusive breast feeding in follow up visits. But in the intervention group, breast feeding difficulties such as insufficient milk, filled milky, wrong position and breast problems such as breast sore and mastitis were significantly reduced compared to the control group (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Education provided by health centers in Bushehr as well as multimedia training on exclusive breast feeding was effective however, multimedia education in reducing common problems of breast feeding educationis preferred which is better for health centers to train more emphasis on correction position for breast feeding...|$|R

Ergonomic and safety engineering practices occasionally {{appear to be in}} conflict in the design of a safe and healthful workplace. Al-though the safety of the operator is of paramount importance, the design of an "ul-trasafe " workplace might require postures and motions that could have unfavorable long-term health consequences.

5000|$|Music critic Thomas Ward {{points out}} [...] "if one song {{could be said}} to {{encapsulate}} Hendrix’s entire oeuvre, 'Foxey Lady' is certainly closer than most." [...] The song opens with a fingered note [...] "shaken in a wide exaggerated vibrato" [...] so the adjacent strings are sounded. After the amplifier is allowed to <b>feed</b> back, Hendrix <b>slides</b> down to the rhythm figure, which uses a dominant seventh sharp ninth chord, a jazz and rhythm and blues-style chord, {{often referred to as the}} [...] "Hendrix chord". According to biographer Keith Shadwick, Hendrix casts the whole solo in the blues vernacular, using bent notes and glisses, or slides, between the notes primarily within the blues or pentatonic scales. To that he adds the new melodicism he had been hearing on recent British rock records. [...] Prior to the recording, the group had not worked out an ending for the song and bassist Noel Redding claimed that using the last IV chord was his idea. Hendrix biographer Harry Shapiro suggests that song's lyrics were inspired by Heather Taylor, who later married Roger Daltrey of the Who. Hendrix later commented that he did not approach women in such a straightforward manner as the lyrics suggested. Lithofayne [...] "Faye" [...] Pridgon, Hendrix's girlfriend in the mid 1960s, has also been suggested as the inspiration for the song.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} sex, {{age of the}} human host, patency of asexual and sexual stages and {{seasonality}} on infectiousness of Plasmodium falciparum to mosquitoes were investigated in a rural village in southern Tanzania between 1992 and 1994. Villagers from randomized subgroups of households were surveyed for malaria parasites. Gametocyte and trophozoite prevalences were age dependent and fluctuated without any clear pattern of seasonality. A sample of 107 participants, selected to include an excess of gametocyte carriers, slept under bednets with holes cut into the sides for 3 weeks. A total of 3837 Anopheles gambiae s. l. and 5403 A. funestus recovered from these bednets, was examined for all oocysts 5 - 7 days after feeding or for oocysts less than 17 · 5 µn in diameter 2 - 3 days after <b>feeding.</b> Additional blood <b>slides</b> from participants were taken twice weekly.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{diagnostic test}} instrument and its development program are described. The instrument automates the {{fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test}} for syphilis {{to the extent}} that only 4 hr of technician time is required to conduct approximately 200 tests daily. Evaluation to date suggests its efficacy. In addition, preliminary studies indicate the feasibility of detecting antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium malariae, and nucleoprotein (antinuclear factor). The instrument would seem to have broad application for routine and research immunofluorescence testing. Two elements comprise the instrument: a slide processor and a microscope attachment. The slide processor is an electro-pneumatically actuated device which automatically <b>feeds</b> special laboratory <b>slides,</b> on which antigen or other reagents are prefixed, through a series of operations which provide reagent application, incubation, washing, drying, and stacking of the finished slides for readout. The instrument provides flexibility in that incubation time and temperature as well as point, sequence, and duration of reagent application can be varied to accommodate a variety of immunofluorescence techniques. The microscope attachment can be fitted to all conventional dark-field fluorescence microscopes and makes possible the reading of three to six slides per minute. The reacted slides from the processor are injected sequentially onto the stage of the microscope by movement of a lever. As injected, slides are automatically in visual focus; fine focus is occasionally required. Scanning of the reacted field is accomplished by means of the normal microscope controls. A buffered glycerol coupling is maintained between the darkfield condenser substage lens and the slide cover glass by means of a pushbutton-actuated feed system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the evaluation, modification and modelling {{of a mass}} flow feeding silo, stand pipe and standard air slide system for use in handling and transporting alumina in the aluminium smelting industry. Stability and repeatability of gravitational flow rates from feeding silos and stand pipes (addressed as interfaces) is crucial from operational {{point of view and}} needs to be achieved before one can further estimate and model the flow of alumina and the capacity of an air slide. Although techniques for design of storage vessels (based on the flow characteristics of particulates) have been in the public domain since the 1960 ’s, they have been slow to gain acceptance in the industry (due to a lack of awareness of their existence amongst engineers). The use of the stand pipe concept to increase flow rates during gravity discharge and to achieve stability of flow has been examined experimentally in a small rig at Tel-Tek department of POSTEC. The stand pipe should be integrated into the mechanical design of an air slide, because if the material cannot be delivered (discharged) properly from the feeding unit onto the air slide, there will be no stable conveying conditions. It has been found by Gu, Arnold and McLean (1993) that the stand pipe is efficient only if it is kept full of powder - the feeding silo acting more as a buffer for the stand pipe. Their concept was implemented in practice during the tests conducted at POSTEC by monitoring the weight of material in the stand pipe and the flow rates of alumina in real time by using LabView software and weighing cells. What makes the research work reported in this document unique is the integration of different mechanical and modelling concepts from different engineering fields (continuum and soil mechanics, fluid dynamics, rheology, cybernetics and powder technology). Previous work undertaken by Haugland (1998) for Hydro focused the flow of alumina as a Newtonian fluid and was itself based on the modelling work of Woodcock (1978). Yet, besides their work, no accurate mathematical model has been developed which could be used to predict the velocity and mass flow rates of alumina flow and capacity of an air slide for a range of alumina qualities. Such a model would be extremely useful when designing new air slide systems, as the capacity of air slides could be predicted from the rheology of powder and the knowledge of bulk particulate characteristics. Previous research, measurement campaigns and extensive literature studies, all point out that in terms of controlling discharge from gravity flow equipment (and after studying the transport behaviour of an air slide), it is often the gravity discharge approach that generates the greatest degree of variability, in terms of both consistency and repeatability. The root of the problem of inconsistent discharge rates has been identified to lie with the flow channel development within the feeding silo and/or the stand pipe (discharge head). The potential causes of flow irregularities are even more critical to be aware of, in the cases where mass flow principles are intended to be applied - {{especially in the case of}} highly segregable materials like alumina blends. This thesis is aimed at developing a reliable means for predicting the average velocity of alumina flow and capacity and also to understand the mechanisms that govern the flow behaviour. To enable online estimation and further modelling of full-scale air slide capacity, a small-scale rig with adjustable length was built at POSTEC in 2012 and further modified in 2013. Air slide capacity (alumina flow rates) for different lengths of 3 m, 7 m and 15 m and inclination angles from 0 to 3. 1 degrees of air slide were measured by using pressurized air in the range of 3 to 6. 5 barg. Empirical models have been developed from test results as a first step. It was found based on empirical models that the velocity of alumina bed has a power law behaviour. However, these models would require the use of expensive and time-consuming air slide trials to determine the values of the power law coefficients for each alumina quality. The degree of segregation when handling and transporting alumina has proven to be quite considerable, in terms of undesirable effects on the production process. This thesis was prompted by several measurement programmes of work undertaken for Hydro by the author with the aim of mapping the performance of volumetric feeders and the degree of segregation in a <b>feeding</b> air <b>slide</b> rig at The Reference Centre in Årdal. Sampling from feeders and chemical analysis of the samples have clearly shown the degree of segregation, especially when fluidizing and transporting binary mixtures of alumina and aluminium fluoride. Pressure measurement results showed pressure drops along the air supply tube, which also have been found to have an impact on segregation. Fluidization and shearing trials have been conducted both on alumina and binary mixtures in order to establish a benchmark procedure for powder characterisation that could be used as an operational support tool. Currently the minimum fluidization velocity for all Hydro Aluminium plants is set to 2. 0 cm/s, which is much higher than what it is actually needed to achieve an optimal fluidization. There is a strong analogy with the flow of Newtonian or non – Newtonian fluids in an open channel that can be applied to the flow of fluidized alumina on an air slide. In this thesis, the hydrological non- Newtonian model developed from the general Saint-Venant model of open channel in a rectangular channel has been applied as a second step. Such theoretical mechanistic models, based on the mass and momentum balance with bottom friction along the powder bed, are numerically challenging to solve. The model requires use of rheometrical benchmark tests to determine the flow index coefficients for a specific quality of alumina for a given initial inlet bed depth and steady state estimated capacity. The use of an Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) solver in MATLAB to predict the height and the velocity of alumina bed in an open channel seemed promising and showed similar trends when compared to the alumina bed results obtained from the air slide tests conducted at POSTEC. Results obtained so far indicate that a more detailed analysis needs to be conducted in order to find out how to ‘fine tune’ the model parameters to further improve the model fit to measurement data. Although more experimental data is needed, e. g. shear stress measurements and flow coefficients at different fluidization velocities and for different alumina qualities, the correlation between measurements and the model obtained so far confirmed that further investigation would be justified. Thus, the effect of interfaces, the feeding silo and the stand pipe should be considered and included into further design approaches for mechanical equipment, by balancing headroom availability in pot rooms versus increase in transport capacity of bulk solids to optimize production...|$|R
