25|$|Jonathan King {{covered the}} song on his 1972 album Bubblerock <b>Is</b> <b>Here</b> <b>To</b> <b>Stay</b> {{as a country}} and western version which Mick Jagger loved. It was {{released}} as a single and became a UK Top 30 hit in 1974.|$|E
500|$|Nancy Erlick from Billboard {{said that}} the song felt like [...] " [...] The pin-up girl in character; part saucy, eager to please." [...] Alex Henderson from Allmusic, commented that [...] "Rodger's gift for sleek, seductive dance music is evident on such gems as 'Dress You Up'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic, called [...] "Dress You Up" [...] an excellent, standard-issue dance-pop. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of Madonna's Drowned Worlds: New Approaches To Her Cultural Transformations, commented that Madonna sounded like a [...] "sex-kitten" [...] in the song. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called the song irresistible. William McKeen, author of Rock and roll <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> {{said that the}} melody of [...] "Dress You Up" [...] was insistently chugging. Debby Miller from Rolling Stone said that [...] "Despite her little-girl voice, there's an {{undercurrent}} of ambition that makes her more than the latest Betty Boop." [...] While reviewing the album in 1995, Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly commented that the song came off as a bit repetitious and immature. Jim Farber from the same publication commented that [...] "the song was built to transcend the Dynasty era." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 2002 Conservative Party conference saw {{an attempt}} to turn Duncan Smith's lack of {{charisma}} into a positive attribute, with his much-quoted line, [...] "do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man". During PMQs, Labour backbenchers would raise their fingers to their lips and say [...] "shush" [...] when he was speaking. The following year, Duncan Smith's conference speech appeared to have abandoned this technique in favour of an aggressive hard-man approach which received several ovations from party members in the hall. [...] "The quiet man <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> and he's turning up the volume", Duncan Smith said.|$|E
2500|$|The term is {{not without}} controversy. [...] Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the [...] "allure and power" [...] {{of the idea of}} Latin America. He remarks at the outset, [...] "The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have {{vanished}} with the obsolescence of racial theory... But {{it is not easy to}} declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed," [...] going on to say, [...] "The term <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay,</b> and it is important." [...] Following in the tradition of Chilean writer Francisco Bilbao, who excluded Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay from his early conceptualization of Latin America, Chilean historian Jaime Eyzaguirre has criticized the term Latin America for [...] "disguising" [...] and [...] "diluting" [...] the Spanish character of a region (i.e. Hispanic America) with the inclusion of nations that according to him do not share the same pattern of conquest and colonization.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, Tarkan {{became the}} first Pepsi {{spokesperson}} in Turkey. This preceded the release of his album Karma {{and for the first}} time two singles in his domestic market in the same year: [...] "Kuzu Kuzu" [...] ("Like A Lamb") and [...] "Hüp" [...] ("Whoop"). Although Karma was not released worldwide, it was distributed in large shipments to Russia, where he had become the largest-selling non-Russian pop star. A million copies shipped to other areas of Europe, including Denmark. His so-called Karma-era style projected an image totally different from his earlier persona in respect to both music and looks. His appearance – tight trousers, loose, unbuttoned shirts or tight T-shirts – and his new hairdo set a trend among young Turkish men, who started to copy his looks. According to hairdressers, his Kuzu Kuzu hairstyle is still the most frequently requested style in the salons of Turkey. During this time he met Michael Lang, co-organiser of the Woodstock Festival, who became his international manager. According to Lang: [...] "Tarkan is a great singer and his performance is great. His current success is only the beginning in my opinion. He'll be a star in five-year's time and he will not fade away. Know this, he <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay.</b> He has an indescribable charisma." ...|$|E

6000|$|SOCIOLOGISTS {{have been}} debating {{the theory that}} the impulse to commit crime is a disease, and the ayes appear to have it--not the impulse but the decision. It is gratifying and {{profitable}} to have the point settled: we now know [...] "where we are at," [...] and can take our course accordingly. It has {{for a number of years}} been known to all but a few back-number physicians--survivals from an exhausted régime--that all disease is caused by bacilli, which worm themselves into the organs that secrete health and enjoin them from the performance of that rite. The medical conservatives mentioned attempt to whittle away the value and significances of this theory by affirming its inadequacy to account for such disorders as broken heads, sunstroke, superfluous toes, home-sickness, burns and strangulation on the gallows; but against the testimony of so eminent bacteriologists as Drs. Koch and Pasteur their carping is as that of the idle angler. The bacillus is not to be denied; he has brought his blankets and <b>is</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> until evicted, and eviction can not be wrought by talking. Doubtless we may confidently expect his eventual suppression by a fresher and more ingenious disturber of the physiological peace, but the bacillus is now chief among ten thousand evils and it is futile to attempt to read him out of the party.|$|E
