In the first place, the people of the United Slates do not give salaries to their ministers of sufficient amount to authorize them to expect that any part of the money should be returned in the way of personal civilities. Fifty thousand francs a year is the usual sum named by the French, as the money necessary to maintain a genteel town establishment, with moderate evening entertainments, and an occasional dinner. This is three thousand francs more than the salary of the minister, out of which he is moreover expected to maintain his regular <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse.</b> It is impossible for any one to do {{much in the way of}} personal civilities, on such an allowance.|$|E

60|$|As it is {{necessary}} to be prepared for all possibilities, let us now contemplate another. Let us suppose the worst possible issue of this war--the one apparently desired by those English writers whose moral feeling is so philosophically indifferent between the apostles of slavery and its enemies. Suppose that the North should stoop to recognize the new Confederation on its own terms, leaving it half the Territories, and that it is acknowledged by Europe, and takes its place as an admitted member of the community of nations. It will be desirable to take thought beforehand what are to be our own future relations with a new Power, professing the principles of Attila and Genghis Khan as the foundation of its Constitution. Are we to see with indifference its victorious army let loose to propagate their national faith at the rifle's mouth through Mexico and Central America? Shall we submit to see fire and sword carried over Cuba and Porto Rico, and Hayti and Liberia conquered and brought back to slavery? We shall soon have causes enough of quarrel on our own account. When we are in the act of sending an expedition against Mexico to redress the wrongs of private British subjects, we should do well to reflect in time that the President of the new Republic, Mr. Jefferson Davis, was the original inventor of repudiation. Mississippi was the first State which repudiated, Mr. Jefferson Davis was Governor of Mississippi, and the Legislature of Mississippi had passed a Bill recognizing and providing for the debt, which Bill Mr. Jefferson Davis vetoed. Unless we abandon the principles we have for two generations consistently professed and acted on, we should be at war with the new Confederacy within five vears about the African slave-trade. An English Government will hardly be base enough to recognize them, unless they accept all the treaties by which America is at present bound; nor, it may be hoped, even if de facto independent, would they be admitted to the courtesies of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse,</b> unless they granted in the most explicit manner the right of search. To allow the slave-ships of a Confederation formed for the extension of slavery to come and go free, and unexamined, between America and the African coast, would be to renounce even the pretence of attempting to protect Africa against the man-stealer, and abandon that Continent to the horrors, on a far larger scale, which were practised before Granville Sharp and Clarkson were in existence. But even if the right of intercepting their slavers were acknowledged by treaty, which it never would be, the arrogance of the Southern slave-holders would not long submit to its exercise. Their pride and self-conceit, swelled to an inordinate height by their successful struggle, would defy the power of England as they had already successfully defied that of their Northern countrymen. After our people by their cold disapprobation, and our press by its invective, had combined with their own difficulties to damp the spirit of the Free States, and drive them to submit and make peace, we should have to fight the Slave States ourselves at far greater disadvantages, when we should no longer have the wearied and exhausted North for an ally. The time might come when the barbarous and barbarizing Power, which we by our moral support had helped into existence, would require a general crusade of civilized Europe, to extinguish the mischief which it had allowed, and we had aided, to rise up in the midst of our civilization.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} this tedious siege, from its {{commencement}} to {{the signing of}} the capitulation, called forth into constant activity the rarest and most difficult virtues of a commanding mind; virtues of no show or splendour in the vulgar apprehension, yet more infallible characteristics of true greatness than the most unequivocal displays of enterprise and active daring. Scarcely a day passed in which Sir Alexander Ball's patience, forbearance, and inflexible constancy were not put to the severest trial. He had not only to remove the misunderstandings that arose between the Maltese and their allies, to settle the differences among the Maltese themselves, and to organise their efforts; he was likewise engaged in the more difficult and unthankful task of counteracting the weariness, discontent, and despondency of his own countrymen--a task, however, which he accomplished by management and address, and an alternation of real firmness with apparent yielding. During many months he remained the only Englishman who did not think the siege hopeless, and the object worthless. He often spoke of the time in which he resided at the country seat of the grand master at St. Antonio, four miles from Valetta, as perhaps the most trying period of his life. For some weeks Captain Vivian was his sole English companion, of whom, as his partner in anxiety, he always expressed himself with affectionate esteem. Sir Alexander Ball's presence was absolutely necessary to the Maltese, who, accustomed to be governed by him, became incapable of acting in concert without his immediate influence. In the outburst of popular emotion, the impulse which produces an insurrection, is for a brief while its sufficient pilot: the attraction constitutes the cohesion, and the common provocation, supplying an immediate object, not only unites, but directs the multitude. But this first impulse had passed away, and Sir Alexander Ball was the one individual who possessed the general confidence. On him they relied with implicit faith; and even after they had long enjoyed the blessings of British government and protection, it was still remarkable with what child-like helplessness they were in the habit of applying to him, even in their private concerns. It seemed as if they thought him made on purpose to think for them all. Yet his situation at St. Antonio was one of great peril; and he attributed his preservation to the dejection which had now begun to prey on the spirits of the French garrison, and which rendered them unenterprising and almost passive, aided by the dread which the nature of the country inspired. For subdivided as it was into small fields, scarcely larger than a cottage garden, and each of these little squares of land inclosed with substantial stone walls; these too from the necessity of having the fields perfectly level, rising in tiers above each other; the whole of the inhabited part of the island was an effective fortification for all the purposes of annoyance and offensive warfare. Sir Alexander Ball exerted himself successfully in procuring information respecting the state and temper of the garrison, and, by the assistance of the clergy and the almost universal fidelity of the Maltese, contrived that the spies in the pay of the French should be in truth his own confidential agents. He had already given splendid proofs that he could outfight them; but here, and in his after <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse</b> previous to the recommencement of the war, he likewise outwitted them. He once told me with a smile, as we were conversing on the practice of laying wagers, that he was sometimes inclined to think that the final perseverance in the siege was not a little indebted to several valuable bets of his own, he well knowing at the time, and from information which himself alone possessed, that he should certainly lose them. Yet this artifice had a considerable effect in suspending the impatience of the officers, and in supplying topics for dispute and conversation. At length, however, the two French frigates, the sailing of which had been the subject of these wagers, left the great harbour on the 24th of August, 1800, with a part of the garrison: and one of them soon became a prize to the English. Sir Alexander Ball related to me the circumstances which occasioned the escape of the other; but I do not recollect them with sufficient accuracy to dare repeat them in this place. On the 15th of September following, the capitulation was signed, and after a blockade of two years the English obtained possession of Valetta, and remained masters of the whole island and its dependencies.|$|E

5000|$|The United States used {{gray and}} black {{propaganda}} research, broadcasting, and print media operations during the Cold War {{to achieve its}} political warfare goals. These operations were conducted against Eastern European targets from Western Europe by two public-private organizations supported partly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the NSC, and partly by private corporations. These organizations were Free Europe, which was launched in 1941 and targeted Eastern Europe, and the American Committee for Liberation (AmComLib) created in 1951 to broadcast information into Soviet Russia. Both were renamed shortly thereafter and combined as Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL). [...] Many RFE/RL recruits came either from European emigrants families who were strongly anti-Communist or from US government agencies, most notably from CIA. Officially, [...] "the US government denied any responsibility for the radios and took care to conceal the channels of funding, personnel recruitment, and policy influence. Obviously, the major support was American, but it was plausibly not official American {{and it could be}} excluded from <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse</b> and international legal complication." [...] RFE/RL was considered to be a gray operation until its existence was publicly acknowledged by [...] "activists" [...] in the United States during the late 1960s.

40|$|JUDGE MOWER {{has succeeded}} in the aim {{modestly}} stated in his preface of presenting in a single volume an outline of the international governmental system at once comprehensive enough to embrace its essential features, and non-technical enough to be of general interest. He is at pains at the outset to justify {{his use of the}} title of his book as indicating not merely form oi organization, but also all of the processes by which the public international business is transacted. He is thus justified in describing not only the organization and. working of the international structure set up by the Treaty of Versailles, but also the means of official intercourse between states which operate independently of this more formal machinery. Nearly one half of the book, therefore, deals with topics which are treated in any general work on international law-for example, international sovereignty, tho equality of states, <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse,</b> the balance of power, the Concert of Europe, international unions, treaties and treaty making through separate negotiation and by means of conferences, mediation, conciliation, arbitration and: international courts. These processes, in the aggregate, constitute international government, and their inclusion was essential not only for this reason, but also to provide the necessary introduction to {{the second half of the}} world, which deals with the League of Nations, the Permanent Court of International Justice, and the International Labor Organization...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} seven years or so, China has adopted an open-door policy, which has brought about an {{increase}} in <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse,</b> and cultural and technical exchanges between China and other countries. And, above all, the number of tourists coming to visit China has been growing rapidly year by year. Together with this increase comes the demand for tour guides, especially Englishspeaking tour guides. Since most Chinese tour guides who are presently working in the travel service {{have not been able to}} receive professional training, they encounter difficulties of various kinds in their work. Such a situation demonstrates an urgent need for designing a special curriculum for training Chinese tour guides. Problems with the current situation are analysed in detail in Chapter 2. The analysis reveals that there are problems with the existing arrangement for recruiting tour guides and also tour guides' weakness in oral communication with tourists which is a result of inadequate training. In order to have an objective picture of Chinese tour guides' oral English - both strengths and weaknesses - a questionnaire was designed, and interviews were conducted as part of the field study. The whole of Chapter 3 is devoted to the analyses of the questionnaire and interviews, which includes the designing and distribution of the questionnaire and the data analysis. Chapter 4 focuses on the discussion of the importance of aims and objectives in the curriculum. It offers guidelines for the other elements of the curriculum which are stated in relation to students' future needs. Students are expected to achieve the goals set for them in the course through studying the course materials. Therefore, teaching materials have to be selected in order to be able to serve the basic aims and objectives of the course. Considerations need to be given to both language and content. Details of how to choose course content are dealt with in Chapter 5. The final chapter gives suggestions for teaching and evaluation. This field study report is not intended to present a proper curriculum. Instead, it is hoped to suggest some aspects worthy of consideration when the training in oral English for tour guides is being planned...|$|E
40|$|There are two {{significant}} trends in how domestic courts applying international law: (i) they are exploiting all the creative potential of {{customary international law}} by pioneering the determination of new customery rules, or favouring the evolution of old ones. However, in so doing, they have often asserted the existence of international customs without sufficient reference to international precedents, or regarded international teatry rules as corresponding ipso facto to general international law; (ii) they constantly apply the interpretative methods of modern costitutionalism to solve the conflicts between international norms, or to propose an evolutive interpretation of customary and treaty norms on the protetcion of human rights. However, they tend to go too far, violating some well-established norms of customary international law and given rise to plethora of interpretations from state to state. The upshot of these trends is that recent national judicial practice marks {{a turning point in}} the formation of customary international law and general principles of law. Domestic courts have also developed a creative judge-made law. However, judges cannot use their freedom to interpretation in an arbitrary way. They would risk handing down illegitimate and ineffectual decisions. Moreover, judicial creativity may also run counter to the practice the executive organs of the various states adopt in their <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse.</b> Too much discretionary power in the hands of the judiciary may, from the domestic point of view, also violate the democratic principle of the separation of powers. The only correction to these shortcomings is to adhere to strict methodological principles in setting out the grounds for any innovative decision. It is the fulfilment of these very conditions wich characterizes courts as independent bodies in a rule-of-law-based legal system. Courts must respect precise formal constraints, such as the obbligation not to exceed the limits of their competence and to give priority to norms of a higher rank. According to legal hermeneutics formal criteria must be coupled with substancial control over the correspondence of the norms to the changing ethical convictions and expectations of the community, and the conformity of judge-made law with the existing legal system. The first type of control has been carried out exspecially by expanding on the content of general principles of law and jus cogens, wheras the second is expressed by canons of balancing and proportionally...|$|E
40|$|Emperor Frederick III {{has been}} {{traditionally}} portrayed as the incompetent ruler {{who was responsible}} for the widespread disorder in fifteenth century religion and politics. Such a concept was the result of limiting historical investigation to the political aspects of his reign, a field entirely unsuited to Frederick 2 ̆ 7 s disposition and temperament. This study was motivated by the desire to achieve a more accurate evaluation of the Emperor by an examination of his activities in an area compatible with his character, that of imperial-papal relations. In attaining this end, it was deemed essential to relate Frederick 2 ̆ 7 s position, both as Duke of Austria and as Emperor, to the age in which he lived. The Emperor 2 ̆ 7 s relations with the Roman Curia were both developmental and regressive in nature. They followed an erratic course which was usually conditioned by current political pressures as well as the governing philosophy of a given pontificate. Frederick 2 ̆ 7 s attitude toward the ecclesiastical problems which faced him {{at the beginning of his}} rule revealed an intelligent grasp of the basic issues at stake. Convinced of the necessity of secular neutrality until the convocation of a general Council, the young ruler set about to bring religious peace to his realm. His enthusiasm was soon dampened by the electoral opposition which manifested itself at the Diet of Mainz held in 1441. The intensification of this trend, especially at the Diet of Nuremberg (1444), forced the Emperor to initiate a fundamental change in his religious policy. This reversal saw the abandonment of internationalism in favor of particularism, and the recognition of the pope at Rome as the legal head of the Church. By affixing his signature to the Concordat of Vienna Frederick acknowledged the failure of his previous ecclesiastical policy, and revealed the futility of stemming the contemporary institutional dismemberment by international arbitration. During the remainder of his reign Frederick intentionally withdrew from the current religious scene, and made no real effort to solve the dilemma of the Church. Although sympathetic towards the crusade advocated by Pope Nicholas V, the Emperor never really made it a part of his imperial policy. Since Pope Calixtus III made all his decisions without consulting Vienna, there was little contact between the two institutions at this time. A substantial improvement in imperial-papal relations occurred when Frederick 2 ̆ 7 s former secretary, Aeneas Sylvius, ascended to the Apostolic Chair as Pius II. There was no reversal of underlying principles, however, since both parties continued to act in the interests of their respective policies. Cooperation remained dependent on mutual need. Daring the last three decades of Frederick 2 ̆ 7 s reign, expediency and self-interest typified the bond between the traditional heads of Christendom. Pope Paul II chose not to rely on imperial goodwill and support, while Sixtus IV preferred to function as an Italian prince rather than as a leader of Christendom. Frederick 2 ̆ 7 s contacts with the Curia depended solely on the presence of a common interest, and political rather than ecclesiastical issues constituted the basis of <b>diplomatic</b> <b>intercourse</b> between the two institutions. In his relations with the Papacy Frederick revealed himself as an energetic, intelligent ruler and a accomplished diplomat. In his attempt to successfully bridge the multiple cross currents of his era, he preferred arbitration to the use of force, survival rather than momentary glory. Possessed by a fanatic belief in the destiny of his dynasty, he endured humiliation and insult to ensure its continued existence. By nature kind and conciliatory, he was not above the weakness of an age in which deeit and misrepresentation dominated the relations between nations...|$|E
