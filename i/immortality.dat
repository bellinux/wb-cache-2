5|$|Petersen also guest {{starred in}} <b>Immortality,</b> CSI's feature-length series finale.|$|E
5|$|A {{characteristic}} method {{aiming for}} longevity is Taoist alchemy. Already in very early Taoist scriptures - like the Taiping Jing and the Baopuzi - alchemical formulas for achieving <b>immortality</b> were outlined.|$|E
5|$|In the {{dialogue}} which follows, Yajnavalkya explains {{his views on}} <b>immortality</b> in Atman (soul), Brahman (ultimate reality) and their equivalence. Maitreyi objects to parts of Yajnavalkya's explanation, and requests clarification.|$|E
5|$|Scarab beetles held {{religious}} and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or <b>immortality.</b> In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to Odonata that signify the impossibility of <b>immortality.</b> Among the Aborigines of Australia of the Arrernte language groups, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} 'San' bush-men of the Kalahari, it is the praying mantis that holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|The Shangqing {{school has}} a {{tradition}} of approaching Taoism through scriptural study. It is believed that by reciting certain texts often enough one will be rewarded with <b>immortality.</b>|$|E
5|$|The best form of {{religion}} is trust in God, and a firm belief in the <b>immortality</b> of the soul, life everlasting.|$|E
5|$|The head {{offering}} {{and subsequent}} {{restoration of the}} head signify <b>immortality.</b> The dichotomy of temporality and <b>immortality</b> is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta's head– interpreted as amrita and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and fear of Death. Chhinnamasta's black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red or orange denotes life. By drinking the blood, she appears as the Saviour, who drinks the negativity {{of the world and}} transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than amrita.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurrent}} {{and important}} element of Taoism are rituals, exercises and substances aiming at aligning oneself spiritually with cosmic forces, at undertaking ecstatic spiritual journeys, or at improving physical health and thereby extending one's life, ideally {{to the point of}} <b>immortality.</b> Enlightened and immortal beings are referred to as xian.|$|E
5|$|After {{remaining}} separated for {{a number}} of years, Grissom and Sara are re-united in the series finale <b>Immortality,</b> when a case involving a suicide bomber brings Grissom temporarily back to the Las Vegas crime lab. The series ends with the pair sailing away together into the sunset, their relationship apparently rekindled.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas {{have been}} {{featured}} in literature {{since the time of}} Homer's Iliad, and as motifs in art from the Chinese Shang dynasty. They have been used in myths and folklore to represent carefree living and <b>immortality.</b> Cicadas are eaten in various countries, including China, where the nymphs are served deep-fried in Shandong cuisine.|$|E
5|$|Elves are {{naturally}} immortal, and remain unwearied with age. In {{addition to their}} <b>immortality,</b> Elves can recover from wounds which would normally kill a mortal Man. However, Elves can be slain, or die of grief and weariness.|$|E
5|$|Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts {{behind and}} set out to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's secret to <b>immortality</b> – the Horcruxes. The trio undergo a long journey with many {{obstacles}} in their path including Death Eaters, Snatchers, the mysterious Deathly Hallows, and Harry's connection with the Dark Lord's mind becoming ever stronger.|$|E
5|$|Himmler was {{interested}} in mysticism and the occult from an early age. He tied this interest into his racist philosophy, looking for proof of Aryan and Nordic racial superiority from ancient times. He promoted a cult of ancestor worship, particularly {{among members of the}} SS, as a way to keep the race pure and provide <b>immortality</b> to the nation.|$|E
5|$|In an Ancient Greek myth, Tithonus {{eventually}} {{turns into}} a cicada after being granted <b>immortality,</b> but not eternal youth, by Zeus. The Greeks also used a cicada sitting on a harp as emblematic of music.|$|E
5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, praying mantis and scarab beetle. Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or <b>immortality.</b> In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying the impossibility of <b>immortality.</b> Amongst the Arrernte Aborigines of Australia, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems. In {{the case of the}} San bushmen of the Kalahari, it is the praying mantis which holds much cultural significance including creation and zen-like patience in waiting.|$|E
5|$|It was {{believed}} that <b>immortality</b> could be achieved if one reached the lands of the Queen Mother of the West or Mount Penglai. Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve <b>immortality</b> through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs. By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice. Its followers believed that the sage-philosopher Laozi (fl.6th century BC) was a holy prophet who would offer salvation and good health if his devout followers would confess their sins, ban the worship of unclean gods who accepted meat sacrifices and chant sections of the Daodejing.|$|E
5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} <b>immortality.</b> The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve <b>immortality,</b> one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in this world, and be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in this world, their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E
5|$|After their creators {{passed into}} the mists of time, but having been {{bestowed}} by them life itself, intelligence, knowledge, the ability to change their form and virtual <b>immortality,</b> the Transformers set out {{to create their own}} destiny; a chivalrous order dedicated to defending peace and harmony with honor was formed, the so-called Knights of Cybertron, and they travelled out into the Universe aboard vast, self-aware vessels known as Metrotitans.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{a goddess}} of contradictions. She symbolises both aspects of Devi: a life-giver and a life-taker. She is {{considered}} both {{a symbol of}} sexual self-control and an embodiment of sexual energy, depending upon interpretation. She represents death, temporality, and destruction as well as life, <b>immortality,</b> and recreation. The goddess conveys spiritual self-realization and the awakening of the kundalini– spiritual energy. The legends of Chhinnamasta emphasise her self-sacrifice– sometimes coupled with a maternal element– sexual dominance, and self-destructive fury.|$|E
5|$|Dejection was a {{response}} to Wordsworth's <b>Immortality</b> Ode. It conveys feelings of dejection, expressed through an inability to write or appreciate nature. Wordsworth is introduced in the poem as a counterbalance to Coleridge; Wordsworth is able to turn his darkness to benefit and accept comfort. However, Coleridge cannot find any positive aspect to his despair, and is paralyzed by his emotions. The poem captures many of the feelings expressed in his earlier works, including his exploration of a problematic childhood and thoughts on his religious beliefs.|$|E
5|$|In a post-credits scene {{after the}} main game's ending, Zobek is seen alive during modern times, and has {{uncovered}} Gabriel {{living as a}} vampire called Dracula. Zobek mentions the acolytes of Satan are preparing for his return and that they must stop him before he takes revenge on both of them. Before Gabriel disappears, Zobek tells him he will free him of his <b>immortality</b> if he helps him.|$|E
5|$|In mythology, {{birds were}} {{sometimes}} monsters, like the Roc and the Māori's Pouākai, a giant bird capable of snatching humans. In Persian mythology, the simurgh was a gigantic bird, {{the first to}} come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of <b>immortality.</b> Its task was to shake the seeds of all the plants out of the tree.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} chapter, the {{shortest}} in the Upanishad, {{the students of}} Brahman ask Yajnavalkya to recommend a hymn that guides someone to <b>immortality.</b> Yajnavalkya recommends the Satarudriya, the hymn with the hundred names of the god Rudra. This hymn is found in sections 16.1 to 16.66 of the Vajasaneyi Samhita in Yajurveda, and is conceived as many epithets of Atman.|$|E
5|$|Kallikrates – {{an ancient}} Greek, {{the husband of}} Amenartas, and {{ancestor}} of Leo. Two thousand years ago, he and Amenartas fled Egypt, seeking a haven in the African interior where they met Ayesha. There, She {{fell in love with}} him, promising to give him the secret of <b>immortality</b> if he would kill Amenartas. He refused, and, enraged, She struck him down.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo, Donatello, and Michelangelo {{plan their}} next move, while Donatello discovers the next portal will open over Winters' tower. Splinter tells Leonardo {{that his team}} is incomplete, and that {{he knows what he}} must do. After 11 monsters have been captured, General Aguila {{questions}} Yaotl's actions. The generals conspire to betray Yaotl, wanting to remain immortal. Raphael encounters the Jersey Devil, one of the remaining monsters but drives it off. Leonardo fights Raphael, but when he breaks Leonardo's swords, Raphael is forced to leave. The generals seize Leonardo, intending to substitute him for the 13th missing beast, and Raphael decides to make amends by rescuing Leonardo. As the portal opens, Yaotl discovers his generals' treachery, while Splinter and the Turtles, accompanied by Casey and April, fight their way through the Foot Clan cordon and breach the tower. Yaotl reveals the truth to the heroes: he wants to be free of his curse of <b>immortality.</b> The generals reveal that they wish to preserve their <b>immortality,</b> but also to use the portal to bring in more monsters to conquer the world.|$|E
5|$|Tessa is MacLeod's mortal {{companion}} and bears {{the consequences of}} his <b>immortality.</b> These include her aging while he does not, the impossibility of having children together and the dangers of MacLeod's involvement in the Game, an ongoing battle in which all Immortals must behead each other until a single victor remains. Fully aware of this situation, Tessa stays with MacLeod, demonstrating her courage, understanding, generosity and compassion.|$|E
5|$|They {{team up with}} a {{group called}} the Sweeper Alliance to storm the Apostles of the Stars' island, {{organized}} by Chronos assassin Lin Shaolee in disguise to act as decoys for Chronos' own attack. Separated upon arriving, Train, Sven and Eve each get involved in fights with members of the Apostles, while Chronos, who landed after them, get to Creed first. Sephiria Arks faces off against Creed, but loses. Sven, Eve and Chronos then fight bio-warrior weapons fused with nanotechnology, while Train begins his battle with Creed. Creed has obtained <b>immortality,</b> although he reveals to Train his only weakness; his brain cannot be repaired like the rest of his body. Train defeats Creed using one last full-powered railgun shot to destroy his Imagine Blade and Eve uses her own nanomachines to take those that give Creed <b>immortality</b> out of his body. Train and Sephiria allow Creed to walk away, and the survivors of the Apostles of the Stars are shown on the run or hiding.|$|E
5|$|An oral legend {{tells how}} the goddess Prachanda-Chandika {{appeared}} {{to aid the}} gods in the god-demon war, when the gods prayed to the Great Goddess Mahashakti. After slaying all demons, the enraged goddess cut off her own head and drank her own blood. The name Prachanda-Chandika also appears as a synonym of Chhinnamasta in her hundred-name hymn in the Shakta Pramoda (19th century). Another oral legend relates her to the Samudra manthan (Churning of the Ocean) episode, where the gods and demons churned the milk ocean to acquire the amrita (the elixir of <b>immortality).</b> Chhinnamasta drank the demons' share of the elixir and then beheaded herself {{to prevent them from}} acquiring it.|$|E
5|$|Gamma, {{the team}} leader and main {{combatant}} of Zombiepowder.s cast, is a 22-year-old powder hunter who desires the zombie powder {{for the sake}} of <b>immortality,</b> and has already obtained one Ring of the Dead at his introduction in the first chapter. Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted criminals in the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the first things determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E
5|$|In Tolkien's Middle-earth legendarium, Lúthien was {{the most}} {{beautiful}} of all the Children of Ilúvatar, and forsook her <b>immortality</b> for her love of the mortal warrior Beren. After Beren was captured by the forces of the Dark Lord Morgoth, Lúthien rode to his rescue upon the talking wolfhound Huan. Ultimately, when Beren was slain in battle against the demonic wolf Carcharoth, Lúthien, like Orpheus, approached the Valar, the angelic order of beings placed in charge of the world by Eru (God), and persuaded them to restore her beloved to life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the year}} 8000 BC, Pandora finds {{the box and}} {{inadvertently}} opens it, unleashing the Seven Sins on the world. As a result she is punished by the Council of Wizards with <b>immortality.</b> Pandora begins her travels, training and trying to destroy the Seven Sins. In the present, she receives information from the Wizard informing her that the box can only be opened by either the purest or darkest of heart. Pandora approaches Superman to open her box, believing he is 'without sin', but when he touches the box he appears to become possessed. Pandora manages to escape with the box, after which Superman seems to return to normal.|$|E
5|$|One poll {{reported}} in the journal Nature showed that among American scientists (across various disciplines), about 40 percent believe in both evolution and an active deity (theistic evolution). This {{is similar to the}} results reported for surveys of the general American public. Also, about 40 percent of the scientists polled believe in a God that answers prayers, and believe in <b>immortality.</b> While about 55% of scientists surveyed were atheists, agnostics, or nonreligious theists, atheism is far from universal among scientists who support evolution, or among the general public that supports evolution. Very similar results were reported from a 1997 Gallup Poll of the American public and scientists.|$|E
5|$|Over time, some {{attributes}} now {{regarded as}} integral became {{incorporated into the}} vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared {{over the course of}} the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Murnau's Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, <b>immortality</b> is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.|$|E
5|$|Pick is commemorated with a {{memorial}} plaque at St Peter's School, York, unveiled in 1953 by Lord Latham, {{and a blue}} plaque was erected at his Golders Green home in 1981. A building at London Underground's Acton Works is named Frank Pick House in his honour. It stands {{on the north side}} of the Piccadilly and District line railway tracks to the east of Acton Town station. Pick is commemorated with a permanent memorial at Piccadilly Circus station by the BAFTA-winning and Turner Prize-nominated artists Langlands & Bell. The work, entitled Beauty < <b>Immortality,</b> was commissioned by Art on the Underground (Transport for London’s official art programme) and the London Transport Museum. It was unveiled on 7 November 2016, the 75th anniversary of Pick's death.|$|E
5|$|Sara Sidle is {{a fictional}} {{character}} on the CBS crime drama , portrayed by actress Jorja Fox. Sidle is a forensic scientist {{and one of}} the core characters of the show, which revolves around a Crime Scene Investigation team in Clark County, Nevada, that investigates cases in and around Las Vegas. Fox appeared in both the first eight seasons and the final five seasons of the show as a series regular. She also recurred throughout the ninth and tenth seasons of the series and headlined <b>Immortality</b> alongside Ted Danson.|$|E
5|$|The Celestial Masters {{believed}} that qi pervaded everything, {{and in order}} to achieve <b>immortality,</b> the correct balance of qi had to be present within the body. Having a poor quantity of qi in the body, would result in illness, and eventually death. Meditation could be used to restore qi to the body, but sex was to be avoided, as it could result in the loss of qi. If there was the correct balance of qi within the body upon death, an adherent could 'feign death' and be reborn. If not, an adherent would be transported to an earthly prison where he would face eternal torment.|$|E
