5|$|The {{effects of}} {{injuries}} {{at or above}} the lumbar or sacral regions of the spinal cord (lower back and pelvis) include decreased control of the legs and hips, <b>genitourinary</b> <b>system,</b> and anus. People injured below level L2 may still have use of their hip flexor and knee extensor muscles. Bowel and bladder function are regulated by the sacral region. It is common to experience sexual dysfunction after injury, as well as dysfunction of the bowel and bladder, including fecal and urinary incontinence. It is also possible for the bladder to fail to empty, leading to a potentially harmful buildup of urine. One sign of spinal cord injury that emergency providers may find is priapism, an erection of the penis.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{urethral}} valve (PUV) {{disorder is}} an obstructive developmental anomaly in the urethra and <b>genitourinary</b> <b>system</b> of male newborns. A posterior urethral valve is an obstructing membrane in the posterior male urethra {{as a result}} of abnormal in utero development. It is {{the most common cause of}} bladder outlet obstruction in male newborns. The disorder varies in degree, with mild cases followed conservatively. More severe cases can have renal and respiratory failure from lung underdevelopment as result of low amniotic fluid volumes, requiring intensive care and close monitoring. It occurs in about one in 8000 babies.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{symptoms}} of IBS are abdominal pain or discomfort {{in association with}} frequent diarrhea or constipation and a change in bowel habits. Symptoms usually are experienced as acute attacks that subside within one day, but recurrent attacks are likely. There may also be urgency for bowel movements, a feeling of incomplete evacuation (tenesmus), bloating, or abdominal distension. In some cases, the symptoms are relieved by bowel movements. People with IBS, more commonly than others, have gastroesophageal reflux, symptoms relating to the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>system,</b> chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, headache, backache, and psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety. About a third {{of men and women}} who have IBS also report sexual dysfunction typically in the form of a reduction in libido.|$|E

In the skeletal system, ribs may be absent, and hemivertebrae, syndactyly (fusion of fingers together), and clinodactyly (curvature of the fifth finger) may be present. In the GI and <b>genitourinary</b> <b>systems,</b> anal atresia, hypospadia (misplaced urethra), and hydronephrosis may exist. Adrenal hypoplasia and growth hormone deficiency are associated endocrine consequences of Ritscher-Schinzel syndrome. Some immunodeficiency has also been reported in connection with 3C syndrome.|$|R
25|$|Fluoroscopy and {{angiography}} {{are special}} applications of X-ray imaging, {{in which a}} fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system. This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a radiocontrast agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting {{into the body of}} the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>system,</b> or the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO4) is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract. Iodine, in multiple proprietary forms, is given by oral, rectal, intra-arterial or intravenous routes. These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as peristalsis in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (tumors, cysts, inflammation) more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air {{can be used as a}} contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.|$|E

30|$|Diabetic {{autonomic}} neuropathy is {{frequent and}} can affect multiple systems, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and genitourinary. Concerning the cardiovascular system, the major clinical manifestations of diabetic autonomic neuropathy include resting tachycardia, exercise intolerance and orthostatic hypotension [35]. Moreover, silent myocardial ischaemia and sudden death {{have been attributed}} to diabetic autonomic neuropathy. Gastroparesis, constipation or diarrhoea, bladder dysfunction and erectile dysfunction are the most common types of the impairment of gastrointestinal and <b>genitourinary</b> <b>systems.</b> Diabetic autonomic neuropathy may also reduce the patient’s ability to sense hypoglycaemia, thereby subjecting patients to the risk of severe hypoglycaemia.|$|R

40|$|The adult bladder and urethra {{acting as}} a unit allow for the {{voluntary}} dual function of urine collection and evacuation. Urinary continence is an acquired, “learned” state, and normal anatomy and function of the nervous and <b>genitourinary</b> <b>systems</b> are necessary to maintain it. Urinary incontinence is defined as “a condition where involuntary loss of urine is a social or hygienic problem and is objectively demonstrable. ” This definition takes into account both sociocultural aspects {{and the need for}} objective clinical assessment of urinary leakage. Marked individual variations in physical activity, occupation and hygienic standards call for appropriate clinical judgment when evaluation this condition. Although excessive vaginal discharge may be confused with urine loss, incontinence is often evoked to obtain psychologic or socioeconomic secondary gains. The element of the reproducibility is therefore of marked clinical importance. Eleven percent of patients evaluated in our urodynamic unit at the Medical College of Virginia had no objective evidence of urinary leakage during their evaluation...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThree major mucosal systems {{exist in}} the body, the oral-gastrointestinal, the {{respiratory}} and the <b>genitourinary</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains the largest mucosal surface {{in the body and}} is the major port of entry for foreign antigens. Therefore, the gut immune system has to differentiate to tolerate dietary antigens and expel infectious and harmful pathogens. During the complex but well-orchestrated immune responses in the mucosal system, T cells play a pivotal role in both immunity and tolerance. Of many T cell subpopulations, CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) T regulatory cells (Tregs) are instrumental in regulation of immune responses in mucosea. Among the multitude of cytokines and factors that are produced in the gut, Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGF-beta) is probably the most important one in influencing mucosal T cell responses. The interaction and mutual regulation between TGF-beta and CD 4 (+) CD 25 (+) Tregs may be the key in maintaining the balance between T cell immunity and tolerance in mucosal system. In this article, we attempt to discuss both beneficial and detrimental effects of TGF-beta and Tregs on oral tolerance, mucosal inflammation and autoimmunity, colon cancer and HIV infection in the gut...|$|R
