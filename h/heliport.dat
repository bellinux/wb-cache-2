Winfield, a town located within the Lake Country district, provides the Winfield (Wood Lake) Water Aerodrome. The West Kelowna district provides twoheliports: the Kelowna (Alpine) <b>Heliport</b> and Kelowna (Wildcat Helicopters) <b>Heliport,</b> while the unincorporated community of Naramata offers the Naramata <b>Heliport.</b> Meanwhile, the towns of Oliver and Osoyoos are home to the Oliver Municipal Airport and Osoyoos Airport. The districts of Peachland and Summerland, along with the town of Oyama in Lake Country, do not provide aviation services.|$|E

50|$|<b>Heliports</b> {{are common}} {{features}} at hospitals where they serve to facilitate Helicopter Air Ambulance (HAA) and MEDEVACs for transferring patients {{into and out}} of hospital facilities. Some large trauma centers have multiple <b>heliports</b> while most small hospitals have just one. <b>Heliports</b> allow hospitals to accept patients that may be flown in from remote accident sites where there are no local hospitals or facilities capable of providing the level of emergency care required.|$|R

40|$|Certification of UN <b>heliports</b> {{for night}} operationsFor {{strategic}} reasons, {{it is very}} important to increase the number of <b>heliports</b> certified for UN helicopter operations, as this enhances the efficiency of the UN Peacekeeping Missions. For instance, increased availability of certified <b>heliports</b> over a wider area on the field would enable improvements of the management of UN resources and the air transport activities. In particular, for the case of casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) involving injured military or civilian personnel where a threat to life or limb exists, or medical evacuations (MEDEVAC) of patients, a wider network of <b>heliports</b> is paramount, because it enables much faster and painless transfers of personnel to the first available levels of medical care. Hence, the chances of saving the lives of injured or seriously ill persons increase significantly. In any case, the <b>heliports</b> must meet critical requirements so essentially it is guaranteed the safety of the operations. Peer ReviewedPreprin...|$|R

5|$|Smaller {{communities}} are served via heliports which connect with hubs located at Upernavik Airport in the Upernavik Archipelago in northwestern Greenland; at Uummannaq <b>Heliport</b> in the Uummannaq Fjord region in northwestern Greenland; at Ilulissat and Aasiaat Airports in the Disko Bay region in western Greenland; at Qaqortoq and Nanortalik Heliports in southern Greenland; and at Tasiilaq <b>Heliport</b> in southeastern Greenland. Of the 45 heliports in use, 8 are primary and {{equipped with a}} tarmac, a terminal building and permanent staff. The other heliports are helistops with either a gravel or grass landing area. Often helicopters need to make more than one flight for each connection to a fixed-wing flight because of passenger capacity, causing longer total travel time.|$|E

5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. The {{cause of the}} {{accident}} was the turbulence and high wind speeds around the airport. The airport was immediately closed after the incident; no public flights have taken off from the Airport after Flight 839. Private flights still use the airport on occasion. The Ministry of Transport and Communications decided on 17 January 1992 to permanently close the airport, after it had been temporarily closed since the accident. This made Værøy Airport the civilian airport in Europe to have operated the shortest time. Helikopter Service resumed helicopter flights from Hanna Bakken-jorden on 1 January 1993. Construction of a new <b>heliport</b> started in 1996 and Værøy <b>Heliport</b> opened on 15 February 1997. The old airport was in 2000 bought by a private individual who has converted the terminal building into a private dwelling and uses the control tower for a small-scale chocolate factory.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the study is the {{evaluation}} of the efficiencies of a group of small Italian airports and the comparison with a set of transport <b>heliports</b> to show the difference in the productivity of the two types of infrastructures. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology used for the evaluation is the data envelopment analysis (DEA). Findings - The better performance of the <b>heliports</b> compared to the small inefficient airports. Research limitations/implications - This research is limited by the field of application and the weaknesses of the DEA methodology. However, it could be the first step for further works that will include more accurate models. Practical implications - The study suggests the conversion of the small inefficient airports into <b>heliports</b> feeding traffic towards the major hubs. The use of helicopters to reach poor accessible areas represents an alternative mode of transport. Originality/value - This is the first case of application of the DEA methodology to a group of <b>heliports...</b>|$|R

5|$|However, some {{expansion}} is planned. In order {{to compete with}} Air Iceland, which operates service from Reykjavik Airport to Nuuk, Narsarsuaq, Ilulissat and {{the east coast of}} Greenland and now controls about 15% the market in Greenland-bound travel, Air Greenland may open a nonstop route between Nuuk and Keflavík International Airport in Iceland. Also, owing to improved technology and higher commodity prices, the Maarmorilik mines were due to reopen in November 2010 with zinc and iron ore reserves projected to last 50 years. As in the 1970s, the mine's supply flights to the mine will be operated by Air Greenland, using Bell helicopters (212s) based out of the Uummannaq <b>Heliport.</b>|$|E

5|$|RAF Weston-super-Mare {{was opened}} in 1936 by No. 24 Group, {{with a single}} tarmac runway.
