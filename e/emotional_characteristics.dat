60|$|From which {{and other}} like facts, {{does it not}} seem an {{unavoidable}} inference, that new emotions are developed by new experiences--new habits of life? All {{are familiar with the}} truth that, in the individual, each feeling may be strengthened by performing those actions which it prompts; and to say that the feeling is strengthened, is {{to say that it is}} in part made by these actions. We know, further, that not unfrequently, individuals, by persistence in special courses of conduct, acquire special likings for such courses, disagreeable as these may be to others; and these whims, or morbid tastes, imply incipient emotions corresponding to these special activities. We know that <b>emotional</b> <b>characteristics,</b> in common with all others, are hereditary; and the differences between civilized nations descended from the same stock, show us the cumulative results of small modifications hereditarily transmitted. And when we see that between savage and civilized races which diverged from one another in the remote past, and have for a hundred generations followed modes of life becoming ever more unlike, there exist still greater emotional contrasts; may we not infer that the more or less distinct emotions which characterize civilized races, are the organized results of certain daily-repeated combinations of mental states which social life involves? Must we not say that habits not only modify emotions in the individual, and not only beget tendencies to like habits and accompanying emotions in descendants, but that when the conditions of the race make the habits persistent, this progressive modification may go on to the extent of producing emotions so far distinct as to seem new? And if so, we may suspect that such new emotions, and by implication all emotions analytically considered, consist of aggregated and consolidated groups of those simpler feelings which habitually occur together in experience. When, in the circumstances of any race, some one kind of action or set of actions, sensation or set of sensations, is usually followed, or accompanied, by various other sets of actions or sensations, and so entails a large mass of pleasurable or painful states of consciousness; these, by frequent repetition, become so connected together that the initial action or sensation brings the ideas of all the rest crowding into consciousness: producing, in some degree, the pleasures or pains that have before been felt in reality. And when this relation, besides being frequently repeated in the individual, occurs in successive generations, all the many nervous actions involved tend to grow organically connected. They become incipiently reflex; and, on the occurrence of the appropriate stimulus, the whole nervous apparatus which in past generations was brought into activity by this stimulus, becomes nascently excited. Even while yet there have been no individual experiences, a vague feeling of pleasure or pain is produced; constituting what we may call the body of the emotion. And when the experiences of past generations come to be repeated in the individual, the emotion gains both strength and definiteness; and is accompanied by the appropriate specific ideas.|$|E

40|$|Past {{years have}} seen a plethora of studies on the {{construct}} of trust in business relationships. Despite the significance of trust in developing relationships, research on trust still has two main deficiencies. First, previous studies attempted to stretch the concept of trust from interpersonal towards interorganizational relationships {{which resulted in a}} cross-level fallacy, as the <b>emotional</b> <b>characteristic</b> of trust only makes sense at the interpersonal level. Second, despite the obvious benefits of trust, long-term and successful business relationships not based on trust can exist, as relationships between firms are invariably based on considerations of mutual interest. Trust is not the only construct enabling such mutual interest. To develop the concept of trust as exemplified in the current literature on business relationships, this study uses an argument proposed in the study by Mouzas et al. (2007) and validates the distinct importance of interorganizational reliance vis-à-vis interpersonal trust in business markets. Despite the importance of issues around reliance in business relationships, there exists a remarkable absence of studies on reliance in business marketing research. This paper distinguishes between trust and reliance and applies them respectively to the interpersonal and interorganizational levels. We use data from 404 companies in the constructio...|$|R

We supposed that different features used could also implicitly encode high-level information about emotions. The concept of emotion is not easy to model. The perception of emotion is not only influenced by the content and the colour of the images. It is also modified by some personal experiences like cultural aspects and personal semantic associated to some colours or objects. The complexity of emotion modelling was considered in classification process through psycho-visual tests. The twenty-five observers assessed the nature and the power of emotions they felt. These tests allowed us to distinguish three classes of emotions, which are "Negative", "Neutral" and "Positive" emotions.
