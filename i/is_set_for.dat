5|$|Although B. rufimanus {{does not}} {{directly}} affect faba bean yield, it alters the aesthetic quality of the seeds {{as well as its}} germinative properties and ensuing yield is therefore an issue for human consumption and seed markets. A maximum 3% damage threshold <b>is</b> <b>set</b> <b>for</b> seeds targeting market for human consumption. Damaged seeds (seeds from which adults have emerged) might have lower germination rates with 13% reduced germination observed in the lab, but no difference observed in the field. Yield from infested beans are lower (-45% to -70%) than for healthy ones (Epperlein, 1992). In addition, damaged seeds have increased susceptibility to rust and root diseases.|$|E

5|$|One {{model for}} the {{formation}} of this category of supernova is a close binary star system. The progenitor binary system consists of main sequence stars, with the primary possessing more mass than the secondary. Being greater in mass, the primary is the first of the pair to evolve onto the asymptotic giant branch, where the star's envelope expands considerably. If the two stars share a common envelope then the system can lose significant amounts of mass, reducing the angular momentum, orbital radius and period. After the primary has degenerated into a white dwarf, the secondary star later evolves into a red giant and the stage <b>is</b> <b>set</b> <b>for</b> mass accretion onto the primary. During this final shared-envelope phase, the two stars spiral in closer together as angular momentum is lost. The resulting orbit can have a period as brief as a few hours. If the accretion continues long enough, the white dwarf may eventually approach the Chandrasekhar limit.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship was {{defended by}} A.J. Styles against Christopher Daniels in a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match. In an Iron Man match, a {{time-limit}} <b>is</b> <b>set</b> <b>for</b> a particular amount, {{in this case}} thirty-minutes. The match will continue until time runs out and the competitor who gained the most falls when time runs out by pinfall, submission, count-out, or disqualification is the overall winner of the bout. Daniels attempted to get Styles to submit early in the bout by using his Koji Clutch submission hold. Later on, Daniels earned a two-count after landing on Styles with his signature B.M.E. aerial maneuver. Styles also gained a near-fall by holding Daniels on his shoulders before twisting him off and slamming him to the mat {{for what he calls}} a Rack Bomb. With only 13 seconds left in the match and the score still tied zero to zero, Styles performed his signature Styles Clash maneuver and followed with the pin. As time ran out, Styles had the most falls thus retaining the TNA X Division Championship.|$|E
