The most commonly used statistical principle to detect and remove the effects of artificial changes is relative homogenization, which assumes that nearby stations are exposed to almost the same climate signal and that thus the differences between nearby stations can be utilized to detect inhomogeneities. By looking at the difference time series, the year-to-year variability of the climate is removed, as well as regional climatic trends. In such a difference time series, a clear and persistent jump of, for example 1 °C, can easily be detected and can only be due {{to changes in the}} measurement conditions.|$|E

50|$|Fast and {{effective}} detection {{is a key}} factor in wildfire fighting. Early detection efforts were focused on early response, accurate results in both daytime and nighttime, and the ability to prioritize fire danger. Fire lookout towers were used in the United States in the early 20th century and fires were reported using telephones, carrier pigeons, and heliographs. Aerial and land photography using instant cameras were used in the 1950s until infrared scanning was developed for fire detection in the 1960s. However, information analysis and delivery was often delayed by limitations in communication technology. Early satellite-derived fire analyses were hand-drawn on maps at a remote site and sent via overnight mail to the fire manager. During the Yellowstone fires of 1988, a <b>data</b> <b>station</b> was established in West Yellowstone, permitting the delivery of satellite-based fire information in approximately four hours.|$|E

40|$|The Guaranteed Bandwidth Protocol (GBW) is {{an access}} scheme being {{proposed}} for implementation of connection oriented services in DQDB networks. Connection oriented services {{are expected to}} handle both constant bit rate (CBR) and variable bit rate (VBR) traffic that have delay and jitter constraints. It {{has been reported that}} the GBW protocol can provide guaranteed bandwidth and lower delays compared to the ordinary DQDB protocol. However, the intensity of the jitter introduced by this scheme has not been made clear. This paper compares the jitter results for the GBW scheme to those obtained by a new access method called Modified Guaranteed Bandwidth (MOD_GBW) protocol, which is proposed here. It is shown through simulation that MOD_GBW also provides guaranteed bandwidth and that its delay and jitter characteristics are significantly better than those of the GBW protocol. In the simulation model, the DQDB stations are divided into two groups: 1) Real-Time (RT) stations that generate either CBR or VBR real-time traffic; and 2) <b>Data</b> <b>stations</b> that generate memoryless type of traffic. <b>Data</b> <b>stations</b> operate according to the ordinary DQDB protocol only. The main performance measure adopted here for the real-time traffic is the interdeparture time distribution of consecutive segments from an RT-station. We define the variance of this distribution as jitter. This paper also shows the impact of GBW/MOD_GBW on the performance of the <b>data</b> <b>stations</b> by evaluating their throughput and average bus access delay. Finally, we show that the network performance is weakly related to the number of RT-stations under MOD_GBW, but it depends strongly on the overall loading...|$|R
