5|$|From 1877 to 1882, Jovanović honed {{his artistic}} skills at Vienna's Academy of Fine Arts, {{studying}} under Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller, among others. In {{the early part}} of his career, he painted mostly Orientalist works, which were in high demand at the time. The paintings were based on his own experiences in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa, and assured his fame among art connoisseurs in the West. In the late 1880s, Jovanović turned to history painting, depicting scenes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Serb people, as seen in The Takovo Uprising (1888). Nevertheless, his reputation as an Orientalist meant that he was best known for these types of works in his first decade as a professional artist.|$|E

5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points in the landscape being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>History</b> <b>of</b> Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Hogg {{purchased}} property near Round Top, {{hoping to}} move its historic building to Bayou Bend. When that plan proved impractical, she decided to restore it in place and temporarily moved to Round Top. After personally supervising {{the restoration of the}} Winedale Inn, a stagecoach inn near Round Top, Hogg donated the property to the University of Texas at Austin. Known as the Winedale Historical Center, it is used primarily as an outdoor museum and music center, and annually hosts Shakespeare at Winedale. In 1969, she restored her parents' house in Quitman; the town renamed it the Ima Hogg Museum in her honor. The museum holds items <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Wood County and northeast Texas. She later restored the home of her maternal grandfather and had it moved to the park.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Grunwald is a {{painting}} by Matejko that portrays events <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Poland, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the struggles of Eastern European principalities against Teutonic knights in general. In {{the center of the}} painting is the Lithuanian duke Vytautas (Witold), dressed in red with a raised sword. Vytautas holds a more prominent position in the painting than his cousin, Polish king Władysław Jagiełło (Jogaila), who is visible in the second plan, mounted, in the top right side. According to Scales and Zimmer, by focusing on Vytautas rather than Jagiełło, Matejko stressed the importance of Lithuania for Poland, and the value of cooperation between the two countries in the Polish–Lithuanian union. Others have noted that this placement likely was influenced by Matejko's reliance on the writings of Jan Długosz, who attributed greater importance to Vytautas than to Jagiełło, who, by some polish sources, commanded the battle. While Lithuanian sources claim that Vytautas The Great have got the very major role in the battle by actually commanding troops. In the skies above the carnage, Saint Stanislaus, a patron of Poland, overlooks the fighting.|$|E
5|$|The {{thesis of}} eliminativism {{seems to be}} so {{obviously}} wrong to many critics, under the claim that people know immediately and indubitably that they have minds, that argumentation seems unnecessary. This sort of intuition pumping is illustrated by asking what happens when one asks oneself honestly if one has mental states. Eliminativists object to such a rebuttal of their position by claiming that intuitions often are mistaken. Analogies <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> science are frequently invoked to buttress this observation: it may appear obvious that the sun travels around the earth, for example, but for all its apparent obviousness this conception was proved wrong nevertheless. Similarly, it may appear obvious that apart from neural events there are also mental conditions. Nevertheless, this could equally {{turn out to be}} false.|$|E
