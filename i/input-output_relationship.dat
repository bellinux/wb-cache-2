What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, technical efficiency and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable <b>input-output</b> <b>relationship</b> which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNeuronal {{gain control}} is {{important}} for processing information in the brain. Shunting inhibition is not thought to control gain since it shifts <b>input-output</b> <b>relationships</b> during tonic excitation rather than changing their slope. Here we show that tonic inhibition reduces the gain and shifts the offset of cerebellar granule cell <b>input-output</b> <b>relationships</b> during frequency-dependent excitation with synaptic conductance waveforms. Shunting inhibition scales subthreshold voltage, increasing the excitation frequency required to attain a particular firing rate. This reduces gain because frequency-dependent increases in input variability, which couple mean subthreshold voltage to firing rate, boost voltage fluctuations during inhibition. Moreover, synaptic time course {{and the number of}} inputs also influence gain changes by setting excitation variability. Our results suggest that shunting inhibition can multiplicatively scale rate-coded information in neurons with high-variability synaptic inputs...|$|R

Furthermore, Burmester's results show that there may be as many as three of these coupler links that provide the desired <b>input-output</b> <b>relationship.</b>|$|E

50|$|Two {{dimensional}} filters {{have seen}} substantial development effort {{due to their}} importance and high applicability across several domains.

The <b>input-output</b> <b>relationship</b> of a 2-D IIR filter obeys a constant-coefficient linear partial difference equation from which the value of an output sample can be computed using the input samples and previously computed output samples.
