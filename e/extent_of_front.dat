A virtual therapy tried to raise the awareness of preventative measures to the individuals, teach them to adapt their negotiation abilities to the alterations of their motion due to age, disease or injuries and and thus, react accurately and fast again to reduce injurious falls. Eighteen subjects (14 males, 4 females; 30 mean age) perform avoidance tasks under three different test conditions. The three test conditions are divided based on the following criteria: the virtual environment is projected only on a front surface, in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the treadmill that the subject stands; the front virtual environment is extended on a ground surface. However, the projected virtual environment in the two surfaces is sub-divided into two test conditions.

40|$|The {{confluence}} region east of New Zealand {{is one of}} only a {{few places}} in the world where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current meets the strong southwardflowing boundary current of a subtropical gyre. The convergence of subtropical and subantarctic water creates strong fronts. The fronts have clear signatures in height and temperature that make them appropriate places to investigate ocean/climate variability. The location and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the New Zealand confluence should respond to changes in large-scale wind patterns, as changes in South Pacific currents have been linked to wind shifts. However, recent studies have shown that highly energetic eddies, local winds, and the bathymetry may be significant controls of currents and associated fronts. This thesis investigates the temporal and spatial variability of the confluence and evaluates its response to variability in South Pacific winds. Analysis of the 18 -year time series, from January 1993 to December 2010, of sea surface height mapped from satellite altimetry was used to investigate the location and <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> <b>fronts</b> and the eddy activity and relate these to the wind forcing. Wind stress data were used with the Island Rule to estimate the winddriven transport of the western boundary currents that feed the confluence. In addition, the climate modes Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) were used to examine the influence of the principal modes of atmospheric variability. Time series of the local wind stress curl and local climate indices were calculated and compared to the intensity of the confluence to test any influence of local forcing. In addition, bathymetric effects were investigated by evaluating evidence for preferred front locations near topographic features. Sea level anomalies in the confluence region are increasing at 3. 4 cm decade⁻¹. The sea surface height gradients and the eddy kinetic energy are also increasing at a rate of 0. 01 cm km⁻¹ and 23 cm² s⁻² per decade respectively, indicating an intensification <b>of</b> the <b>fronts</b> and eddy activity in the confluence. There is a high and significant correlation (r = 0. 84) between the front and eddy signals reflecting baroclinic instabilities inherent in the fronts. Difference in transport anomalies across the confluence derived from the Island Rule are also increasing at 8. 8 Sv decade⁻¹. SAM and SOI indices showed little or no correspondence with variability in the confluence intensity and eddy kinetic energy, and the same lack of correspondence was observed in local winds and local indices. While these results suggest a connection between the variability in the confluence and South Pacific winds, there is a preferential location <b>of</b> the strongest <b>fronts</b> and eddy activity northeast of Bounty Plateau and Bollons Seamount, indicating some bathymetric control. The correspondence between basin-scale winds and sea surface height gradients in the confluence region indicates that if wind stress continues to increase, as current trends predict, front intensity and eddy activity will also increase, enhancing the transfer of heat and nutrients that, respectively, influence energy transfer and biological productivity...|$|R

We correlate sequences from continuous coreholes using well logs to trace strike and dip sections throughout this region, {{allowing us to}} predict the continuity of confining units and aquifer sands. Marine sequences follow a predictable shallowing upward pattern: fine-grained shelf and prodelta sediments grade upward into delta front and shallow-marine sands, corresponding to confining unit-aquifer couplets. Aquifer sands deposited in marine shelf environments tend to be continuous on the 10 + km (6. 2 mi) scale and are traceable for> 60 km (37. 3 mi) along strike and> 25 km (15. 5 mi) along dip. Confining units for these marine sequences are typically shelf or prodelta silty clays that are even more laterally continuous than their as-sociated aquifer sands. Marginal marine to non-marine sequences {{are more difficult to}} predict {{due to a lack of}} continuous marine marker beds, difficulty in interpreting paleoenvironments of thick sand beds, and lack of fossil material except pollen for biostratigraphy. Mar-ginal to non-marine sequences are generally less continuous, though some show surprising lateral continuity along strike (> 60 km [37. 3 mi]), reflecting the widespread <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> delta <b>front</b> environments.

40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} {{of the future}} state of the atmosphere is important throughout society, ranging from the weather forecast {{in a few days}} time to modelling the effects of a changing climate over decades and generations. The equations which govern how the atmosphere evolves have long been known; these are the Navier-Stokes equations, the laws of thermodynamics and the equation of state. Unfortunately the nonlinearity of the equations prohibits analytic solutions, so simplified models of particular flow phenomena have historically been, and continue to be, used alongside numerical models of the full equations. In this thesis, the two-dimensional Eady model of shear-driven frontogenesis (the creation <b>of</b> atmospheric <b>fronts)</b> was used to investigate how errors made in a localised region can affect the global solution. Atmospheric fronts are the boundary of two different air masses, typically characterised by a sharp change in air temperature and wind direction. This occurs across a small length of O(10 km), whereas the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the <b>front</b> itself can be O(1000 km). Fronts are a prominent feature of mid-latitude weather systems and, despite their narrow width, are part of the large-scale, global solution. Any errors made locally in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>fronts</b> will therefore affect the global solution. This thesis uses the convergence of the Euler equations to the semigeostrophic equations, a simplified model which is representative of the large-scale flow, including fronts. The Euler equations were solved numerically using current operational techniques. It was shown that highly predictable solutions could be obtained, and the theoretical convergence rate maintained, even with the presence of near-discontinuous solutions given by intense fronts. Numerical solutions with successively increased resolution showed that the potential vorticity, which is a fundamental quantity in determining the large-scale, balanced flow, approached the semigeostrophic limit solution. Regions of negative potential vorticity, indicative of local areas of instability, were reduced at high resolution. In all cases, the width <b>of</b> the <b>front</b> reduced to the grid-scale. While qualitative features of the limit solution were reproduced, a stark contrast in amplitude was found. The results of this thesis were approximately half in amplitude of the limit solution. Some attempts were made at increasing the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>front</b> through spatial- and temporal-averaging. A scheme was proposed that conserves the potential vorticity within the Eady model. Open Acces...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new multi-objective {{evolutionary}} algorithm, called neighborhood exploring evolution strategy (NEES). This approach incorporates {{the idea of}} neighborhood exploration together with other techniques commonly used in the multi-objective evolutionary optimization literature (namely, non-dominated sorting and diversity preservation mechanisms). This idea of the proposed approach was derived from a single-objective evolutionary algorithm, called line-up competition algorithm (LCA). The main idea is to assign neighborhoods of different size to different solutions. Within each neighborhood, new solutions are generated using a (1 + λ) -ES (evolution strategy). This scheme naturally balances the effect of local search (which {{is done by the}} evolution strategy) with that of the global search performed by the algorithm, and gradually impels the population to progress towards the true Pareto-optimal <b>front</b> <b>of</b> the problem and to explore the <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> such <b>front.</b> Three versions <b>of</b> our proposal are studied: a (1 + 1) -NEES, a (1 + 2) -NEES and a (1 + 5) -NEES. Such approaches are validated on a set of standard test problems reported in the specialized literature. Simulation results indicate that, for continuous numerical optimization problems, our proposal (particularly the (1 + 1) -NEES) is competitive with respect to the NSGA-II, which is an algorithm representative of the state-of-the-art in evolutionary multi-objective optimization. Moreover, all the versions of our NEES improve on the results of the NSGA-II when dealing with a discrete optimization problem. Although preliminary, such results might indicate a potential application area in which our proposed approach could be particularly useful.

The Navier-Stokes equations for a chemically reacting gas are solved in a fully coupled manner using an implicit, time accurate algorithm. The solution procedure is based on a spatially second order, total variation diminishing (TVD) scheme and a temporally second order, variable-step, backward differentiation formula method. The hydrogen-oxygen chemistry is modeled with a 9 -species, 19 -step mechanism. The accuracy of the solution method is first demonstrated by several benchmark calculations. Numerical simulations of expansion tube flowfields are then presented for two different configurations. In particular, the development of the shock-induced combustion process is followed.

The Polisario gradually gained control over large swaths of the Western Saharan desert, and its power grew steadily after early 1975 when the Tropas Nomadas began deserting en masse to the Polisario Front, bringing their weapons and training with them. At this point, the maximum <b>extent</b> <b>of</b> the Polisario <b>Front's</b> manpower included perhaps 800 men, but they were backed by a larger network of supporters. The 1975 United Nations visiting mission to Spanish Sahara, headed by Simeon Aké, concluded that Sahrawi support for independence (as opposed to Spanish rule or integration with a neighboring country) amounted to an [...] "overwhelming consensus" [...] and that the Polisario Front was by far the most powerful political force in the country.|$|R
