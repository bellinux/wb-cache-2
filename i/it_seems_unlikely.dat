5|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australian's that volunteered {{to fight in}} Russia can only be guessed at, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to have been political. Regardless, they {{confirmed}} a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} for an ancestral world of RNA cells and computer analysis of viral and host DNA sequences are giving {{a better understanding}} of the evolutionary relationships between different viruses and may help identify the ancestors of modern viruses. To date, such analyses have not proved which of these hypotheses is correct. However, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that all currently known viruses have a common ancestor, and viruses have probably arisen numerous times in the past by one or more mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{atmosphere}} is very effective at absorbing high energy electromagnetic radiation such as x-rays and gamma rays, so {{these types of}} radiation would not reach any dangerous levels at the surface during the burst event itself. The immediate effect on life on Earth from a GRB within a few parsecs would only be a short increase in ultraviolet radiation at ground level, lasting from {{less than a second}} to tens of seconds. This ultraviolet radiation could potentially reach dangerous levels depending on the exact nature and distance of the burst, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be able to cause a global catastrophe for life on Earth.|$|E
2500|$|Semmelweis's {{critics were}} also {{quick to point}} out that he had {{virtually}} no evidence for his self-infection theory. [...] In particular, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the two women could have infected other patients without becoming infected themselves: ...|$|R
50|$|However, as Souths had won {{the minor}} premiership by two points, the NSWRL play-offs system meant that Balmain had to beat them in the Final, and then beat them again in a second Final to claim the title. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ultimately, <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that any}} media company, {{particularly}} the major studios and television network making Inferno and 12 Monkeys, would risk the negative publicity {{that would come}} from using the images in the spectrograms and a suggested threat against a U.S. president.|$|R
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. Implied in the text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the march, Julian gave {{a speech}} to the {{assembled}} army. Its wording could be read as implying that Julian had already had a fortified marching-camp built (in accordance with standard Roman military practice), or that he was simply proposing to do so. In any case, it appears that Julian, concerned that his men might be too tired to fight after a 6-hour march in the hot sun, urged that the clash be postponed until the following day. But his officers and men {{would have none of it}} and clamoured to be led against the enemy immediately. Julian, who prided himself on acting by consensus, gave way. However, since Ammianus states that the battle and subsequent pursuit ended after sunset, <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the army would have actually engaged at midday straight after the march without a few hours rest and refreshment (and, if a camp was built, a couple of hours spent on that task). It thus seems more likely that battle commenced in the late afternoon.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{probably}} {{in the vicinity of}} Strasbourg, the vanguard of Barbatio's army was ambushed by a strong German force as it approached the camp of Julian's deputy, Severus, who was apparently operating separately from Julian. The vanguard fled in disarray, and, instead of engaging, Barbatio led the rest of his force in a hasty retreat, under close pursuit by the Germans, out of Alsace and a good way into Raetia, in the process losing most of his sutlers, pack-animals and baggage. Then Barbatio, whose cooperation with Julian had been reluctant at best, withdrew his army from the theatre of operations altogether, without Julian's permission. He sent his forces across the Alps into winter-quarters in Italy, despite it being the middle of the campaigning season and the Alamanni being far from defeated or ejected from Alsace. This reduced Roman forces in Alsace by two-thirds and effectively sabotaged the pincer strategy. It is uncertain whether Constantius instigated Barbatio's actions, but <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the magister would have risked breaking off operations unless confident of the emperor's approval.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Parker was {{the caucus}} nominee of the Republican Party for a Missouri Senate seat. However, the {{political}} tide had shifted in Missouri; <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely</b> {{that he would}} be elected to the Senate, so he sought a presidential appointment as judge for the Western District of Arkansas.|$|R
50|$|The Springfield entry {{was most}} {{interesting}} for its layout. It used two 30-round magazines in tandem in a bullpup layout, taking rounds {{from the front}} magazine first. However, their massive magazine-fed grenade launcher pushed the weight to 14 lb, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely</b> this could be reduced by much.|$|R

5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E

50|$|He {{stayed in}} that role until April 2001, when, with Palace once again facing relegation to the third tier, manager Alan Smith was sacked by new {{chairman}} Simon Jordan, and Kember was made caretaker for the remaining two games of the season. Palace were six points short of survival, and <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely</b> that relegation could be avoided.|$|R
25|$|Subsequent rulings {{in respect}} of {{personal}} current accounts suggest that the argument that these charges are penalties for breach of contract is weak, and given the Office of Fair Trading's ruling <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that any further test case will take place.|$|E
25|$|The final tournament {{was held}} in Singapore in May 2004. Malaysia won after beating Hong Kong in the final.

25|$|Considerable {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} origins of the Cipher Manuscripts. Westcott claimed Sprengel was a German Adept of the 'Gold- und Rosenkreuzer' Order who wrote letters to Westcott and Mathers granting them permission to establish the Order in England.

50|$|Until 2009, no {{samples of}} the bitters were known to exist, and as the recipe had never been published, recreating <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>unlikely.</b> That year, a man {{showed up at the}} London Bar Show with a small {{remaining}} sample, which was then combined with extensive research (including interviewing descendants of John Boker), to recreate a facsimile of the bitters.|$|R
25|$|The morphs that {{represent}} the various tense/person/case/mood categories of Basque verbs, especially in the auxiliaries, are so highly fused that segmenting them into individual meaningful units is nearly impossible, if not pointless.

25|$|The scheme {{gave rise}} {{to many of the}} force's constables. For instance, the current Chief Inspector of Swindon Operations, Mike Jones, was in the last ever cadet unit in the Wiltshire Police.

25|$|The {{trouble with}} this account is that Gigantopithecus {{was not a}} hominin and maybe not even a crown group hominoid; yet the {{physical}} evidence implies that Bigfoot is an upright biped with buttocks and a long, stout, permanently adducted hallux. These are hominin autapomorphies, not found in other mammals or other bipeds. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that Gigantopithecus would have evolved these uniquely hominin traits in parallel.|$|E

25|$|Camponotus anderseni {{are rarely}} seen {{foraging}} {{which has led}} scientists to believe that these ants rely on another food source. Due to the high numbers of coccids, their main food source is most likely honeydew.

25|$|This {{icy water}} rescue {{is said to}} have {{exacerbated}} Peter's bladder problems and caused his death. The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that no one else would have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E
25|$|But these {{taxes would}} {{probably}} have been outweighed by the loss of the annual poll tax previously paid by peregrini, from which as Roman citizens they would now be exempt. <b>It</b> <b>seems</b> <b>unlikely</b> that the imperial government could have foregone this revenue: it is therefore almost certain that the Antonine decree was accompanied by a further decree ending Roman citizens' exemption from direct taxes. In any case, citizens were certainly paying the poll tax in the time of Emperor Diocletian (r. 282-305).|$|E
50|$|Off-track, Nigel Mansell {{dropped a}} huge hint {{that he would}} not retire from F1 after all.
