The GaN samples were grown on c-plane (0001) sapphire substrates by metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD). Trimethylgallium and blue ammonia were used as the Ga and N sources, respectively, for MOCVD growth. In our experiments, the GaN sample was thermally oxidized in a 600 ml/min oxygen ambient for 10 min at 900 °C, and an approximately 5 -nm-thick Ga 2 O 3 layer was obtained on the GaN surface. The GaN sample was thermally oxidized in the same condition but for 8 h, and a 200 -nm-thick Ga 2 O 3 layer was obtained on the GaN surface. The GaN thin-film surface has a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.3 nm as revealed by AFM. The RMS roughness of the approximately 5 -nm-thick Ga 2 O 3 layer surface is 2.7 nm. The Ga 2 O 3 thickness was measured by XPS, and the Ga 2 O 3 crystal structures were characterized using an X-ray <b>diffraction</b> (XRD) <b>apparatus.</b> The XRD measurements were carried out using an X'Pert Pro MPD diffractometer (CuKα radiation; PANalytical B.V., Almelo, The Netherlands) with an X'Celerator detector. The XRD patterns were then refined using the HighScore Plus (PANalytical B.V.) and FullProf software packages. The XPS measurements were performed at room temperature using a PHI Quantera SXM instrument (Physical Electronics GmbH, Ismaning, Germany) with AlKα (hv[*]=[*] 1486.6 eV) as the X-ray radiation source, which had been carefully calibrated {{based on the work}} function and the Fermi level (EF). The total energy resolution of this XPS system is approximately 0.5 eV, and the accuracy of the observed binding energy is within 0.03 eV after careful calibration [8]. Before taking the measurements, the XPS apparatus is calibrated by fitting to the Fermi edge of an Ar+-bombarded silver sample. The accuracy of the observed binding energy (368.26 [*]±[*] 0.03 eV for Ag 3 d 5 / 2) is within 0.03 eV. When the sample is measured, a large number of electrons are excited and emitted from the sample, so the sample is always positively charged and the resulting electric field can affect the measured kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. A low-energy electron flood gun was used to achieve charge compensation, and all of the XPS spectra were calibrated using the C 1 s peak at 284.8 eV from contamination to compensate for the charge effect. In order to avoid the pernicious effect of surface contamination on the XPS measurement of the Ga 2 O 3 /GaN heterojunction, an Ar+ bombardment with a voltage of 1 kV at a low sputtering rate of 0.5 nm/min was carried out.|$|R
40|$|Local {{delivery}} of medication to the lung is highly desirable {{as the principal}} advantages include reduced systemic side effects and higher dose levels of the applicable medication {{at the site of}} drug action. This administration could be particularly useful for patients with specifically chronic pulmonary infections or pulmonary diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, asthma or lung cancer. In order to deliver a high dose range of medication for highly-dosed drugs such as antibiotics, “carrier-free” DPI formulations of tobramycin were developed with the aim of minimizing the use of excipients. Briefly, dry powders were prepared by spray drying various suspensions of tobramycin in isopropanol. First, as particle size is a key parameter in defining drug deposition in the lungs, the new Spraytec® laser diffraction method specifically modified for measuring the PSD of aerosolized drug was evaluated. The dispersion properties of various dry powder formulations were investigated using different laser <b>diffraction</b> and impaction <b>apparatuses</b> at different flow rates and using different inhalator devices. Different correlations between geometric and aerodynamic size data were demonstrated in this study. As a potential application, for the flow rate, the different inhalation devices and the drug formulations examined, the tobramycin fine particle fraction could be predicted from measurements obtained from the Spraytec® using linear relationships. Correlations (R² > 0. 9) between the MMAD and the percentage of particles with a diameter below 5 µm could be demonstrated between the results obtained from the laser diffraction technique and the impaction method. Consequently, the Spraytec® laser diffraction technique was proved to be an important tool for initial formulation and process screening during formulation development of DPIs. In order to modify the surface properties of the raw tobramycin powder, different powder compositions were formulated with the aim of studying the influence of the concentration of tobramycin in drug suspensions used for spray-drying, the lipid film composition (cholesterol:Phospholipon ratio) and the coating level (in percentage) on the physicochemical and aerodynamic characteristics of the antibiotic. The results indicated that the application of a lipid coating around the active particles allowed an improvement in particle dispersion from the inhalator, decreasing raw powder agglomeration and thus enhancing drug deposition deep in the lungs. Moreover, these results seemed to be influenced by the amount and composition of the lipids in the formulations. The evaluation of the influence of the coating level showed that the deposition of only 5 % w/w lipids (on a dry basis) was sufficient to improve particle dispersion properties during inhalation. The FPF, which is around 36 % for the uncoated micronized tobramycin, was increased to up to about 68 % for the most effective lipid-coated formulation. Of particular importance, these results revealed the need to add sufficient amounts of covering material in order to significantly modify the particle surface properties and reduce their tendency to agglomeration, while limiting the lipid level in the formulations in order to avoid any undesirable sticking and to allow the {{delivery of}} more of the active drug to the deep lung. Another approach used to modify the surface properties of raw tobramycin was to coat the micronized particles with nanoparticles of the drug, produced by high pressure homogenization. The evaluation of the influence of the level of nanoparticle coating of the micronized particles showed that the presence of nanoparticles in the formulations improved the particle dispersion properties during inhalation. One microparticle was completely covered with a single layer or several layers of nanoparticles, in function of the percentage of nanoparticles in the mixture. Coating the fine drug particles with particles in the nanometer range was believed to reduce Van Der Waals forces and powder agglomeration. These various layers of nanoparticles also allowed a decrease in the cohesion of the powder by improving the slip between the particles. On the other hand, suspensions containing solely nanoparticles were spray dried with various concentrations of surfactant in order to produce easily dispersible and reproducible micron-size agglomerates of nanoparticles during inhalation. The evaluation of the influence of the concentration of surfactant showed that deposition of only 2 % w/w (on a dry basis) of Na glycocholate is sufficient to improve particle dispersion properties during inhalation. Consequently, the use of nanoparticles in dry powder formulations increased the FPF from 36 % for the uncoated micronized tobramycin to about 61 % for this latter formulation. To modify the balance between the different forces of interactions without the need for any excipient, the influence of formulation components on the aerosolization characteristics of spray-dried tobramycin through the use of various proportions of water in the solvent used to prepare initial suspensions was investigated. These results showed {{that it is possible to}} modify the surface properties of the particles by coating the particles of drug with a homogeneously distributed film of the active compound dissolved in a solvent system containing a mixture of different solvents such as isopropanol and water. During nebulization of the suspension, droplets are composed of one or more particles in solid state surrounded with solvent containing the dissolved drug. It is hypothesized that during the drying step, dissolved tobramycin forms a coating of the amorphous drug around particles in suspension. The coating of drug particles can thus be used as an alternative approach that permits the modification of the surface properties of the particles, increasing the flowability, the desagglomeration tendency and the fine particle fraction deposited in the deep lung. So, the evaluation of the influence of the water content of the suspensions and the effect of the inlet temperature during spray-drying showed that the addition of 2 % water v/v is sufficient to improve particle dispersion during inhalation. Of particular interest, as tobramycin is a very hygroscopic drug, the addition of water turned out to be a critical step. It was thus important to add a small amount of water to the solvent system and to process the drying step at a high temperature to produce formulations containing solely the active drug and showing a FPF of up to 50 %. Moreover, stability studies demonstrated that these optimized formulations (lipid-coated formulation, nanoparticle formulation and amorphous drug-coated formulation) were stable over a long time period at various ICH temperature and relative humidity storage conditions (25 °C/ 60 % RH, 30 °C/ 65 % RH and 40 °C/ 75 % RH). The formulations were shown to keep their crystalline state, initial PSD, redispersion characteristics and deposition results for more than twelve months. In order to confirm these encouraging results, two optimized formulations (one with a lipid coating and another with amorphous drug coating) were selected and compared to the only commercially available tobramycin formulation for inhalation, Tobi® (nebulizer solution), by performing a combined in vivo scintigraphic and pharmacokinetic evaluation of tobramycin DPIs in nine CF patients. In comparison with Tobi®, it was estimated that lung deposition, expressed as a percentage of the nominal dose, was 7. 0 and 4. 5 times higher for the lipid-coated and amorphous tobramycin-coated formulations, respectively. Moreover, the pharmacokinetic data, adjusted to the same drug dose as that of the Tobi® deposited in the lungs, showed that the AUC values were found to be 1. 6 times higher for Tobi® than for DPI formulations. So this evaluation confirmed the superiority of dry powder formulations in terms of drug deposition and reduced systemic exposure in comparison with the conventional comparator product, Tobi®. Thus, these new and orginal tobramycin DPI formulations based on the use of very low excipient levels and presenting very high lung deposition properties, were shown to offer very good prospects for improving the delivery of drugs to the pulmonary tract and to the widest possible patient population.

The pulses are accelerated and focused to meet the excitation laser and the molecular beam in a mutually perpendicular arrangement. Scattered electrons are detected by a CCD camera at the terminus of a phosphor, fiberoptic, image-intensifier chain. The excitation laser pulses may be delayed to provide time-dependent diffraction patterns. A schematic drawing of the setup is shown i...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the pulmonary administration of antibiotics as dry powder to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), as an alternative for nebulization. This part of the study describes the development of a powder formulation with colistin sulfate as model substance. The aim of the new dosage form was to increase pulmonary deposition, therapeutic efficiency and, by that, compliance by the CF patients. A physical powder mixture of colistin and a size fraction of lactose (106 - 150 μm) was prepared and the mixture was optimized with respect to colistin content (83. 3 %) for use in a special test inhaler. A laser <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus</b> with special inhaler adapter was applied for analysis of the size distribution of the aerosol cloud from the inhaler. The size distributions of the aerosol clouds from the test inhaler at flow rates between 30 and 60 l/min for the optimized formulation showed nearly the same median diameter as that for the primary drug particles. But the X 100 -value was much lower, because of an effective large particle separation from the inspiratory air by an air classifier in the test inhaler. The results suggest that dry powder inhalation might be a suitable and highly efficient alternative for nebulization of antibiotic drugs in CF therapy. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Abstract: Cavitaion erosion {{behavior}} {{of cast iron}} in water and in mixed solution of 50 % H 2 O+ 50 % C 2 H 6 O 2 with different temperature and distance between two samples have been studied {{by means of a}} ultrasonic vibrator. The mass loss of the samples at different time is recorded. The surface structure of the oxidation films on the surface of cast iron was analyzed by X-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The experimental results show that mass loss of the upper sample is more than that of the lower sample. The maximum of mass loss occurred when the distance between the samples is about 1. 0 mm. Oxidation films form {{on the surface of the}} cast iron in pure water and cannot form on the surface of cast iron in mixed solution. The XRD results show that the oxidation film mainly consists of Fe 2 O 3 phase at 50 °C, Fe 3 O 4 phase at 80 °C. The mass loss at 50 °C is less than that at 80 °C. Oxidation film of Fe 2 O 3 phase has some advantages to decelerate the cavitation erosion. Mass loss of the sample of cast iron in mixed solution is less than that in pure water at 80 °C. This phenomenon indicates that formation of the oxidation films plays a more important role in cavitation erosion to reduce or increase mass loss of the cast iron samples...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} an extraordinary quantum mechanical effect when, roughly speaking, {{the nucleus of}} an atom becomes (linearly) larger than the whole atom. Precisely, we consider Helium ion (in the ground state of the electron) moving translationally with the speed much smaller than speed of the electron rotation. This translation, effectively, changes neither the total momentum, nor the de Broglie wave length of the electron, nor the linear size of the atom corresponding to {{the diameter of the}} electron orbit. But, this translation implies a small nucleus momentum and nuclear de Broglie wavelength almost hundred times larger than the electron de Broglie wavelength. In the measurement of the nucleus wavelength using a <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus</b> with a characteristic length constant proportional to the proposed nucleus wavelength, according to standard quantum mechanical formalism, the nucleus behaves practically certainly as a wave. Then the unique, irreducible linear characteristic size for such a nucleus is de Broglie wavelength. Such a measurement effectively influences neither the electron dynamics nor linear size of the atom. This implies that, in such measurement, the size of the nucleus is in one dimension larger than the whole atom, i. e. electron orbital. All this corresponds metaphorically to the famous Leonardo fresco "Last Supper" where Jesus' words coming from the nucleus, i. e. center of the composition, cause an expanding "superposition" or dramatic wave-like movement of the apostles.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 In this dissertation, I {{describe}} the experimental investigation of catching ions in superfluid helium droplets. The {{ultimate goal of}} our project {{is to build a}} coherent electron <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus</b> for atomic structure determination from oriented single macromolecules. This involves generating protein ions from electrospray ionization (ESI) and doping them in helium droplets. The doped droplets are then oriented by an elliptically polarized laser and exposed to a coherent electron beam for diffraction. The specific goal of my project is to explore the methods for sample preparation. I have started by exploring the doping conditions for continuous cesium ions from a thermionic emission source and then moved on to pulsed ions from an ESI source. I have also characterized the size and size distribution of the doped droplets. The relative ion doping efficiency of the continuous cesium ions is determined by both the kinetic energy of the ions {{and the size of the}} droplets. For reserpine and substance P from the ESI source, we have succeeded with a simple experimental setup by stopping the ions in the droplet beam with a DC bias. The resulting doping efficiency is observed to scale with the residence time of the ion beam in the droplet beam. To further control the size of the ion doped droplets for diffraction, I also have performed an exploratory experiment of collisional size reduction of ion doped droplets. These exercises and the resulting theoretical understanding of the doping mechanism of cations in superfluid helium droplets will be fundamental for the next stage of the overall project...|$|E
40|$|Bulk {{density of}} {{undisturbed}} soil samples {{can be measured}} using computed tomography (CT) techniques with a spatial resolution of about 1 mm. However, this technique may not be readily accessible. On the other hand, x-ray radiographs have only been considered as qualitative images to describe morphological features. A calibration procedure {{was set up to}} generate two-dimensional, high-resolution bulk density images from x-ray radiographs made with a conventional x-ray <b>diffraction</b> <b>apparatus.</b> Test bricks were made to assess the accuracy of the method. Slices of impregnated soil samples were made using hardsetting seedbeds that had been gamma scanned at 5 -mm depth increments in a previous study. The calibration procedure involved three stages: (i) calibration of the image grey levels in terms of glass thickness using a staircase made from glass cover slips, (ii) measurement of ratio between the soil and resin mass attenuation coefficients and the glass mass attenuation coefficient, using compacted bricks of known thickness and bulk density, and (iii) image correction accounting for the heterogeneity of the irradiation field. The procedure was simple, rapid, and the equipment was easily accessible. The accuracy of the bulk density determination was good (mean relative error 0. 015), The bulk density images showed a good spatial resolution, so that many structural details could be observed. The depth functions were consistent with both the global shrinkage and the gamma probe data previously obtained. The suggested method would be easily applied to the new fuzzy set approach of soil structure, which requires generation of bulk density images. Also, it would be an invaluable tool for studies requiring high-resolution bulk density measurement, such as studies on soil surface crusts...|$|E
