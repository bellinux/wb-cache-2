50|$|Over the years, {{a number}} of RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> were {{developed}} for the Commodore 64 and 128. Commodore officially produced several models of RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges,</b> referred to collectively as the 17xx-series Commodore REUs. While these devices came in 128, 256, or 512 kB sizes, third-party modifications were quickly developed that could extend these devices to 2 MB, although some such modifications could be unstable. Some companies also offered services to professionally upgrade these devices.|$|R
50|$|The Yamaha Y8950 {{is a sound}} chip, {{produced}} in 1984. Essentially a Yamaha YM3526 with an ADPCM encoder/decoder added on, it {{is also known as}} MSX-Audio as it was designed for inclusion in an <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> for the MSX personal computer.|$|E
50|$|During {{the chip}} {{shortages}} of the 1980s, Commodore could not produce enough of its RAM Expansion Units (they eventually cancelled them). The GEOS operating system {{relied heavily on}} extra RAM and so the company behind GEOS produced their own memory <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge,</b> called the geoRAM.|$|E
50|$|RAM pack, RAMpack, RAM <b>{{expansion}}</b> <b>cartridge,</b> RAM {{expansion unit}} (REU), memory expansion pak and memory module {{are some of}} the most common names given to various self-contained units or cartridges that expand a computer, games console or other device's own internal RAM in a user-friendly manner.|$|E
5000|$|Some of the {{hardware}} limitations were overcome with external add-ons, particularly <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges.</b> Some {{were made by}} Tandy, some by other manufacturers. Examples are: ...|$|R
50|$|Typically, most Commodore 64 users did {{not require}} a RAM expansion. Very little of the {{available}} software was programmed {{to make use of}} expansion memory. The cost of the units (and the requirement to add a heavy-duty power supply) also was a factor in the limited usage of RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges.</b> The volatility of DRAM was also a factor in the limited usage, as the RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> were normally used for fast RAM disk storage, data stored on them would be lost at any power failure.|$|R
50|$|Several {{levels of}} the game can be played on the {{hardware}} expansion subsystem alone. Additionally, smaller <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> (originally available for separate purchase) providing additional levels and other new content can be plugged directly into the Karaoke Studio subsystem.|$|R
50|$|The {{consumer}} {{version of}} the 8580 was rebadged the 6582, even though the die on the chip is identical to a stock 8580 chip, including the '8580R5' mark. Dr. Evil Laboratories used it in their SID Symphony <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> (sold to Creative Micro Designs in 1991), and it was used in a few other places as well, including one PC sound-card.|$|E

50|$|The RAMLink was one {{of several}} RAM {{expansion}} products made by Creative Micro Designs (CMD) for Commodore's C64/128 home computers. The RAMLink was intended as a third-party alternative, successor and optionally companion to Commodore's own 17xx-series REU RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commodore's {{official}} RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{were only}} available up {{to a maximum}} of 16 kB worth of additional memory, but third party cartridges could provide up to 64 kB and sometimes included DIP switches to map the additional RAM to user-selectable address space.|$|R
50|$|Since the VIC-20 was {{designed}} to use SRAM rather than DRAM, the system board had no provisions for RAM refresh. Memory <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> may in practice use either type; however, DRAM-based expanders had to contain their own circuitry to refresh the RAM and multiplex the data/address bus, and one possible reason for the oversized VIC-20 cartridge PCBs may have been to provide room for DRAM infrastructure.|$|R
50|$|The Nintendo DS Browser is {{a version}} of the Opera web browser for use on the Nintendo DS, {{developed}} by Opera Software and Nintendo. The Nintendo DS Browser comes in separate versions for the Nintendo DS and the Nintendo DS Lite; this is due to differing physical size requirements for the memory <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> included with the browser. The Nintendo DSi is incompatible with the Nintendo DS Browser, though a DSi compatible version of Opera 9.5, Nintendo DSi Browser (Nintendō Dī Esu Ai Burauzā), is available free from the DSi Shop.|$|E
5000|$|SLOT-2 devices {{sometimes}} contain extra RAM (similar to the SLOT-2 RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> {{that comes}} with the Nintendo DS Browser) or Rumble Pak abilities that can be used by homebrew or, for the Rumble, Nintendo games. However, the serial design of SLOT-1 does not lend itself to being used for RAM or Rumble expansion, and therefore SLOT-1 devices do not offer extra RAM or Rumble ability. (Separate RAM/Rumble expansion packs for SLOT-2 can still be bought.) However, somehow a few manufacturers have managed to pack processors in SLOT-1 devices.|$|E
50|$|The {{source code}} {{was written in}} VIC-BASIC, with {{assembly}} language routines for faster animation of graphics and to handle the background music. Unlike most {{of the more popular}} VIC-20 games, it wasn't published as a ROM cartridge but rather on cassette tape. Due to the complexity of the source code and the unusual (by VIC-20 standards) length of the game, as well as the fact that unlike a cartridge game all of it had to fit in RAM, an 8k or 16k RAM memory <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> was required to be installed in the VIC-20 before running the game, further limiting the target audience.|$|E
50|$|Since MSX BASIC {{was meant}} to be {{expandable}} from inception, it was possible to write add-on modules quite easily. Support for specific hardware was commonly added by means of <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges,</b> which also served as the interface to the hardware in question. MSX Disk-BASIC is an example, bundled in the cartridge that provides the hardware interface to the disk drives, it adds commands to access the floppy disk drives.|$|R
50|$|Some 64 kB <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{allowed the}} user to copy ROM images to RAM. The more {{advanced}} versions even contained an 80-character video chip and a patched BASIC interpreter which gave access to 48 kB of the memory and to the 80-column video mode. As the latter type of cartridges, marketed primarily in Germany, were not released until late 1984—two years after {{the appearance of the}} more capable C64—they went by mostly unnoticed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{memory mapping}} of the VIC-20 was {{slightly}} confusing and could {{vary depending on}} system configuration. With no expanders installed, free user memory started at $1000 and extended up to $1DFF, with the video buffer placed at $1E00-$1FFF. Below $1000 was a [...] "hole" [...] from $400-$FFF which could be filled with 3 kB of expansion RAM. If memory <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> were used, video memory started at $1000 and free user RAM at $1200.|$|R
50|$|When used on Texas Instruments' Consumer Division products, the VSMs {{are always}} marked CDxxxxx where xxxxx is a 4 or 5 digit mask rom ID code, {{typically}} 23xx or 62xxx. The chips are SOMETIMES (typically after 1981) also marked TMC0350, as {{this seems to}} be the 'internal use class' of the chip. The very first VSMs (used in the Speak and Spell, 1978 version) were marked TMC0351 and TMC0352 and did not have a CD number. These two SEEM to have been 'grandfathered in' as CD2300 and CD2301, as all later VSMs start at CD2302 (used in the 'Vowel Power' Speak and Spell <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge).</b> It {{should also be noted that}} CD22xx, CD25xx and CD28xx numbers are used for chips that are NOT VSMs.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{available}} 17xx-series Commodore REUs, and then their later discontinuation, Berkeley Softworks, the publishers of GEOS, developed their own 512 kB RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> - the GeoRAM. This device was purposely designed for use with GEOS, although some REU-aware programs were later adapted {{to be able to use}} it. Some time later, the GeoRAM was cloned by another company to form the BBGRAM device (which also sported a battery backup unit). The GeoRAM used a banked-memory design where portions of the external SRAM were banked into the Commodore 64's CPU address space. This method provided substantially slower transfer speeds than the single-cycle-per-byte transfer speeds of the Commodore REUs. A benefit of using SRAMs was lower power consumption which did not require upgrading the Commodore 64's power supply.|$|E
40|$|Key Words: {{fluid power}} {{transmission}} and control; control valve; cavitations; numerical simulation Abstract: Four kinds of cavitations suppression schemes {{on the basis}} of cavitations theory of control valve were designed in this paper. The fluid dynamic characteristics parameters under the above schemes was obtained by using RNG k-ε turbulence model respectively, which is composed with the velocity vector of internal fluid, pressure and cavitations distribution contours of numerical simulation. The results show that the design of straight-through porous structure has a lot of advantages compared with other structures in terms of its good fluid dynamic characteristics that fluid flow is uniformly in the valve cartridge, the loss of pressure is lower, the impaction in <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridge</b> is smaller and impact noise of it can be reduced. Therefore, the straight-through porous structure could suppress the initiation and development of the cavitations...|$|E
50|$|The Sega Saturn has {{a fairly}} unusual workaround; while a disk-based console, {{it has a}} {{cartridge}} slot generally used for backup memory, cheat cards, and other utilities. This same slot {{can also be used}} for cartridges that allow imported games to run. Some of these cartridges include regional bypass, extra memory, RAM expansion(s), and cheat devices all in one, while others feature only regional bypass and cannot play certain Japanese Saturn games that require RAM <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Aside from power-supply problems, {{the other}} main {{downfall}} of the RAM expansions were their limited usability {{due to their}} technical implementation. The RAM in the <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> was only accessible via a handful of hardware registers, rather than being CPU-addressable memory. This meant that users could not access this RAM without complicated programming techniques. Furthermore, simply adding the RAM expansion did not provide any kind of on-board RAM disk functionality (though a utility disk was supplied with some REUs, which provided a loadable RAM disk driver).|$|R
50|$|The Starpath Supercharger (originally {{called the}} Arcadia Supercharger) is an <b>expansion</b> {{peripheral}} <b>cartridge</b> created by Starpath, for playing cassette-based proprietary {{games on the}} Atari 2600 video game console.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} up to 52 playable songs, with a {{base set}} of 12 songs {{and the capacity}} to use as many as 4 <b>expansion</b> library <b>cartridges</b> of 10 songs each.|$|R
5000|$|Some non-program <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> {{include a}} sound/voice {{synthesizer}} (which {{led to the}} CoCo being used as an accessibility device for the disabled), 300-baud modem pack, an RS232 pack (the internal serial port was merely one bit of a parallel port), a hard-drive controller, stereo-music adapter, floppy-disk controller, input tablet, and other accessories. Some of this hardware was designed and marketed by third party mail-order houses, including a [...] "Disto Super Controller" [...] (a floppy controller, with space for an optional serial port or SCSI interface in the same enclosure). The CoCo was the first Tandy computer to have a mouse available for it; instead of following the IBM PC/Microsoft standard, this mouse was electrically the equivalent of an analogue joystick.|$|R

5000|$|Early in the Commodore 64's life, Commodore {{released}} several niche hardware enhancements {{for sound}} manipulation. These included the [...] "Sound Expander", [...] "Sound Sampler", [...] "Music Maker" [...] overlay, and External music keyboard. The Sound Expander and Sound Sampler were both <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges,</b> but had limited use. The Sound Sampler in particular could only record {{close to two}} seconds of audio, rendering it largely useless. The Music Maker was a plastic overlay for the Commodore 64 [...] "breadbox" [...] keyboard, which included plastic piano keys corresponding to keys on the keyboard. The External keyboard was an add-on which plugged into the Sound Expander. These hardware devices did not sell well, perhaps due to their cost, lack of adequate software, marketing as home consumer devices, and an end result that turned many serious musicians off.|$|R
50|$|There were {{numerous}} sound editing tools for the Commodore 64. Commodore released music composition software {{which included a}} keyboard overlay suited for early model Commodore 64s. Software titles such as the Music Construction Set were available for users to compose music with notes, however the only tools which really pushed the C64's sonic capability to the full were mostly demoscene music tools, or pure assembly language. MIDI <b>expansion</b> <b>cartridges</b> and speech synthesizing hardware was also available for more serious musicians. The Prophet64 cartridge was recently released and features a suite of GUI-style applications for sequencing music, drum and rhythm synthesis, MIDI DIN-sync, and {{taking advantage of the}} SID chip in other ways, effectively turning the C64 into a true musical instrument that anyone can use. There was also software which could be used to make the Commodore 64 speak, the best-known being SAM.|$|R
50|$|Such {{units are}} {{generally}} {{designed to be}} installable by an end-user with little technical knowledge, often simply by plugging them into an <b>expansion</b> or <b>cartridge</b> slot easily accessible {{at the rear of}} the machine (e.g. the Sinclair ZX81 or the VTech Laser 200), or via a user-accessible hatch (e.g. the Atari 800's CX852 and CX853 modules or the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak).|$|R
