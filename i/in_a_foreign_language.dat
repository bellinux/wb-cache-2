Eleanor Roosevelt High School, a small public high school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, was founded in 2002.

25|$|The two {{alternative}} methods of 'translating' films <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> are dubbing, in which other actors record over {{the voices of}} the original actors in a different language, and lectoring, a form of voice-over for fictional material where a narrator tells the audience what the actors are saying while their voices can be heard in the background. Lectoring is common for television in Russia, Poland, and a few other East European countries, while cinemas in these countries commonly show films dubbed or subtitled.|$|E

25|$|The {{doctrine}} of foreign equivalents is a {{rule applied in}} United States trademark law which requires courts and the TTAB to translate foreign words in determining whether they are registrable as trademarks, or confusingly similar with existing marks. The doctrine is intended to protect consumers within the United States from confusion or deception caused {{by the use of}} terms in different languages. In some cases, a party will use a word as a mark which is either generic or merely descriptive of the goods <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language,</b> or which shares the same meaning as an existing mark to speakers of that foreign language.|$|E
25|$|The {{language}} of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish {{may be used as}} a {{language of}} instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language,</b> nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes.|$|E

25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{concerns the}} fact that most traditional tests of APD use verbal materials. The British Society of Audiology has embraced Moore's (2006) recommendation that tests for APD should assess processing of non-speech sounds. The concern is that if verbal materials are used to test for APD, then children may fail because of limited language ability. An analogy may be drawn with trying to listen to sounds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language.</b> It is much harder to distinguish between sounds or to remember a sequence of words in a language you do not know well: the problem is not an auditory one, but rather due to lack of expertise in the language.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{trait of}} Argentine rock is its uncompromising stance to only use Spanish language lyrics. Rock music {{is made in}} many languages around the world, {{but in most cases}} it shares the lyrical creative pen with English. The Argentine rock movement {{was one of the first}} non-English forms of rock to be commercially successful overseas. Today it's rare for an Argentine rock band to sing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> as happens in other nations, even within Latin America and Spain (except to convey a sense of artistic freedom, or in an attempt to isolate their message or aesthetic). Argentine rock today is a blanket term describing a number of rock styles and sub-cultures within Argentina.|$|E
25|$|While the {{scientific}} study of language is known as linguistics and is generally considered a social science, a natural science or a cognitive science, the study of languages is still central to the humanities. A good deal of twentieth-century and twenty-first-century philosophy has been devoted to the analysis of language and to the question of whether, as Wittgenstein claimed, many of our philosophical confusions derive from the vocabulary we use; literary theory has explored the rhetorical, associative, and ordering features of language; and historical linguists have studied the development of languages across time. Literature, covering a variety of uses of language including prose forms (such as the novel), poetry and drama, also {{lies at the heart of}} the modern humanities curriculum. College-level programs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> usually include study of important works of the literature in that language, as well as the language itself.|$|E
50|$|Besides education, the {{certificates}} {{may also}} be useful in certain job areas.

Employees in health sector would also need to prove their language proficiency — the Chambers of Nurses in Poland require foreigners employed by Polish hospitals and medical centres to have <b>a</b> certificate <b>in</b> Polish as <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> at B1 level.

25|$|Basic {{training}} commences with 'pep talks' {{to boost}} {{the morale of the}} new recruit. This is a ten-day phase in which the inductee is familiarised with the real world of intelligence and espionage, as opposed to the spies of fiction. Common usages, tradecraft techniques and classification of information are taught. Financial and economic analysis, Space Technology, Information Security, Energy Security and Scientific knowledge is imbibed to the trainees. The recruit is made to specialise <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language</b> and introduced to Geo strategic analysis. Case studies of other agencies like CIA, KGB, ISI, Mossad and MI6 are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organisations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country's foreign policy does. Basic classroom training in tactics and language are imparted to R officers at the residential Training and Language Institute in Gurgaon. A multi-disciplinary school of economic intelligence is also being set up in Mumbai to train intelligence officers in investigating economic crimes like money laundering for terror purposes etc.|$|E

25|$|Vassar confers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) {{degree in}} more than 50 majors, {{including}} the Independent Major, in which a student may design a major, as well as various interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary fields of study.

25|$|A {{few months}} after its United States release, The Sound of Music opened in 261 theaters overseas—the first American movie to be {{completely}} dubbed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>language,</b> both dialogue and music. The German, French, Italian, and Spanish versions were completely dubbed, the Japanese version had Japanese dialogue with English songs, and other versions were released with foreign subtitles. The film was a popular success in every country it opened, except the two countries where the story originated, Austria and Germany. In these countries, the film had {{to compete with the}} much-loved Die Trapp-Familie (1956), which provided the original inspiration for the Broadway musical, and its sequel Die Trapp-Familie in Amerika (1958)—both films still widely popular in German-speaking Europe and considered the authoritative von Trapp story. Austrians took exception to the liberties taken by the filmmakers with regard to the costumes, which did not reflect traditional style, and the replacement of traditional Austrian folk songs with Broadway show tunes. The film's Nazi theme was especially unpopular in Germany, where the Munich branch manager for 20th Century Fox approved the unauthorized cutting of the entire third act of the film following the wedding sequence—the scenes showing Salzburg following the Anschluss. Robert Wise and the studio intervened, the original film was restored, and the branch manager was fired. The Sound of Music has never been popular in Austria and Germany.|$|E
