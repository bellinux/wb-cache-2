Based on empirical research conducted among 473 Dutch executives, we find that CSR attitudes mediate the influence of religiosity on CSR behavior. Intrinsic religiosity positively affects the ethical CSR attitude and negatively affects the financial CSR attitude, whereas extrinsic religiosity stimulates the philanthropic CSR attitude. Financial, ethical, and philanthropic CSR attitudes significantly affect some types of CSR behaviors. However, because religiosity has opposing effects on the three attitudes, the <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> effect of the three attitudes is negligible.

50|$|Emperor Napoleon III of France {{sought to}} re-establish a French empire in North America, with Mexico {{at the center}} of an empire that he hoped might also come to include a canal across Central America. In December 1861, France invaded Mexico. While the {{official}} justification was the collection of debts, France eventually established a puppet state under the rule of Maximilian I of Mexico. In October 1862, fearing that a re-unified United States would threaten his restored French empire, Napoleon III proposed an armistice and <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> of the American Civil War by France, Britain, and Russia. However, this proposal was declined by the other European powers, who feared alienating the North. Napoleon's bellicose stands towards Russia in the 1863 January Uprising divided the powers and greatly diminished any chance of a joint European intervention. The United States refused to recognize Maximilian's government and threatened to drive France out of the country by force, but did not become directly involved in the conflict even as Mexican resistance to Maximilian's rule grew. With the end of the American Civil War in 1865, the U.S. increased pressure on France to withdraw from Mexico, and the French presence in the Western hemisphere would be a major foreign policy issue for Lincoln's successor.|$|R

Japan did everything possible to consolidate her position in Shantung, but always with the knowledge that America might re-open the question at any time. As soon as the Washington Conference was announced, Japan began feverishly negotiating with China, with a view to having the question settled before the opening of the Conference. But the Chinese, very wisely, refused the illusory concessions offered by Japan, and insisted on almost unconditional evacuation. At Washington, both parties agreed to the <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> of England and America.

40|$|Abstract The autobiographical memory {{model of}} PTSD posits that the memory for the {{traumatic}} experience is influential in {{development of the}} disorder (Rubin, Berntsen, 2 ̆ 6 Bohni, 2008). In particular, Berntsen 2 ̆ 6 Rubin (2006) argue {{that the degree of}} event centralization, the incorporation of the memory into the individual 2 ̆ 7 s sense of self and life story, {{is directly related to the}} degree of PTSD symptoms exhibited by the individual. The present series of studies systematically analyzes event centralization and its relationship to PTSD, while taking into account other variables such as cognitive and emotion variables, as well as individual differences. Study one explored event centralization as an additional factor of PTSD symptoms. Results from this study suggest that PTSD is best described by a higher order model that includes the following five lower order factors: event centralization, reexperienceing, effortful avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. In study two, predictors of adaptive and maladaptive outcomes were compared in a <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> model. The results from this model suggest that Neuroticism is a risk factor for PTSD, and that this may be due to Neuroticism causing increases in event-related rumination and event centralization. Conversely, Agreeableness is a protective factor that increases reflection and emotion-focused coping, which subsequently leads to posttraumatic growth. Finally, study three expanded the centrality of events scale to specify the emotional direction of the centralization. Results from this study suggest that some individuals centralized their traumatic event in a positive way, but negative event centralization was a stronger predictor of PTSD symptoms than was positive event centralization. Combined, the results of these studies support the theorized role of event centralization in the development of PTSD. Given the growing body of evidence for the relationship between event centralization and PTSD symptoms, clinical practices should be updated to better serve the individuals afflicted by PTSD...|$|R

40|$|Focused Conference Group: FC 15 – Endotheliumin Health and Disease. Paper No. 1595 Elevated {{angiotensin}} II (AngII) {{levels have}} {{been implicated in}} patients with hypertension and diabetic vascular complications, while cyclooxy-genase- 2 (COX- 2) {{is regarded as a}} culprit of vascular inflammation. However, it remains elusive whether COX- 2 acts directly as a downstream effector in mediating AngII-induced vascular pathogenesis. The present study aimed to investigate this relationship and the intracellular signalling cascades linking these two factors. Primary endothelial cells were freshly cultivated from rat thoracic aortas. The COX- 2 expression was minimal in untreated endothelial cells but reached a maximum after 8 -hour incubation with 100 nM AngII. Losartan and RNA synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin-D) inhibited COX- 2 over-expression. Of known transcriptional pathways examined, only inhibitors of p 38 MAPK and ERK 1 / 2 (SB- 202190 and PD- 98059) decreased COX- 2 expression, and co-treatment caused additive effect, suggesting a <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> through both kinases. PKC inhibitor (GF 109203 X), and particularly, the specific PKCδ inhibitor (rottlerin), prevented AngII-induced phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and COX- 2 expression, suggesting an upstream regulation of ERK 1 / 2 by PKCδ. Pivotal role of PKC in AngII-induced COX- 2 expression was further supported by a similar stimulatory effect of PKC activator, signified by the translocation of PKCδ to the membrane and confirmed by its phosphorylation (Tyr 311). Aortae of AngII-infused rats and renal arteries from patients with hypertension and diabetes exhibited an increased endothelial COX- 2 expression. The present novel findings indicate that activation of p 38 MAPK and PKCδ/ERK 1 / 2 is critical in AngII-mediated COX- 2 up-regulation. This study provides an important molecular basis for further elucidation on how the COX- 2 -derived products participate in vascular inflammation in hypertension and diabetes.

This article analyzes why the practice of mediation today creates a demand for such expertise-focused cooperation. Beyond the need for flexibility and additional resources, the explanation lies in the prevailing feeling of uncertainty caused by today’s internal conflicts, for which the traditional state-centric lens is becoming irrelevant. In this context, the UN relies on knowledge produced by an epistemic community of peace and conflict scholars, and is embedded in a network of nongovernmental mediators with which it exchanges know-how, following the logic of communities of practice...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} comparatively analyses the use {{and effectiveness}} of international mediation by the United Nations and six regional organisations namely, The League of Arab States (AL), the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), the European Union (EU) the Organisation of American States (OAS), the Organisation for African Unity (OAU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). When reviewing the literature it became evident that a comparative expose of organisation mediation was overdue. Research on international mediation posits that mediation success is contingent on several contextual and process factors. This thesis sought to determine which of the contextual factors affecting international mediation also influenced organisation mediation. Secondly, {{similarities and differences between}} UN and regional organisation mediation are identified and examined. In addition to considering the effect of contextual factors on mediation, the analysis takes into consideration the impact of various levels of interorganisational cooperation. The UN and regional organisations are obligated to cooperate in the peaceful settlement of international disputes, however very {{little is known about the}} effectiveness of their <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> efforts. Indeed, the nature of interorganisational relations in international mediation has never been empirically examined. Taking into account actual mediator experiences, inter organisational mediation activities are categorised to reflect three different levels of cooperation: independent participation, coordination and cooperation. This research takes a unique look at the impact of organisation cooperation on mediation to gain more insight into how organisations function in a 'mediating relationship'. The analysis leads to a re-evaluation of systemic cooperation once the reality of interorganisational cooperation is revealed. This study enlarges an extensive data set of international mediation to analyse specific elements of organisation mediation. New data was coded to comply with the existing data set and was fitted to' conform to the framework of the contingency model. The empirical analysis, using bivariate and multivariate methods, identifies several organisational characteristics and differences. While this study does not provide definitive answers on how to apply mediation more effectively, the results have some predictive value in determining the strengths and weaknesses in organisation mediation practices. Findings suggest that though the UN and regional organisations mediate effectively in different dispute conditions, cooperative mediation offers the greatest potential. Despite the intense conditions in which cooperation occurred and the fact that organisation cooperation is still largely ad hoc, lacking structure and recognition, cooperative mediation was remarkably successful...|$|R
6000|$|... (M29) This pretty nearly concludes {{all that}} need be said upon the {{attitude}} taken by Mr. Gladstone in that mighty struggle. We may at least add that if, and where, it differed {{from that of}} the majority of his countrymen, it did not differ for the worse. In November (1862) the French Emperor renewed proposals of <b>joint</b> <b>mediation.</b> The Emperor had objects of his own to serve. He was entangled in the coils of the Mexican adventure that was to give the first shock to his throne and to add another to the long scroll of tragedies in the house of Hapsburg. From the first the government of the American Union had scowled upon the intervention of Europe in the affairs of Mexico, just as the same government had refused to intervene in a European protest on behalf of Poland. The civil war between North and South kept American hands tied, and Napoleon well knew that the success of the North and the consolidation of the Union would overthrow his designs in Mexico. He cast restlessly about for any combination that promised aid to the Southern confederates, who, whether they should emerge strong or weak from the struggle, would be a useful instrument for his future purposes. So now he pressed England and Russia to join him in a project of mediation. Russia declined. The London cabinet was divided.(62) Mr. Gladstone writes home in these important days.—“Nov. 11. We have had our cabinet to-day and meet again to-morrow. I am afraid we shall do little or nothing in the business of America. But I will send you definite intelligence. Both Lords Palmerston and Russell are right.—Nov. 12. The United States affair has ended and not well. Lord Russell rather turned tail. He gave way without resolutely fighting out his battle. However, though we decline for the moment, the answer is put upon grounds and in terms which leave the matter very open for the future.—Nov. 13. I think the French will make our answer about America public; at least it is very possible. But I hope they may not take it as a positive refusal, or at any rate that they may themselves act in the matter. It will be clear that we concur with them, that the war should cease. Palmerston gave to Russell’s proposal a feeble and half-hearted support. As to the state of matters generally in the cabinet, I have never seen it smoother; and they look pretty well, I think, as regards my department, though the distress tells upon me.” ...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to examine}} the relative contribution of mediators derived from different theoretical perspectives (i. e. self-control theory, differential association theory, and routine activity theory) to explaining the relationship between parenting and delinquency. It is examined how various dimensions of parenting (i. e. parental monitoring, parental limit-settings, {{and the quality of the}} parent-adolescent relationship) are related to self-control, delinquent attitudes, peer delinquency, and time spent in criminogenic settings, and how these factors are in turn related to involvement in delinquency. Because it is reasonable to assume that these mediating mechanisms are interrelated, it is important to examine these mediators simultaneously in order to determine their relative contribution to explaining the relationship between parenting and delinquency. Since time spent in criminogenic settings is a relatively new concept used to explain adolescent engagement in delinquency, however, we also examined whether and how parenting is related to time spent in criminogenic settings. As a final step, we examined gender differences in the direct and indirect pathways, derived from the various theoretical frameworks, from parenting to delinquency. Data from the Study of Peers, Activities and Neighborhoods (SPAN) were used in the current dissertation, consisting of two waves of data collection among adolescents who were between the ages of 11 and 17 at T 1 (M = 14. 3). In order to be able to examine both between-person differences as well as within-person changes simultaneously we proposed a multilevel modeling approach. This approach enables us to explain time-stable differences between individuals, as well as within-person change in the dependent variable, controlled for all stable individual differences. The results of this dissertation have indicated that an integration of concepts from different theories in a <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> model, and by examining both between-person differences and within-person changes, provides insight into the ways in which various parenting dimensions might influence adolescent involvement in delinquency. Parental monitoring, parental limit-setting and the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship might indirectly be protective for involvement in delinquency, by affecting the adolescent’s level of self-control, delinquent attitudes and peer delinquency. The present dissertation also provided some more insight into the determinants of time spent in criminogenic settings. Parents may function as access barriers by directly restricting adolescents from spending time in criminogenic settings on the one hand, but also indirectly by fostering self-control and delinquent attitudes that prevent them from spending time in criminogenic settings on the other hand. Furthermore the findings suggest that mechanisms derived from mainstream criminological theories explain involvement in delinquent behavior for both male and female adolescents. To conclude, interventions aimed at improving the quality of the parent-adolescent relationship might be as important as interventions aimed at improving parental monitoring and parental limit-setting, and boys and girls may equally benefit from these interventions...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between law and negotiation is increasingly {{at the forefront}} of the international agenda. International organisations whose role includes the mediation of peace, such as the <b>Mediation</b> Support <b>Unit</b> of the United Nations, and the European Union, are seeking to understand the {{relationship between}} mediation, law and justice in conflict and post conflict societies. While such organisations acknowledge that international law places normative constraints on the practice of peace making, they also recognise that key principles of mediation, such as consent, inclusivity and local ownership, are crucial to the success of negotiated peace processes (United Nations, 2012). These questions have risen to the top of international policy agendas, but there is little academic scrutiny of how the relationship between law and negotiation itself it to be negotiated (Kastner, 2015). Research to date has focused on discrete aspects of the relationship between law and negotiation, such as the role of human rights in peace agreements (Bell, 2000), or in setting transitional justice priorities (Bell 2008; Wierda, 2010). It has not addressed the overarching question of the relationship between law and negotiation that underpins these divisive issues. Binding norms as well as normative expectations serve to shape the mediation process. Yet while law can play a key role in providing guidance for peacemakers, and in providing legitimacy for peace agreements, it can also come into conflict with the political task of negotiation...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is the Southern African Development Community (SADC) {{preventive}} diplomacy interventions in Lesotho in 1994, 1998 and 2007. The core aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of the SADC security mechanism (the Organ on Politics, Defence and Security (OPDS) in conflict prevention, management and resolution on the basis of the Lesotho experience. Data for this qualitative case study was collected through interviews and document analysis. The twenty four participants for the study were drawn from the SADC OPDS unit, Lesotho political parties, Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), Academics from the University of Botswana (UB) and the National University of Lesotho (NUL), retired Botswana Defence officers who participated in the Lesotho missions and office of the post- 2007 election dispute dialogue facilitator in Lesotho. Documents on the SADC Treaties, Protocols, Communiqués and interventions in other set ups were used to highlight its operational policies, mandate, structures, successes and challenges. Lesotho was chosen as a case study because SADC employed both non-coercive (SADC Troika and Eminent Person mediation, 1994 and 2007 respectively) and coercive measures (the 1998 military intervention). The findings of the study revealed that SADC as a regional body had its own successes and challenges. Different perceptions on the SADC interventions in Lesotho emerged mainly between the participants from the ruling party and the opposition parties. While the former commended SADC for successfully mitigating the calamitous effects of 1994, 1998 and 2007 post-electoral violence, the opposition parties viewed the regional organisations as engaged in illegal interference in the domestic affairs of the country to defend the incumbent governing party. It also emerged from the study that the SADC security mechanism has numerous structural and operational flaws. There were several unanswered questions revolving around the legality and mandate of some of the missions. For instance, no concrete evidence emerged as to whether the 1998 military intervention was authorised by the SADC. The study also revealed that SADC has learnt valuable lessons from the Lesotho missions. Some of the reforms which the SADC has introduced in the OPDS such as the establishment of the SADC Stand by Force, Early Warning structures, the <b>Mediation</b> <b>Unit,</b> and a panel of expert mediators emanated mainly from the Lesotho experiences. The study recommends that SADC needs to harmonise the efforts of its OPDS structures such as the Mediation Unit; the Troika; the Inter-State Defence and Security Committee (ISDSC); the Inter-State Politics and Diplomacy Committee (ISPDC) and the Summit of Heads of States and Governments for rapid, coherent and well coordinated interventions in future regional preventive missions. It is also recommended that SADC should focus on identifying and mitigating underlying causal factors such as underdevelopment; poverty; deprivation of freedoms, marginalisation and other forms of social stratifications and oppression in its preventive diplomacy missions if durable peace is to be achieved in Lesotho and any other future cases...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{the results}} aforementioned, I {{went on in the}} second part of the study to examine the impact of aging on EDCF-mediated contractions - the {{alterations}} of COX- 2 -mediated endothelium-dependent contractions and the associated release of prostaglandin(s) in the aortae from aged (> 18 month-old) hamsters. Endothelium-dependent contractions in the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) were significantly greater in the aortae from aged hamsters and contractions could also be observed without L-NAME, which were sensitive to COX- 2 inhibitors and TP receptor antagonists. The levels of COX- 2 expression, the release of PGF 2 alpha and vascular sensitivity to PGF 2 alpha were augmented in aortae of aged hamsters. The present results indicate a positive impact of aging on COX- 2 -derived PGF 2 alpha-mediated endothelium-dependent contractions. In the first part of the study, I investigated whether COX- 2 participated in the occurrence of endothelium-dependent contractions in the aortae from young (- 3 month-old) hamsters and identified the most possible EDCF. Endothelium-dependent contractions were elicited by acetylcholine and abolished by COX- 2 inhibitors (NS- 398, DuP- 697 and celecoxib) and thromboxane-prostanoid (TP) receptor antagonists (S 18886, L- 655, 240 and GR 32191), but not by COX- 1 inhibitors (valeryl salicylate and sc 560). RT-PCR and Western blot analysis using aortae with and without endothelium revealed that the COX- 2 expression was localized mainly in the endothelium. Levels of prostangladin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) and prostacyclin (PGI 2) increased in response to acetylcholine and the release of both prostaglandins was inhibited by COX- 2 but not COX- 1 inhibitors. Exogenous PGF 2 alpha but not PGI 2 caused contractions at a concentration that corresponded to the amount released endogenously. The release of PGF 2 alpha was not affected by the presence of nitric oxide (NO). The results of the present study suggest that a novel constitutive role of COX- 2 in endothelium-dependent contractions, with its metabolites PGF 2 alpha acting as a physiological EDCF in the young hamster aortae. In the third part of the study, I investigated the relationship and the intracellular signaling cascades linking two pro-inflammatory factors Ang II and COX- 2, and tested whether COX- 2 mediated the Ang II-induced vascular pathogenesis. Eight hour-incubation with 100 nmol/L Ang II resulted in maximal COX- 2 expression in primary rat endothelial cells and it was inhibited by losartan and RNA synthesis inhibitor (actinomycin-D). Inhibitors of either p 38 MAPK or ERK 1 / 2 (respectively SB 202190 and PD 98059) decreased the COX- 2 expression, and co-treatment with both inhibitors caused an additive effect, suggesting a <b>joint</b> <b>mediation</b> through both kinases. Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor (GF 109203 X), and particularly, the specific PKCdelta inhibitor (rottlerin), prevented Ang II-induced phosphorylation of ERK 1 / 2 and COX- 2 expression, indicating an upstream regulation of ERK 1 / 2 by PKC delta. A pivotal role of PKCdelta in Ang II-induced COX- 2 expression was further supported by a similar stimulatory effect of PKC activator, signified by the Ang II-stimulated translocation of PKCdelta to the membrane and confirmed by its phosphorylation (Tyr 311). Small interfering RNA targeting PKCdelta (siPKCdelta) diminished COX- 2 expression, which was abrogated in siPKCdelta-treated cells treated with SB 202190, confirming the parallel pathways of PKC delta-ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 MAPK. Aortae and renal arteries from Ang II-infused rats exhibited an increased endothelial COX- 2 expression and impaired acetylcholine-induced relaxation that was normalized by celecoxib. Human mesenteric arteries incubated with Ang II demonstrated elevated endothelial COX- 2 and MCP- 1 expressions, of which the former was inhibited by SB 202190 plus rottlerin and the latter prevented by COX- 2 inhibitor celecoxib. Renal arteries from hypertensive or diabetic patients revealed an exaggerated expression of COX- 2 and MCP- 1 in the endothelium. The present novel findings indicate that the activation of PKCdelta-ERK 1 / 2 and p 38 MAPK is critical in Ang II-induced COX- 2 up-regulation in endothelial cells, and identify a COX- 2 -dependent pro-atherosclerotic cytokine MCP- 1.
