40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we {{have argued that}} <b>technological</b> <b>communities</b> provide a useful level of analysis to examine information and knowledge flows among researchers. Based on an international {{survey of more than}} 700 scientists and engineers engaged in the development of neural network technology, the information and knowledge exchange patterns of two important subsets of that particular <b>technological</b> <b>community,</b> i. e. academic researchers and industrial researchers, were explored. The analyses demonstrated that industrial researchers, even if they are more commercially oriented than their colleagues in academia, recognise the professional community as a relevant locus of information and knowledge. An obvious methodological need exists, though, to generalize beyond the neural networks community. This is the aim of the present paper. Based on questionnaire surveys of researchers belonging to two other <b>technological</b> <b>communities,</b> the empirical results from the neural network community study are replicated and, to a large extent, validated. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Technological options can be {{regarded}} as variations in an evolutionary development process. The variations are put forward by their respective <b>technological</b> <b>communities</b> and are selected by technology selectors. Building on the notion of quasi-evolutionary technology development we show how <b>technological</b> <b>communities</b> secure their position on R&D agendas through feeding and maintaining expectations in arenas of expectations. We examine this process by studying the expectations work of the community that tries to develop metal hydrides for the on-board storage of hydrogen for mobile applications. Metal hydrides are proposed as a promising alternative to gaseous and liquid hydrogen storage but are yet underdeveloped. Its proponents however, succeed in convincing their sponsors of the future potential of metal hydrides. In this paper we show how expectations of this technological option are raised and maintained by its developers and how this has kept them on hydrogen technology agendas for over 40 years...|$|R

40|$|Since the Patent Act was revised in 1952, {{patent law}} has {{expanded}} to cover an array of novel endeavors [...] new fields of technology (notably computer science and business methods) {{as well as the}} activities of researchers engaged in fundamental scientific discovery. These changes have been accompanied by shifts in the organizational structure of the <b>technological</b> <b>community,</b> with smaller firms and universities emerging as important players in the patent system, and by new marketplace expectations arising from consumer demand for interoperable technology and converging functionality. As a result of these developments, structural flaws in the legal order have become evident.

40|$|Summary. Economic {{development}} requires {{knowledge in}} today’s knowledge-based economy. The achievement {{of economic development}} in one area depends directly on {{the efficiency of the}} attainment, accumulation and application of knowledge and information. These processes rely heavily on the involvement of human resources with technological knowledge and technical skills. Correspondingly, knowledge creation ability and the efficiency of knowledge creation and application determine industrial clustering and economic sustainability. Current surveys of industrial clusters in Taiwan have ascertained that clusters of traditional industries do not necessarily lead to innovation although, empirically, an industrial cluster is a prerequisite for innovative activity. Recent studies have addressed the effects of the spatial proximity among firms and advanced research institutes in the Hsinchu area. According to their results, industrial clustering positively influences innovation by technological companies. Based on available results, this study considers how interaction between <b>technological</b> <b>communities</b> and industrial clustering influence the innovative activities in a sample area. Additionally, this study analyses social networking within the <b>technological</b> <b>community</b> and the relationship to industrial clustering in the Hsinchu area. Results of this study provide a valuable reference for industrial district planning and management. 1...|$|R

Many {{of the changes in}} British society demonstrated in the archaeological record are now suggested to be the effects of the native inhabitants adopting foreign customs rather than being subsumed by an invading population.|$|R
40|$|This paper adapts {{and extends}} the <b>technological</b> <b>community</b> {{perspective}} (e. g., Van de Ven, 1993), {{to review and}} analyze the outcomes {{of a series of}} three research projects funded by the Australian Government as reported in a number of publicly available documents. The projects were designed to support education for sustainability within Australian business schools and to promote knowledge sharing between the business schools and industry around sustainability. Project participants included seven business schools and their industry collaborators. The <b>technological</b> <b>community</b> perspective, which is particularly well-suited to examining this innovative education for sustainability project, is a theoretical framework that examines evolution of innovation at the community level; this includes multiple internal and external stakeholders, and is beyond the more traditional uni-dimensional focus on organization or industry levels. This approach provides lessons with respect to complex and dynamic interactions between and among multiple stakeholders responsible for successful development and dissemination of sustainability in business schools, corporations, and beyond. Hence, this paper addresses issues raised in the call for papers for the special issue of Journal of Management and Organization, ‘Educating for Sustainability and CSR: What is the role of business schools?’ The paper addresses the questions: (1) What are the barriers for business schools with respect to integrating sustainability in the curricula; (2) What role do partnerships with other stakeholders play in such initiatives? 14 page(s...|$|R
