5|$|Callisto's surface can {{be divided}} into several geologically {{different}} parts: cratered plains, light plains, bright and dark smooth plains, and various units associated with particular multi-ring structures and impact craters. The cratered plains constitute most of the surface area and represent the ancient lithosphere, a mixture of ice and rocky material. The light plains include bright impact craters like Burr and Lofn, as well as the effaced remnants of old large craters called palimpsests, the central parts of multi-ring structures, and isolated patches in the cratered plains. These light plains are thought to be icy impact deposits. The bright, smooth plains constitute a small fraction of Callisto's surface and are found in the ridge and trough zones of the Valhalla and Asgard formations and as isolated spots in the cratered plains. They were thought to be connected with endogenic activity, but the high-resolution Galileo images showed that the bright, smooth plains correlate with heavily fractured and <b>knobby</b> terrain and do not show any signs of resurfacing. The Galileo images also revealed small, dark, smooth areas with overall coverage less than 10,000km2, which appear to embay the surrounding terrain. They are possible cryovolcanic deposits. Both the light and the various smooth plains are somewhat younger and less cratered than the background cratered plains.|$|E

5000|$|Enduro - Similar to 1970, the Enduro was {{an exact}} {{copy of the}} Roadster 2 without the headlights. One {{difference}} brought about in 1971 was the addition of Rupp [...] "Motocross" [...] tires to the Enduro. The motocross was a <b>knobbier</b> tire that enabled more traction in off-road conditions. The Enduro was offered in the same colors as the Roadster 2 {{with the exception of}} metallic purple.|$|R
25|$|The inner zone (diameter {{of about}} 360km) {{is an example}} of a palimpsest: a high albedo {{circular}} feature of impact origin. The surface in the central zone is relatively smooth and has a mottled appearance. Many impact craters inside it have dark halos. At the high resolution achieved in some Galileo images the central part of Valhalla looks like a <b>knobby</b> terrain, where bright knobs are surrounded by dark smooth plains; there is noticeable deficit of small impact craters.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{portion of}} Whitchurch–Stouffville {{lies on the}} Oak Ridges Moraine. The moraine consists of <b>knobby</b> hills between 290 and 373 meters above sea level of irregularly bedded layers of unconsolidated sand and gravel (built-up glacial debris) deposited by the meltwater of the Wisconsin glacier some twenty-five thousand to ten thousand years ago. In a few cases the retreating glacier left behind and buried huge blocks of ice which, when melted, created deep, water-filled depressions known as kettle lakes. Preston Lake, Van Nostrand Lake and Musselman Lake are three such examples.|$|E
25|$|Adults are {{typically}} 13-25 centimeters in length, and can weigh up to 480 grams. The body color {{can be a}} dull yellow, gray, brown, or rust in color with light blotches, and {{very similar to that}} of the surrounding sandy or coral seabed in which they are found. This coloration acts as a camouflage which renders them extremely difficult to detect in their natural habitat. The skin is without scales except along the lateral line, and is covered with venomous spines and wartlike glands which give it a <b>knobby</b> appearance. The head is flattened, depressed and concave. The eyes, mouth and nostrils project upwards and outwards from the dorsal aspect of the head. Sexual dimorphism is not believed to occur in this genus.|$|E
2500|$|In {{very simple}} cases, {{knitting}} {{can be done}} without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles, knitting machines or rigid frames. [...] Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called stocking frames, knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting <b>knobbies,</b> knitting nancies, or corkers). [...] There is also a technique called knooking of knitting with a crochet hook that has a cord attached to the end, to hold the stitches while they're being worked.

50|$|Formed by the {{confluence}} of the Collaroy Creek and Whelan Creek, east of the settlement of Lotus Creek, the headwaters of the river rise below the Chinaman Ridges in the Great Dividing Range. The river flows generally west past Mount Bridget where the river veers south and crosses the Marlborough-Sarina Road and then forms a series of braided channels and continues generally south by southwest. Crossing Bar Plains the river forms even more channels then discharges into the Isaac River at several locations north of the Junee National Park. From source to mouth, the river passes through a series of lagoons and waterholes including the Boat Hole, Main Camp Lagoon, Lotus Creek, Lake Plattaway and <b>Knobbys</b> Waterhole. The river descends 59 m over its 301 km course.|$|R

500|$|Front {{brakes on}} many {{inexpensive}} bikes are {{not strong enough}} so, on the road, they are the limiting factor. Cheap cantilever brakes, especially with [...] "power modulators", and Raleigh-style side-pull brakes severely restrict the stopping force. In wet conditions they are even less effective. Front wheel slides are more common off-road. Mud, water, and loose stones reduce the friction between the tire and trail, although <b>knobby</b> tires can mitigate this effect by grabbing the surface irregularities. Front wheel slides are also common on corners, whether on road or off. Centripetal acceleration adds to the forces on the tire-ground contact, and when the friction force is exceeded the wheel slides.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} {{knitting}} has three basic tasks: (1) the active (unsecured) stitches {{must be held}} so they don't drop; (2) these stitches must be released sometime after they are secured; and (3) new bights of yarn must be passed through the fabric, usually through active stitches, thus securing them. In very simple cases, knitting can be done without tools, using only the fingers to do these tasks; however, hand-knitting is usually carried out using tools such as knitting needles or rigid frames. Depending on their size and shape, the rigid frames are called knitting boards, knitting rings (also called knitting looms) or knitting spools (also known as knitting <b>knobbies,</b> knitting nancies, or corkers).

Lincoln University {{has been involved with}} this leaders programme since 1979 when it was launched with a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, USA. Between 1973 and 1975 four local pastoral leases applied for and were granted reclassification of their lease to crown renewable lease tenure, which allows the leasee the right to purchase the fee simple (the freehold title). This was followed by a dramatic reversal. The land settlement board, between 1975 and 1977, declined three official applications. Numerous verbal applications and enquiries were made to field officers, but all were discouraged. These pastoral leasees were advised to forget freeholding, you'll never be allowed to, and were advised to get on with farming. On 1 st August 1980 the incredible/the unbelieveable occured, all but three pastoral leasees between Beaumont in the south and the <b>Knobbies</b> in the north were mandatorily reclassified...|$|R
500|$|In 1960, McCormack {{noticed that}} one Honda dealer in Boise, Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the {{combined}} total of all six dealers in Los Angeles. He {{found out that}} the Idaho dealer, Herb Uhl, was selling the CA100s as a trail bike by adding <b>knobby</b> tires for off-road traction and a [...] "cheater sprocket," [...] that is, increasing the final drive ratio by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth, which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel, trading off lower top speed as a result. Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the automatic clutch allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off-road riding, in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle. McCormack shipped a version of Uhl's customized CA100 to Japan and requested Honda put it into production, and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers. Cycle World praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the new bike, and it was a US sales success.|$|E

2500|$|The {{species of}} Sarcocornia are {{perennial}} herbs, subshrubs or shrubs. They are taking an erect or prostrate, creeping form. The new stems are fleshy and divided into joint-like segments. Older stems are woody and not segmented. The oppositely arranged leaves are borne on fleshy, <b>knobby</b> petioles, their base decurrent and connate (thus forming the segments), the blades forming small, triangular tips with narrow scarious margin.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are various}} types of {{off-road}} motorcycles, also known as dirt bikes, specially designed for off-road events. The term off-road refers to driving surfaces that are not conventionally paved. These are rough surfaces, often created naturally, such as sand, gravel, a river, mud or snow. These types of terrain can sometimes only be travelled on with vehicles designed for off-road driving (such as SUVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and mountain bikes) or vehicles that have off-road equipment. Compared to road-going motorcycles, off-road machines are simpler and lighter, having long suspension travel, high ground clearance, and rugged construction with little bodywork and no fairings for less damage in spills. [...] Wheels (usually 21" [...] front, 18" [...] rear) have <b>knobby</b> tires, often clamped to the rim with a rim lock.|$|E

The Owl Rock is made of purple and orange mudstones, fine-grained sandstones and siltstones with interbedded 1 to 10foot (30 to 300cm) thick green to mottled pink micritic and <b>knobby</b> limestone. [...] Fossilized desiccation mudcracks that are up to 4inches (10cm) wide and 3feet (1m) deep are found {{at the very top of}} the Owl Rock (they were later filled with sand from the overlying Wingate Sandstone). Also found in the Owl Rock are trace fossils of cylindrical burrows and fossils of ostracodes. The Owl Rock erodes into littered slopes and is found directly below the Wingate Sandstone along the Waterpocket Fold's west face.|$|E
2500|$|Ginkgo {{branches}} grow {{in length}} by growth of shoots with regularly spaced leaves, as seen on most trees. From the axils of these leaves, [...] "spur shoots" [...] (also known as short shoots) develop on second-year growth. Short shoots have very short internodes (so they may grow {{only one or}} two centimeters in several years) and their leaves are usually unlobed. They are short and <b>knobby,</b> and are arranged regularly on the branches except on first-year growth. Because of the short internodes, leaves appear to be clustered at the tips of short shoots, and reproductive structures are formed only on them (see pictures below - seeds and leaves are visible on short shoots). In ginkgos, as in other plants that possess them, short shoots allow the formation of new leaves in the older parts of the crown. After a number of years, a short shoot may change into a long (ordinary) shoot, or vice versa.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{divisions}} of rock {{units in the}} quadrangle are (1) plains materials and (2) crater and basin materials. Surfaces of the plains units range in morphology from relatively level but rough to nearly flat and smooth; the latter terrain has intermediate albedo {{like that of the}} Cayley Formation or older maria on the Moon. Plains materials are identified in part by surface texture and their relative ages determined by density of superposed craters. Intercrater plains material, one of the two oldest plains units, was originally described by Trask and Guest. It covers large areas in the western, central, and southeastern parts of the quadrangle. There, as in other regions of Mercury, its surface reveals the outlines of many buried crater rim crests and <b>knobby</b> remnants of an older resurfaced terra. This unit has been scoured by many secondary craters that have formed overlapping chains and troughs that contribute to its hummocky texture. The intercrater plains unit is inferred to consist of crater and basin ejecta deposits, volcanic flows, and possible pyroclastic deposits that have partly resurfaced and smoothed older, highly cratered, crustal rocks. The unit appears to be gradational laterally eastward with plains and terra material, undivided, and vertically with intermediate plains material. The intercrater plains material is probably {{about the same age as}} the ejecta blanket around Beethoven basin: both units have a high crater density. That the plains unit is younger than Beethoven may be indicated in some areas where the basin’s ejecta blanket appears to be partly obscured by the overlap or embayment of plains material. Spudis and Prosser (1984) have suggested that Beethoven may possibly be late c3 in age or as old as early c2.|$|E
