5|$|Raphel {{entered her}} State Department {{assignment}} {{at a time}} when U.S.-Pakistan relations were strained. Sanctions imposed by George H. W. Bush over concerns about Pakistan's burgeoning nuclear program under the Pressler Amendment banned all military ties, supply of military hardware and jet fighters, and cut off political relations with Islamabad. Bhutto sought rapprochement with the Clinton White House, and Raphel became a key player in orchestrating the renewal of ties, visiting the United States in April 1995. Raphel, working with Pakistan's envoy to Washington at the time, Dr. Maleeha Lodhi, helped craft administration policy changes and build Congressional support that would ultimately become law through repeal of the Pressler Amendment. The Brown Amendment was put into effect in November 1995. It restored U.S.-Pakistan relations and allowed Raphel to proceed apace in executing U.S. energy objectives in the region, now with new-found support from the Pakistani military for restoring military-to-military ties and its civilian government for insuring return of <b>funds</b> <b>paid</b> by Pakistan to the United States for undelivered F-16 fighter jets.|$|E

It held that the Kern-Clifton Roll was valid for only that distribution, and was superseded by the Dawes Rolls in terms of establishing the Cherokee tribal list of membership. With passage of the Indian Claims Commission Act of 1946, Congress established a commission to hear cases of Indian claims. Numerous descendants of the 1,659 Freedmen who had been recorded on the Kern-Clifton Roll {{but not on the}} Dawes roll, organized to try to correct the exclusion of their ancestors from Cherokee tribal rolls. They also sought payments from which they had been excluded.|$|E
500|$|Murphy {{spoke of}} uniting Scottish Labour – and Scotland – after the referendum, and said that, if chosen {{to lead the}} party, he would stand for {{election}} to the Scottish Parliament at the 2016 election, [...] "if not before". He claimed that a [...] "lack of vision" [...] and a failure to listen to Scottish voters had led to voters' deserting Labour. He suggested that it was [...] "compulsory" [...] that an MSP should be his deputy, and expressed support for greater devolution for Scotland. Murphy said that Scottish Labour should take greater responsibility {{in areas such as}} policy making, fundraising, and campaigning, and that <b>funds</b> <b>paid</b> to UK Labour by Scottish Labour councillors should be used exclusively for Scotland. Murphy also wanted to spend £5,000 on campaigns in every Labour-held Scottish constituency at Holyrood and Westminster, as well as seats the party planned to target at future elections, and pledged a [...] "radical change" [...] in Labour's campaign strategy.|$|E

2500|$|Conflict {{between the}} {{municipal}} government followed. In September 1752, the confreres derided the council while demanding that they show them their books. This was done because there existed an accord {{to split the}} <b>funds</b> <b>paid</b> by vendors who used the churchyard, and there existed some skepticism {{on the part of}} the brotherhood as to their rights and remuneration. [...] The brothers counselled reform of the accord between the partners, but petitioned the king to [...] "give each man his right". The following year the vendors, who occupied the spaces of the brotherhood, used the church tower to tie down their tents and used the church pews for their own use, which created tensions. These vendors eventually armed their tents some distance from the church, and solicited the brotherhood for space in front of the Misericórdia Velha in order to establish their tents. The confreres consented to the rental, but determined that no part of the churchyard would be occupied again.|$|E
2500|$|In 1693 the College of William and Mary officially opened. [...] One of {{the initial}} goals of the college was to educate Virginia Indian boys. [...] Funding from a farm named [...] "Brafferton," [...] in England, {{were sent to the}} school in 1691 for this purpose. [...] The <b>funds</b> <b>paid</b> for living expenses, {{classroom}} space, and a teacher's pay. [...] Only children of treaty tribes could attend, but at first none of them sent their children to the colonial school. By 1711, Governor Spotswood offered to remit the tribes' yearly tribute payments if they would send their boys to the school. [...] The incentive worked and that year, the tribes sent twenty boys to the school. [...] As the years passed, the number of Brafferton students decreased. By late in the 18th century, the Brafferton Fund was diverted elsewhere. From that time, the College was restricted to ethnic Europeans (or whites) until 1964, when the federal government passed civil rights legislation ending segregation in public facilities.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{a central}} tenet {{of the flat}} tax is to {{minimize}} the compartmentalization of incomes into myriad [...] special or sheltered cases, a vexing problem is deciding when income occurs. This is demonstrated by the taxation of interest income and stock dividends. [...] The shareholders own the company and so the company's profits belong to them. [...] If a company is taxed on its profits, then the <b>funds</b> <b>paid</b> out as dividends have already been taxed. [...] It's a debatable question if they should subsequently be treated as income to the shareholders and thus subject to further tax. [...] A similar issue arises in deciding if interest paid on loans should be deductible from the taxable income since that interest is in-turn taxed as income to the loan provider. There is no universally agreed answer to what is fair. For example, in the United States, dividends are not deductible but mortgage interest is deductible. Thus a Flat Tax proposal is not fully defined until it differentiates new untaxed income from a pass-through of already taxed income.|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Vickery, who {{has written}} {{positively}} about the People's Republic of Kampuchea, public observance of Buddhism and of Islam was reestablished, and government policies allowed Cambodians freedom to believe or not to believe in Buddhism. Vickery cites some differences in this reestablished Buddhism: Religious affairs were overseen by the PRK's Kampuchean (or Khmer) United Front for National Construction and Defense (KUFNCD), the mass organization that supported the state by organizing women, youths, workers, and religious groups. In 1987 {{there was only a}} single Buddhist order because the Thommayut order had not been revived. The organization of the clergy also had been simplified. The sangharaja (primate of the Buddhist clergy) had been replaced by a prathean (chairman). Communities that wanted wats had to apply to a local front committee for permission. The wat were administered by a committee of the local laity. Private <b>funds</b> <b>paid</b> for the restoration of the wats damaged during the war and the Khmer Rouge era, and they supported the restored wats. Monks were ordained by a hierarchy that has been reconstituted since an initial ordination in September 1979 by a delegation from the Buddhist community in Vietnam. The validity of this ordination continued to be questioned. In general, there are only two to four monks per wat, which is fewer than before 1975. In 1981 about 4,930 monks served in 740 wats in Cambodia. The Buddhist General Assembly reported 7,000 monks in 1,821 active wats a year later. In 1969 by contrast, observers estimated that 53,400 monks and 40,000 novice monks served in more than 3,000 wats. Vickery sums up his observations on the subject by noting that, [...] "The government has kept its promise to allow freedom for traditional Buddhism, but does not actively encourage it." ...|$|E
