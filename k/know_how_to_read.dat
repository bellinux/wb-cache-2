25|$|Prevention {{includes}} wearing {{sunglasses and}} not smoking. Early on the symptoms may be improved with glasses. If {{this does not}} help, surgery to remove the cloudy lens {{and replace it with}} an artificial lens is the only effective treatment. Surgery is needed only if the cataracts are causing problems and generally results in an improved quality of life. Cataract surgery is not readily available in many countries, which is especially true for women, those living in rural areas, {{and those who do not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} {{group is}} the “afromexicanos” or Afro-Mexicans who are concentrated in the Costa Chica region. This group is found in Guerrero and the Costa Chica area of Oaxaca. This group has been relatively isolated {{from the rest of}} Mexico, with little modernization or formal education. To this day, there are many who have no birth certificates or <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> or write. Much of the history of these people is preserved in oral tradition. Historically, afromexicanos have been discriminated against and marginalized. Even among these people today, the concept of being “negro” is considered bad and a number take to skin-lightening methods. The musical style associated with the group is “chilena ” which became popular outside of Guerrero and Oaxaca after the 1960s. One of these songs, “Soy negro de la Costa…,” has been preserved by CONACULTA and INAH as part of Mexico’s cultural heritage. A major change for this community came with the building of the highway connecting Acapulco with Pinotepa Nacional and Puerto Escondido, which opened it up to the outside world. This allowed the shipping of goods and influx of people. The increase in people and contacts led to the building of schools.|$|E

25|$|Critics, {{such as the}} American Council of the Blind, {{note that}} U.S. bills are {{relatively}} hard to tell apart: they use very similar designs, they are printed in the same colors (until the 2003 banknotes, in which a faint secondary color was added), {{and they are all}} the same size. The American Council of the Blind has argued that American paper currency design should use increasing sizes according to value and/or raised or indented features to make the currency more usable by the vision-impaired, since the denominations cannot currently be distinguished from one another non-visually. Use of Braille codes on currency is not considered a desirable solution because (1) these markings would only be useful to people who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> Braille, and (2) one Braille symbol can become confused with another if even one bump is rubbed off. Though some blind individuals say that they have no problems keeping track of their currency because they fold their bills in different ways or keep them in different places in their wallets, they nevertheless must rely on sighted people or currency-reading machines to determine the value of each bill before filing it away using the system of their choice. This means that no matter how organized they are, blind people still have to trust sighted people or machines each time they receive US banknotes.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not need to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E

Van Peebles stated that [...] "Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa. Effects and music [...] are strictly secondary considerations.

There's no sense of the elbow-in-rib, tongue-in-cheek aesthetic that so permeates the rest of American culture–including kids' shows like the Rugrats. I think what's subversive about it is it's so incredibly naive–deliberately. Because there's nothing in it that's trying to be hip or cool or anything else, hipness can be grafted onto it". In another interview with LA Times, he commentated on the show's adult audience: [...] " [...] It's a kind of time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in their footie [...] On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is very edgy to adults who <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and listen between the frames."

2500|$|The Latin {{letters were}} {{introduced}} officially during the 13th century, but farmers, artisans and traders continued to write with runes to communicate or to mark goods. [...] It appears {{that in many}} parts of Sweden, people considered Latin letters to be a foreign practice throughout the Middle Ages. Still in the 16th century, the runes were engraved on official memorials or as secret writing in diaries. In the mid-16th century, the parson of the parish of Runsten on Öland wrote a sign on the chancel-wall of the church that said [...] "The pastor of the parish should <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> runes and write them". It is likely that the text represented the general opinion of the parishioners. Since the runes were still actively known and used in the 16th century, when the first runologists began to do scholarly work on the runes, the runic tradition never died out. Many manuscripts written in Iceland through the 16th to 19th centuries featured Medieval runes, Rune Poems and secret rune sets.|$|E

2500|$|Multimodality in the 21st {{century has}} caused {{educational}} institutions to consider changing {{the forms of}} even its traditional aspects of classroom education. According to Hassett and Curwood, authors of Theories and Practices of Multimodal Education, “Print represents only one mode of communication…” and with a rise in digital and Internet literacy, other modes are needed, from visual texts to digital e-books. Other changes occur by integrating music and video with lesson plans during early childhood education; however, such measures are seen as augmenting and increasing literacy for educational communities by introducing new forms, rather than replacing literacy values. In several children’s books released today, written language is no longer the most important factor while producing these books. According to Miller and McVee, authors of Multimodal Composing in Classrooms, “These new literacies do not set aside traditional literacies. Students still need to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and write, but new literacies are integrated." [...] The main purpose of early childhood education is still evident but the form that is now being presented to children is different. Some learning outcomes include – {{but are not limited to}} – reading, writing, and language skills. For example, “Multimodal Composing In Classrooms,” written by Miller and McVee, advocates storyboarding as an assignment and says that it “is multimodal in that there is the visual and audio of a film clip, the drawing representation of the film’s images, as well as the written analysis of the scene." [...] According to Roger Essley in his article, [...] "Visual Tools for Differentiating Reading & Writing Instruction," [...] storyboarding is “the origin of all written language. Teachers are able to use storyboards for visual organization to strengthen writing skills and help the writing process. They can be used in brainstorming sessions, problem solving, planning, and much more.|$|E
