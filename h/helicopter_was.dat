5|$|By {{the time}} of the Korean War, {{helicopters}} had replaced floatplanes and the Sikorsky HO3S-1 <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> employed. New Jersey made use of the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH drone for her Vietnam war deployment in 1968–1969.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 2017, an Apache <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> {{reportedly}} {{involved in}} the attack on a Somali refugee boat in which 42 refugees were killed. Saudi Arabia denied involvement though {{it is the only}} military in the Yemeni Civil War.|$|E
50|$|A {{military}} <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> a <b>helicopter</b> that <b>is</b> either specifically built or converted for use {{by military}} forces. A military <b>helicopter's</b> mission <b>is</b> a function of its design or conversion. The most common use of military <b>helicopters</b> <b>is</b> transport of troops, but transport <b>helicopters</b> can <b>be</b> modified or converted to perform other missions such as combat search and rescue (CSAR), medical evacuation (MEDEVAC), airborne command post, or even armed with weapons for attacking ground targets. Specialized military <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> intended to conduct specific missions. Examples of specialized military <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> attack <b>helicopters,</b> observation helicopters and anti-submarine warfare helicopters.|$|R
2500|$|On 25 September 2008 Pakistani troops {{fired on}} two American OH-58 Kiowa {{reconnaissance}} helicopters; U.S. ground troops, who the <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> supporting, returned fire. No one was injured {{on either side}} and the <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> undamaged. American and NATO officials asserted that the <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> flying within Afghan territory to protect an armed patrol. Pakistani officials declared that the <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> inside Pakistani territory and were fired upon by [...] "flares" [...] as a warning.|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} of <b>helicopters</b> has to <b>be</b> more precise than for fixed-wing model aircraft, because <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> susceptible {{to even the}} smallest of vibrations, which can cause problems when the <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> in flight.|$|R
5|$|On 7 June 2008, a Eurocopter AS350 {{crashed on}} the runway at Nuuk Airport. There were no injuries, but the <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|At around 09:30, {{the four}} CH-46 {{helicopters}} arrived in Ngok Tavak, {{and they were}} able to unload Makowski and about 45 soldiers of the 12th MSF Company. However, the VC demonstrated their domination of the landing zone when the first <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> hit with anti-aircraft fire, and was forced to land on the ground, intact, though with damages to the fuel line. Moments later, the third <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> struck by a rocket propelled grenade as it turned around to rescue the crews of the first downed helicopter, and it was destroyed immediately. Now, with two downed helicopters blocking the landing zone, the remaining helicopters were prevented from landing on the ground, so the wounded men had to be evacuated while the helicopters were still hovering. As the last helicopter took off, two Nungs and one stranded U.S. soldier grabbed the helicopter skids to get out of Ngok Tavak, but they all fell to their deaths. Shortly after his arrival, Makowski placed the 12th MSF Company under the command of his Australian counterpart, as the situation continued to worsen.|$|E
5|$|XZ574 – Sea King HAS.5 on {{static display}} at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovilton, Somerset. The {{aircraft}} was delivered to the Royal Navy in 1976 and was operated from HMS Invincible during Operation Corporate. During the rescue of the crew from ditched Sea King HC.4 ZA311 on 23 April 1982, the <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> flown by HRH Prince Andrew.|$|E
50|$|<b>Helicopters</b> <b>are</b> {{extensively}} {{used for}} traffic control surveillance, pursuit of suspects, rescue and disaster relief. Total of 80 {{small and medium-sized}} <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> being operated in 47 prefecturesnationwide.|$|R
50|$|Until November 2000, Canadian <b>Helicopters</b> <b>was</b> the {{domestic}} operating arm of Canadian Helicopters International, a wholly owned subsidiary of CHC Helicopter Corporation.

5000|$|A captive <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> a <b>helicopter</b> which <b>is</b> {{tethered}} {{to the ground with}} a rope, as with a captive balloon. Captive <b>helicopters</b> can <b>be</b> used for the same purposes as captive balloons.|$|R
5|$|Bjarne Sortland was {{appointed}} managing director. The first <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> delivered in May, {{with a new}} helicopter being delivered each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Havørn and Havsvale. Owner Bjørn G. Braathen stated that his goal was that the airline would reach a 50% market share. In 1990, another challenger, Mørefly, had also established themselves in the market. For the start of operations, Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Norwegian Polar Institute took an {{initiative}} to establish DROMLAN {{in cooperation with}} eleven other countries who operate research facilities in Queen Maud Land. On 5 January 2001, a test flight with representatives from eight countries was made to Henriksenskjera. From there, a DHC-6/300 Twin Otter, Basler BT-67 and a <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> used to distribute the crew and supplies to the various bases. In addition to evaluating the airfield at Novolazarevskaya, an evaluation was performed at Troll in January 2002. The hub model was used {{during the summer of}} 2001 and 2002, operated by the South African company Antarctic Logistics Centre International.|$|E
5|$|Killed in the {{airplane}} were the pilot Steven Altman, his brother Daniel, and his nephew Douglas. The helicopter tourists were in two groups; {{the first was}} Michele Norelli and his son, Filippo Norelli. The other group was Fabio Gallazzi, his wife, Tiziana Pedroni, and his son, Giacomo Gallazzi. The pilot of the <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> New Zealander Jeremy Clarke, who had logged 2,700 hours as a helicopter pilot. All recovered victims died from blunt trauma to the head, torso and extremities, according to the NYC medical examiner's office.|$|E
50|$|Each ship {{can support}} two helicopters, the Sea King or the HAL Dhruv. The Sea King <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> {{equipped}} with a Super Searcher radar and primarily used in air surveillance and anti-submarine roles. The <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> capable of flying four and half hours non-stop. The HAL Dhruv <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> primarily for utility roles. INS Delhi has a crew of approximately 30 officers and 350 sailors.|$|R
50|$|Military {{transport}} <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> used {{in places}} where the use of conventional aircraft is impossible. For example, the military transport <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> the primary transport asset of US Marines deploying from LHDs and LHA. The landing possibilities of <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> almost unlimited, and where landing is impossible, for example densely packed jungle, {{the ability of the}} helicopter to hover allows troops to deploy by abseiling and roping.|$|R
50|$|Sixteen Westland Sea King SAR <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> in {{operation}} with the Royal Navy {{at the time}} of the 1982 Falklands War. SAR <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> assigned search and rescue patrols, and Sea King as well as Westland Wessex aircraft plucked several airmen from the icy waters. <b>Helicopters</b> <b>were</b> also used to transport troops and to rescue Special Air Service (SAS) troops trapped on a glacier in heavy wind and snow conditions.|$|R
5|$|The {{requirement}} {{for a new}} attack <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the Eurocopter Tiger, a modernised Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, the AH-64 Apache, the Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, and the Agusta A129 Mangusta. Both the Tiger and Cobra variant were derided for requiring development, and thus risk, while the Apache was combat proven, however its performance in the First Gulf War was criticised by competitors. Westland and the Apache was selected in July 1995, a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|A {{dedicated}} {{search and}} rescue (SAR) version, the HAR3, was developed for the RAF Search and Rescue Force. The type entered service in 1978 to replace the Westland Whirlwind HAR.10. A 16th <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> ordered shortly after, and following the Falklands War of 1982, three more examples were purchased to enable operation of a SAR flight in the islands, initially from Navy Point {{on the north side}} of Stanley harbour, and later from RAF Mount Pleasant. In 1992, six further helicopters were ordered to replace the last remaining Westland Wessex helicopters in the SAR role, entering service in 1996. The six Sea King HAR3As featured updated systems, including a digital navigation system and more modern avionics.|$|E
5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant <b>helicopter,</b> <b>was</b> started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational testing purposes. As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was to have all of the planned capabilities included.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} operates twelve Westland Sea King <b>helicopters.</b> Two <b>are</b> {{located on}} each base {{at any given}} time, except for Florø which only has one helicopter. Up to two <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> on long-term maintenance at any time. At all bases {{at least one of}} the <b>helicopters</b> <b>is</b> on stand-by at any time.|$|R
50|$|Attack <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> <b>helicopters</b> {{used in the}} {{anti-tank}} {{and close}} air support roles. The first of the modern attack <b>helicopters</b> <b>was</b> the Vietnam era AH-1 Cobra, which pioneered the now classic format of pilot and weapons officer seated in tandem in a narrow fuselage, chin mounted guns, and rockets and missiles mounted on stub wings. To enable them to find and identify their targets, some modern attack <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> equipped with very capable sensors such as a millimeter wave radar system.|$|R
50|$|<b>Helicopters</b> <b>were</b> used {{in combating}} {{wildfires}} in California {{as early as}} 1947 and their usefulness at moving personnel rapidly around a fire was quickly recognized. Initially, <b>helicopters</b> <b>were</b> just used for tactical and logistical support for ground crews.|$|R
5|$|During this period, the United States Army {{had been}} {{introducing}} the UH-1 Iroquois into service. First used in its intended {{role as a}} transport, it was soon modified {{in the field to}} carry more machine guns in {{what became known as the}} helicopter gunship role. This proved effective against the lightly armed enemy, and new gun and rocket pods were added. Soon the AH-1 Cobra was introduced. This was an attack helicopter armed with long-range BGM-71 TOW missiles able to destroy tanks from outside the range of defensive fire. The <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> effective, and prompted the U.S. military to change its defensive strategy in Europe by blunting any Warsaw Pact advance with anti-tank helicopters instead of the tactical nuclear weapons that had been the basis for NATO's battle plans since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006, whilst {{serving in}} the Afghanistan conflict, Flight Lieutenant Craig Wilson, Captain of ZA718/BN from 1310 Flt in Helmand Province, {{received}} the third Distinguished Flying Cross for 'exceptional courage and outstanding airmanship' while operating in Helmand Province. During the night of 11 June 2006, Flt Lt Craig Wilson was tasked with picking up a casualty. The mission was successful despite the difficult and dangerous conditions that led Wilson to fly the aircraft at the low altitude of 150ft. A few hours after this incident, the <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> called out again on operations, with Wilson landing the helicopter despite being low on fuel. After being on duty for over 22 hours, Wilson volunteered to take reinforcements to the front line, returning with two wounded soldiers. For his actions over the 24‑hour period Flt Lt Wilson was awarded the DFC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the night}} of 27/28 April, a group of Croatian Ministry of the Interior {{officers}} managed to reach Kijevo, and a Croatian police station was formally established in the village on 28 April. The following day, JNA troops, commanded by the JNA 9th (Knin) Corps chief of staff Colonel Ratko Mladić, moved in, cutting all access and preventing delivery of supplies to Kijevo. On 2 May, a Croatian police helicopter made an emergency landing in Kijevo after sustaining damage caused by SAO Krajina troops gunfire. The <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> carrying then defence minister Luka Bebić and Croatian Parliament deputy speaker Vladimir Šeks. The aircraft {{was able to take}} off after repairs the same day. Another skirmish took place on 2 May on Mount Kozjak, where a member of the SAO Krajina paramilitary was killed while on guard duty.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{unmanned}} <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> {{widely used}} for its' unique strongpoint, however, the high failure rate of unmanned helicopter seriously limits its further application and development. For solving the above problems, in this paper, {{the reasons for}} the high failure rate of unmanned <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> analyzed and the corresponding solution schemes are proposed. The main problem of the failure cause of the unmanned <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> the aircraft engine fault, and the failure cause of the unmanned <b>helicopter</b> <b>is</b> analyzed particularly. In order to improving the safety performance of unmanned helicopter system, the scheme of adding the safety parachute system to the unmanned <b>helicopter</b> system <b>is</b> proposed and introduced. These schemes provide the safety redundancy of the unmanned helicopter system and lay on basis for the unmanned helicopter applying into residential areas...|$|R

5|$|The <b>helicopters</b> <b>are</b> to be {{replaced}} by AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin under the Norwegian All-Weather Search and Rescue Helicopter (NAWSARH) programme. The candidates for the NAWSARH contract of 10–12 <b>helicopters</b> <b>was</b> the AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin, NHIndustries NH-90, Eurocopter EC225 and Sikorsky S-92.|$|R
5|$|Jolly Green 67 flew east at first, {{further into}} {{territory}} {{held by the}} North Vietnamese, before it turned southeast for a few kilometers, when a fire {{broke out in the}} left engine. Pieces of the tail rotor struck the main rotor, and the aircraft rolled and crashed on its left side, burning ferociously. No rescue beepers were heard. The entire crew was listed as MIA and presumed killed: Capt. Peter Hayden Chapman II (pilot), Capt. John Henry Call III (co-pilot), TSgt. William Roy Pearson, TSgt. Allen J. Avery (para-rescuemen), TSgt. Roy D. Prater (Crew Chief), and Sgt. James Harold Alley (combat photographer). The fire consuming the <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> so hot it melted parts of the aircraft and continued to burn for three more days.|$|E
5|$|Lockheed {{designed}} the Cheyenne as a compound helicopter, which combines a helicopter with fixed-wing features for increased performance, usually speed. The design included {{features such as}} a rigid main rotor, low-mounted wings, and a pusher propeller. The Cheyenne was powered by a General Electric T64 turboshaft engine. Thrust was provided by a pusher propeller {{at the rear of}} the aircraft. At high speeds, the amount of lift provided by the wings, along with thrust from the pusher prop, reduced the aerodynamic loading of the rotor. At such speeds, the rotor produced 20% of the lift and could be adjusted by collective pitch control changes. Rotor tilt was controlled through gyroscopic precession. The Cheyenne achieved speeds over 200knots (230mph, 370km/h), but as a compound <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> unable to qualify for speed records in helicopter categories.|$|E
5|$|Operation Red Wings was a counter-insurgent {{mission in}} Kunar province, Afghanistan, {{involving}} {{four members of}} the United States Navy SEALs. Murphy and two other SEALs, Danny Dietz and Matthew Axelson, were killed in the fighting, in addition to 16 American Special Operations Forces soldiers, who were killed when their <b>helicopter</b> <b>was</b> shot down while attempting to extract the SEAL Team. Prior to a helicopter being shot down in 2011, it was both the largest loss of life for American forces since the invasion began and the largest loss for the SEALs since the Vietnam War. Marcus Luttrell was the only surviving American sailor from the squad; he was protected by local villagers, who sent an emissary to the closest military base, allowing a rescue team to locate him.|$|E
