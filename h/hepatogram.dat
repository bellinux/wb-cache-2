40|$|Hepatic outflow {{obstruction}} {{created by}} balloon occlusion of the hepatic vein induces characteristic angiographic {{findings in the}} occluded area: prolonged enhancement on <b>hepatogram</b> followed by reversed portal opacification on the hepatic arteriogram and perfusion defect on the arterial portogram. The following induced hepatic hemodynamic changes are suggested: hepatic arterial flow increases, and the portal vein acts as a draining vein with slow reversed flow. These unique hemodynamic changes enhance the effect of hepatic interventional therapies. In transcatheter arterial infusion, increasing hepatic arterial flow and absence of portal inflow can bring about {{a high concentration of}} drugs, the presence of which is greatly protracted due to outflow blockage. In transcatheter arterial chemoembolization, reversed portal flow can allow portal embolization in addition to arterial embolization. In microwave coagulation therapy and radiofrequency ablation therapy, decreasing portal flow can cause larger areas of coagulation. Further, the technique of hepatic venous occlusion has potential therapeutic applications. </p...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Dynamometry is a cheap, {{simple and}} easily {{reproduced}} method to assess muscle strength (MS), which, like other processes of obtaining measurements, displays high {{sensitivity and specificity}} for the early detection of {{any change in the}} nutritional status. Objectives: To evaluate factors concerning the reduction in MS in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD). Methods: A single center, crosssectional study was carried out. The following clinical variables were analyzed: sex, age, blood pressure, weight, significant weight loss within the last 36 months, body mass index (BMI), weight gain in between dialysis sessions, hemodialysis treatment time, diabetes, energy and protein intake. Other factors taken into account were: laboratory findings (hemoglobin, <b>hepatogram,</b> electrolyte panel, calcium test, phosphate test, lipid profile, protein analysis, transferrin saturation) and hand grip strength (before and after dialysis, on both arms) measured through dynamometry. The patients' muscle strength values were compared to those of healthy subjects. Values below the 10 th percentile were regarded as abnormal. Mean, median, standard deviation as well as the X 2 and the Student's t tests were considered where applicable. A p< 0. 05 constituted a significant value. Results: There were 73 patients included in this study and 47. 95 % of them showed low MS with significant strength loss on the arm having the vascular access when compared to the other arm (p  0. 00019). A longer hemodialysis treatment time (p 0. 026) and a lower BMI (p 0. 046) were found to be the two variables with the highest impact on MS. Conclusions: Muscle strength loss in patients undergoing hemodialysis is very common and is associated with a longer HD treatment time and a lower BMI...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect was}} studied of high energy {{irradiation}} on the liver scan in {{cases in which}} {{an important part of}} liver parenchyma had been included in the irradiated field. Eleven cases of malignant lymphoma were studied as well as 9 cases of cancer of the esophagus, stomach, right kidney and right suprarenal gland. Several <b>hepatograms</b> were made before and after irradiation. The results show that, after a dose of 3, 500 rads, there is a clear effect of irradiation on the scintigraphic picture, as visualized by the uptake of 198 Au particles. This modification of the scintigraphic picture depends on the following factors: interval between the scintigraphic examination {{and the end of the}} irradiation; dose of irradiation; administration of complementary chemotherapy; and liver changes before radiation therapy. To avoid pitfalls, these factors should be considered before evaluation of liver scans of irradiated patients. SCOPUS: NotDefined. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{describes}} {{a system for}} automatic off-line scene analysis of individual images and image sequences. The analysis {{is based on the}} use of a priori procedural knowledge of the task and declarative knowledge of the scene to be analyzed. The system analyzes a scene with a domain model, including (i) a scene model, (ii) programmable algorithms via a blackboard structure, and (iii) a supervisor. The generic task is to find and delineate objects in images, which involves model and data dependent segmentation, feature extraction, and object labeling. The image is represented with statistical feature vectors describing local and global image properties, organized in an octave-based resolution pyramid. The image is segmented into regions - blobs - which are labeled on the basis on their relative positions and a priori numerical constraints on the possible labels. Additional object-label constraints are set by the existence of ridges/valleys between pairs of objects. The supervisor specifies a default processing chain of discrete actions on the image, called processing states, divided into execution and evaluation states. In the evaluation states, the results of the analysis in the execution states are compared with the domain model, and if the results are consistent, the default processing chain is continued. Otherwise a control mechanism - an exception handler - is invoked which contains condition-action pairs that trigger auxiliary processing depending on a diagnosis of the error event and the previous processing history. For sequences of images, a natural continuity constraint is used to correct possible erroneously labeled or delineated images. The scene analysis has been compared with an inductive method for simultaneous labeling and segmentation with Kohonen's unsupervised classification algorithm. The two major applications have been automatic left ventricular delineation in four-chamber ultrasound images and in gamma camera images of the heart. Other biomedical applications include the extraction of renograms from kidneys, <b>hepatograms</b> from livers, and left ventricular detection in x-ray cardiac images...|$|R
