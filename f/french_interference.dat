In the 1958 election, despite <b>French</b> <b>interference,</b> Olympio's party (the Comité de l'unité togolaise) swept the elections defeating Grunitzky's party (the Togolese Progress Party) and the French named Olympio the Prime Minister of the colony.

Wavell preferred to let the propaganda continue and provided a small amount of supplies under strict control. When the policy had no effect, Wavell suggested negotiations with the Vichy governor Louis Nouailhetas, to use the port and railway. The suggestion was accepted by the British government but because of the concessions granted to the Vichy regime in Syria, proposals were made to invade the colony instead. In June, Nouailhetas was given an ultimatum, the blockade was tightened and the Italian garrison at Assab was defeated by an operation from Aden. For six months, Nouailhetas remained willing to grant concessions over the port and railway but would not tolerate Free <b>French</b> <b>interference.</b> In October the blockade was reviewed but {{the beginning of the war}} with Japan in December, led to all but two blockade ships being withdrawn.

40|$|The {{inclusion}} of French loanwords in the Indonesian language cannot {{be separated from}} the fact that there have been contacts between the two languages.

In light of this, this study aims to examine whether French loanwords in the Indonesian Language are in the state of interference or already have integration status.

40|$|The {{nature of}} the lexical {{selection}} process in bilingual spoken word production {{is one of the}} pending questions of research on bilingualism. According to one view this competitive process is language-specific, while another holds that it is language-nonspecific (i. e., lexical competition is cross-linguistic). In recent years, research on bilingual language production has seen the rise of a third view that postulates that lexical selection is in fact dynamic and may function as language-specific or nonspecific depending on a number of factors. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the lexical selection process among moderately proficient bilinguals whose two languages are typologically distant: Tunisian Arabic and <b>French.</b> The picture-word <b>interference</b> task was used in two experiments where moderately proficient Tunisian Arabic (L 1) -French (L 2) bilinguals were asked to name pictures in their L 2 while ignoring auditory distractors (semantic, phono-translation, phonological, or unrelated) in their L 2 (Experiment 1) or their L 1 (Experiment 2). Thus, the language context was entirely monolingual in Experiment 1 and bilingual in Experiment 2. In Experiment 1, only a phonological facilitation effect was observed. In Experiment 2, interference was found in the phono-translation, semantic, and phonological conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that cross-language competition occurs among moderately proficient Tunisian Arabic-French bilinguals only in a bilingual context (Experiment 2) as indexed by the phono-translation interference effect observed. Our findings are in line with the recent hypothesis that lexical selection is a dynamic process modulated by factors like language similarity, language proficiency, and the experimental language context...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of military integration {{has been a}} source of friction between France, Germany and the United States for many years after World War II. Key to this friction was the {{question of}} nuclear proliferation, most importantly, German nuclear proliferation. Both the US and France agreed that Germany should be kept from access to a nuclear arsenal, but they could not agree on how to organize this. This friction can be traced back to the different views France and the US had on European integration and rebuilding after World War II. France, especially Charles de Gaulle as from 1958, wanted Europe to become an independent entity in itself. Europe should be independent from the United States as a third superpower in world affairs. In order to be taken seriously in the international realm, Europe should have its own nuclear deterrent and France would provide this through de Gaulle’s force de frappe, the national nuclear force. The United States saw a bigger role set aside for themselves, as victors of World War II and role model, in the European integration process. They wanted the European countries to work together in order to provide a counterweight to the Soviet Union and a bastion against communism on the continent. This co-operation would be guided and coordinated by the United States in the so called Atlantic Alliance. This difference in interpretation of European rebuilding and integration would prove to be a thorny issue and the cause of many misunderstandings for the years to come. One of the key issues in the formation of the European defense was the creation of a multilateral force (MLF) as envisioned by the US. The problem revolved around ownership and development of nuclear weapons. The United States did not want other countries to develop nuclear weapons, because this would end the bipolar world order, endanger relations with the Soviet Union and eventually lead to an unstable world. France on the other hand was convinced, inherently connected to the French vision on Europe, that each country had the right to defend itself with the ultimate measures and should be able to develop nuclear weapons for that cause. De Gaulle wanted the help of the Americans in developing the nuclear arsenal, but was not willing to trim his principles to get the needed technology. The French nuclear arsenal and the decision to use it should be solely <b>French,</b> without <b>interference</b> from the United States. The nuclear issues that arose after Charles de Gaulle came to power in 1958 shaped the French and American relationship...|$|R

40|$|Peer reviewedThis article explores {{whether the}} Age of Enlightenment, in general, and the French Revolution of 1789, in particular, {{promoted}} or restricted religious freedom. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 defines religious freedom as the “inalienable right {{of individuals and}} groups to choose or change beliefs as their consciences dictate and be free from intimidation, restrictions and biases based on those beliefs”. In other words, people must {{have an opportunity to}} exercise their religious beliefs in an atmosphere that is free of intimidation and interference. During eighteenth century, the Age of the Enlightenment ushered in a profound scientific and cultural transformation. This transformation altered the conditions under which religion was practised. In theology, pietism served to promote new scientific discoveries and theories. In addition, a secular culture developed; nothing was regarded as sacrosanct and secularists sought to prevent believers from worshipping God according to the dictates of their own consciences. A consequence of the French Revolution was that some of the spirit of the Enlightenment became reality-interference in religious affairs. This article will argue that by joining the Third Estate to form the National Constituent Assembly, the clergy negated one of the fundamental pillars of religious freedom: {{the separation of church and}} state. The Constituent Assembly forbade the taking of religious vows, regular religious life was restricted to houses, the state was involved to interfere with the selection of priests, and believers were harassed and imprisoned. In the words of 1 Research Associate, Research Institute for Theology and Religion, University of South Africa, Pretoria, South Africa. 2 Comby (1989 : 111), the French Revolution signified a “war with Christianity”. In 1791, Pope Pius VI condemned the principles of the <b>French</b> Revolution and <b>interference</b> in ecclesiastical affairs by the state. It should be noted that the key role of the state is to respect and protect religious choice, not to mandate religious conformity...|$|R

The reply was prompt, though guarded.

A complete disillusionment, however, awaited the French Government. The taxes in Egypt, as in other countries, are not collected evenly over the whole year. During some months there is a large cash balance in the Exchequer. In others the money drains in slowly. It happened at this period of the year, after the cotton crop had been gathered, that a considerable balance had accumulated in the Treasury, and on the guarantee of the English Government being received, to the effect that they would ultimately assist Egypt with regard to the expenses of the expedition, Lord Cromer determined to repay the money at once.|$|E
