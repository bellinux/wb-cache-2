The interface of the feature is split into three sections; {{the upper part of}} the screen shows a view of the ocean in front of the ship and any hostile ship in the vicinity.

40|$|In {{the context}} of the {{cognitive}} study of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> for deductive reasoning, the availability of syntactic manipulation of diagrams has {{played a key role in}} accounting for their efficacy. Currently, however, little has been known about the interface between such syntactic or proof-theoretical aspects and the corresponding semantic or informational aspects of diagram use. The present paper investigates the cognitive processes of interpreting <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> underlying deductive reasoning, combining the insights from both logical and cognitive studies of diagrams. A semantical analysis of two different ways of formalizing logic diagrams is provided. Based on it, a multiple stage model of cognitive processes of extracting information from logic diagrams is proposed, and evidence was found to support this model. A consequence for the way the abstract syntax and semantic of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> are constrained is also explored...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{research}} on <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> highlights their {{importance for the}} teaching and learning of mathematics. However, the empirical evidence to support their use in the classroom is mixed and somewhat lacking. Purpose: The aim {{of this study was to}} develop the use of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> of mathematical concepts in primary classrooms, through introducing primary teachers to the research literature in this area, and researching the subsequent impact on children and teachers. A professional development programme was designed, involving three one-day training sessions for mathematics co-ordinators. They were asked to implement the ideas from the training back in their schools. Sample: Mathematics co-ordinators from eight primary schools attended the professional development programme. The study focussed on Year 3 pupils (aged seven–eight) and Year 5 pupils (aged nine– 10). Design and methods: In this paper, we report the qualitative findings from the larger project looking at the overall impact of the professional development programme. The paper focuses on semi-structured interviews carried out with the mathematics co-ordinators attending the professional development sessions, and the Year 3 and Year 5 class teachers who subsequently worked with the co-ordinators on their use of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> in their teaching of mathematics. Lesson observations involving the class teachers were also carried out in order to explore further the possible impact of the project on classroom practice. Results: The qualitative results identified the impact of the project on mathematics co-ordinators and class teachers’ knowledge and practice. However, the nature of this impact was complex, with a variety of facilitating and hindering factors identified for the transfer of the professional development ideas on the use of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations.</b> In addition, different levels of sophistication of class teachers’ use of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> were identified. Conclusions: Implications for the development of professional development programmes to facilitate the transfer of research into practice were identified. Recommendations for the use of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> are also put forward...|$|R

The coelom, or body cavity, of Amphioxus lies, of course, {{as in the}} vertebrata, {{between the}} {{intestinal}} wall and the body walls, and, {{just as in the}} vertebrata, it is largely reduced where gill slits occur. But matters are rather complicated by the presence of an atrial cavity round the pharynx, which is not certainly represented in the vertebrata, and which the student is at first apt to call the body cavity, although it is entirely distinct and different from that space. The mutual relation of the two will become apparent after a study of Figures 10, 11, 12 (Sheet 21). Figure 10 gives diagrammatically a section of a very young stage of Amphioxus; P is the pharynx portion of the alimentary canal, coe. is the coelom surrounding it at this stage here as elsewhere; mt.c. are certain lymph spaces, the metapleural canals, between which a small invagination (i.e., a pushing-in), at., of the outer epidermis occurs; n.c. is the notochord, and s.c. the spinal cord. The gill slits, by which P. communicates with the exterior, are not shown. Next Figure 11 shows the invagination (at.) pushing its way in, and cut off from the exterior by a meeting of the body wall below. Note that at. is a portion of the animal's exterior thus embraced by its body, and that its lining is therefore of the same material as the external integument. In Figure 12, at. is developing upward, so that the true body hangs into it. Now imagine the gill slits perforated, as shown by the double-headed arrow in Figure 12. Figure 3, on Sheet 20, is a less <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representation</b> of a cross-section of the pharyngeal region (vide Figure 1, Sheet 19). The student should compare Figure 3, Sheet 20, and Figure 12, Sheet 21. The atrium and metapleural canals are easily recognised in both. In Figure 3 the coelom is much cut up by the gill slits, and we have remaining of it (a) the dorsal coelomic canals (d.c.c.) and (b) the branchial canals (br.c.) in the bars between the slits. The atrial cavity remains open to the exterior at one point, the atrial pore (at.p.).|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} {{investigate}} content analysis of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> in upper primary science textbooks based on diagrammatic typology. The study analyzed the distribution of diagrams in different upper primary science book categories. The sample selected consists of a total number of nine 7 th grade physics, chemistry and biology textbooks adopted in three Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (I. C. S. E) schools in the Allahabad, India. Content analysis in this research entails a systematic coding and categorizing of the diagrams, drawings, photos, charts and graphs appeared in upper primary school science textbooks. A great amount of diagrams have been used in the upper primary level of science teaching. On average, there are about 1. 20 diagrams in physics, 0. 80 diagrams in chemistry & 1. 06 diagrams in biology textbooks used per page for the purposes of explaining, presenting or evaluating the scientific domain. The results confirmed that upper primary level of science education demands large quantity of diagrams to facilitate students learning. So content analysis of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> of science textbooks is recommended and teachers should adopt such diagrammatic strategies which increase the level of knowledge of learners. Teachers should teach students through different <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> skills and to enhance their academic performance...|$|R

The use of eye tracking methodology for the study of <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations,</b> however, has been relatively limited so far.

Since graph-like network diagrams {{are among the}} most commonly used and most important types of diagrammatic displays, layout techniques for graphs have been extensively studied.

This paper introduces a new layout method that consumes only little computational resources and does not need any heavyduty preprocessing. Unlike other declarative layout algorithms not even the costly repeated evaluation of an objective function is required. The method presented is based on a competitive learning algorithm which is an extension of self-organization strategies known from unsupervised neural networks. 1 Introduction For applications which generate <b>diagrammatic</b> <b>representations</b> a [...] ...|$|R
