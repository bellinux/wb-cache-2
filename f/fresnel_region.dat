These regions are useful to identify the field structure in each, although there are no precise boundaries.|$|E

40|$|Computation {{of fields}} {{radiated}} by parabolic reflectors and planar apertures {{is a problem}} of prime importance, and conventional approaches to performing these computations are often very time-consuming. The paper demonstrates the usefulness of a series expansion technique for efficient computation of radiated fields in both the Fraunhofer and <b>Fresnel</b> <b>regions.</b> The series approach is based {{on the use of the}} Jacobi polynomials. The application of the series method to determining the far-field pattern of the antenna from the near-field measurements for an arbitrary aperture antenna is also discussed...|$|R
50|$|Scattering-based DDM {{belongs to}} the {{so-called}} near-field (or deep Fresnel) scattering family, a recently introduced family of imaging-based scattering methods. Near field is used here {{in a similar way}} to what is used for near field speckles i.e. as a particular case of <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> as opposed to the far field or Fraunhofer region. The near field scattering family includes also quantitative shadowgraphy and Schlieren.|$|E
50|$|Particularly in {{the fields}} of fiber optics, lasers, and {{integrated}} optics, the term radiation pattern may also be used as a synonym for the near-field pattern or Fresnel pattern. This refers to the positional dependence of the electromagnetic field in the near-field, or <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> of the source. The near-field pattern is most commonly defined over a plane placed in front of the source, or over a cylindrical or spherical surface enclosing it.|$|E
50|$|When it was built, Pontardawe {{transmitter}} re-radiated {{a signal}} received off-air from Kilvey Hill about 12 km to the southwest. However, sometime after the Alltwen relay {{was built on}} the opposite side of the valley, the Pontardawe mast was reassigned to relay its signal instead. Both sites have line-of-sight to Kilvey Hill, but the direct signal to the Pontardawe site does have a close encounter with a wooded hillside 2 km away which severely intrudes into the signal's First <b>Fresnel</b> <b>Region.</b> Alltwen's line-of-sight is unobstructed.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{proposed}} for simulating free-space propagation. This method is an {{improvement of the}} angular spectrum method (AS). The AS does not include any approximation of the propagation distance, because the formula thereof is derived directly from the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld equation. However, the AS is not an all-round method, because it produces severe numerical errors due to a sampling problem of the transfer function even in <b>Fresnel</b> <b>regions.</b> The proposed method resolves this problem by limiting the bandwidth of the propagation field and also expands the region in which exact fields can be calculated by the AS. A discussion on the validity of limiting the bandwidth is also presented...|$|R
40|$|A cross-well, shear-wave {{data set}} posed two problems: 1) wells are {{separated}} by only 12. 5 wavelengths, so thin raypaths are a poor approximation; 2) data are recorded through a high-velocity limestone surrounded by low-velocity shales. Waves are bent considerably, so either refracted or direct arrivals can arrive first. Only first-arrivals can be picked with any reliability. Ray tracing is avoided entirely by extrapolating traveltimes explicitly from sources or receivers to every point in a region of interest. Rather than search for a single fastest raypath, this method finds <b>Fresnel</b> <b>regions</b> containing all paths that add con-structively to first-arrivals. This method also robustly finds minimum traveltimes, whether direct or refracted. The resolution of the estimated velocity model is controlled explicitly with basis functions of adjustablewidth. Wavepaths and velocities are estimated alternately: as the accuracy of paths improves, velocities are allowed to introduce sharper detail. No more two-dimensional detail is introduced than necessary...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a novel phase {{retrieval}} approach to reconstruct x-ray {{differential phase shift}} induced by an object. A primary advantage of our approach is a higher-order accuracy over that with the conventional linear approximation models, relaxing the current restriction of weak absorption and slow phase variation scenario. The optimal utilization of the diffraction images at different distance in <b>Fresnel</b> diffraction <b>region</b> eliminates the nonlinear terms in phase and attenuation, and simplifies the reconstruction to a linear inverse problem. Numerical studies are also described to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of our approach...|$|R
5000|$|Objective {{speckles}} {{are usually}} {{obtained in the}} far field (also called Fraunhofer region, thatis the zone where Fraunhofer diffraction happens). This means that they are generated [...] "far" [...] from the object that emits or scatters light. Speckles can be observed also close to thescattering object, in the near field (also called <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region,</b> that is, the region where Fresnel diffraction happens). This kind of speckles are called near field speckles. See near and far field for a more rigorous definition of [...] "near" [...] and [...] "far".|$|E
5000|$|The {{radiative}} {{near field}} (sometimes called the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region)</b> {{does not contain}} reactive field components from the source antenna, since it is {{so far from the}} antenna that back-coupling of the fields becomes out of phase with the antenna signal, and thus cannot efficiently store and replace inductive or capacitive energy from antenna currents or charges. The energy in the radiative near field is thus all radiant energy, although its mixture of magnetic and electric components are still different from the far field. Further out into the radiative near field (one half wavelength to 1 wavelength from the source), the [...] and [...] field relationship is more predictable, but the [...] to [...] relationship is still complex. However, since the radiative near field is still part of the near field, there is potential for unanticipated (or adverse) conditions.|$|E
50|$|If {{a signal}} is {{vertically}} polarized and it deflects off a horizontal object {{such as a}} flat roof, and then bounces up to a receiving antenna, and if the roof is within the 1st region of the Fresnel zone, the resulting signal will be inverted relative to the original signal. This means the high points of the sine wave are now low points, and vice versa. Hence, even though one would expect minimal change in phase in the first <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region,</b> the bounced signal will arrive out-of-phase, which will weaken the received signal. So, the installer of the antenna system must take this into consideration and either move the transmitting antenna, receiving antenna, or both, to minimize or remove the interfering roof-deflected phase-shifted signal. Or, the installer can increase the height of either one or both the transmitting and receiving antenna so that the object (roof) that is deflecting the signal is in the 2nd region rather than the 1st (the inverted signal would behave {{as if it was}} right side up by the time it reached the receiver due to the half-wave phase shift in region 2). Or, the installer can simply change the polarization to horizontal.|$|E
5000|$|In antenna applications, the Rayleigh {{distance}} is often given as four times this value, i.e. [...] which {{corresponds to the}} border between the <b>Fresnel</b> and Fraunhofer <b>regions</b> and denotes the distance at which the beam radiated by a reflector antenna is fully formed (although sometimes the Rayleigh distance it is still given as per the optical convention e.g.).|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Based on the {{scattering}} {{theory and the}} Green function method, a dynamical theory is given for calculating the diffraction of deeply-etched gratings with a stratified structure substrate. The key of our method is that the patterned grating structure is considered as a perturbation to the unpatterned stratified structure rather than to vacuum. Using the first-order Born approximation and in the <b>Fresnel</b> diffraction <b>region,</b> we obtain a simple analytical expression, {{which can be used}} to calculating {{the scattering}} intensity of deeply-etched circular binary Fresnel zone plates with a stratified substrate (MDECBFZPs). The numerical results show that the focusing intensity at the foci of the MDCBFZP changes periodically with the etching depth and the thickness of the substrate film. Our results are in good agreement with FDTD simulations. 1...|$|R
30|$|Laser {{interference}} patterns {{generated by}} a diffraction grating are advantageous for the fabrication of reproducible 2 D and 3 D periodic nanostructures over large areas (comparable to the laser beam size) using a single laser exposure [64]. Unlike prism holographic lithography, phase-shift lithography uses the interference among several diffracted light beams split by a diffraction grating. The interference patterns of the diffracted beams generated in the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>regions</b> are transferred to the photoresist film to generate ordered nanopillar arrays with a rectangular arrangement. During the laser interference patterning process, beams reflected from the interface between the photoresist and the underlying substrate produce a vertical standing wave by combining with the incident light to generate a vertical undulating pattern {{on the sides of}} the nanopillar arrays [65]. A schematic diagram of the laser interference lithography method using a diffraction grating is shown in Fig.  9 j. FDTD simulation data reveal that substrate with higher refractive index causes higher intensity of the reflected beam, thereby resulting in clearer undulating patterns on the side walls of nanopillars (Fig.  9 k). As shown in Fig.  9 l, m, nanopillar arrays produced on a silicon wafer display much clearer undulating patterns, whereas nanopillar arrays formed on a glass wafer have indistinct undulating patterns. The smooth-surface nanopillar arrays were prepared and the SERS spectra of benzenethiol were measured on three different substrates (Fig.  9 o). The intensity of the SERS signal obtained from the undulating nanopillar array was much higher than that obtained from the indistinctly undulating nanopillar array, and the smooth surfaces of the nanopillars provided no SERS signal at all. The electric field was significantly enhanced at the metallic nanogaps on the side walls of the undulating nanopillars (Fig.  9 p). The undulating nanopillar array provides high uniformity of SERS intensity over wide area (Fig. 9 q).|$|R

The method allows the use of the Fraunhofer antenna pattern to estimate the electromagnetic field radiated in the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> of base transceiver station (BTS) antennas. The proposed approach is introduced from a theoretical point of view and validated with simulations and measurements on linear and planar array systems. For its application, a specific description of the boundaries of the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> for a generic antenna of parallelepipedal shape, which takes into account the dependency from the direction of observation, is introduced. The method provides a rapid and simple solution of assessment issues in relation to the electromagnetic fields exposure limit...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} image micro/nano scale {{objectives}} with miniaturized optical components {{has always been}} of great interest due to its great potential in applications such as microscopy, nanofabrication, and biomedical monitoring. However, in traditional practice using dielectric lenses, the focal size is inevitably limited by the Abbe’s diffraction limit (0. 51 fλ/ρ). Here, λ is the wavelength in vacuum, and f and ρ are the focal length and the radius of the lens, respectively. Moreover, the performance of conventional spherical lenses deteriorates as their sizes approach the wavelength. On the other hand, owing to the recent advances in micro/nano fabrication techniques, miniature sensors have received much attention, which are highly desirable in many sensing applications for physical, chemical, and biomedical parameter measurements. However, the performance of miniature sensors usually suffers from the similar difficulty as miniaturized imaging systems. Recently nanophotonic structures have been explored {{for the development of}} miniaturizing imaging and sensing systems due to their capability of confining and manipulating light at a subwavelength scale. In this dissertation work, several different mechanisms that nanophotonic structures can be used to help enhance the performance of imaging and sensing in miniaturized systems are investigated. First, plasmonic lens utilizing the nanophotonic structure to achieve the subwavelength focusing ability is studied. Three different regions in the plasmonic lens design are defined. Furthermore, a plasmonic lens in the <b>Fresnel’s</b> <b>region</b> is designed and k. ed to achieve a sub-diffraction limit focus. Second, radially polarized light generated by the TEM mode in the annular aperture in metal is investigated, which can further enhance the focusing ability. Third, in terms of sensing, an ultra-thin plasmonic interferometer constructed with a nano-hole array is fabricated on a fiber facet. By using this structure, the multi-parameter sensing capability of this interferometer is demonstrated; high sensitivity refractive index and temperature sensing are achieved. Finally, a novel sensor design based on the cladding modes and buffer modes generated by the planar grating on the fiber facet is proposed. Experimental studies of this sensor demonstrate its superior temperature sensitivity and the potential of multi-parameter sensing...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{correlation}} {{properties of the}} speckles in the deep <b>Fresnel</b> diffraction <b>region</b> produced by the scattering of rough self-affine fractal surfaces. The autocorrelation function of the speckle intensities is formulated by {{the combination of the}} light scattering theory of Kirchhoff approximation and the principles of speckle statistics. We propose a method for extracting the three surface parameters, i. e. the roughness w, the lateral correlation length xi and the roughness exponent alpha, from the autocorrelation functions of speckles. This method is verified by simulating the speckle intensities and calculating the speckle autocorrelation function. We also find the phenomenon that for rough surfaces with alpha = 1, the structure of the speckles resembles that of the surface heights, which results from the effect of the peak and the valley parts of the surface, acting as micro-lenses converging and diverging the light waves...|$|R
50|$|Each Fresnel zone {{is defined}} by the {{phase-shift}} (or lack thereof) which ultimately occurs when a transmitted sine wave deflects off an object within that region and continues onward to the receiver. These regions can be important to take into account because a sine wave following one of these paths may arrive at the receiver out of sync with the line-of-sight sine wave by anywhere from 1º to 359º of phase shift (or more). If an object is within a particular <b>Fresnel</b> zone <b>region,</b> a part of the original signal which is not moving towards the receiving antenna and would otherwise have continued onward into space, may be partially deflected by that object back to the receiving antenna. The deflected signal can result in constructive interference or destructive interference at the receiver, depending on the path length and the resulting degree of phase shift in the deflected wave as it arrives at the receiver.|$|R

40|$|We {{provide a}} {{detailed}} analysis of the three-dimensional spatial coherence properties of light speckles, based on very general assumptions. We show that, while in the deep <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> close to the source the longitudinal coherence of speckles is ruled by the laws of ordinary diffraction, on approach to the Fraunhofer zone the longitudinal coherence length tends to become infinite. We offer both a quantitative and a qualitative description of the emergence of these different behaviors...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical and numerical {{investigation of the}} spatially averaged electric field in the beam of a circular aperture. The investigation leads to closed-form analytical expressions, based on scalar diffraction theory, which describe the spatially averaged electric field in the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> of a circular aperture excited by a spatially uniform, harmonic plane wave. The expressions ultimately permit rapid, practical, and efficient prediction of certain routine electromagnetic measurements. Because the expressions are valid in the <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region,</b> they are also valid in the near field, the far field, and the Fraunhofer region of a circular aperture. In fact, it is shown that the closed-form expressions contain, as special cases, classic on-axis and far-field results associated with a circular aperture. The analytical expressions {{are based on a}} generalization of Fresnel diffraction originally developed by Lommel in the late 1800 s. Hence, a thorough review of the literature on the Lommel diffraction formulation is presented. Finally, it is shown that results obtained from the closed-form expressions compare quite favorably to results obtained from the exact solution computed via the dyadic Green 2 ̆ 7 s function approach...|$|E

The methods employed are {{not restricted to}} the Conical-Gregorian antenna, but apply {{in a general way}} to dual and even multiple reflector systems. Complex vector wave methods are used in the <b>Fresnel</b> and Fraunhofer <b>regions</b> of the reflectors. Field amplitude, phase, polarization data, and time average Poynting vectors are obtained via an IBM 360 / 91 digital computer.

40|$|Wireless power {{transfer}} (WPT) {{has been an}} active topic of research, {{with a number of}} WPT schemes implemented in the near-field (coupling) and far-field (radiation) regimes. Here, we consider a beamed WPT scheme based on a dynamically reconfigurable source aperture transferring power to receiving devices within the <b>Fresnel</b> (near-zone) <b>region.</b> In this context, the dynamic aperture resembles a reconfigurable lens capable of focusing power to a well-defined spot, whose dimension can be related to a point spread function (PSF). Near-zone focusing can be achieved by generating different amplitude or phase profiles over the aperture, which can be realized using traditional architectures, such as phased arrays. Alternatively, metasurface guided-wave apertures can achieve dynamic focusing, with potentially lower cost implementations. We present an initial tradeoff analysis of the near-zone WPT concept, relating key parameters such as spot size, aperture size, wavelength, focal distance, and availability of sources. We find that approximate design formulas derived from the Gaussian optics approximation provide useful estimates of system performance, including transfer efficiency and coverage volume. The accuracy of these formulas is confirmed using numerical calculations. Comment: Original manuscript as submitted to Journal of Applied Physics (2016). 27 pages, 12 figure...|$|R
50|$|Reflectivity is {{the ratio}} {{of the power of the}} {{reflected}} wave to that of the incident wave. It is a function of the wavelength of radiation, and is related to the refractive index of the material as expressed by <b>Fresnel's</b> equations. In <b>regions</b> of the electromagnetic spectrum in which absorption by the material is significant, it is related to the electronic absorption spectrum through the imaginary component of the complex refractive index. The electronic absorption spectrum of an opaque material, which is difficult or impossible to measure directly, may therefore be indirectly determined from the reflection spectrum by a Kramers-Kronig transform. The polarization of the reflected light depends on the symmetry of the arrangement of the incident probing light with respect to the absorbing transitions dipole moments in the material.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} {{of making the}} antenna of an MST radar too large is pointed out. It {{is not that the}} signal ceases to become stronger beyond some critical antenna size; the received scattered signal actually becomes weaker as the antenna size is increased whenever the target is in the near field, <b>Fresnel</b> <b>region</b> of the antenna.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} the crossing statistics of speckle patterns formed in <b>Fresnel</b> diffraction <b>region</b> by {{a laser beam}} scattering through a nanofluid. We extend $zero-crossing$ statistics to asses dynamical properties of nanofluid. According to {{joint probability density function}} of laser beam fluctuations and its time derivative, theoretical framework for Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes are revisited for determining the magnitude of the moving particle's velocity. We count number of crossings not only at $zero$ level but also for all available thresholds. Using probabilistic framework in determining crossing statistics, $a$ $priori$ Gaussianity is not essentially considered, therefore even in presence of deviation from Gaussian fluctuation, this modified approach is capable to compute relevant quantities such as mean value of velocity more precisely. Generalized total crossing which represents the weighted summation of crossings for all thresholds to quantify small deviation from Gaussian statistics is introduced. This criterion can manipulate the contribution of noises and trends to infer reliable physical quantities. The characteristic time scale for having successive crossings at given threshold is defined. In our experimental setup, we find that increasing sample temperature leads to more consistency between Gaussian and perturbative non-Gaussian prediction. The maximum number of crossing does not necessarily occur at mean level indicating that we should take into account other levels in addition to $zero$ level to achieve more accurate assessments.

40|$|Some of the {{features}} of single and dual parabolic-cylinder reflector antenna systems are discussed in terms of wave conversions, field divergence, and wavefronts in <b>Fresnel</b> and Fraunhofer <b>regions.</b> Beam-squinting, by mechanical displacement and electrical phase gradient methods, is introduced together with the combination of these methods. In the case of dual parabolic cylinders there is also a discussion of surface-truncation, parametric representation of surface intersections, main-aperture blockage by the subsystem, and beam squinting. A few diffraction patterns are presented to illustrate the type of data available via a formulation equivalent to the complex-vector Kirchhoff-Kottler formulation. Main and cross-polarization components of the solution are available as they are inherently part of the field solution in the Cartesian coordinate system. A means of displaying main and cross-polarization components for arbitrary beam-scanning in space is outlined.

Satisfaction of the radiation conditions at infinity by the equivalent form is demonstrated by a conversion from Cartesian to spherical vector operators.
