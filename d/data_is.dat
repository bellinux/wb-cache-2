30|$|<b>Data</b> <b>were</b> {{collected}} and analyzed using SPSS software (SPSS Inc., version 22, Chicago: SPSS Inc). Continuous <b>data</b> <b>were</b> tested for normality of distribution where normally distributed <b>data</b> <b>were</b> presented as mean[*]±[*]SD while non-normally distributed <b>data</b> <b>were</b> presented as median (interquartile range). Categorical and nominal <b>data</b> <b>were</b> presented as number and or percentage. Independent sample t test and chi-square test {{were used to}} detect statistical {{differences between the two}} groups. P value was considered significant if less than 0.05.|$|R
5|$|Even {{interpreting}} the hydrogen data (including safety <b>data)</b> <b>is</b> confounded {{by a number}} of phenomena. Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen/orthohydrogen ratio (it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio, for which the <b>data</b> <b>is</b> usually given). Hydrogen detonation parameters, such as critical detonation pressure and temperature, strongly depend on the container geometry.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, {{the volume}} of <b>data</b> <b>is</b> {{increasing}} exponentially with a doubling time of approximately 10 months.|$|E

5|$|Public imaging {{processing}} of Hubble <b>data</b> <b>is</b> encouraged {{as most of}} the data in the archives has not been processed into color imagery.|$|E
5|$|The MSE {{method is}} also {{sensitive}} to secondary clustering. One {{example of this}} phenomenon is when a set of observations is thought {{to come from a}} single normal distribution, but in fact comes from a mixture normals with different means. A second example is when the <b>data</b> <b>is</b> thought to come from an exponential distribution, but actually comes from a gamma distribution. In the latter case, smaller spacings may occur in the lower tail. A high value of M(θ) would indicate this secondary clustering effect, and suggesting {{a closer look at the}} <b>data</b> <b>is</b> required.|$|E
5|$|A search {{combining}} multiple images {{collected by}} WISE and NEOWISE data {{has also been}} conducted.

5|$|Basic SQL {{comparison}} operators always return Unknown {{when comparing}} anything with Null, so the SQL standard provides for two special Null-specific comparison predicates.

5|$|Content analysis: The {{content of}} {{interviews}} and other texts is systematically analysed. Often <b>data</b> <b>is</b> 'coded' {{as a part}} of the 'grounded theory' approach using qualitative data analysis (QDA) software, such as Atlas.ti, MAXQDA, NVivo, or QDA Miner.|$|E
