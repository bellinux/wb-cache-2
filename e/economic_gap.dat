King said that he did not seek a full restitution of wages lost to slavery, which he believed impossible, but proposed a government compensatory program of $50billion over ten years to all disadvantaged groups.|$|E
5|$|Set in the People's Republic of China {{during the}} 1990s, the film {{centers on a}} 13-year-old {{substitute}} teacher, Wei Minzhi, in the Chinese countryside. Called in to substitute for a village teacher for one month, Wei is told not to lose any students. When {{one of the boys}} takes off in search of work in the big city, she goes looking for him. The film addresses education reform in China, the <b>economic</b> <b>gap</b> between urban and rural populations, and the prevalence of bureaucracy and authority figures in everyday life. It is filmed in a neorealist/documentary style with a troupe of non-professional actors who play characters with the same names and occupations as the actors have in real life, blurring the boundaries between drama and reality.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1970s, several suburbs (banlieues) of Paris, (especially {{those in}} the north and east) {{experienced}} deindustrialisation, as factories closed or moved farther out. The once-thriving residential cités became ghettos for African and Arab immigrants with few skills and high unemployment. At the same time, some neighbourhoods within the city of Paris and the western and southern suburbs successfully shifted their economic base from traditional manufacturing to high-value-added services and high-tech manufacturing, giving these neighbourhoods the highest per-capita incomes in France and among the highest in Europe. The resulting widening <b>economic</b> <b>gap</b> between these two areas led to periodic clashes between young residents of the northeast housing projects and the police.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a large}} <b>economic</b> <b>gap</b> between Flanders and Wallonia. Wallonia was {{historically}} wealthy {{compared to}} Flanders, mostly due to its heavy industries, but {{the decline of the}} steel industry post-World War II led to the region's rapid decline, whereas Flanders rose swiftly. Since then, Flanders has been prosperous, among the wealthiest regions in Europe, whereas Wallonia has been languishing. As of 2007, the unemployment rate of Wallonia is over double that of Flanders. The divide has played a key part in the tensions between the Flemish and Walloons in addition to the already-existing language divide. Pro-independence movements have gained high popularity in Flanders as a consequence. The separatist New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) party for instance is the largest party in Flanders.|$|E
25|$|There {{are serious}} and {{controversial}} issues about {{differences in the}} situation of women with different races and ethnicities in Brazil. As a whole, black and Amerindian women enjoy considerably less quality of life than white women, with this being {{a reflection of the}} general characteristics of the social and <b>economic</b> <b>gap</b> that has separated social classes in Brazil for centuries, thus not indicating any specific problem about gender and women's rights. Black women's life expectancy in 2004 was 69.52 years, while white women could expect to live 73.80 on average. However, there is, at least apparently, no legal or institutional circumstance that generates those ethnic differences, but lower standards of life have always been related to a much larger percentage of mulatto, black and Amerindian people in Brazil, as in many other countries. In the last years, there is a tendency of soft decrease in Brazil's racial inequality.|$|E

500|$|The FairTax's {{effect on}} the {{distribution}} of taxation or tax incidence (the {{effect on the}} distribution of economic welfare) is a point of dispute. The plan's supporters argue that the tax would broaden the tax base, that it would be progressive, and that it would decrease tax burdens and start taxing wealth (reducing the <b>economic</b> <b>gap).</b> Opponents argue that a national sales tax would be inherently regressive and would decrease tax burdens paid by high-income individuals. A person earning $2 million a year could live well spending $1 million, and as a result pay a mere 11% of that year's income in taxes. Households {{at the lower end of}} the income scale spend almost all their income, while households at the higher end are more likely to devote a portion of income to saving. [...] Therefore, according to economist William G. Gale, the percentage of income taxed is regressive at higher income levels (as consumption falls as a percentage of income).|$|E
500|$|Its initial goals achieved, UMNO {{established}} {{itself as}} a political party to fight for independence. At the same time, the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) launched an armed insurgency to form a communist government in Malaya, culminating in the Malayan Emergency which lasted until after independence. The insurgency was marked by a clear racial divide; opposition to the insurrection was almost entirely Malay, while Chinese dominated the communist ranks. The British encouraged {{the establishment of the}} Communities Liaison Committee (CLC), comprising the top echelon of Malayan politicians from different communities, to address sensitive issues, especially those related to race. Compromises on a number of issues, including citizenship, education, democracy, and Malay supremacy, were agreed on. Eventually, a [...] "bargain" [...] between the Malays and non-Malays was formulated; in return for giving up ketuanan Melayu, the Malays would be assisted in closing the <b>economic</b> <b>gap</b> between the Malay and non-Malay communities. CLC member E.E.C. Thuraisingham later said, [...] "I and others believed that the backward Malays should be given a better deal.

The report also recommended providing the governments of the First Nations with up to $2 billion every year until 2010, in order to reduce the <b>economic</b> <b>gap</b> between the First Nations and the rest of the Canadian citizenry. The money would represent an increase of at least 50% to the budget of Indian and Northern Affairs. The report engaged First Nations leaders to think of ways to cope with the challenging issues their people were facing, so the First Nations could take their destiny into their own hands.|$|E

40|$|Tourism {{is today}} the world’s largest {{industry}} {{and an important}} economic development tool in many developing countries. However tourism sometimes causes social complications, often due to social- and <b>economic</b> <b>gaps</b> that lead to tensions between tourists and local residents. At small island destinations spatial confinement and isolation contribute {{to the risk of}} these tensions to occur, which may then ruin the destination’s image. This study examines the relationship between tourists and local residents at the small island Koh Tao, which is a popular tourist destination in Thailand. The aim is to identify possible tensions and to examine why these tensions may occur. The research material is collected through an ethnographic study, including participant observations and informal interviews. The result of the study shows an overall positive relationship between the tourists and local residents, where the tourism industry’s economic contribution to the host community is an important factor fortheir positive attitude towards tourism. A few social- and <b>economic</b> <b>gaps</b> are identified, however these {{do not seem to be}} the cause of any notable tensions. Yet, sometimes tensions do occur and are then most often related to cultural- and linguistic misunderstandings. The essay discusses how these misunderstandings could be prevented through increased knowledge and also proposes an illustrating model. Finally, suggestions for future research regarding the usage of tourism as a development tool are proposed. Minor Field Studie...|$|R
