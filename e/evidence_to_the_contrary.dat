For example, she worked hard to keep both her name and the name of Wyatt's second wife Mattie out of Stuart Lake's 1931 book, , and Marcus threatened litigation to keep it that way. Marcus also told Earp's biographers and others that Earp never drank, did not own gambling saloons, and that he never provided prostitutes to customers, although strong <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary</b> exists.|$|E

50|$|Reformed {{epistemology}} {{is a form}} {{of modest}} foundationalism which takes religious beliefs as basic because they are non-inferentially justified: their justification arises from religious experience, rather than prior beliefs. This takes a modest approach to foundationalism - religious beliefs are not taken to be infallible, but are assumed to be prima facie justified unless <b>evidence</b> arises <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1954, the Brundage-headed IOC, in {{a narrow}} vote, {{recognized}} both committees, thus allowing both states to participate at Melbourne. Only the PRC's committee initially accepted, but when the Taiwanese NOC changed its mind and decided to send a team to the Games, the mainlanders withdrew in protest. Brundage took the position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with the USSR, once the PRC's committee was recognized and reported to the IOC that all eligibility rules were observed, the international committee had to accept that unless it had <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> He was frustrated by the continuing controversy, considering the squabble a distraction from the goal of advancing the Olympic movement.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{drawings}} {{described in this}} letter as showing drafts of the two new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, {{in the absence of}} <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> this design is considered by most vexillologists to have been unofficial, {{there is reason to believe}} that such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of British {{colonization}} of Australia in 1788, Indigenous Australians were characterised as nomadic hunter-gatherers who did not engage in agriculture, despite <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> In 1969, the archaeologist Rhys Jones proposed that Indigenous Australians engaged in systematic burning {{as a way of}} enhancing natural productivity, what has been termed fire-stick farming. In the 1970s and 1980s archaeological research in south west Victoria established that the Gunditjmara and other groups had developed sophisticated eel farming and fish trapping systems over a period of nearly 5,000 years. The archaeologist Harry Lourandos suggested in the 1980s that there was evidence of 'intensification' in progress across Australia, a process that appeared to have continued through the preceding 5,000 years. These concepts led the historian Bill Gammage to argue that in effect the whole continent was a managed landscape.|$|E

5|$|The USPTO will {{contact the}} senior {{registrant}} to inform that {{party of the}} claim against their mark. The proceeding in which the respective rights of the parties are determined is like a trial in which the applicant must submit evidence showing that the applicant had adopted the mark in good faith, that the applicant had adopted the mark prior to the senior registrant's date of registration, and that the confusion is not likely. The senior registrant may present <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> {{in order to prevent}} the loss of control over the use of the registered mark in the applicant's claimed territory. Both parties may take discovery in the form of requests for admission, interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. As with a regular trial, the TTAB may be called upon to resolve disputes over whether discovery requests are overbroad, and whether discovery responses are inadequate.|$|E
5|$|The family sought {{compensation}} {{from the}} National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (NVICP), {{but in order}} to qualify they were required to prove that it was more likely than not that their children's autism was caused by their vaccines. The scientific community had concluded that vaccines did not cause autism years before the first cases were heard, and concern was therefore expressed that the relatively lax evidentiary standards of the NVICP could lead to compensation being awarded in spite of the compelling scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> This, some vaccine supporters argued, might have serious adverse public health effects by discouraging vaccine manufacturers from producing more childhood vaccines. Though the NVICP had existed since 1988, it was not designed to handle the thousands of cases it received from 1999 to 2007, which led to the establishment of the Omnibus Autism Proceeding in 2002.|$|E

50|$|A {{pamphlet}} entitled Bishop Hopkins Letter on Slavery Ripped Up and his Misuse of the Sacred Scriptures Exposed {{was written}} by an anonymous clergyman in 1863. In this pamphlet the author methodically opposes all of Hopkins’ points and either gives more <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> show how he was wrong or gives another interpretation of <b>the</b> Hopkins’ <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> prove <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> This opposition <b>to</b> Hopkins' pamphlet shows the intense divide in the Episcopal Church {{over the issue of}} slavery. Throughout the Civil War, the Church remained unclear on its official stance on slavery, and these two opposing pamphlets are a prime example of the two duelling factions.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{determinism}} is {{the idea}} that many significant human characteristics are rendered inevitable by the presence of certain genes. The psychologist Susan Oyama has famously compared arguing against genetic determinism <b>to</b> battling <b>the</b> undead.

As long as genes are represented as containing information about how the organism will develop, they will continue to be regarded as determining causes no matter how much <b>evidence</b> exists <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary.</b> Philip Kitcher has strongly disputed Oyama's diagnosis, arguing that the conventional interactionist perspective on development is the correct framework for understanding the role of the genes in development.

40|$|The {{design of}} legal obligations, whether {{by a public}} body such as a {{legislature}} or by private contract, should anticipate the enforcement process that induces compliance. Judicial enforcement is costly and imperfect, largely because of limits on <b>the</b> court’s ability <b>to</b> detect facts accurately. In adversarial litigation, courts are often fooled by fabricated, suppressed, or otherwise manipulated evidence. Given that fabricated evidence is both more costly and less valuable than truthful evidence, {{one would think that}} contracting parties should design their agreement so as <b>to</b> deter future <b>evidence</b> fabrication. <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>contrary,</b> this article suggests that evidence fabrication may be harnessed by contracting parties <b>to</b> improve <b>the</b> (evidentiary) cost-efficiency of performance incentives in their relationship.
