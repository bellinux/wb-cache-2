40|$|Purpose. The {{article is}} {{aimed to develop}} a {{technique}} for calculating the magnetic characteristics of uncompensated traction electric motors (TEM) at any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> excitation based on the approximating expression for improved universal magnetic characteristics (UMC). It is also necessary to conduct an analysis of expressions for improved UMC {{with the aim of}} finding an expression that most fully satisfies the requirements for developing a technique for determining the inductive parameters of TEM. Methodology. It is necessary to determine the saturation coefficient for each <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> the excitation for building the characteristics with the improved UMC. This can only be done analytically. To simplify the analytical finding of the saturation coefficient, the method based on solving a system of two equations is proposed, one of which is UMC itself, and the second one is a straight line whose angular coefficient is proportional to the saturation coefficient. Resulting values of the saturation coefficient for the excitation degrees β < 1 are essentially the coefficients of the shape of the magnetic characteristic. To get rid of the need to determine the coefficients of approximation each time in the calculation of characteristics a form of improved UMC is proposed, in which the magnetomotive force (MMF) of the excitation winding serves as the argument's role. Findings. Using the improved UMC it is possible to calculate the characteristics of uncompensated TEMs for any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> excitation. The accuracy of the calculation at β = 1 does not differ from that in the calculation for UMC, proposed by Prof. M. D. Nakhodkin. The same accuracy is preserved at excitation degrees that are different from unity. Originality. An analytical technique for calculating the magnetic (speed) characteristics of uncompensated TEM for any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> {{with the help of an}} improved UMC is proposed. The analytical technique for determining the saturation coefficient for an improved UMC at any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> excitation is also proposed. Due to the introduction of an excitation winding as an argument, there is no need to determine the approximation coefficients for each specific TEM. Practical value. The developed methodology let calculate magnetic characteristics of uncompensated REMs for any <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> excitation. On the basis of this technique, it is possible to develop a technique for determining the inductive parameters of the TEM, using the saturation coefficient of the machine as initial data...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out on monkeys, goats and guinea-pigs to define as closely as {{possible}} the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> the Rev I strain of B. melitensis. Earlier studies had conclusively demonstrated the effectiveness of the strain as an immunizing agent of the three animal species and had suggested that the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> was such as to warrant limited study in humans. Results of such a limited study suggested more intensive measurement of the virulence of the strain in other stocks of animals as well as in individual animals rendered increasingly susceptible. A comparison of Rev I with B. abortus, strain 19 -BA, and with a fully virulent strain of B. melitensis in guinea-pigs confirmed that the BA strain was more attenuated than Rev I. Cynomolgus monkeys were effectively immunized by Rev I and showed temporary signs of generalized infection.

This effect may ultimately influence the design of WDM wavelength packet-switched networks employing wavelength tuneable transmitters. We have investigated this effect by examining the BER transmission performance of a WDM channel as a function <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> another WDM wavelength signal during fast wavelength switching events.

40|$|Background: It is {{not known}} whether leaded glass goggles with 0. 25 mm Pb equivalency, used in interventional {{cardiology}} procedures, attenuate radiation below the levels established by the latest recommendation of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). Aim: To assess ifthe <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> the secondary ionizing radiation achieved {{by the use of}} 0. 25 mm Pb leaded glass goggles, in occupationally exposed workers in interventional cardiology procedures, meets the latest ICRP recommendations. Material and Methods: A prospective investigation was carried out to compare the eye exposure to secondary ionizing radiation received by occupationally exposed personnel in a 9 months period. A set of two thermo luminescent dosimeters was arranged in the front and back of leaded glass goggles in a cohort ofseven members of an interventional cardiology service, exposed to 1057 consecutive procedures. Results: The monthly dose equivalent measurement performed in front ofthe goggles ranged between 1. 1 and 6. 5 mSv, for paramedics and interventional cardiologists. The radiation measured {{in the back of the}} glass varied between 0. 66 and 2. 75 mSv, respectively. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> the dose at eye level ranged from 40 % to 57. 7 %, respectively. The projected annual exposure would reach 33 mSvfor the interventional cardiologist. Conclusions: With a similar load ofwork and wearing 0. 25 mm Pb equivalent glass goggles, interventional cardiologists will exceed the crystalline equivalent dose limit recommended by the ICRP (20 mSv/year averaged over the past 5 years) ...|$|R

40|$|Motivation: The rapid {{expansion}} of whole-genome copy number (CN) studies brings a demand for increased precision and resolution of CN estimates. Recent studies have obtained CN estimates {{from more than one}} platform for the same set of samples, and it is natural to want to combine the different estimates in order to meet this demand. Estimates from different platforms show different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> the true CN changes. Similar differences can be observed in CNs from the same platform run in different labs, or in the same lab, with different analytical methods. This is the reason why it is not straightforward to combine CN estimates from different sources (platforms, labs and analysis methods) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{degradation}} of the PET images is mainly due to the scattering and <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> 511  K eV gamma rays within the FOV (Abella et al. 2007). The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> and accuracy <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> mapping {{is based on the}} volume of the object (Zaidi et al. 2006). However, in case <b>of</b> PET-MRI, the <b>attenuation</b> due to hardware and MRI coils within FOV is near to the region of interest. Thereby, this can suppress the information from the PET image (Keereman et al. 2013). Any attenuation correction technique has to consume minimum time because the mapping is done simultaneously with acquisition of PET data (Zaidi and Hasegawa 2003).|$|R

A number of reports have indicated that active fault zones are characterized by high attenuation (low Q values) due mainly to high fracture density and/or the presence of abundant pore water (e.g., Rietbrock 2001; Bennington et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2012).|$|R

50|$|Isolation is the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> from an {{unwanted}} signal detected {{at the port}} of interest. Isolation becomes more important at higher frequencies. High isolation reduces the influence of signals from other channels, sustains the integrity of the measured signal, and reduces system measurement uncertainties. For instance, a switch matrix may need to route a signal to a spectrum analyzer for measurement at -70 dBm and to simultaneously route another signal at +20 dBm. In this case, switches with high isolation, 90 dB or more, will keep the measurement integrity of the low-power signal.|$|R

40|$|Turbidity is an {{expression}} of the optical property of a medium, which causes light to be scattered and absorbed rather than transmitted in straight lines through a sample. Turbidimetry is the measurement of turbidity by quantifying the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>attenuation</b> <b>of</b> a beam of light of known initial intensity.

Measurements of turbidity can be used in many analytical fields to determine the mass concentration of suspended particles in a sample and, for some simple contexts, particle size distributions.
