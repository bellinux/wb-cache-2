[...] In the United States and Canada, the band is available on a primary basis from 222 to 225 MHz, with the addition of 219 to 220 MHz on a limited, secondary basis.

50|$|The 2200 meter or 136 kHz band is {{the lowest}} {{frequency}} band in which amateur radio operators are allowed to transmit. It was formally allocated to amateurs at the 2007 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-07).

50|$|The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio {{operations}} in the frequency range from 50.000 to 54.000 MHz in <b>ITU</b> <b>Region</b> 2 and 3.

Over the years portions have been vacated by VHF television broadcasting channels for one reason or another.
