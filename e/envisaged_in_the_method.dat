30|$|Deleterious {{effects of}} {{fluoride}} contamination in ground waters {{on the health}} of human beings are well known and intensive research on developing de-fluoridation methods is globally pursued. Of the various methodologies, increasing interest is being <b>envisaged</b> <b>in</b> using <b>the</b> adsorption <b>methods</b> based on active carbons derived from plant material. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present investigation, Nitric acid activated carbon derived from barks of Vitex negundo plant (NVNC) is probed for its de-fluoridation abilities.|$|R
40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that the modules and phase of complex {{reflection}} coefficient can be determined by using a magnetic substrate and polarized neutrons. Several other methods have also been worked out based on measurement of polarizations of reflected neutrons from magnetic reference layers and magnetic substrate. However, due to the fact that available reflectometers are limited <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choice of polarization of reflected beam <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction as the polarization of the incident beam, neither of <b>the</b> <b>methods</b> which are based on polarization analysis, has been proven to be experimentally practical. In this paper, we have proposed a new <b>method</b> for determining <b>the</b> phase of reflection coefficient which is based on two measurements of polarization which correspond to two magnetic fields with the same magnitudes and different orientations. The polarization analysis is performed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same direction as the polarization of the incident beam and is well suited for available reflectometers. <b>The</b> problems <b>envisaged</b> <b>in</b> implementation of <b>the</b> <b>method</b> are also discussed.
