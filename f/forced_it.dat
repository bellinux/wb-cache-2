5|$|After this battle, the Rhodian admirals {{decided to}} leave Chios and sail back home. On {{the way back to}} Rhodes, the Rhodian admiral Theophiliscus died of the wounds he {{received}} at Chios, but before he died he appointed Cleonaeus as his successor. As the Rhodian fleet was sailing in the strait between Lade and Miletus on the shore of Asia Minor, Philip's fleet attacked them. Philip defeated the Rhodian fleet in the Battle of Lade and <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to retreat back to Rhodes. The Milesians were impressed by the victory and sent Philip and Heracleides garlands of victory when they entered Milesian territory as did the city of Hiera Cone.|$|E
5|$|By 1932 the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus {{services}} {{had begun}} to run with unrestricted competition, and the tram line by this time was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing loops and passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, {{and the effect of}} the Great Depression at the time <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931. The goods service continued until 12 January of the next year.|$|E

5|$|In December 1987, the Conservancy {{performed}} one of {{its first}} breed rescues when it removed a viable population of Santa Cruz sheep from Santa Cruz Island. The sheep {{were in danger of}} being eradicated by The Nature Conservancy, which was working to save indigenous vegetation that the breed used as food. The first twelve lambs were removed from the island in 1988, with further animals brought to the mainland in 1991. The population now stands at 125 animals and is considered an important genetic resource due to its island heritage, which kept it isolated from other breeds and <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to adapt to adverse conditions.|$|E
5|$|On 24 January the French {{ambassador}} {{was expelled}} {{in response to}} the execution of Louis XVI in Paris on 21 January and on 1 February the National Convention declared war on Great Britain. The naval campaign in the Atlantic began in earnest in March 1793, when a French battle squadron briefly put to sea before a mutiny <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to return. The war between Britain and France begun in the Goulet on 2 January 1793 was to last, with a 14-month break in 1802–1803, until 1815.|$|E
5|$|Pilot whales {{have also}} {{fallen victim to}} bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in {{southern}} California. Likewise, California's drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales {{a year in the}} mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to be shut down.|$|E

5|$|The oldest gymnasiums in {{the country}} are Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík and Menntaskólinn á Akureyri. Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík traces its origin to 1056, when a school was {{established}} in Skálholt. The school was moved to Reykjavík in 1786, but poor housing conditions <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to move again in 1805 to Bessastaðir near Reykjavík. In 1846 the school was moved to its current location, and a new building was erected for it in Reykjavík.|$|E
5|$|Thence {{the fleet}} {{continued}} {{on to the}} Hellespont, and when all was ready, shipped the land forces across to Europe. The army then marched through Thrace, re-subjugating it, since these lands had already {{been added to the}} Persian Empire in 512 BC, during Darius's campaign against the Scythians. Upon reaching Macedon, the Persians <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to become a fully subordinate part of the Persian Empire; they had been vassals of the Persians since the late 6th century BC, but retained their general autonomy.|$|E
5|$|Two major {{incidents}} {{occurred in}} 1972. The Fatah subgroup Black September hijacked Sabena Flight 572 {{en route to}} Vienna and <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to land at the Ben Gurion International Airport in Lod, Israel. The PFLP and the Japanese Red Army carried out a shooting rampage at the same airport, killing twenty-four civilians. Israel later claimed that the assassination of PFLP spokesman Ghassan Kanafani {{was a response to}} the PFLP's involvement in masterminding the latter attack. Two days later, various PLO factions retaliated by bombing a bus station, killing eleven civilians.|$|E

5|$|Very heavy {{strategic}} bombing by the Allies targeted refineries producing {{synthetic oil}} and gasoline {{as well as}} the German transportation system, especially rail yards and canals. The armaments industry began to break down by September 1944. By November, fuel coal was no longer reaching its destinations and the production of new armaments was no longer possible. Overy argues that the bombing strained the German war economy and <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to divert up to one-fourth of its manpower and industry into anti-aircraft resources, which very likely shortened the war.|$|E
5|$|Ann Arbor has a {{long history}} of {{openness}} to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of cannabis, the large number of medical marijuana dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from Michigan Stadium until zoning <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual Hash Bash: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.|$|E
5|$|At a {{congress}} in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded {{a national organization}} of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany (Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but {{a lack of interest}} <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, Solidarität (Solidarity), was founded, but the name was changed to Die Einigkeit (Unity) the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, Oryol was {{probably}} hit by five 12-inch, two , nine , thirty-nine 6-inch shells, and 21 smaller rounds or fragments. Although {{the ship had}} many large holes in the unarmored portions of her side, she was only moderately damaged as all of the four (one 12-inch and three 6-inch) shells that hit her side armor failed to penetrate. The left gun of her forward 12-inch turret had been struck by an 8-inch shell that broke off its muzzle and another 8-inch shell struck {{the roof of the}} rear 12-inch turret and <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> down, which limited the maximum elevation of the left gun. Two 6-inch gun turrets had been jammed by hits from 8-inch shells and one of them had been burnt out by an ammunition fire. Another turret had been damaged by a 12-inch shell that struck its supporting tube. Splinters from two 6-inch shells entered the conning tower and wounded Yung badly enough that he later died of his wounds. Casualties totaled 43 crewmen killed and approximately 80 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Forecasters {{initially}} predicted {{wind shear}} from an upper level low would prevent strengthening and cause dissipation within three days. However, the depression continued to organize as deep convection continued to develop near the circulation despite moderate amounts of wind shear, {{and the system}} intensified into Tropical Storm Chris six hours after developing. The convection gradually consolidated over the system, and by late on the 1st Chris reached winds of 60mph (95km/h) while passing 50miles (80km) north of the northern Leeward Islands. The structure of Chris continued to improve and become more symmetrical, and an upper level eye feature developed early on August 2. Outflow improved in all quadrants, as well, and the storm reached a peak intensity of 65mph (100km/h) shortly thereafter while located 120miles (195km) east of St. Thomas. Despite initial predictions of Chris intensifying to a hurricane as a ridge of high pressure <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> west-northwestward, upper level shear dissipated the well-defined inner core of the storm, and Chris started to weaken.|$|E
5|$|Freidig was {{established}} in 1918 as a local team for Briskebyen {{in what was then}} the municipality of Vang. At the time there was a severe lack of pitches in Hamar, so the club was forced to sneak into unused venues and play until they were chased by the groundskeeper. The club was accepted {{as a member of the}} Football Association of Norway (NFF) in 1927, changing its name to Briskebyen FL. This <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to formalize its pitch renting so it would have a single home venue for each season. In 1928 and 1929, it played at Vangsbanen, from 1930 through 1933 at Ottestad bane, and from 1934 at Hamar stadion.|$|E

5|$|Headlam {{was given}} command of No.2 Squadron at Laverton on 15April 1941, and raised to wing {{commander}} on 1July. Equipped with Lockheed Hudsons, the squadron mainly conducted maritime patrols in southern waters until 5December, when {{four of its}} aircraft were ordered to Darwin, Northern Territory, in response to fears of Japanese aggression in the Pacific. On 7December, this detachment established itself at Penfui, near Koepang in Dutch Timor, while No.2 Squadron's eight remaining Hudsons were stationed at Darwin on standby. The following day, aware that Australia was now at war in the Pacific, one of the Penfui-based Hudsons attacked the Japanese pearler Nanyo Maru, which was suspected of being a radio ship, and <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> aground. By 12December, Headlam had transferred to Penfui as commanding officer of the base, as well as No.2 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate was the second-longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the season, Kate developed from a tropical wave {{in the central}} tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned sharply westward while moving around a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125mph (205km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing {{to the east of}} Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Channel 4 {{television}} programme What Sank the Mary Rose? attempted {{to investigate the}} causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models {{of the ship and}} metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up {{on the day of the}} sinking as the real Mary Rose went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works <b>forced</b> <b>it</b> to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the waterline and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.|$|E
