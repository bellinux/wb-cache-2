50|$|The stem, of the quill variety, is {{attached}} to the fork's steerer tube using an <b>expander</b> <b>bolt</b> which fits through the stem from the top with a wedge at the bottom, the stem fits inside the steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free the stem for adjustment, undo the bolt {{on the top of the}} stem a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.|$|E
50|$|Moser's {{frames are}} unique among Italian racing {{bicycles}} for being fillet brazed using silver solder {{rather than using}} lugs with brass brazing; silver solder never gets hot enough to weaken the tubing and thus bicycles constructed in this manner {{do not need to}} be reinforced with lugs, thus reducing the bicycle's weight. After brazing, each frame is hand filed and aligned on a digital alignment table. The smooth lines resulting from the lack of lugs are emphasized with a unicrown fork and an integrated seatpost, attached by an <b>expander</b> <b>bolt</b> in a manner similar to the handlebar stem.|$|E
50|$|The older {{of the two}} {{handlebar}} stem styles, quill types have been largely displaced as the industry standard on sport bikes. However, they remain standard on the majority of utility bikes, regardless of price, {{as well as on}} less expensive sport bikes and higher-end retro bikes. The quill stem requires the threaded steerer tube of the fork to extend up through the headset but not protrude beyond it. The quill stem fits down into the inside of the top of steerer tube and is held in place by either a wedge-shaped nut and bolt or a cone-shaped <b>expander</b> nut and <b>bolt.</b> In the case of a wedge-shaped nut, the bottom of the stem is cut diagonally to match the wedge and the bolt pulls the wedge against the stem to expand against the inside of the steerer tube and hold the stem in place. In the case of an expander nut, the bottom of the stem is cut perpendicular to its length and also has two slits cut parallel to its length. The cone-shaped expander nut is pulled upwards by the bolt causing the sides of the stem to spread and press against the inside of the steerer tube to hold it in place.|$|R
