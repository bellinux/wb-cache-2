500|$|The company traces {{its history}} to a <b>groundwood</b> pulp mill {{established}} in 1865. Car tyre production began in 1932 by Suomen Gummitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd). A three-company merger formed the Nokia Corporation in 1967; Nokian Tyres Limited {{was established in}} 1988 as a joint venture company split from the conglomerate as Nokia Corporation started focusing entirely on the mobile communications business. Nokian is [...] "Nokia" [...] in the genitive, thus Nokian renkaat meaning [...] "Tyres of Nokia". The European subsidiary of Japanese tyre company Bridgestone is currently the largest minority shareholder.|$|E
500|$|Early {{corporate}} predecessors of Nokian Tyres are the Nokia Aktiebolag (Nokia Company) and Suomen Kumitehdas Oy (Finnish Rubber Works Ltd.). In 1865, {{mining engineer}} Fredrik Idestam established a <b>groundwood</b> pulp mill {{on the banks}} of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tampere, in southwestern Finland. In 1868, Idestam built a second mill near the town of Nokia, [...] west of Tampere by the Nokianvirta River, which had better resources for hydroelectric production. In 1871, with the help of his close friend, the statesman Leo Mechelin, Idestam renamed and transformed his mills into a share company, founding the Nokia Company.|$|E
50|$|Another {{operation}} {{that is no}} longer performed relates to storing <b>groundwood.</b> In 1934, a large concrete pad was constructed for storing â€œlapped <b>groundwood</b> pulp. Because of the water-driven <b>groundwood</b> mill, at time of high water availability, excess <b>groundwood</b> was manufactured for use when the water flow was low. Separation of frozen laps was difficult during cold Minnesota winters. When separation was not possible with crowbars, dynamite was used. The lapped <b>groundwood</b> pulp was then brought into the mill and placed into beaters for repulping and use.|$|E
