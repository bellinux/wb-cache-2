40|$|Background: The <b>Global</b> <b>Network</b> for Women’s and Children’s Health Research (<b>Global</b> <b>Network)</b> {{supports}} and conducts clinical trials in resource-limited countries by pairing foreign and U.

Accurate reporting of births, stillbirths, neonatal deaths, maternal mortality, and measures of obstetric and neonatal care is critical to efforts to discover strategies for improving pregnancy outcomes in resource-limited settings. Because most of the sites in the <b>Global</b> <b>Network</b> have weak registration within their health care systems, the <b>Global</b> <b>Network</b> developed the Maternal Newborn Health Registry (MNHR), a prospective, population-based registry of pregnancies at the <b>Global</b> <b>Network</b> sites to provide precise data on health outcomes and measures of care. Methods: Pregnant women are enrolled in the MNHR if they reside in or receive healthcare in designated groups of communities within sites in the <b>Global</b> <b>Network.</b> For each woman, demographic, health characteristics and major outcomes of pregnancy are recorded. Data are recorded at enrollment, the time of delivery and at 42 days postpartum...|$|R

40|$|The role of <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> is {{increasingly}} important in influencing state’s decision on grand project. Tactics and strategies are employed across borders {{to build up}} cases and arguments to influence state’s decision. Global actors such as the non-governmental organizations particularly environmentalist groups adopt strategies that bypass their state and search out for international allies to bring pressure on their state from outside. Sahabat Alam Sekitar (SAM) and other international allies {{who are members of}} World Commission on Dam (WCD) rally campaigns for the severe environmental and social structure effect on the Bakun dam project. <b>Global</b> <b>networks</b> presented their findings on eight large dams that have put pressure on the Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) and the Malaysian government to reconsider the big-dam project. Here the discussions on tactics and strategies by <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> are vital because a similar analysis can be applied in examining the impact of <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> on state’s decision. However, actions from <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> have to be consistent and continuous to convince state actors. Local networks have to find ways to redefine issues concerning environments and people who are affected as a way to maintain endorsement from international networks. If supports are not consistent and continuous, the impact of collective efforts from <b>global</b> <b>networks</b> is rather subtle or perhaps forgettable...|$|R

40|$|China's {{entry into}} the <b>global</b> <b>networked</b> society has raised {{considerable}} debate over what {{is derived from the}} development and expansion of information and communication technologies (ICTs). One of the hotly debated issues is Internet copyright piracy, which is critical to the credibility and stability of China's membership to the <b>global</b> <b>networked</b> society. This paper examines Chinese users' online discussion about Internet software piracy as local resistance to global copyright enforcement exercised through globalization processes. The study uses Mittelman and Chin's (2005) framework of Polanyi's (1957) counter-hegemony and Gramsci's (1971) counter-movements as a heuristic device to conceptualize the resistance points to globalization located within the dominant discourse on intellectual property rights, specifically Internet software piracy, by Chinese Internet users. Gee's (2002) discourse analysis framework is applied to produce seven recurring themes within online postings: cost, convenience, software companies, foreign developed countries, China's development, Chinese culture, and moral dilemma. The analysis on these dominant themes illustrates the cultural models held by Chinese users towards the issues of Internet software piracy: Internet as a public domain, socialist market economy, patriotism, and Chinese culture. These cultural models represent different types of resistance in Mittelman and Chin's (2005) framework. Meanwhile, these resistance positions are integrated under the notion of Chinese nationalism to constitute a complete set of counter-discourses to global software copyright enforcement...|$|E
