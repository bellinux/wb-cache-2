5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby <b>H.</b> <b>Corner,</b> a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the dismay of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced herself from Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of infrageneric taxa (such as the subgenus, section and series) in the 19th century by botanists including Augustin Pyrame de Candolle allowed {{the retention of}} large genera that would otherwise have become unwieldy. E. J. <b>H.</b> <b>Corner</b> believed that studying large genera might enable greater insights into evolutionary biology, and he concentrated his efforts on large tropical genera such as Ficus.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, the British {{botanist}} E. J. <b>H.</b> <b>Corner</b> published The Durian Theory, or the Origin of the Modern Tree. His {{theory was}} that endozoochory (the enticement of animals to transport seeds in their stomach) arose before any other method of seed dispersal, and that primitive ancestors of Durio species were the earliest practitioners of that dispersal method, in particular red durian (D. dulcis) exemplifying the primitive fruit of flowering plants. However, in more recent circumscriptions of Durioneae, the tribe into which Durio and its sister taxa fall, fleshy arils and spiny fruits are derived within the clade. Some genera possess these characters, but others don't. The most recent molecular evidence (on which the most recent, well-supported circumscription of Durioneae is based) therefore refutes Corner's Durian Theory.|$|E

25|$|The next {{match was}} a World Heavyweight Championship match between Booker T and Triple H. The match began with Booker {{in control of}} the match over Triple H, however, Ric Flair, who was at ringside in Triple <b>H's</b> <b>corner,</b> threw Booker's knee into the steel steps. The attack allowed Triple H to work over Booker's leg, as he applied various {{submission}} holds onto Booker's leg including the Indian deathlock. Booker T retaliated and took control of the match; after he delivered a Harlem leg drop, Booker grasped his knee in pain, which allowed Triple H to recover and perform a Pedigree for a pinfall, thus Triple H won the match and retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|R
25|$|Australian {{botanist}} Charles Moore described Ficus columnaris in 1870 from {{material collected}} from Lord Howe Island, choosing the species {{name from the}} Latin columnaris for the column-like roots. English botanist E. J. <b>H.</b> <b>Corner</b> reduced this to synonymy with F. macrophylla in 1965, before P.S. Green noted it was distinct enough for subspecies status in 1986. Australian botanist Dale J. Dixon reviewed material and felt the differences too minor to warrant subspecific status, and recognised two forms: Ficus macrophylla f. macrophylla, a free-standing tree which is endemic to mainland Australia and Ficus macrophylla f. columnaris, a hemiepiphyte without a distinct main trunk, which is endemic to Lord Howe Island. The species is generally {{commonly known as the}} Moreton Bay fig, after Moreton Bay in southern Queensland, although it is found elsewhere. The term has also been mistakenly generalised to other fig species in Australia. An alternate name—black fig—is derived from the dark colour of the ageing bark.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} described as Hygrophorus lewelliniae by Hungarian mycologist Károly Kalchbrenner in 1882, {{and later as}} Hygrocybe lewelliniae by Brittlebank in 1940, before being placed in the genus Humidicutis by Australian mycologist Tony Young in 1997. A molecular phylogenetics study {{found it to be}} more closely related to the type species of the genus Porpolomopsis, Porpolomopsis calyptriformis so it was transferred to Porpolomopsis. The original holotype specimen had been collected on 14 June 1880 in the vicinity of Western Port in Victoria by a Miss M.R.Lewellin and sent by Ferdinand von Mueller to Kalchbrenner in Budapest. It was likely destroyed in the First World War, although a watercolour of it by the collector survives and is located in the National Herbarium of Victoria. It has been compared with collections made by E. J. <b>H.</b> <b>Corner</b> of a Mycena rimosacuta in Borneo and found to be the same species. It may be that Humidicutis mavis is merely a white-coloured form of this species.|$|E

50|$|On the February 25, 2013 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H returned, brawling with a {{returning}} Brock Lesnar, {{who was about}} to attack Vince McMahon for the second time , thus reigniting their feud from last year. During the brawl, Lesnars head was busted open and required 18 stitches. The following week, Triple H set out a challenge to Lesnar at WrestleMania. On the March 11 episode of Raw, after Lesnar attacked Triple Hs former D-Generation X members, The New Age Outlaws, Lesnars manager, Paul Heyman, said that Lesnar accepted Triple Hs challenge, but only if Heyman could add stipulations, to be revealed after Triple H signed the contract. Triple H signed the contract, therefore, he accepted the conditions, then Heyman revealed that the bout would be No Holds Barred and that if Triple H lost the match, he must retire from WWE. On the final Raw before WrestleMania, Shawn Michaels announced that he would be in Triple <b>Hs</b> <b>corner</b> for the match to support him.|$|R
500|$|American mycologist Elizabeth Eaton Morse {{described}} Cantharellus bonarii in 1930. The type locality was General Grant National Park in Fresno County, California. In 1945 C. floccosus and Morse's C. bonarii {{were transferred}} to Gomphus by Rolf Singer. The generic name {{is derived from the}} Ancient Greek γομφος, gomphos, meaning [...] "plug" [...] or [...] "large wedge-shaped nail". Alex H. Smith treated the members of Gomphus as two sections—Gomphus and Excavatus—within Cantharellus in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America, as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the genera. The shaggy chanterelle was placed in the latter section due to its scaly cap, lack of clamp connections and rusty-colored spores. Roger Heim classified it in the genus Nevrophyllum, before E. J. <b>H.</b> <b>Corner</b> returned it to Gomphus in 1966.|$|E

40|$|At long last, {{witness the}} {{publication}} of E. J. <b>H.</b> <b>Corner’s</b> legendary manuscript on the figs of Malesia! Corner’s disagreement with Flora Malesiana editor C. J. J. G. van Steenis in 1972 delayed the appearance of this work for a remarkable 35 years. According to Corner, a genus as distinctive and diverse as Ficus could not possibly conform to the standard format of the Flora. He once remarked that the many forms of these incredible plants could alone assemble a forest as diverse as any (Corner, 1940), and his idiosyncratic views clashed with the central tenet of Flora Malesiana to provide parallel accounts and keys of all species, genera and families in the region. A comprehensive treatment {{of one of the}} most difficult genera in Malesia was to van Steenis proof of the Flora concept but to Corner it was the culmination of a monumental 40 -year effort. A student of Corner’s once said that argumentative letters with van Steenis even included derogatory name calling in Malay. The impasse seemed a sort of last colonial standoff in the botany of a region once divided between the Dutch and the British. After Corner’s death in 1996 the manuscript that had languished in Leiden was passed to C. C. Berg who revised it so extensively tha...|$|R

5000|$|Next, WWF World Champion Kurt Angle was {{challenged}} by Triple H, {{who had been}} named number-one contender by his (then storyline) father-in-law Vince McMahon. The match began as a mat based, hold for hold contest, but Trish Stratus then tried to interfere on Angle's behalf, only to then get into a catfight with Stephanie McMahon, who was in Triple <b>H's</b> <b>corner.</b> Stratus (Vince McMahon's storyline mistress) and Stephanie (McMahon's daughter and then storyline wife of Triple H) {{had been involved in}} their own feud due to vying for power as the WWF's [...] "dominant female". After the fracas involving the two ladies on the outside (which had to be broken up by Vince himself), both Triple H and Angle accidentally hit the referee Earl Hebner, causing him to roll out of the ring. Triple H grabbed the title belt and tried to hit Angle with it, only to receive a belly-to-belly suplex. Angle then tried to hit Triple H with the belt, but Triple H ducked and gave him a Pedigree. As Triple H went outside to revive the referee, Stone Cold Steve Austin rushed into the arena, beating Triple H and giving him the Stone Cold Stunner as retaliation for Triple H costing Austin the title several weeks earlier on Raw. As Austin left the arena, Angle crawled over on top of Triple H to cover him for the pin, while Hebner recovered and made the count. Angle won the match and retained the WWF Title, with a very angry Triple H vowing to get even with Austin for costing him the match.|$|R

5000|$|The {{most highly}} {{promoted}} match, billed as [...] "The Perfect Storm", {{on the card}} saw Triple H facing of against Brock Lesnar. On the April 30, 2012 episode of Raw, Lesnar attempted to renegotiate his contract with General Manager John Laurinaitis. Triple H (in his corporate role as Chief Operations Officer) intervened, and declared that the contract Lesnar had agreed to upon re-signing with WWE was still valid and thus Lesnar could not add any other clauses to it. This led to a brawl between Lesnar and Triple H resulting in the latter having his arm broken by Lesnar via the Kimura armbar. Triple H returned at No Way Out, not only addressing Lesnar and the lawsuits brought against WWE, but also challenging him at SummerSlam, {{in exchange for his}} dropping the lawsuits that his legal representative, Paul Heyman, made against WWE and Triple H. On the June 18 episode of Raw, Heyman made an appearance, rejecting Triple H's challenge on behalf of Lesnar. After further goading from Heyman, Triple H attacked him. Meanwhile, it was announced that Lesnar would respond to Triple H's challenge on the July 2 edition of Raw; however, at the event it was announced that he will instead return at the 1000th episode of Raw on July 23. On Raw 1000, Heyman again declined the challenge, but after Triple H's wife Stephanie McMahon slapped him (due to making remarks about their children), Heyman accepted on behalf of Lesnar. Then on the August 6, 2012 episode of Raw, Shawn Michaels made an appearance to announce he'll be in Triple <b>H's</b> <b>corner</b> at SummerSlam. However, Michaels would not make it to SummerSlam after Lesnar used a Kimura lock to break his arm on the August 13, 2012 episode of Raw.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — A {{corner cut}} micro strip patch antenna having H slot with small micro strip line feed is {{presented}} here. Different design parameters with their effects are studied using v 11 Ansoft HFFS. For the operational frequency of 1. 8 GHz(1758 - 1848 Mhz), 3. 3 Ghz(3285 - 3454 Mhz) and 4. 6 Ghz(4600 - 4748 Mhz) VSWR bandwidth nearly 1. 38 and return loss bandwidth up to- 19. 75 db has been obtained. <b>H</b> slots and <b>corner</b> cut used here {{plays an important}} role in balancing resistive part and reactive part which affect the impedance matching. H slot at the centre increases radiating edges which results in improved bandwidth. The results demonstrate that the proposed antenna with <b>H</b> slot and <b>corner</b> cuts at special position can generate steady radiation patterns and is capable of wrapping the frequencies demanded by GSM, Wi-Fi and WiMAX. A thick dielectric substrate is helpful in increasing the bandwidth. Simple rectangular antenna can be resonated frequency ranging from 1 to 6 GHz range [3] [4]. It can be resonated only at one frequency at a time which is not suitable for multiband operation, but with the addition of different type of slots antenna can be resonated at more than one frequency at a single time which can be used for multiple operation...|$|R

The proofs use the dual RSK algorithm, Gessel's theorem, the Borodin Okounkov identity and a novel, rigorous saddle point analysis.
