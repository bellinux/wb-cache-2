50|$|In the {{determination}} of silicon content in an organic sample, a small and accurately-measured quantity of a substance {{is added to the}} large amount of sulfuric acid, then heated in an <b>evaporating</b> <b>dish.</b> The dish is heated with a Bunsen burner, until only stable precipitate remains, which contains the silica content. The dish is then closed and heated at high temperature until completely clean, fused silica is produced. Comparison of the initial weight of the substance and that of the fused silica allows to the content of silicon in the sample to be determined.|$|E

Shallow glass <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> are commonly termed [...] "watch glasses", since they resemble the front window of a pocket watch. Some used for high-temperature work are of refractory metals, usually of platinum, owing to its non-reactive behaviour and low risk of contamination.|$|R
50|$|Crucible tongs are scissor-like tools, {{but instead}} of having two blades, these tools are {{replaced}} with two pincers or pieces of metals that concave together, which allow the users to grasp a hot crucible, flasks, <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes,</b> or even small beakers. They are made of durable metals, allowed them to endure a very hot temperature when touching with the hot objects.|$|R
30|$|We {{concluded}} {{before that}} spore collection in plastic lids positioned above mushrooms with open hymenium depended on their forcible ballistospore discharge mechanism mediated at high humidity by {{the fusion of}} Buller’s drops with liquid films at the adaxial sides of the spores. Gasteroid species have lost this active basidiospore discharge mechanism, produce their basidiospores within closed fruiting bodies and disperse them from openings or cracks passively with wind or through pushing the spore sacs by rain drops (Hibbett et al. 1997; Wilson et al. 2011; Kües and Navarro-Gonzaléz 2015). Accordingly, basidiospores did not accumulate during overnight windstill incubation in <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> (18 – 24  h) in the plastic lids above mature puffballs (Lycoperdon perlatum, Agaricaceae) which were either already cracked or of which the inner gleba with the basidiospores was opened by cutting the fruiting body into two equal halves. Similarly, there were no spores in lids after 18  h incubation when we positioned two different mature earth-stars (Geastrum rufescens and Geastrum striatum; Geastraceae, Geastrales) with an ostiole as a natural opening and unrolled segments of the exoperidium into windstill <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> covered by plastic lids. However, when we hit 2 × with caution the spore sacs from the side with a glass rod through the spouts of the <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes,</b> clouds of spores escaped through the ostioles from the spore sacs {{into the air and}} attached to the plastic lids above (not further shown). We harvested and counted in the lids then 6.9  ×  106 basidiospores of G. rufescens (plating proofed them to be contamination free) and 4.4  ×  106 for G. striatum. We conclude that the spores are moved into the air is decisive for spore attraction to the plastic lids but not the particular initial mode of the spore release.|$|R

30|$|Nine cubic {{centimeter}} of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) ((C 2 H 5 O) 4 Si[*]≥[*] 99.5 %) and 9  cm 3 HCl (0.1  mol dm− 3) were dispersed in ethanol (16  cm 3) and stirred for 30  min. Meanwhile, 4  g citric acid (C 6 H 8 O 7 [*]·[*]H 2 O[*]≥[*] 99.5 %) and 2.2  cm 3 ethylene glycol (C 2 H 6 O 2 [*]≥[*] 99 %) were dissolved in deionized water (10  cm 3), and then 1.9  g MWNT dispersion (9  wt%, MWNT aqueous dispersion, Timesnano, Chengdu) (mass ratio of Si and MWNT[*]=[*] 6.6 : 1) was added into this solution with gentle stirring for 30  min.

50|$|A pipeclay {{triangle}} is a {{piece of}} laboratory apparatus that is used to support a crucible being heated by a Bunsen burner or other heat source. It is made of wires strung in an equilateral triangle on which are strung hollow ceramic, normally fire clay, tubes. The triangle is usually supported on a tripod or iron ring. Unlike wire gauze, which primarily supports glassware such as beakers, flasks, or <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> and provides indirect heat transfer to the glassware, the pipeclay triangle normally supports a crucible and allows the flame to heat the crucible directly. The triangular shape allows rounded crucibles of various sizes to rest in a stable way.|$|R
30|$|After sampling, the {{analysis}} was started immediately in the laboratory. The standard methods recommended by APHA (2005) and Trivedy and Goel (1984) were employed for {{the determination of}} various physicochemical parameters like pH, temperature, total dissolved solids (TDS), total suspended solids (TSS), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD). pH of the effluent samples {{was determined by the}} electrometric method by using a digital desktop, pH meter (Systronics- 335). The temperature was determined by glass thermometer. Similarly, TDS and TSS were analysed by the gravimetric method by using <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> and Whatman filter paper no. 1 having pore size 11  µm. The COD test and BOD 5 were analysed by modified Winkler’s method in 300 -mL BOD bottles.|$|R
6000|$|... 527. On {{breaking}} the connexion with the battery, the portions of asbestus were lifted out, and the drops hanging {{at the ends}} allowed to fall each into its respective vessel. The acids in a and b were then first compared, for which purpose two <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> were balanced, and the acid from a put into one, and that from b into the other; but as one was a little heavier than the other, a small drop was transferred from the heavier to the lighter, and the two rendered equal in weight. Being neutralized {{by the addition of}} the soda solution (525.), that from a, or the negative vessel, required 15 parts of the soda solution, and that from b, or the positive vessel, required 16.3 parts. That the sum of these is not 34 parts is principally due to the acid removed with the asbestus; but taking the mean of 15.65 parts, it would appear that a twenty-fourth part of the acid originally in the vessel a had passed, through the influence of the electric current, from a into b.|$|R
30|$|The monthly {{atmospheric}} total deposition/atmospheric fallout {{has been}} sampled using a weathering-resistant plastic tray (area[*]=[*] 4  m 2) installed on a cottage roof {{in an open}} field of the MRI in Tsukuba, Ibaraki (36.1 °N, 140.1 °E; approximately 170  km southwest of the FDNPP) since the 1980 s. After April 2011, the sample size was reduced to two trays, each 1  m 2, which we considered sufficient for the levels present after the FDNPP accident. The collected samples were evaporated and concentrated into a gross quantity with a rotary evaporator (Eyela NE- 12) or an <b>evaporating</b> <b>dish,</b> and the samples were saved in a polyethylene safekeeping container. Each evaporated sample, packed in a cylindrical plastic container, was measured for γ-ray emitting radionuclides (134 Cs and 137 Cs) using a Ge semiconductor detector (coaxial-type from ORTEC EG&G or Eurisys) coupled with a computed spectrometric analyzer (Oxford-Tennelec Multiport or Seiko EG&G 92 x). The precision, accuracy, and quality control of the measurements are described elsewhere (Otsuji-Hatori et al. 1996).|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the mineralogical composition of salt assemblages and the composition of groundwaters from which these salts precipitated. A comparison was made between salts and waters sampled in the Konya Basin in Turkey and waters sampled in three different regions in Kenya. The chemical composition of waters from rivers entering the Konya Basin is different from the composition of those from rivers in Kenya. The initial composition of these rivers determines the type of minerals that will precipitate during evaporation of these river waters. The ratio of calcium to carbonate at the moment the solution becomes saturated with respect to calcite, usually the first mineral to precipitate, determines whether the final solution will become carbonate-rich or carbonate-poor. The ratio of magnesium to silica and the ratio of calcium to sulphate at the moment the solution becomes saturated with respect to sepiolite and gypsum respectively, determine the magnesium and sulphate content of the final solution. In this way six different types of concentrated brines originate and six different types of salt assemblages precipitate from these brines during evaporation. The concentrated waters and the salt assemblages in the Konya Basin belong mainly to the Na-Mg-SO 4 -Cl-type. The evolution of the groundwater composition and the type of minerals which precipitated from these groundwaters can be explained by assuming successive precipitation of calcite, sepiolite and gypsum. The concentrated waters and the salt assemblages from Kenya belong mainly to the Na-CO 3 -SO 4 -Cl-type. The behaviour of the dissolved species and the type of salt minerals can be explained by assuming calcite and sepiolite precipitation only. The crystallographic properties of some salt minerals were determined by means of X-ray diffraction analysis and the morphological properties by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The presence of halite causes a salt crust to become dense and sealing. The porosity of a salt crust increases when bloedite or trona is present. Prediction of the sequence of salt minerals which will precipitate from a concentrated solution requires an accurate knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of concentrated electrolyte solutions. Unfortunately, these properties are still unknown for carbonate-rich solutions. Only recently a theory was developed for carbonate-poor solutions. The watersamples were evaporated in the laboratory in <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> under ambient conditions. The mineralogical composition of the precipitates was compared with the assemblages that occur in the field. The carbonate-containing salt assemblages both from the field and from the laboratory experiments were investigated by means of log PCO 2 - log aH 2 O diagrams. It appeared that neither the field nor the laboratory salt assemblages were in equilibrium with the CO 2 - pressures of the solutions from which they precipitated. These CO 2 -pressures were calculated from the analytical data. The carbonate-free salt assemblages from the Konya Basin were investigated by means of Jänecke-diagrams. For a few selected samples the theoretical mineral sequences were calculated under the assumption of equilibrium precipitation {{with the help of the}} computerprogram of Harvie & Weare (1980). It appeared that prediction of mineral assemblages in salt efflorescences is difficult even with a sound thermodynamic theory. Salt assemblages in natural salt efflorescences could best be predicted assuming precipitation under equilibrium conditions, whereas mineral assemblages in <b>evaporating</b> <b>dishes</b> in the laboratory could best be predicted assuming both metastable mineral formation and fractional crystallization. This conclusion is supported by the presence of the two new minerals, konyaite and eugsterite, which have been discovered in this study. Both are metastable minerals under ambient conditions. The oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition of some waters from the Konya Basin in Turkey and of the watersamples from the Amboseli Basin in Kenya were determined. The isotope fractionation caused by evaporation is different in groundwater and surface water. Processes of evaporation and water-rock interaction could be distinguished...|$|R

A simple energy flow process was established to determine the energy consumption of a dishwasher with internal air circulation. The drying performance of the dishwasher was determined by evaluating dish wetness. The effect of various performance variables (e. g., final rinse temperature, air circulation flow rate, and fan operation time) on the drying performance and the energy consumption was assessed individually. All tests were per-formed following a slightly modified EN 50242. The energy accumulated in the final rinse step was responsible for <b>evaporating</b> water off <b>dishes.</b> The drying performance increased as the energy consumption increased. More than 1. 17 kWh energy was consumed to obtain a drying performance greater than 1. 8...|$|R
