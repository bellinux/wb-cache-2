50|$|On September 14, 1947, the {{nationalist}} westward push was met head on with stiff communist resistance. At dawn, {{the nationalist}} 50th Division {{at the left}} front was badly mauled by the communist 8th Column and the 1st Independent Division at the Pear Tree Ditch Gate (Lishu Gou Men, 梨树沟门) region, {{and was forced to}} turn back. The communist force did not pursuit the retreating remnant of 50th Division, but instead, turned to the nationalist 22nd Division at the central <b>front,</b> <b>wiping</b> out the enemy at the region between Yang’s Family’s Pole (Yangjia Zhangzi, 杨家杖子) and Old Gate (Jiu Men 旧门). The nationalist 60th Division at the right front immediately withdrew after learning the news of the annihilation of forces at the other two fronts and after failing {{to catch up with the}} retreating enemy, the communists withdrew to the west for rest and regroup. In the meantime, the communist 9th Column were order to the Jinxi and Yang’s Family’s Pole (Yangjia Zhangzi, 杨家杖子) for reinforcement to face the renewed nationalist attack that was certain to come.|$|E
25|$|When a cold <b>front</b> along Florida <b>wiped</b> out 96 {{percent of}} {{branching}} coral in 1976-77, once extensive branching coral formations became rubble fields. The Dry Tortugas National Park now consists of patch reef and branching coral rubble.|$|R
2500|$|Next are verses {{from the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and John {{referring}} to Jesus {{after he was}} flogged by soldiers. Another section shows the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene and Mary of Clopas watching the punishment of Jesus from afar. Christ then receives the cross. The next section shows Jesus on his knees with Simon of Cyrene [...] carrying the cross and followed by a large crowd and soldiers. Saint Veronica appears in <b>front</b> of Christ, <b>wiping</b> {{his face with a}} cloth. The north and south segments show the falls Jesus suffered while carrying the cross while the three Marys look on.|$|R
6000|$|Turning to the spells {{of service}} at the front--there will be no rusting there--the novelty of sensation, the demand for {{initiative}} and adaptability are too great. A soldier said to me: [...] "My two years in depôt and camp were absolutely deadening; that eight weeks at the front before I was knocked over were the best eight weeks I ever had." [...] Spells at the <b>front</b> must <b>wipe</b> out all or nearly all the rust; but against them must be set the deadening spells of hospital, which too often follow, the deadening spells of training which have gone before; and the more considerable though not very permanent factor--that laziness and dislocation left {{on the minds of}} many who have been much in the firing line. As the same young soldier put it: [...] "I can't concentrate now as I could on a bit of work--it takes me longer; all the same, where I used to chuck it when I found it hard, I set my teeth now." [...] In other words, less mental but more moral grip.|$|R
50|$|The Russian {{army was}} {{surprised}} near Lubar on 14 September. Shermetev's <b>front</b> guard was <b>wiped</b> out, and Sheremetev — who until then {{had failed to}} send a single scouting party and suddenly realized {{what was to be}} an easy victory was a death trap — decided to take defensive positions in a fortified camp. Numerical superiority of the Polish forces, lack of supplies and several minor defeats convinced him to break away on 26 September. The plan succeeded at first but Polish forces caught the Russian army during its crossing of the Iber River, and captured or destroyed {{a significant portion of the}} remaining Russian artillery and supplies. The Polish forces caught up again with the Russians on 27 September, near Chudniv. At that point, the Russian and Cossack armies had lost about 1,000 troops, and the Poles about 100 (not counting the wounded). Sheremetev also received a minor reinforcement by attaching Chudniv's garrison (about 1,000 troops) to his main army.|$|R
5000|$|Although Campbell is {{regarded}} as a forefather in the state of today's justice system, he has been criticized by some prominent investigative persons for his actions. In 1947, General Motors and a number of its allies in the scheme to buy out all trolley systems in the U.S., using a number of <b>front</b> corporations (thereby <b>wiping</b> out railway competition with vehicle competition), were indicted on federal anti-trust charges. Two years later the workings were exposed during a trial in Chicago. The investigative journalist Jonathan Kwitny later argued that the case was [...] "A fine example of what can happen when important matters of public policy are abandoned by government to the self-interest of corporations." [...] Judge William J.Campbell was not so outraged. As punishment, he ordered GM and the other companies to pay a fine of $5,000 each. The executives were fined $1 each. The actions by GM and its allies illegally created zero competition and opened the automobile production to America without further challenge.|$|R
50|$|Next the 88th {{moved to}} Souilly Aerodrome on 12 September and was {{attached}} to the V Corps Observation Group. From 12 to 17 September the 88th operated over the lines at St. Mihiel. The unit took part in the St. Mihiel Offensive from 10 August to 17 September. It had fourteen planes available for service and stood sixteen pilots and eleven observers ready for duty. The Squadron in the St. Mihlel attack served under the 5th Observation Group attached to the 26th Division. In the first day's fighting the Division reached its enemy objective and the work of the Squadron from then {{until the end of the}} offensive consisted of reconnaissance work for the Division. in watching and reporting upon the enemy's retreat and counter-attacks. Thus the Squadron, just having experienced hard and constant fighting on the Vesle, was able to do its part on the new <b>front</b> to help <b>wipe</b> out the St. Mihiel salient. During this time the squadron conducted photographic, corps visual reconnaissance and command missions. Also, on 14 September, the squadron moved again to the Pretz-en-Argonne Airdrome.|$|R
