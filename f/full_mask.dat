25|$|A <b>full</b> face <b>mask</b> {{is lighter}} and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most <b>full</b> face <b>masks</b> are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The <b>full</b> face <b>mask</b> does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for <b>full</b> face <b>masks</b> is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a <b>full</b> face <b>mask</b> under water without assistance, so this is more an inconvenience than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|R

5000|$|In Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical adaptation, {{only half}} of Erik's face is {{deformed}} (thus the famous half-mask often associated with Erik's appearance.) His show was originally planned to have a <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> and full facial disfigurement, but when the director, Hal Prince, realized {{that it would make}} expression onstage very difficult, they halved the mask. The logo featuring a <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> was publicized before the change. The deformity in the musical includes a gash {{on the right side of}} his partially balding head with exposed skull tissue, an elongated right nostril, a missing right eyebrow, swollen lips, different colored eyes, and a wrinkled, warped right cheek. It is covered by a white half mask and wig. It originally took roughly four hours per performance to put the prosthetics on in the original London productions. On Broadway, it was cut to roughly three, and over the years has been reduced to 45 minutes. More than one Phantom has described make-up disasters onstage. Michael Crawford recounts a story where he pulled away from the kiss at the end only to see that [...] "his lower lip was now hanging off Sarah Brightman's face!". To cover the flub, he pulled her back for another kiss and [...] "took back the lips" [...] and kept that side of his head turned away from the audience.|$|E

5000|$|Damage {{appears in}} the relaunched Justice Society of America {{released}} in December 2006. He wears a <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> and a costume {{similar to that of}} his father and Atom Smasher, featuring a biohazard symbol. He also has a significantly gruffer and more cynical attitude, partly because, as the villain Rebel insinuates, Damage was left badly scarred, but alive, by Zoom. Zoom later encounters the Justice Society, claiming to have maimed, but not killed, the boy intentionally, to give him a defining tragedy, and the fight leads to Georgia. Damage leaps into the state, despite his ban from entering, catches up with Zoom, and holds him hostage. Liberty Belle calms Damage down, but Zoom escapes and hurls debris at his face with the intent to kill him. Liberty Belle speeds in, saves Damage, and knocks out Zoom. When the police are ready to arrest Damage for violating his ban, the Justice Society stands up for him and he is released, but it is not yet known if this action has caused the ban to be dropped. Damage remains on the team, essentially in Atom Smasher's place (Jakeem Thunder's Thunderbolt has even called him [...] "Atom Smasher Two" [...] jokingly).|$|E
5000|$|Each {{character}} has something specific about {{the look of}} their mask that makes them recognizable {{even if it is}} a different mask in another show.A characters identification is found in their mask. There four or five classes that the masks can be grouped into: the old men such as Pantalone and il Dottore; the young and adventurous man, il Capitano; the servant sometimes named Zanni; and another old man though more crooked and crippled Pulcinella. The servant characters such as Zanni typically will have a long nose, sometimes with more curve for Pantalone, and the servants whose names that end in [...] "ino" [...] such as Truffaldino or Arlecchino are more often small and round. To follow traditional masks the servant characters such as Zanni should have big noses and smaller eyes, this creates a more animal look making them seem more primitive, as the servant is lower than the master. The zanni mask {{was one of the first}} and was a <b>full</b> <b>mask,</b> covering the full face and sometimes head, until the bottom of the mouth was removed. Capitano's mask has a strong brow, in a frown, wide eyes would only make his farrowed brow less prominent so the smaller eyes are better for him as well. Some characters also have hair, beards, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Brighella is one character mentioned to have a beard in some early mentions of masked characters. He is often known to have a mustache now that is swirled up to give him the mischievous feeling. apitano is often described as having a long nose as well as Zanni, though typically larger. He also has a mustache sometimes that is a stiff and strong mustache under such a large nose, it almost looks like spikes poking out. Dottore also sometimes has hair, in the form of a small mustache, or eyebrows, and no upper lip. His mask covers the actors forehead and nose exposing their cheeks. Leaving the cheeks exposed so that the actor may use blush to create the look that he enjoys his spirits. Pantalone is known for his red and black costume but also his beard and easily recognizable mask. His long pointed beard looks almost like an extension of his equally long nose, he sometimes also has a mustache and some bushy eyebrows to give him a very distinct look. Dottore and Pantalone though both old men, have very different looks.|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} a novel {{procedure}} developed for the fabrication of reflection masks for extreme ultraviolet lithography. The procedure involves the deposition and patterning of an absorber bilayer (40 nm W and 25 nm C) on Mo/Si multilayer blanks. The C layer is used to protect the underlying Mo/Si multilayer structure during processing and repair. The pattern is written with an e-beam pattern generator into EPR resist and is transferred into the absorber bilayer with three consecutive rf etching processes. We have investigated {{the effect of the}} <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> making procedure on the multilayer reflectivity using 13 nm radiation. The procedure causes some oxidation of the top Si layer of the multilayer, an effect which is confirmed by XPS measurements. However, the method does not affect the multilayer reflectivity to within narrow tolerances. The profiles of patterns in the absorber layer are inspected with a SEM, showing patterns with a feature size of 250 nm and side wall slope angles of 80 degrees. An indication is found that cleaning of the substrate with ion etching prior to the fabrication of the mask blanks reduces the defect density. (C) 1997 American Vacuum Society...|$|E
40|$|Background: Activities in CDU III {{are very}} risk to any hazards {{potential}}; {{because of that}} hazards potential is much needed in controlling the hazards potential to decrease the accidents and occupational diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the controlling of hazards potential in CDU III PT. Pertamina (Persero) RU III Plaju in 2011. Method: This study was a qualitative study. The methods of data collection were using in-depth interview and observation. The total of informants in this study was 7 people. Results: Hazards potential in CDU III were noise, fire, risk of falling from height, falling objects, electric shock, risk of H 2 S and CO, NH 3, being hit and squeezed, chief stumbling, hand scraped, stumbling, slipped, and flash. The controlling of hazards potential in PT. Pertamina was good enough, even though there were still some constraints in the implementation. Conclusion: The controlling techniques applied in PT. Pertamina were elimination, substitution, isolation, maintenance and broken equipments repair. The administrative controlling applied in PT. Pertamina were SIKA, training, safety talk, working time arrangements, hazard warning signs, and CSMS. The personal protective equipments provided by PT. Pertamina were goggles, welding goggles, face shield, safety helmet, ear plug, ear muff, air-filtering mask, <b>full</b> <b>mask,</b> SCBA, cotton coverall, flame retardant coverall, chemical resistant gloves, heat resistant gloves, rubber gloves, safety shoes, safety boots, and body harness...|$|E
40|$|Visual {{disappearance}} illusions – such as motion-induced blindness (MIB) - {{are commonly}} used to study the neural underpinnings of visual perception. In such illusions a salient visual target becomes perceptually invisible. Previous studies are inconsistent regarding the role of primary visual cortex (V 1) in these illusions. Here we provide physiological and psychophysical evidence supporting a role for V 1 in generating MIB. Some {{of the most striking}} visual illusions fall into the category of multistable phenomena. These are situations in which an unchanging stimulus generates alternating perceptual states. Some examples are Necker cube reversals, binocular rivalry, ambiguous structure from motion and motion-induced blindness 1. Motion-induced blindness (MIB) is a phenomenon of visual disappearance in which a salient target becomes intermittently invisible when surrounded by a field of rotating distractors 1. Several explanations have been proposed to explain this illusion: slowdown of the attentional switch 1, interhemispheric competition 2, depth ordering, surface completion 3 and perceptual filling-in 4 among others. The aim of our first, perceptual, experiment was to test whether having a large surface-inducing mask is necessary for MIB to occur. To do this we compared the effects on the rate of target disappearance of a <b>full</b> <b>mask,</b> a mask that only just surrounded the target and flashing bars around the target 5 (Figure 1 A, 1 B and 1 C). There was no difference between the rates of disappearance or the time the target remained invisible under these conditions N at u...|$|E

30|$|Part of our {{interest}} in hyper-realistic masks stems from their use in security settings. At first sight, {{it is difficult to}} credit that a person wearing a <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> could board a plane unchallenged. How are we to make sense of such incidents? Do they reflect inattention {{on the part of the}} observer, or perhaps an unwillingness to confront the mask wearer? Or could it be that, in these situations, hyper-realistic masks are indistinguishable from real faces? In our experiments, almost no one reported noticing the mask, despite attending to the mask and answering several questions about its appearance. This was true for photographic images presented onscreen. It was also true for live confederates presented outdoors. The numbers are sobering. Of the 280 participants who viewed hyper-realistic masks in these studies (60 in Experiment 1; 60 in Experiment 2; 160 in Experiment 3), only two spontaneously reported the mask and only three more reported the mask following further prompting. Interestingly, all five of these participants viewed the mask live (Experiment 3) and at the closer viewing distance of 5  m. These are low detection rates. Evidently, the information available even in near-distance, live viewing (visual detail, 3 D form, motion) did not allow viewers to distinguish hyper-realistic masks from real faces with any generality. Nevertheless, the clustering of these few participants by viewing condition suggests that the available information may have some diagnostic value, above and beyond that which is available at longer viewing distances or in photographic presentations.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a complete methodology for process window optimization in proximity mask aligner lithography. The commercially available lithography simulation software LAB from GenISys GmbH {{was used for}} simulation of light propagation and 3 D resist development. The methodology was tested for the practical example of lines and spaces, 5 micron half-pitch, printed in a 1 micron thick layer of AZ® 1512 HS 1 positive photoresist on a silicon wafer. A SUSS MicroTec MA 8 mask aligner, equipped with MO Exposure Optics® was used in simulation and experiment. MO Exposure Optics® is the latest generation of illumination systems for mask aligners. MO Exposure Optics® provides telecentric illumination and excellent light uniformity over the <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> field. MO Exposure Optics® allows the lithography engineer to freely shape the angular spectrum of the illumination light (customized illumination), which is a mandatory requirement for process window optimization. Three different illuminat ion settings have been tested for 0 to 100 micron proximity gap. The results obtained prove, that the introduced process window methodology is {{a major step forward}} to obtain more robust processes in mask aligner lithography. The most remarkable outcome of the presented study is that a smaller exposure gap does not automatically lead to better print results in proximity lithography - what the "good instinct" of a lithographer would expect. With more than 5 ' 000 mask aligners installed in research and industry worldwide, the proposed process window methodology might have significant impact on yield improvement and cost saving in industry...|$|E
40|$|Respirators {{are used}} to {{minimize}} the exposure to air contaminants. A good fit {{is essential for the}} effective functioning of a respirator. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) requires an annual respirator fit testing. Respirator fit can be assessed either qualitatively or quantitatively. Two studies were conducted to assess the fit testing program with specific objectives to: (1) assess leak rates in full and half mask respirators; (2) assess the effectiveness of "feedback" 1 on the quality of fit; (3) evaluate the effect of daily beard growth on respirator leak rates. In the first study, {{it was found that the}} half mask respirator has a significantly lower leak rate than the full face respirator. A significant reduction in leak rate in both respirator types with "feedback" was also observed. The finding that half mask respirators have lower leak rates directly contradicts American National Standard Institute's (ANSI) guidelines of higher Assigned Protection Factor (APF) for <b>full</b> <b>mask</b> respirator. Further studies are necessary to determine these findings and to amend respirator recommendations in the future. As expected in the second study, beard growth was associated with respirator leak rate. The effect of daily growth on leak rate over a period of twelve days could be defined by a second order regression equation. An attempt was made to describe some characteristics of beard that affect the leak rate. After 12 days of beard growth, it was found that the aspect ratio (length/diameter) of hair was inversely correlated with leak rate (r = 0. 64). 1 Feedback: A numerical value measuring the minimum leak rate that can be gotten from a respirator fitting with a normal donning...|$|E
