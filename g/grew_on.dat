5|$|In 2015, {{researchers}} at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston found that plants {{can be a}} vector for prions. When researchers fed hamsters grass that <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> ground where a deer that died with chronic wasting disease (CWD) was buried, the hamsters became ill with CWD, suggesting that prions can bind to plants, which then take them up into the leaf and stem structure, {{where they can be}} eaten by herbivores, thus completing the cycle. It is thus possible that there is a progressively accumulating number of prions in the environment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} survey of 1998, only nine plants were {{identified}} in one single Radyr garden, where it traditionally <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> grassy banks and lawns, often in shade. It was no longer found at the original locality of Radyr Quarry where examples were last seen in 1985. At Bridgend, six possible plants of the Radyr genus were found on an old garden wall, but confirmation of identification is still awaited.|$|E

5|$|Ruiz {{also noted}} that these {{subspecies}} differed in their preference of soil substrate. He first noted this while attempting to find the population of plants from which Humboldt and Bonpland had collected their type specimens in 1803. Although Ruiz {{was able to find}} many populations of the species growing in the areas that Humboldt and Bonpland had visited in the vicinity if Mina de Moran, only one population, the only one growing on limestone, matched H.B.K.'s description and their type and isotype specimens now housed in the herbarium of the French national museum of natural history. The other populations in the area <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> substrate of igneous origin and more closely matched Hooker's 1846 description of P. orchidioides. These latter plants then became the new variety, P. moranensis ssp. neovolcanica.|$|E
5|$|Telopea 'Wirrimbirra White' {{is a white}} {{form from}} Kangaloon near Robertson. Aboriginal legends of white waratahs existed, and several had been encountered, but none had been {{previously}} preserved in horticulture. Joseph Maiden had previously found a white waratah near Kurrajong, and others had been sighted near Narara on the Central Coast in 1919, and Colo Vale in the 1950s. Horticulturalist Frank Stone reported one in his garden, possibly propagated from the latter plant. 'Wirrimbirra White' was brought into cultivation in 1972 by cuttings from the original plant, which <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> water catchment property. It has pale greenish buds which open to a cream-white inflorescence. It is less vigorous than the parent species and vulnerable to borers. It is also highly vulnerable to the Macadamia twig girdler.|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{influence}} was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth {{is a single}} living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book Gaia: A new look at life on Earth. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> {{the surface of the}} Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E

50|$|Skeletocutis {{causes a}} white rot in a {{diverse array of}} woody substrates. Although the {{majority}} of species are found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> the dead wood of various conifer and hardwood genera, some are known to <b>grow</b> <b>on</b> the dead fruit bodies of other polypores. For example, S. brevispora feeds on Phellinus ferrugineofuscus, while S. chrysella eats Phellinus abietis. The tropical Chinese species S. bambusicola <b>grows</b> <b>on</b> dead bamboo. S. percandida has been reported <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> exotic bamboos cultivated in France. In the Daxing'anling forest areas of northeastern China, S. ochroalba has been found <b>growing</b> <b>on</b> charred wood after forest fires, and may be a pioneer species for this substrate.|$|R
5|$|A {{study of}} coastal heaths on Pleistocene sand dunes around the Myall Lakes found B.aemula <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> ridges (dry heath) and B. oblongifolia on slopes (wet heath), {{and the two}} species did not overlap. Manipulation of {{seedlings}} in the same study area showed that B. aemula grows longer roots seeking water and that seedlings do grow in wet heath, but it is as yet unclear why the species does not grow in wet heath as well as dry heath. Unlike similar situations with banksia species in Western Australia, the two species {{did not appear to}} impact negatively on each other. A field study on seedling recruitment conducted at Broadwater National Park and Dirrawong Reserve on the New South Wales North Coast showed that generally Banksia aemula produced seedlings in low numbers but the attrition rate was low, and that seedlings had a greater survival rate on dry rather than wet heaths. Field work including the experimental planting out of seedlings at Crowdy Bay National Park showed that Banksia aemula seedling roots reach the water table within six months of germination, and that they can germinate in {{the presence or absence of}} recent bushfire. The reasons for bradyspory (that is fewer seeds with greater percentage of survival) is unclear, but may be a defence against seed-eating animals. Similarly in field work on North Stradbroke Island, B.aemula was noted to shed its winged seeds over time between (as well as after) fire, and germinate and grow readily with little predation by herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Jason Voorhees {{went from}} {{deceased}} child to full-grown man for Friday the 13th Part 2, and Warrington Gillette {{was hired to}} play the role. Gillette auditioned {{for the role of}} Paul; that role eventually went to John Furey. Under the belief that he had attended the Hollywood Stuntman's School, Gillette was offered the role of Jason Voorhees. Initially Gillette was unsure about the character, but the idea of starring in his first film <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> Gillette, and he also thought the role was amusing. It became apparent Gillette could not perform the necessary stunts, so the stunt coordinator Cliff Cudney brought in Steve Daskawisz. Daskawisz filmed all of the scenes except the opening sequence and the unmasking shot at the end; Gillette returned for the unmasking scenes. Gillette received credit for playing Jason, while Daskawisz was given credit as the stunt double. When Part 3 was released the following year, Daskawisz was credited as Jason for the reused footage from the climax of the film. Initially, Daskawisz was asked to return to the role for Part 3, but it would have required him to pay for his own transportation and housing during filming. Having secured a part on Guiding Light, Daskawisz declined.|$|E
5|$|With {{the bulk}} of the French Navy {{confined}} to port, the British were able to strike directly at French colonies, although their reach was limited by the significant resources required in blockading the French coast and so the size and quality of operations varied widely. In 1804, Haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by the Royal Navy, and in 1806 British forces secured most of the northern coast of South America from its Dutch owners. In 1807 the Danish West Indies were invaded and in 1808 Spain changed sides and allied with Britain, while Cayenne fell to an improvised force under Captain James Lucas Yeo in January 1809. The damage done to the Martinique economy during this period was severe, as British frigates raided coastal towns and shipping, and merchant vessels were prevented from trading Martinique's produce with France or allied islands. Disaffection <b>grew</b> <b>on</b> the island, especially among the recently emancipated black majority, and during the summer of 1808 the island's governor, Vice-amiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, sent urgent messages back to France requesting supplies and reinforcements. Some of these messages were intercepted by British ships and the low morale on Martinique was {{brought to the attention of}} the Admiralty, who ordered their commander on the West Indian Station, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to raise an expeditionary force from the ships and garrisons available to him and invade the island.|$|E
