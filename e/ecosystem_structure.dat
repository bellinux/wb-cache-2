5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} {{over the past decade}} or so shows that they teem with a wide variety of microbial life. However, <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{failure to}} reevaluate the current {{paradigm}} {{and recognize that}} both bottom-up and top-down forces affect many features of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they even begin.|$|E

To maintain this high productivity, great quantities of synthetic fertilizers are required (Avis et al. 2008; Godfray et al. 2010), which can damage <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structures</b> and functions, including the soil microbial community which {{plays an important role}} in agriculture sustainability (Ahemad and Khan 2010; Avis et al. 2008; Srinivas et al. 2008).|$|R
40|$|In the {{framework}} of the SIGMA plan, Flemish authorities (Waterways and Maritime Affairs Administration, division Sea Scheldt) plan a large controlled inundation area (CIA) in polders (Kruibeke-Bazel-Rupelmonde, 578 ha) along the freshwater - oligohaline border of the Scheldt estuary. Beside fulfilling an important role in enhancing safety against flooding, a CIA could contribute to the restoration of degraded ecosystem functions and habitats by implementing specific management options. However, as the outcome of some management types on <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structures</b> and functions are still uncertain, preliminary projects on a smaller scale must yield adequate information to allow, if necessary, appropriate adaptations. In the pilot project ‘Lippensbroek’, a management scenario for {{the northern part of the}} future Kruibeke-Bazel-Rupelmonde CIA will therefore be tested beforehand on an innerdike area of 10 ha. Carefully designed sluices will allow the exchange of limited amounts of Scheldt water, causing a semidiurnal submersion of ca. 0. 5 m. Additionnaly, submersions with larger water quantities will occur on a less regular base during storm floods. We discuss the present and future hydrologic regime of the Lippensbroek polder, together with the necessity of a multidisciplinary program to monitor the restoration of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structures</b> (fresh water tidal marshes, mudflats, creeks, etc.) and functions (nutrient cycling, storage capacity enhancement, sediment retention, biodiversity and habitat support, etc.) ...|$|R
2500|$|A {{greater number}} or variety of species or {{biological}} diversity of an ecosystem {{may contribute to}} greater resilience of an ecosystem, because there are more species present at a location to respond to change and thus [...] "absorb" [...] or reduce its effects.

25|$|Interrelationships among {{nutrient}} cycling, regeneration, {{and subsequent}} forest development on floodplains in interior Alaska were addressed by Van Cleve et al. (1980), who {{pointed out that}} the various stages in primary succession reflect physical, chemical, and biological controls of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> and function. Thus, each successional stage has a species combination in harmony with site quality. Short-circuiting succession by planting a late successional species such as white spruce on an early successional surface may result in markedly reduced growth rates because of nitrogen insufficiency. Without application of substantial amounts of fertilizer, use would have to be made of early successional alder and its site-ameliorating additions of nitrogen.|$|E
25|$|The {{number and}} {{diversity}} of invasive exotic species in riparian ecosystems is increasing worldwide. Riparian zones may be particularly vulnerable to invasion due to frequent habitat disturbance (both natural and anthropogenic) and the efficiency of rivers and streams in dispersing propagules. Invasive species can greatly impact the <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> and function of riparian zones. For example, the higher biomass of dense stands of the invasive Acacia mearnsii and Eucalyptus species causes greater water consumption and thus lower water levels in streams in South Africa. Invasive plants can also cause changes {{in the amount of}} sediment that is trapped by vegetation, altering channel morphology, and can increase the flammability of the vegetation, increasing fire frequency. Exotic animals can also impact riparian zones. For example, feral burros along the Santa Maria river strip bark and cambium off native cottonwoods, causing tree mortality.|$|E
25|$|In salt marshes, early ecologists like Eugene Odum and John Teal {{sparked the}} current {{bottom-up}} paradigm in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like temperature, salinity, and nutrients in regulating plant primary productivity and <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> (Teal 1962, Odum 1971). Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed {{and appeared to}} be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as detritus (Teal 1962). A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962). This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007), and has thus “become entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).|$|E

40|$|The purpose ofthis {{document}} {{is to describe}} research, monitoring, and evaluation (RME) for the Federal Columbia River Estuary Program. The intent of this RME effort is to provide data and information to evaluate progress toward meeting program goals and objectives and support decision-making in the Estuary Program. The goal of the Estuary Program is to understand, conserve, and restore the estuary ecosystem to improve the performance of listed salmonid populations. The Estuary Program has five general objectives, designed to fulfill the program goal, as follows. 1. Understand the primary stressors affecting ecosystem controlling factors, such as ocean conditions and invasive species. 2. Conserve and restore factors controlling <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structures</b> and processes, such as hydrodynamics and water quality. 3. Increase {{the quantity and quality}} of <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structures,</b> i. e., habitats, juvenile salmonids use during migration through the estuary. 4. Maintain the food web to benefit salmonid performance. 5. Improve salmonid performance in terms of life history diversity, foraging success, growth, and survival. The goal of estuary RME is to provide pertinent and timely research and monitoring information to planners, implementers, and managers of the Estuary Program. In conclusion, the estuary RME effort is designed to meet the research and monitoring needs of the estuary Program using an adaptive management process. Estuary RME's success and usefulness will depend on the actual conduct of adaptive management, as embodied in the objectives, implrementation, data, reporting, and synthesis, evaluation, and decision-making described herein...|$|R
30|$|Nutrients are {{essential}} for maintaining an <b>ecosystem’s</b> <b>structure</b> and function. Knowledge {{of the effects of}} excessive nutrients on ecosystems is important for environmental management. In streams, increased nutrient concentrations have altered biological structures and functions such as species richness, composition, abundance, and decomposition rate (Dodson et al. 2000; Freeman et al. 2009; Smith et al. 1999; Gulis and Suberkropp 2004; Rosemond et al. 1993). Excessive nutrients can also reduce water quality causing problems for drinking water and can deplete dissolved oxygen, leading to fish kills (USEPA 1996). For example, 40 % of rivers in the USA have been impaired primarily as a result of excessive nutrients (USEPA 1996).|$|R
25|$|Classic {{studies in}} kelp forest ecology have largely focused on trophic {{interactions}} (the relationships between organisms and their food webs), particularly the understanding and top-down trophic processes. Bottom-up processes are generally {{driven by the}} abiotic conditions required for primary producers to grow, such as availability of light and nutrients, and the subsequent transfer of energy to consumers at higher trophic levels. For example, the occurrence of kelp is frequently correlated with oceanographic upwelling zones, which provide unusually high concentrations of nutrients to the local environment. This allows kelp to grow and subsequently support herbivores, which in turn support consumers at higher trophic levels. By contrast, in top-down processes, predators limit the biomass of species at lower trophic levels through consumption. In the absence of predation, these lower-level species flourish because resources that support their energetic requirements are not limiting. In a well-studied example from Alaskan kelp forests, sea otters (Enhydra lutris) control populations of herbivorous sea urchins through predation. When sea otters are removed from the ecosystem (for example, by human exploitation), urchin populations are released from predatory control and grow dramatically. This leads to increased herbivore pressure on local kelp stands. Deterioration of the kelp itself results {{in the loss of}} physical <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> and subsequently, the loss of other species associated with this habitat. In Alaskan kelp forest ecosystems, sea otters are the keystone species that mediates this trophic cascade. In Southern California, kelp forests persist without sea otters and the control of herbivorous urchins is instead mediated by a suite of predators including lobsters and large fishes, such as the California sheephead. The effect of removing one predatory species in this system differs from Alaska because redundancy exists in the trophic levels and other predatory species can continue to regulate urchins. However, the removal of multiple predators can effectively release urchins from predator pressure and allow the system to follow trajectories towards kelp forest degradation. Similar examples exist in Nova Scotia, South Africa, Australia and Chile. The relative importance of top-down versus bottom-up control in kelp forest ecosystems and the strengths of trophic interactions continue to be the subject of considerable scientific investigation.|$|E
500|$|While {{the flora}} of Grand Teton National Park is {{generally}} healthy, the whitebark pine, {{and to a}} lesser degree the lodgepole pine, are considered at risk. In the case of the whitebark pine, an invasive species of fungus known as white pine blister rust weakens the tree, making it more susceptible to destruction from endemic mountain pine beetles. Whitebark pines generally thrive at elevations above [...] and produce large seeds that are high in fat content and an important food source for various species such as the [...] grizzly bear, red squirrel and Clark's nutcracker. The species {{is considered to be a}} keystone and a foundation species; keystone in that its [...] "ecological role (is) disproportionately large relative to its abundance" [...] and foundation in that it has a paramount role that [...] "defines <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure,</b> function, and process". Whitebark pine has generally had a lower incidence of blister rust infection throughout the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem than in other regions such as Glacier National Park and the Cascade Range. The incidence of blister rust on whitebark pines in Yellowstone National Park is slightly lower than in Grand Teton. Though blister rust is not in itself the cause of increased mortality, its weakening effect on trees allows native pine beetles to more easily infest the trees, increasing mortality. While general practice in National Parks is to allow nature to take its course, the alarming trend of increased disease and mortality of the vital whitebark pine trees has sparked a collaborative effort amongst various government entities to intervene to protect the species.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} criticisms of the mesopredator release {{hypothesis}} is that it argues {{in favor of the}} top-down control concept and excludes the possible impacts that bottom-up control could have on higher trophic levels. [...] This means that it supports the argument that top predators control the structure and population dynamics of an ecosystem, but it {{does not take into account}} that prey species and primary producers also have an effect on the ecosystem’s structure. [...] Furthermore, populations of smaller predators do not always increase after the removal of top predators; in fact, they sometimes decline sharply. Another problem is that the hypothesis is offered as an explanation after large predators have already become rare or extinct in an ecosystem. [...] Consequently, there is no data on the past <b>ecosystem</b> <b>structure</b> and the hypothesis cannot be tested. [...] As a result, information on the past conditions has been inferred from studies of the present conditions. However, contemporary examples of mesopredator release exist, such as the culling of cats on Macquarie Island.|$|E
