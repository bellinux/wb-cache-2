Sirenians typically inhabit warm, shallow, coastal waters, or rivers. They are mainly herbivorous, {{but have been}} known to consume animals such as birds and jellyfish. Males typically mate with more than one female (polygyny), and may participate in lek mating. Sirenians are K-selectors, and display parental care.|$|E
5|$|Where Americans had a {{historic}} {{disdain for the}} refineries of French cooking, that opinion, {{at least in a}} small part, began to change with the American alliance with the French. In the first American publication of Hannah Glasse's Art of Cookery Made Easy, insults aimed at French dishes disappeared. A number of Bostonians even attempted to cook French cuisine for their French allies, sometimes with comedic results when entire frogs were put into soups rather than <b>just</b> <b>their</b> legs. Nonetheless, the alliance supported a friendship with France that later resulted in a large migration of French cooks and chefs to America during the French Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Wigner was {{disappointed}} that DuPont was given responsibility for the detailed design of the reactors, not <b>just</b> <b>their</b> construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it {{by the head of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem. Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year. During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site. Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.|$|E

25|$|A {{new feature}} of Incapacity Benefit was that {{officials}} {{could ask for}} claimants' disabilities to be confirmed using a bespoke testing procedure – the All Work Test – carried out by doctors working for the government.

Nevertheless, the caseload continued to rise.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a closely}} related {{notion of the}} {{connected}} sum of two knots. In fact, if one regards a knot merely as a one-manifold, then the connected sum of two knots is <b>just</b> <b>their</b> connected sum as a one-dimensional manifold. However, the essential property of a knot is not its manifold structure (under which every knot is equivalent to a circle) but rather its embedding into the ambient space. So the connected sum of knots has a more elaborate definition that produces a well-defined embedding, as follows.|$|E
